He needed to hire somebody cause his boss said that he needed another clown to intertain the kids on Saturday for the big Circus play. If he did hire somebody, all of the other clowns would have to teach the clown to do tricks and everything. That might take a while, so Freddy thought he needed to hire one almost right away.            So, Freddy took a walk down to the park. He took a glance at the park from around the corner. He didn't see anybody from around the corner, but he needed glasses because he had bad eyesight. So he walked farther, until he finally got there. Freddy saw two 2 year-olds, two 5 year-olds, three 13 year-olds, and 1, just one, 18 year-old. The perfect age to become a circus clown. Freddy thought. Even more perfect that there's only one. Fred let out some humour. (if you couldn't notice, sometimes Fred had a bad sense of humour. Fred is short for Freddy so you don't have to say FREDDY. As the other circus clowns said.)   'Hi, what's your name?' Fred went up to the girl that was 18.   'Hi, my name is Meg, do I know you?' The girl replied.   'No, I don't think so, but I was going to ask you something.'   'What was that sir?' Meg said.   'I was wondering if you would like to come work for me at the circus?'   'I would have to know what time and what days it would be on.'   'It would be the whole week. Some days you would be working for long hours but other days short hours.' Fred inquired.   'Yeah, I would be okay with that,' Meg said happily.   'Awesome! The one thing I would have to know from you is what your talent is, if that's okay with you.' Fred announced.   ' Oh, sure. My talent is that I LOVE gymnastics, and I go to practice in Iowa Falls. Crowds of people come to watch me do my fancy trick called THE SPIN. One time Taylor Swift came and watched me. It was the best day of my life!' Meg was excited talking about that.   'Sounds fun, do you want to go home and talk to your parents about it real fast?' Fred said.   'Yeah, be right back.' Meg replied.   'Okay,' Fred responded.            As soon as she got back, she said her parents said yes. Freddy was happy. Then they got to right back to the circus and practice.            Meg was so good at gymnastics that she mastered the new moves she had to learn in no time. Circus clowns were so proud of her and she did great at the big play!

I started doing gymnastics when I was five years old so I am rather good at being a trapize artist. My trick to not being scared even though i'm so high up is to just look at my mom on the other side. My whole family is in the circus but we do not all do the same thing. My brother, Tio, is an assintant clown. He gets to ride unicycles. My dad is the lion tamer. At dinner time we dont get to get to much because we are performing in a little while. We do ten shows a week so when the show is over I am very tired. The show goes to ten thirty p.m. and I go to bed at 12:00 a.m. In a couple of days we head to a different town. You may think it's exciting going from place to place but sometimes I wish that we could just settle in one spot that I can call home.'             As you can see it is not an easy life.

If they fall then everyone will laugh at the person who is doing that trick so that is just one thing and there are more tricks that are harder than that so it is hard. When people perform it is hard because they have to practice lots of times so they don't fail that is why when they do tricks they practice lots of times so they don't fail so practice makes perfect.                     My first reason that you should practice is that when you are on a balance beam you don't fall and get caught in the net when they fall off they get laughed at when they fall. Also when you fall off you might get injured when you mess up or maybe the net is to long and you still hit the ground a little hard. Some people that are on the balance beam they are sometimes blind and have a large stick that is about 10 or 15 or 20 feet long. They have to carry that all the way across the rope blinded. One person did that and fell on the rope which made him sit down on the rope and again he fell off this time. That is why you need to practice all the time so you can master it.                      My second reason is that when elephants go on bouncy balls they have to train them to stand on the balls and they train them to hold each other so they don't fall. They have to keep them skinny so that when they get on the balls the ball doesn't pop right when they are in the middle of doing their trick. The balls that they use to put the elephant on are strong so that when they get on the ball won't pop. The elephants hold on to each other because the elephants can't hold their balance they don't fall on their back or slip to their side. That is another reason why you should practice all the time.                      My Third reason why you should practice is that when clowns fold and twist balloons they have to practice folding and twisting the balloon. When people become clowns they practice before they go out and give kids balloon animals he has to know how to make them and how to do it without popping the balloon in the kids face. When clowns do tricks like the flower that shoots out water when you try to smell it they have to know where he should shoot it. If he shoots it anywhere then he might get the person in the eye. That is another reason why you should practice before you so your act on stage.                                                                                                                                                            Those are reasons why when you go to a circus and sign up for it then you have to practice all the time so that you won't fall or get hurt. Practicing make perfect because if you try to be a juggler them you have to learn how to juggle about five which should be a maximum amount of rings to juggle. So if you mess up them some people will laugh about how you failed or boo at you. That is why you should practice all the time when you try to join a circus.

I live with a circus group called Magic Wonders Circus. I live all over the world, because we never stay in one place for long. I've been to all the continents, including Australia, my favorite one. I travel every week for 7 months and 14 days. I work from 5:00am to 11:00pm.                Here is a normal day at Magic Wonders Circus:            5:00am I wake, get dressed in uniform and head to pie car for breakfast. The crew at this time is setting up tents, lights, and music for todays show. I have time before school, so I normally go to see Giggles and Bunny-Hunn the clown. They let me play around with their bowling pins and trinkets. We usually, to get excersize, play tag.             8:00am I go to school with the other boys and girls. we learn everything that normal kids learn and how to do some circus acts. Many of us speak English, but all of us now every language there is. It helps us with our travels.              2:30pm School is over. Now we get a 30 minute break. I play with my friends, Ayessha and Herbert. We usually play games with the clowns for awhile. Then we just play our own.              3:00pm practicing and dishes. My daily activities. I am an acrobat. I practice on a trampoline and do tricks on horses. One time my mother fell off one and onto a trampoline. She was not hurt.             6:30pm It is now dinnertime. We don't eat alot before a show. We do 14 shows each week. 2 on each day.              10:30pm The show is over. I am sooooo pooped out! Usually we dont do very long shows. oh well.              11:00pm Good night.

Worried that someone would see my face, (which was covered with bright makeup) looking at them, I quickly ducked back be hind the curtain. As soon as the audience gave one last cheer, I knew that I would have to go on. 'don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be sacared,' I told myself.                    I am Kathrine, and I spend my life at the circus. I work as a acrobat. Every week we have to preform. Every day, we have to practice. I had known I wanted to be in the circus when I was only about four years old. My family and I were at our very first circus together. A clown with a bright smile came up to me and handed me a polka dot flower. I smiled big too and laughed so hard. Then I saw the acrobats. I begged my parents to take gymnastics class. When they had heard enough of my whining and complaints, they finally let me.                    That is how I became an acrobat. I worked very hard, in fact a little too hard. I guess my legs were too straight, or my toes were too pointed, or I was too shakey. It was tough, but when I FINALLY got everything right, my toes were perfectly pointed, my legs were perfectly straight, and I was perfectly still, I was so proud. I congragulated myself and was hoping that that would be my start as a professinal acrobat.                     That was my start as a professional acrobat. Because of that now I am on posters and huge billboards with me spinning on thin ropes wearing sparkly and colorful costumes. And like I told you before, my face had bright makeup all over. 'Thats me!' I think every time we go past one. I fell in love with all this circus buisiness. Everytime it is my turn to be on stage, though I am nervous, I try my very best, and it is absolutly worth it. When I am backstage I always say to my self, 'What am I doing?!' But after, I always say, 'That's so fun, I want to go again!'                     As I carefully and gently walked on to stage, with the bright lights shining on my face, I wasn't scared anymore because I because I believed that I could really do it as long as I try my very best. Trying my very best is hard, but once again it is absolutly woth it. Being in the circus can be tough, but it is also very enjoyable.

The most exciting part of my day is see all my friends and all the people at the circus watching me preform.       When it is time to preform I sometimes get scared by look out and seeing all the people just waiting for me to preform.  The my fellow people in the circus give wisdom and im ready to preform.  I do the acrobatic preforming section of the circus.       When im done everyone cheers me on and the little tiger cub comes to me and gives me a huge hug.  By then it is about midnight and I take a shower and take all of the circus make-up.  Then im ready for my next day at the circus.

For many people life being in a circus act is very fun. I say this because I like to watch acrobats. One acrobat is Philippa Hayball. Philippa Hayball has loved being an acrobat in the circus because she said she loved to go to many different places and see new faces, she loved to have fun while the whole audience watches her, and she likes to travel with the 100 people that are also in the circus act.                  One reason Philippa like the circus is because she gets to travel and see new faces. Philippa has traveled all over the planet including Japan, Australia and all over North America. Every where she goes she sees new faces.             Another reason Philippa likes the circus is because she has fun while the audience watches her perform. She loves entertaining all of the audience, and doing her job.                One last reason Philippa like to be an acrobat is because she loves to travel with the 100 people she calls her circus family, they are also preforming at night.             This is my way of showing you the life of an circus acrobat and I hope one day you get to see what i am talking about, or maybe you just might be one!

When you first wake up you have to eat breakfast quick because you have to get ready for the morning show.  After you eat breakfast you have to practice for your act.  My act is training lions to jump through hoops.  Hopefully it's not your turn to pick up after the elephant.  After you practice it's time for lunch. all you get is some cheese burgers and fries.                                               Show Time        Before the show the ring master will let everyone know the acts that will be happening.  Once your on your on.  first everyone goes on at once and it's a big fiasco.  You have to make sure you don't bump into anyone or they'll be very mad.  You wait anxiously until it's your turn.  First the trapeze artist are up, then the acrobats, and finally it's your turn. it's hard being a lion tamer, especially when people are watching.                                                  After The Show            After the circus is over you have to clean up.  During the clean up time you literally have to clean up everything.  After you're done cleaning up it's dinner time. you get a big dinner.                                               The Fun Times                   When you're not working you're having fun. You may think the clowns are the most fun you're wrong.  The most fun is the trainers with their animals.  It's fun riding on the unicycles when the clowns aren't around throwing water balloons at you.  The most fun though is climbing the trapeze wire.  I also like swinging on the trapeze swing.                                               Conclusion                As you can see the circus is not all fun and games.  As you have learned  it's mostly work not play I hope you know this before you join the circus.  Even though I have fun some times  it's not allways fun.

The very next morning Speckle woke up from a shower going on from a human, he remembered that he was going to sneak off in the apartment, and insisted for his sister Sam to go with him and Sam really wanted to go to and so they were off. Once Speckle took his first step out he spun around in joy and called his sister to come join him. then Speckle thought the kids room was full of toys to play with 'Sam!' he shouted 'lets look in the kids room'. Back at the old mouse house Speckle's mom woke up and she cooked because she thought they were there. soon she was searching for the kids but they weren't there.              Her panicking woke uncle and aunt mouse and tried to calm her down. Sam and Speckle had a wide grin on their faces because of all the toys. they started playing and had a joyful time.Then they heard stomping and they didn't know what to do so they ran and ran back home but then there was a big push of air and a broom was coming at them. it suddenly hit Sam. Speckle was panicking 'SAM!!' he rushed were the human couldn't see them and saw that Sam had a broken leg. he grabbed her and put her on his back and carried her back safely to the mouse hole.  the human was turning all around in confusion, she didn't know were they went. Speckle was relieved that they were okay, but mom was angry she told them not to go outside and they disobeyed. she was bursting with fury and put them both in time-out. Also Sam was hiding her leg so her mom wouldn't get more furious.                         Early in the morning Sam had woken Uncle mouse up because her leg was full of pain and was hurting real worse then yesterday.Uncle mouse got a string of material that was made out of cotton and got a cream to sooth her pain. he put the cream om and wrapped her leg very slowly and he called Speckle to get two sticks to hold her up when she stands. after that the mouse family had lived happily together for the rest of their lives.

I am a leopard tamer, and a trapeze artist.                  At the beginning of the circus I bring out Cutie the Leopard. She jumps through rings of fire and does lots of tricks. One of her tricks is dancing we give her a treat if she does it right.If she ever gets mad or fierce we have to take her back to her cage out back and bring in Sharp, Sharp is Cuties brother he behaves a lot better than Cutie. Cutie is just competitive she always has to be better than everyone else. Sharp just wants to have fun he loves doing tricks but he can't do the ring of fire because got burnt before on the leg and he is just to scared to do it. At the end of their act they will both get a treat. Their treat is kind of gross though because it is a raw bird that you have to lay out in their cage for them.                 After the elephants and dancers are done I get to go out and do my trapeze tricks. I have a partner named Lewie. When it is time for our act we have to climb this 153 foot tall ladder that goes to the top. When we get up there we have to wait for Jimmy the announcer to announce us. When I get up there I just think happy thoughts, because if you don't you might not make it. It happened to me on my first show I got up there and just froze. All I was thinking about was massing up or falling or missing a flip. Since I didn't think happy thoughts I messed up so that's why I think happy thought from now on. Jimmy just announced us first I jump off the podium and flip to the first bar when I get it swinging I do a triple flip to the second bar. Now it's time for Lewie to come in. He glides to the first bar and then I flip to the third bar and he goes to the second one. Then I flip back to the second bar where Lewie is we but I dive for the net under us but we lock legs before I touch the net. Then the bar starts to swing a lot and that's when I flip back to the first bar. And that's when we both let go and fall on the mat.                    After the show when everyone leaves I got to my trailer and go to bed.

Then they might be tired  On Saturdays you usually have at least two circuses because it is a weekend and the kids are out of school. And the parents are not a work so they can bring them to the circus. Then if they live near the circus were they are preforming they can just walk, bike or go on a shooter and they can just bring there friend if he or she is coming over.   Then they have a busy schedule because they only have like 4 or 5 trailers to sleep in. and it will be super crammed in side even in the pie car were they eat. ?Next they might not have a enough food for every in the circus (even the clowns).

Ring! 'ok students this is our last day before summer break and your report cards are in your daily envelope.' Says mrs. Goldilocks izzy's teacher. Izzy rushed home and looked at her daily envelope. Yes she got all A+'s but that didn't suprise her but what did suprise her was a bright blue paper that said ' Are you bored sitting at home at reading these papers? Are you 10 or older?' Well izzy was bored and she was 12. so she kept reading the paper, 'Then join a Circus sign up here first class free!' so izzy ran to her mom and asked, 'Mom can I join the circus?'                                                             5 minutes later              'Well honey you can join the circus if you promise you can keep your grades up and be careful' her mother said.

As the ringmaster, it is my job to make sure that people are doing what they are supposed to be doing.  I also have to help other performers make sure that can do their act.  The lion tamer probably has the hardest   job of any performer because the lion is very dangerous.      In my downtime, I like to help the other performers practice their acts as well as my own.  The juggler is one of the ones I don't help because he sometimes juggles flaming chainsaws!  The trapeze artist also is not someone Id like to help as she flips around and does twists and twirls.  I could seriously hurt myself !  As for my own act, well, that's what this story is about.      When I first joined the circus, I had no act.  The old ringmaster, my father, was about to retire and I never even thought about becoming ringmaster.  I decided to ' try out ' for a clown. Well that was a joke! (HAH HAH!!! Get it,  joke!) Anyway, the clown didn't work out as I  previously said. Next, I thought about being a tightrope walker. That also didn't work thanks to my little slip I had that left me in the hospital for 4 weeks.  After I got out of the hospital, my dad was retired and that meant a position as ringmaster was now open.  I knew it would be imposable for a rookie to get the position as ring master.      It actually wasn't me who got the position but my older brother! (Can you believe it after how hard I've worked! )  So, I got a little angry. Wait. I shouldn't a little angry. I was VERY ANGRY.  I was so angry that I quit the circus.       I know this story is about how I got my job but it didn't happen the first year. Months later, I got married to a beautiful woman. (a.k.a The Trapeze Artist).  After I explained what happened, she encouraged me to try again. So I did.  When I got back to the circus my brother wasn't there. I was happy yet confused at the same time.  The juggler told me he had been diagnosed with spinal stinosis ( did I mention he was a dwarf ?)  The whole circus went to visit him the next day at the hospital.  He was completely paralyzed from the waist down. It was all so sudden.  Moments later, a machine started to make a constant beep and doctors rushed is and asked us to leave. I knew what this meant.   We had go back to the circus and the I was automatically ringleader. Simple as that. But that's not the end of the story. That's just the beginning. A year later we went back to the hospital not because of my brother, but because of our new born child. We named him Dillon after my brother ( who had really died.)  Dillon became the youngest member of the circus. He could ride a unicycle at the age of 3 months. Amazing isn't it.  Sometimes he fell, sometimes I fell when tried to ride to unicycle which was not a great idea by the way.   Our lives felt complete.  We needed nothing else.  That's when the scary thing happened.  Dillon started to throw up constantly.  We were very worried. We took him to the doctors office to get him looked over. The doctor said he probably had a appendicitis and that we should take him over to get an x-ray. Indeed his appendix had ruptured. They had to operate immediately.  The operation was successful but Dillon couldn't ride his unicycle for many months.  We needed another act. Clowns, jugglers, lion tamers. What else did we need? Then I had it.  We need a strongman.   We bought plane tickets all the way to Africa to find some of the strongest people in the world.  Many came to preform but we knew we could only choose one.  One man could dead lift 600 pounds! There's one possibility right there.  Another could bench 800 pounds.  The choice was hard because they both could lift the some amount of weight. We went with the second guy.  He seemed really interested about being in the circus.  He almost exceeded his maximum limit before we had to stop him. We had no choice but to take him.    He filled out his passport to America and started to travel with us.  Great news was waiting for us when we arrived.  Dillon could almost ride his unicycle again.  We were so excited that we threw a party. Everyone came and brought Dillon something. He got a golden unicycle from the juggler.  At the time he was 2 years old and still better than me on a bike.  After the party we had our first show. The next week, the circus was packed with people Everyone had been practicing their acts for weeks and still felt nervous.  We started of with the lion tamer then my wife, them the juggler.  After that we had Dillon do his routine. the crowd went wild and everyone did good.  My act was not only as a ringleader, but as a father, a husband, and a brother.  This was my family. This was my place. This was my life.

I think joining the circus isn't just fun and hard, maybe it can change your life.            I think the circus is an interesting and weird place to work.

Being a gymnis can end up being an acrobat, so if I join gymnastics I would might end up being an acrobat.            If I do work at a circus, I know how hard it is to work at one. To work at one you would have to have a cerain talent. Your talents can lead you to a great job. Working at a circus takes a lot of practice. You'd have to practice your tricks a lot. Working at a circus is a little risky, but if you really want to work at a circus, you should go for it. Working at a circus could be risky because of all the tricks they do. Their tricks are sometimes dangerous.            There are also good things about working at a circus. You get to travel around the world. When you travel around the world you get to travel in a big trailer with your family. The best part about working at a circus is seeing the smile on kids faces when they watch you perform. Some people that work at the circus work there to inspire children.            The circus is really fun. You can play games and win prizes or you can watch the circus acts. If your feeling sad I suggest you go to the circus and turn that frown upside down. When you grow up, you should join the circus. It will be tons of fun, so what do you say, are you going to join?            Clearly, if you go for your dreams, anything can happen.

As soon as you are done with break, You do nonstop work at the circus until the show is over and then you go to bed. The next day you wake up, it is back to work again.        You don't have any time to see friends and family. Also, you don't get free time to play things like soccer or baseball.         There are some upsides, though. People think you are really cool and people want your autograph. You get to see different places in the world like Japan and Europe. You get to meet many people, too.        As you can see, the circus life is not as easy as it seems. Such as long hours hard performances and not being able to see your family.

This is by far my scariest circus ever. Although I was happy two because I knew I could do the tight rope preety well. Even if I fell there would someone there to cacth me. I was scared for my dad though. He had to do the tight rope and he was not aloud to fall of or else he would get kicked out of the circus. He would get kicked out because he had been praticing since my age and I am only 11.               When we got in and we started praticing people then started to come. Just a bit after an hour of practicing the place was full of people. 10,000 people. There were so many. I went second right after the person who does all the flips. It was then my turn. When i did it I heard a whole bunch of oohs and aahs. That is when I got all relazed. I finished it and I had done well!!!!!! It was then my dads turn. He went across the rope in ten seconds!

Next, you have to be confident and determind. if you are not confident in your self when you are doing your act something will go wrong. you also have to be determind and brave if you are not you would not want to do the act anymore and the show will not include you.

Juggling.Well thats not really scary but you have to juggle chainsaws that are on fire.Now thats scary.We also had to juggle balls which were ok and we had to juggle swords which was scary because they could cause a minor injury.Then we juggled torches which also could burn my hand but I finally did.

I stretch, yawn, get dressed into my overalls and head over to the pie car for breakfast.           Oh! What am I thinking? I need to introduce myself! Hi, my name is Ariana Lasnier. I'm not your average 12 year old. I have spent most of my last 5 years touring the world with my family in the circus. I know what you're probably thinking... I'm a freak that can bend into a pretzel on a tightrope. Well, I'm not. Being in the circus is so much different than that. I'm part of the acrobats section. Not to brag, but we do A-MA-ZING tricks while hanging from ropes and so on. Anyways...          You get the point. Now, back to the story. On my way to the pie cart, I realize something. It's abnormally quiet. That's odd...  At the pie car, I sit down at a table and wait. And wait. And wait. Where is everyone? After what seemed like ages, Michelle, our cook arrives.    'Finally...' I mumble, my stomach growling.   'I'm sorry dear, I was in the back helping your mother. She's coughing up a storm!' Michelle apologizes, clanking the pans on the stove.   'W-what do you mean? I mean, she'll be okay for the show tonight won't she?' I ask worried.   'Your guess is as good as mine!' She laughs.         I fake a nervous laugh to cover my anxiety. We can't go on without her! We need her to tame the lion! After a while my eggs and bacon are ready.   'Eat up or you'll be late for school!' Michelle commands.         Well of course I can't go to just one school due to the moving for 7 months each year. Instead us younger performers get home schooled. My mom teaches, of course she would if she wasn't sick.         I rush over to the schooling car. Class has just started.   'So today- *cough cough*- we are going to revise evaluating expres- *cough cough* expressions! Goodness sakes! I'm sorry for the cough!'   My mom exclaims.     'Gee mom, you're really sick! You could rest. We'll just do tomorrows test so you don't have to talk.' I suggest.   'Well, I guess...' She says unsure.         So we take our test then read a book. Finally.... Class is over and I head to the stalls for some chores. All I have to do is feed and groom the horses and clean the stalls. After that I have to practice my routine and then I'm done until the show. This would be easy but my mom can't help. Great. So I decide to do the parts I can, by myself. Like flips, twirls on the rope and so on.         When I finally finish I head over to my moms parlor. There she is coughing and coughing and coughing!    ' You really are sick aren't you...' I say in a hushed voice.   She groans. I'll take that as a yes.   'Who's gonna take your place then?' I question   'Well, *cough* I think maybe we could postpone the show.'    'No! We can't! We are already booked for at least a show per day!' I exclaim. What are we going to do? I thought. Then, it came to me!   'Mom! I could tame the lion!' I say. I regret what came out of my mouth right away, that thing could kill me!   My mom thinks, coughs, groans and finally says 'I need to rest.'         As I head towards the door I think. I guess I could at least try to tame the lion. I just need to suck it up and learn. I turn back to my mother one last time. 'Mom, I'm going to tame the lion.' Then, I leave.         At the lion cage I find Simba- the lion- sleeping in the corner.   'Simba... Simba...' I coo. He growls. Ok. Where is the food?  I scan the room and stop. Over in the opposite corner is raw fish. Yuck!   I quietly shuffle over to the corner. I slowly stick my hand in the bucket. Of course being myself, I fully extend my arm in front of my face and hold it by the tail like a pair of dirty socks. I throw it to the lion. Out of nowhere it pounces over to the fish and rips it apart. Ok I can do this...         After about 2 or 3 hours, I'm finally done with my 'training'. Fingers crossed I don't die tonight. Time to get ready for the show!          I scurry over to the makeup parlor. All they do is powder my face a put on some mascara, lipstick and eyeshadow. Now, my costume is not exactly the most comfortable outfit on earth. It's a short dress with hanging, itchy fabric at my waist. Then, of course, is my tights. Now I look circus ready.         As I jog over to the main tent, I pass my biggest horror of the night. The lion being pushed, in its cage of course, over to the tent. Can you say death sentence? My head is spinning. This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this, that lion will rip me apart! My knees feel weak. I feel dizzy. It's too much! Suddenly, everything goes black.         'Ariana...' The darkness calls.   'Ariana.' Closer, louder this time...   'Ariana!' Out of nowhere I'm snapped back into reality and being shaken by Joshua ( my acrobat partner). My eyes flutter open.   'Oh thank god your awake! We're on in 10 minutes!' He sighs of relief.   'W-what happened?' I mutter.   'I don't know. We found you passed out on the ground a few yards outside the entrance.' He explains.   'Is my mother okay? What about the lion?'    'She's still sick. But we have a substitute performer. Duh!' He laughs.   ' Sub-substitute!? I spent hours training with that lion!' I complain.   'Its fine... Anyways the audience came in and they-' he was cut of.   'It's show time!' My father exclaims in his announcer voice.         We take the ladder up to our ropes. Hanging there we wait for our signal. The lights go out.   'Ladies and gentleman... Welcome, to the Balabam Circus. Pleeeaaaassseeee, put your hands together for our first act of the night, the acrobats!' The announcers voice booms over the loud speakers.   The audience cheers.          I look down at the dirt floor far below us. I take a deep breath and let go of my rope. Swinging by the the rope attached to my feet I twirl over to Joshua who grabbed my arms and flipped us both. Slowly we put our arms out to show my rope is unattached and we are both just hanging by his rope, and we are only attached by a chain in our mouths. I open my mouth to release the chain. The sensation of dropping washes over me, only to be stopped by the swinging bar a hook onto. The crowd goes wild. Around me I see all the girls hanging by silk, twirling endlessly with so much grace. I pull up to position myself to sit on the swing. Only to leap through the air while Joshua swings on his swing to catch me. Again the crowd goes bonkers.          After a moment of them cheering I jump and plunge through the air, flipping over and over again. After a few seconds I blindly spin around. Trying to aim towards the landing mat. I realize I'm off by a foot or two and won't make it to the mat. Suddenly, something slams into me from behind. Joshua. He Had noticed my mistake and altered his path to help me.          I tumble onto the mat trying not to look dazed. And stand with my toes pointed and arms out. The crowd claps and we exit to the back section.         The crowd becomes muffled as a sit backstage.    'Hey uh, thanks for helping me out.' I mutter awkwardly.   'No problem. Hey wanna go get some popcorn?' He asks   'Sure!' I say relieved to get away from the quiet room.         After an hour and a half or so we get ready for our final bow. Oh duh! My mom! She came out and helped with the lion. Anyways, at the final bow I notice someone. Danielle Stone. My heart leaps up my throat. She waved her hand for me to come over after the bow.         I scurry over to her after explaining to my dad a friend was here. Danielle is, well was, my best friend before I started the circus.    'Oh my god! Hi! I haven't seen you in ages!' I shout over the noise hugging her.   'I know! You did awesome! So, how you been?what are you up to?' She smiles.   'Oh nothing. Just, you know, touring the world and such...' I joke.   ' Well about that... I'm joining the circus!Im going to be an acrobat like you!' She exclaims throwing her arms up.   'Really that's great! Well, as much as I'd love to talk I have to go. See you soon.' I hug her once more and walk away. Time for the meeting. I head to the back of the tent         Joshua waves me over to sit by him at our performance meeting. I blush and sit down. I mean, he is kind of cute... Moving on! The meeting is basically reviewing how we did and stuff. While they talk I rest my head on my arm. Although there we some bumps, today was a pretty great day!

I just found out that I got hired to try out at the circus! The things that I'm going to do at the circus are to train the show animals. I'm also going to be able to make up my own trick, and preform it on an aniaml!       First, I have to make my own trick and then practice it on an animal. The animal I will choose would be a tiger. I've been practicing this trick for about a week. Now I get to finally get to present it in front of everybody! My trick is to jump really high off of a trampoline. While I'm in the air I will do a back flip right onto a tiger!       Next, I have to practice a few more times before the show. 1, 2, 3 and jump, flip and land. Then, my boss wanted me to make the tiger sprint and go upsidown on a big loop. So then I had to wait one more day to present my trick. 1, 2, 3 and jump, flip, land, sprint and loop.        Finally, today is the day, preformance day! As I go out I here the aduince cheering as the spotlight is blazing into my face. I feel presured, but I know that I can do this. I get on the trampoline and warm up. I finally get high enough to flip. As I land on the tiger I yell 'RUN!' At first I was very scared to go on the loop. Then after the loop I wanted to do it again. So I went back to the trampoline. Jump, flip, land, run and LOOP!        My first preformance wasn't so scary after all. I can't wait to do another preformance next time. I wonder if I get to do something crazy next time?

'I got you good.' 'Don't do that, you know I'm in the moment when I'm practicing.'  At that moment, Gorge started to literally go ape. After he threw a fit he went to the door and pointed outside. I went to investagate and saw that one of the lion cages were empty.          'Good boy,' I said and got him a box of cookies. he went back to his cage and started to work on his cookies. I noticed that the lock had been broken and tracks lead into the main tent. I opened it up there was no lion just one big banner that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIM!

Also I have a small 2 year old sister named Mitsy.The circus I preform in is called Le Circe De Lune which means the circus of the moon in French.         A normal day in my life is that I get up around 5:00 A.M so then I can get some practice in before the school. Then at 6:00 I rush to the Pie cart to get a tasty Nuttella crep, which is technically a flat pancake, after that I rush to the school, which is a red wagon. My best friend Enzo waits for me at the door. In school we have tests and homework and weekends and all, but instead it's moving. Usually we learn about the places that we preform at, like right now we're in France.         After 6 hrs. of school I go home to feed my sister, because my mother is working. Then I go and practice for 3 hrs. before the show. After I put on my sparkly leotard and dress Mitsy in her puffy pink dress, and even though she is to young to really preform the clowns use her to do there show. Then I head down to the tent, the people painted my face.         Then as usual I have an awesome preformance and am totally wiped out.

This is a story of how I, Isabell Castini, got in the circus! It started out one summer morning. I was getting ready to go to the park when suddenly my dad says, 'Isabell. Do you want to go to the circus instead?' I called back, 'Sure!' So I got ready to go to the circus! I was in the car when my dad asked me, 'Isabell, what would you be if you were in the circus?' I replied, 'Well, I guess I would be an acrobat!' My dad kept driving and said,'Well, Isabell, how about I get you lessons to be an acrobat? This is the perfect age to start!' He says that because im about 11 years old so he wants me to learn how to be something I want to be.                      We got to the circus at exactly 12:00 o'clock. We were just in time! The first act was clowns! I watched the clowns as they happily threw pie in each other's faces! It was so funny! The next act was the acrobats! I was so excited! They did flips and twirls and whirls! I was so amazed! Then after the show was over I told my dad, 'Yes. I would love to take acrobat lessons!' So the next day my dad called the city's office. 'Hello? Do you have any gymnastic lessons or acrobat lessons? I am not sure what they are called.' Asked my dad. 'Yes, all you have to pay is $20 a month.' said the phone lady. 'Okay. When do the next lessons start?' asked my dad. 'Next Tuesday? Okay we will be there!' 'Well?' I asked. 'You may come next Tuesday ok? Do NOT let me forget! This is very important!'                   A week had passed and my dad woke me up super early! 'The early worm catches the bird!' My dad cheerfully said. 'Um...dad? Isn't it supposed to be the early bird catches the worm?' 'Oh. Right.' said my dad as he laughs. 'Well anyways. Today is the day!' 'What?' I asked while yawning. 'You are supposed to go to your lessons!' my dad replied. 'At 7:00 in the MORNING?' I asked. 'No!' my dad says, 'You are supposed to be getting up early if you want to be in the circus like your big sister.' 'Okay. I will try to be more responsible.' I replied.                  Finally after what had seemed like an hour to me (which had only been about thirty minutes.) we were there! I entered the building and the counter lady was standing right there like she had been waiting for me. I asked her what time it was so I would know that she wasn't some kind if robot or something. She said it was 8:00 A.M. 'Okay, so maybe it was an hour.' I said to myself. 'Go right in there.' said the counter lady. As I went inside I saw girls who were probably up since 5:00 in the morning doing flips and really cool tricks! 'Wow! I wish I could do that!' I said out loud. Then a lady came up to me and said, 'Hello there, My name is Mrs. Belini. Are you one of our newcomers?' 'Um, yes.' I replied shyly. 'It's fine we are all family here! you don't need to be shy.' she said. she led me to a balance beam and held my hand. She told me to climb up the balance beam. It wasn't very high and she said she would hold my hand so I climbed up on the balance beam. She told me to try to jump off and spin 360 degrees. So I jumped off and tried to spin and I did! She said that was beginner stuff. I was so happy that I got off to a good start!                  A couple of years passed and I was doing AWESOME! I was now 15 and I knew a ton of stuff about the circus and the Belini Brothers! I was thinking about joining them. Then I knew something was going on. My circus/gymnastics teacher's name was Mrs. Belini! She is their SISTER?! I ran to my dad and told him, and he said he already knew. 'Isabell, she is going to try and get you into Belini Brothers!' screamed my dad. 'What?! I barely know anything about circuses and-,' my dad cut me off. 'It's fine! Do you think that she just wants to do that just because?' 'No.' I replied quietly. 'Then you are fine. She told me that you will be able to see them on Friday. Ok?' my dad told me. I started to stutter, 'Um, but, when? How? Whe-' 'Stop stuttering. you will be fine.'                 A week passed and I was ready! I got up REALLY early and my dad wasn't even up yet. I took a shower and got dressed, and I sat in the living room waiting for my toaster waffle to be done. My dad walked in the room thinking nobody was up yet. He almost screamed, 'INTRUDER! INTRUDER!' 'I woke up early dad just like youi said. Right?' He started to laugh. 'Ok what is the big occasion?' he asked. I gasped. 'You mean you don't remember?! The Belini Brothers? We are going there, remember? So i can audition?' 'Oh yeah!' He yelled. 'Hurry! Get dressed! Take a shower!' 'It's ok dad I already did all that.' 'Ok.' he said.  3 hours had passed and finally we got to the car and started driving.                 We finally got there and one of the Belini brothers told me to go on the stage and audition. I was so scared I could barely feel my feet! So I got on the balance beam and did a bunch of cool trips and flips. Mrs. Belini also taught me how to do the acrobat tricks in the air. I climbed the ladder. Everything looked so small but I saw my dad and Mrs. Belini Cheering me on. So I jumped and did one flip. I grabbed the bar and did flips. I was so amazed that I could do all this stuff! Then the Belini Brothers spoke. 'Isabell Castini!' I thought they were going to kick me out but they just started to laugh and dance. 'We want YOU to be in our circus!' I panicked and screamed, 'AHHHH! I am so happy!' My dad told me 'CONGRATULATIONS!' I packed my things up and said, 'Thank you dad.' I got on the train and left. And that is the story of how I got into the circus!

But enough aboust me i have to tell you a day at a circus for me.     I was laying in bed awake starring at the crumbling white paint on the ceiling. I was waiting for Koney Non , a clown, who woke me up to eat at the pie car.     I was wiped out , though i got used to being tired. Today we had a matinee show at 3:00.                      Knock , Knock , knock.      The sound echoed at the door flung open.                                       Koney Non was in the opening of the door already wearing wis make up and clothes plus his red velvet wig.                                   'Sorry , I forgot to wake you up early!' Koney chuckled as we went in my van.                                       ' What time is it?' I asked cunfused.                                        ' Oh its 2:49' Koney whispered.                                 'WHAT!!!!' I screamed juming up off my blue sparkly bed.                         ' Why did'nt you wake me up!' i yelled as i ran to my make up desk.                I grabbed my yellow worn out brush and brush out all my tangles. My hair was done by the time he answered.                                    ' Well they had extra buritos at the pie shop and I ran to get my fair share and then i forgot, then time passed by then i remembered you and got you some snacks' Koney laughed as he took out some crackers.     I jumped up and grabbed the crackers and shoved them in my mouth not caring what the flavor was.    i chewed it all up and it tasted like white cheddar.                   ' I hate you but i gotta say thank you so much I love you!!!!!' I screamed as i went to sit back down to put on my glittery make up.                Koney smiled and walked out my van and closed the door.      I put on my blue eye shadow and then but on eye liner.           I went as fast as I could wlile i put maskera on.\\   It was 2:50 by the time I finished.     On my make desk was a curling iron , but i had no time to spare. I put my hair in a bun and ran into my bathroom.     I looked in the mirror and I did'nt look have bad.      My brown hair looked perfect. But at that moment i knew i could'nt brush my teeth becuase i heard the clock go ding ,ding ,ding ,dong.    Meaning it was 2:59.              Luckily my outfit had been ironed and next to the sink.   I quickly slipped on the dress and tights and ran outside.     It seemed as if the Circus house area was a desert and i was the only one there.      I walked passed the vans and cars then started to run in to the building that we did our preformances.          Why was everybody practiceing I mean we had a show to do but nobody was in the audience.    The ring tosser was ring tossing, the lion tamer was taming and everybody acted as if there was no rush!                        I felt a tight pinch on my back.    It was Koney the Clown.                  ' You know that the show doesnt start till tomorrow!Right' Koney chuckled as he walked to his post.                 ' What!!!!!' I whispered as i walked where the acrobats trained.             So maybe the life in the Circus is crazy , but it is my dream to do it so I will do it. No matter what.

I'm an acrobat in the circus, and believe me, it's not as easy as you think. We have to wake up very early in the morning to do our jobs, and we go to sleep very late. We do several shows in over 150 different cities in a year! I travel with my family, and all the circus performers live in one big trailer. My mother is an animal trainer, and my father is a clown.                 Even though we live in a trailer, we still go to school. The   school just travels with us. Believe it or not, our school is just like yours! We have our regular lessons, along with tests. We also use computers. But because circus performers come from all over the world, a lot of my classmates speak different languages. I have always wanted to play an instrument or do a sport, but we never have enough free time to do other things.                  When school is over, we have do to chores and practice our circus tricks. Being an actrobat takes a lot of agility and perseverance. I took gymnastics when I was smaller, so I know how to do a lot of the flips and other things in the job of being a circus performer. In the circus, I still have a lot of friends even though we're not in our real home. We try to adapt to different temperatures, but it's hard because we move around so much.                   Sometimes life is hard for us circus performers, but I know I will always enjoy being an acrobat in the circus.

It all started on May 4, 2010, my birthday, I was at my car getting ready for the next trip to Nevada. Then all of a sudden my car started moving. I looked out the window and to my relief we were just leaving early, but noticed my cat was gone. My cat was sitting on top of another car. I hit the emergency button that made all the cars stop,'Screeeech!' I grabbed my cat and we were off again. I thought all the crazy stuff was all done for the day, but I was wrong, very wrong.             Finally we stopped in Nevada for the week and we started to set up for the night. Then suddenly I heard a,'BOOOOMMM' I shot out of my car and ran to the tent. I looked around and saw that part of the stands were lose and fell of. I grabbed a wrench and ran to the stands and started tightening the loose screws. I guess I set an example because then everyone in the circus pitch in. Like I said before there was more in store for me that day.             The show started in ten minutes and everyone was filling the stands. I used to be nevous, but I've been doing this for a while so I was exited. Especially since I learned a new tightrope dance. The show has begun, but something was wrong I could feel it. 'ROOAARR!' everyone screamed in terror. Luckily I learned how to tame a lion in circus school. I finally got the lion back in it's cage and everything was fine. The show was canceled that night,but that is fine because it was a wild day anyway.               Wow what a day.

They decided to go and find and animal. The problem was that the circus had every animal known to be in the circus. They didn't know what to do. They went to Australia to find a kangaroo. The problem was the kangaroo just kept trying to hop away. Another problem was that the next performance was three days away. This was going to be their biggest crowd yet because they had advertised saying they had a new animal.                  The crew decided to go to Africa to find an animal. With one day left. When they brought the cheetah back from Africa, he wouldn't listen to anyone. Every performer tried to tame the cheetah.   During dinner time, our stage manager said that maybe he should try taming the cheetah. He hadn't tamed any animals before but we decided we should let him try. The cheetah was going to our grand finally. When we looked through the curtains, we saw that the crowd was huge. As usual, all the performers and the animals went. Then, it was the cheetah's turn.                   When the cheetah and the stage manager went into the place where the performers perform, everybody was cheering. All of us were peaking through the curtain trying to look. The cheetah was amazing. It jumped through flaming hoops, and walked on three legs. It was the best animal we trained ever. After the spectacular performance, we decided to let the stage manager also be the cheetah trainer.

I had known that she would never be the best in our circus, but I never knew that she truly had no talent. Already a half of the crowd was shouting angrily to Manny, our ringleader, and Monique. Shocked by the audience's response to her part in the show, Monique fled the stage and burst into tears as she ran to her trailer. I couldn't blame her for the audience's reaction. Many times the audience quality changed. In Atlanta, there were many happy people while in Salem, there were many grumpy people. Although most of the angry responses were because of the audience quality, I knew that part of it was because of her act.               Dandrum Circus was a very successful circus until Pansy Lynn quit. Pansy was about the best horseback rider in history. She was the one who wowed the crowd with her amazing horse tricks. To the public, she was known as 'Pansy the Horse Whisperer.' Sometimes Pansy would go to the audience and answer their questions and sign autographs. She loved the publicity. And her horse, Kay. Pansy loved that horse. He was proud, handsome, and Pansy would die for him. Actually, he died first.               Pansy cried her eyes out the day that the doctors declared Kay dead after he died of a disease. At first she refused to work with any other horse and stayed inside her trailer for weeks. Manny talked to Pansy and even sent her to a therapist to help settle her feelings. Pansy came back fresh and happy. It seemed like she had forgotten about Kay. I followed her to the stable when she was picking out a horse to practice with. I saw her come towards a beautiful tan horse like Kay, except it wasn't. 'You look so beautiful,' Pansy said as she stroked his mane,'like Kay.' She paused, making a shocked and puzzeled face. 'Where is Kay?' she said to herself. As if remembering, she sadly walked back to her trailer.                The next day, I heard that she quit. Jose, the circus manager, looked as red as a beet when he came out of the office trailer after his talk with Pansy. I didn't have a glimpse of Pansy that day and never saw her ever since.                We moved to Seattle. I helped post flyers for job openings in our circus. One of the jobs was Pansy's part with horses. Jose sat in his office interviewing many people who wanted a job. I had peeked through the window and had seen Jose's tired face after the interviews were done. It was after dinner and he was about to flip the sign that said 'Interviews in Session' to 'No Interviews' until a teenage girl with purple hair and bright blue eyes ran up to Jose. 'Are the interviews done already?' she asked. Jose looked around. No one else was in line. 'I guess one more is fine,' he said. When both of them went inside the trailer, I slipped back to my own trailer and had a good night sleep.                She got Pansy's part. Jose introduced her to everyone in the circus while we were eating breakfast. 'Her name is Monique and she claims that she is the 'horse whisperer' of this town.' We all clapped. At practice that day, I saw that she was not very good, but I didn't let that worry me. At least until showtime.                Monique ruined her part. She drove the horses too close to each other so that they were practically hitting each other. Then she fell off the horses and tripped herself and got herself stuck in the hay while the horses were chewing her hair. At least there was my part.                After Monique were my friends and me. We're called the 'Birds of the Trapeze.' I jumped and Ellen swang towards me. We caught eachother and danced around our course. Maylee and Lucy joined us. The crowd loved us. Now it was time for the finale. We all grabbed ropes that were in a circle and were somersaulting and changing spots. I've seen YouTube videos of us, and we were really good. Then Aimee jumped in the middle and we became tropical birds in paradise. We landed perfectly on our posts and posed. The crowd cheered wildly and we took a bow. They seemed to forget Monique.                Later that day, Manny told us that we saved the show. Monique had quit. 'If we find another bad performer, I'm not gonna put horse tricks on the show,' he said. We only had a day in Seattle. I wasn't sure he was going to find a replacement. That is, until I saw the long line of people outside the office trailer.

The next day at school I was thinking of some things for the contest and then it hit me.I should make a good story by having a good plot and beginning,middle and end.That night I started my story about the circus.                                     THE  CIRCUS   The day I was born my mom told me that I wanted to be in the circus I don't no why but when i was 4 they put me in Gymnastics they said it would help my balance on the tightrope.I don't no why they did but i'm glad now because I am a tightrope walker now all thanks to my parents I travel all around the world seeing different sights and beautiful places that I never thought I would see before.       When we reached our destination I saw a bear riding a unicycle wasn't that a sight.When we were practicing I got nervous and almost fell because i've never performed in front of a live audience before.I got so nervous on the tight rope my legs just froze and my legs locked but i caught myself and got back on the platform and got down because i was scared to death that could've put me to my death if i would of not kept my balance.       That night in front of the audience was packed and I saw this little kid about in the 5th grade or so and he was in the front row of the circus.He smiled at me I smiled back and waved he looked like he admired me and that got me across that tight rope.The night when that boy gave me a smile changed my life if that boy wouldn't of smiled I wouldn't be telling this story right now.That circus was about ten years ago and if I could have the opportunity to meet that boy again I would shake his hand that was the circus man's dream now and his goal.           10 years later he made his dream come true and shook the boy's hand for the first time.           15 years later the man died of a heart attack in his basement.   The boy went to his funereal and gave his heart to the old man because the boy looked up to him.       20 years later the boy gave the old man a grave that no one could give him and he buried him in a circus and when the boy died of a disease he got buried right beside his idol.

Once, there was a circus performer named Chicken Yumyum.  She was a person who was not afraid of any type of snake, so she decided to join the circus.  Back then, people use to dance with constrictors in the circus.  It was all her talent.  So she decided to join the circus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        She was entered in a circus in Tokyo.  There was many trains to pull stuff with help of trucks and ships.  Chicken was the last performer.  Her job was to stand on the horse while sprinting and dance with mean constrictor about 7 feet long.  It was a success!  She then went to Florida to do a huge practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                        While practicing Chicken thought she was going to be the best and most wealthy performer in the world.  However on the newspaper it said that a clown called the floating spirit could juggle on a very thin rope while bouncing on a ball with a monster unicycle.  Chicken got mad and said to herself,'that clown should try a constrictor till he falls of his rope and dies.'She practiced more and more and was going to preform much more better than the last one.  This time she was going to a lot better than her last preform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There were a lot more trains and ships and trucks.  Again she was last which was good.  The Floating Spirit was there that time.  He was on a rope that almost looked like a spider web with a unicycle and a ball while juggling 6 balls.  This time in his preferment he said,'THROW THE RATTLESNAKE.'Someone shot a rattlesnake in the air and he started dancing with it in one hand while the other hand was juggling the balls!  Chicken saw that the rattlesnake was weird and how he juggled and how he unicycles was weird.  Chicken didn't know how to juggle, but she did know she was not afraid of snakes.  She asked somebody who was in charge of the circus materials,'where are the rattlesnakes?'We don't have any rattlesnakes,'said the guy,'but we have corral snakes.'Chicken was confused, but she didn't care that much.  This time she got a 8 and a half constrictor with 2 corral snakes.  She put a unicycle on a horse that was much faster than the other horse.  She was a great success but more people cheered for The Floating Spirit than Chicken.  They through money and roses at The Floating Spirit.                                                                                                                                                                             All night Chicken thought about all the strange things that happened that night.  Then it hit Chicken that the clown was a fake!  There were strings on  the balls and on the clown!  He was also attached to the unicycle!  And there was no rattlesnakes in the circus and the rattlesnake was fake or dead because it never moved! 'Nobody would believe me,'she thought,'but he can ruin my career!'She was doing nothing for 5 minutes and then she had brilliant idea.  She dressed like an untalented person and asked somebody,'when and where is The Floating Spirit's next preferment?'The guy replied.' America, Main, Tuesday April 21, 9:30 pm.'That is where and when Chicken left.                                                                                                                                                                Chicken borrowed a spot light and went into the tent.  While 'The Great Floating spirit' was doing his fake moves Chicken aimed the spot light above the clowns head and turned it on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It showed the lines above his head and then everybody started shouting BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! and started shouting CHICKEN YUMYUM!                                                                                                                                                                       In conclusion, Chicken Yumyum died after a corral snake bit her and fell of a tight rope and was constricted by an anaconda about 16 feet long.  However, she was the most famous circus performer in history.

The circus master thinks that I did it so he told me if all the animals aren't back by midnight he's going to kick me out of the circus.         First I try to find all the small animals, but when I thought I got all of them I founded out I was missing Momo. I decided to find Momo later and go for the bigger animals. The bigger animals were easyier then I thought they were. It all came up to Momo to decide if I can stay. It was five minutes before midnight and I didn't know what to do.         I was on my way to the master when I heard something. The look on his face when I told him Momo was under his hat was incredible. He told me since I found all the animals I can stay.

When I went in the circus, I saw lots of talent. In order to be on a circus,you'll have to have talent. I am good at juggling. So one day I got ready. All performers need to wake up early and get ready so I got ready at 7:00 A.M in the morning. Then I went to the pie car, where circus performers eat. And I ate there. The food is delicious.                                                          Then, after I ate, I went to the circus and knew that I had the chance to travel around the world with my talent. This was my chance to show the people what I can do like juggling. I knew I had to work all day and spend a lot of time away from home. So I practiced and practiced until I can do it and I was juggling. I was so happy and I wanted to show the people what I can do so bad. So I practiced and practiced.                                   I knew I can do it but I just kept on practicing and practicing. Then it was time for the show but I was scared and shy. I have not been in front of a lot of people. The people that work there told me that it is going to be all right. And I felt more better. Then it was time and the person that calls my name and my group called us and we performed. I didn't want to go but I had no choice.                               I was so happy and so glad. It was the best time of my life. I love being a juggler and love being a circus performer. There is a lot jobs in a circus but I like juggling so I wanted to be a circus performer. After I performed, I wanted my family here. I miss my family. Circusis are fun and exciting. I love to be a circus performer. In conclusion, a circus isn't like flying fun games, its all about what you like to do and what you're good at.

A circus can look like lots of fun but can be a little hard to work in because you have to wake up early to get dressed. Circus's can be fun to  watch but can be a little stressful for you to work in. One day a girl named Karen thought it might be interesting s she went to search for a circus she can join.               Karen was a curios girl.  So she set off to Massachusetts because she heard their was going to be a circus there soon. She saw the magical circus and looked at everyone do their magical talents. Se was impressed about the way they did their tricks. She said out loud ''I WISH I WAS IN A CIRCUS. She asked them if she can be in the circus. They said sure you may be able to be in the circus.               She decided she wanted to be in the acrobatics because she had been in gymnastics before and knew how to do tricks and flips. Karen was not used to waking up at 7:00 A.M. so that was a big change for her. She loved school, but she did not like how it was taught in the circus classes. She knew two languages very well. Soon they made Karen learn another language she was very happy she got to learn another language. Not long before she realized that she had to go to bed at 10;30 P.M. after her show was over.               Ever since she entered the circus she gets to talk to her family once a week. She was not very happy with her new schedule. One fact she did love about the circus was the deliciouse food trucks. Each day they had a different kind of food. She had her own dance studio where she practiced from 3:30 to 6:30.               At last she realized she really didn't want to be in a circus. Sje loved the way her life was, she really missed the times she spent with her family and friends. Yea she loved the food at the circus but she missed her moms delicious home made food. Now Karen is going back to practicing gymnastics.

'What happened?' Moma asked. 'Papa's favorite horse, Lust, is missing!' Laura cried. 'Oh! That's just terrible! There is no show without Lust. He's the star of our circus you know.' Mama said, pulling Laura close. Suddenly, one of the circus clowns burst into  the trailer. 'The show is about to start Mrs. Cinders. We're all waiting on you.' the clown spoke in a goofy voice. 'Have you no idea that Lust is missing!' Moma practicly screamed.     'Lust is missing!' the clown said, his eyes bulging. ' That's right, and we're not doing the show without him.' Laura snapped. 'I don't know Laura. Not doing the show means losing a lot of money.' Moma said shaking her head. ' What are we waiting for then? On with the show!' the clown smiled, and waddled out of the trailer. 'Sorry sweetie.' Moma sighed as she walked out of the trailer and closed the door behind her.     'Don't worry Lust. I'll find you.' Laura exclaimed confidently. With that said, she grabed her flash light and snuck out of the trailer. The moment she got out she heard rustling in he underbrush. Instinctively she filcked on her flash light and pointed it tward the underbrush.All of a sudden, somebody put a hand over Laura's mouth and draged her into the prickly bushes.     Laura looked up and saw that it was her dad and Lust. 'Papa aren't you suppost to be at the circus, and how did you find Lust?' Laura asked. ' The circus life is so busy that I decided to run away with Lust.' Papa frowned. 'Papa, you could have just told us and we could have stopped our tour. Nobody would mind. All we want is for you to be happy.' Laura said, and hugged her dad. 'Really?' Papa asked. 'Really.' Laura said. With that said, Papa grabbed Lust's reins, took Laura's hand, and walked back to the circus.

There are lots of preformers and animals. Some animals that are there are elephants, lions, bears, and monkeys. Also some preformers do acrobats, circus jugglers, tightrope walker, and clowns. It is very fun and exciting at circuses because there are lots of fun activitys and magic! The animals are fun to watch because there are animals doing tricks and having fun.

Animal stunts have to do with sometimes just animals or animals and humans together, either way it is a stunt with an animal in it.Like in the section that i highlighted nex to the section where it says ''3:30 P.M.'' it says all kinds of stuff about what animals and humans do in a circus. Another example of a human and an animal working together is when it says that Bella was working on a stunt where she flips off the trampoline and lands on the horse. That is a stunt with and animal and a human.          Another thing that happens in a circus are circus acrobats. Circus acrobats are very flexible and very talented. They do flips,front handsprings,arials,and a lot more! Thay might be my favorite thing that happens in a circus. I personaly LOVE circus acrobats!          One more thing that happens in a circus are tightrope walkers! They are probably my 2nd favorite thing that happens at a circus.They are VERY balanced and sometimes really flexible!

My parents were reluctant to allow me to practice this act, but now, seven years later, I am a professional flame swallower and lion tamer. I learned how to swallow flame while standing upon a running lion's  back. But I had never done this in front of an audience. And, I get stage fright!               But it is too late now.

Bella and her family could not eat much because they were going to perform.          12:00 she went to sleep. if i was Bella and did it everyday i will be really tried. i think the second part is the same. the thing i did int get is that why do they let kids perform. it can be very dangerous.

I think that is the most hardest thing to do because when you are flipping you also have to have balance. Once when I went to a circus when I was little thae lead acroabat had to walk on a tight rope and then jump into a pool of water. When he jumped off of the tight rope he slipped and broke his leg. The fall was like thirty feet into the air. thats why i say it is the hardest.                Anoher thing that is hard to do in the circus is twisting your body. When i went recentlly to a circus with my mom this one group of boys from ages 9 to 17came out. Their names were 'The Bone Crusher Boys. ' They call themselves that becuse they had to twist their bodys around in fuoll curcules while keepin their heads still. On boy came out when it was his turn and he could dislocating his shoulder to twist his arm around and with his hands tied behind his back. his arms went around like 5 times and it didn't even hut him. when their act was over, he showed us how he moved id arms around like that and i was because he could his inner armpit bone pop in and out whithout him hurting himself.                Lastly, the most hardest thing to do is walk on stilts. I say that because the same day I saw the Bone Crusher Boys I saw the people who walk on stilts. One guy had french braids in his hair and he was like 35 years old. He could walk up the stairs with the stilts on and he could jump up and down with their stilts on. Lastly he said you have to have a lot of balance to be on these because the bottoms of the stilts are really small. And that is why I think the Circus is a hard job.

Most people think that our life is just fun and no school, no homework just traveling and games in the circus, but no that's nothing like my life at all. I still have a normal life even if I am in the circus.       First of all, I do have school there are other kids on the circus train with me and we have one teacher. between circus acts we have school and homework. Even though I do live on a train I still have lots of responsibility, including taking care of my dog Fluffy and doing my chores.       The circus takes a lot of work including practicing for 8 hours everyday.I have to stretch a lot especially since I'm an acrobat we're the most flexible in the circus. I almost never get any sleep for example, one time we had a circus that went all the way from 4:00 to 11:55 P.M. and I didn't get to bed until 3:00 A.M. Most kids my age have to go to bed at 9:30 P.M. on the school week.       Being in the circus is also very dangerous sometimes. My best friend Meranda is also an acrobat but her parents work with lions. One time Merandas dad was practicing with the lions and one lion jumped back and scratched Merandas dad it wasn't pretty. But luckily he was trained not to be scared so he didn't panic at all, he acted very calm.       Sometimes I get super home sick, I'm from California but I'm only home for about 2 months and im in the circus train for 10 months. I've been everywhere in America on this train. I've never been out of the country for a circus act but my parents said maybe next year the circus will take us to france. My parents and Merandas parents and some other people are on the circus committee.They make all the decisions for us like which state where going next, and they help set up all the circus stuff.       On the train sometimes if we're bored all the kids on train come and we play different games.some of my favorite games that we play are hide &amp; go seek tag. its super fun escpecially since the trains really long we have many places to hide and run.       Now you can see how my life is, its not easy and all fun and games at all. well actually being in the circus is lots of fun but you know what I mean.It takes lots of work, responsibility,  time and trust but its all worth it!

It all started 27 years ago in a small village called Burritoville. There were circus auditions to join the renown travelling circus called The Burrito Brothers. At the time I was only 7 years old. No person has ever made it into The Burrito Brothers at my age. My special talent was that I could walk on a tightrope.                        I was number 54 to audition. I nervously watched as people were being denied into The Burrito Brothers. My friend Barney was doing an acrobatic performance when he fell of the rope that he was holding on to and came crashing to the ground. He went into a coma.   That injury made me even more nervous.                        34,35,36,37,38,......54.                                     It was my turn. I did not want to go into a coma and i did not want to be denied. I wanted to be the youngest person to ever join The Burrito Brothers. The problem was that The Burrito Brothers did not want very young people to join their circus.                         'Well, are you coming or not 54?' Yelled the director.                          'Y-yes sir.' I stammered.                             As I climbed on to the tightrope I suddenly got butterflies in my stomach as I thought about poor Barney who went into a coma. I put my right foot on the rope and then my left foot and so on.                              I had 3 more steps...2......1.... I made it!!!!! All of the judges were clapping. The director announced, 'Congrats, Jonny. You are the youngest person to ever join The Burrito Brothers!!                                     That was how my career started.

I changed from my pajamas to my day clothes and went into the pie car for breakfast. I finish my breakfast and rush to the bathroom and brush my teeth.

In two days from now we'll be in another country. I was hoping we'd go to Las Vegas, in Nevada. But I highly doubt that'll ever happen. I hopped under my covers and drifted to sleep. That night I had a strange dream about my spinning on a rope 300 ft. in the air, trick.                                                    THE DREAM        My palms were sweaty and I turned to face all the people counting on me, to do this trick. My hands gripped the rope. I climbed the rope, to the top and I felt the rope begin to spin. I gripped the rope even tighter with my sweaty hands. I plastered a fake smile on my face to cover up the fright. I saw the crowd cheering me on and my parents, the crew, and the other performers cheering me on aswell. Without thinking one of my hands let go of the rope. My smile was swept off when this happened. The crowds cheers got louder but everyone elses stopped. Everyone but the crowd had nervousness on their faces. I tried to put my hand back on the rope but the rope was spinning to fast. I finally got a grip of the rope with my other hand. I took a deep breath and my palms got sweaty again. I looked down, and that was the moment I realized I was afraid of heights. My breathes were quicker and my heart literally stopped. My hands slipped on the rope and when as I was falling I heard gasps and 'oh no's!' from the audience. The crew, my family, and other performers rushed to the rope. I closed my eyes tight and was waiting for impact. I slammed onto the floor, with a 'THUNK!' then I  blacked out.                                                 REALITY   I woke up sweating. I saw that my family was surounding me. They all looked worried, I noticed that I was crying. I wiped the tears off my cheeks and rubbed my eyes.        'What happened?', I asked, looking up to my family.          'You were crying and sweating. You were screaming in your sleep.', my sister, Alyssa, said still with a worried look on her face, 'What were you dreaming about?'          'I was dreaming about the rope trick. I was dreaming I fell off and I slammed into the floor.', I said, laying back down.           It was Saturday and my family gave me 'It's going to be okay, nothing will happens' before leaving the bedroom. I rubbed my eyes and got out of bed and headed to the pie car. I ate breakfast and went to go look at the rope.       I looked up at the rope and took a deep breath. I climbed the rope up to 300 ft. I looked down and it wasn't so scary.                            ON MONDAY AT THE SHOW           I looked at the people counting on me. This wasn't a dream at all. I sighed and climbed up the rope. I looked down and felt the rope begin to spin. I gripped the rope tighter and felt goosebumps go up my arms. I didn't realize my eyes were closed until I opened them and the crowd was cheering. I did it. I acomplished this trick nobody else would do. Im proud  of myself.

A lot of thing happens at a circus a lot of kids go there within their family and have fun. In circus their are a lot of treats like cotton candy and more.At a circus there are  animals and candy, soda and more. Also at the circus they have clowns that juggles and circus acrobats that hangs on rops, tightrope walker that rides on a rope with a unacycile, and horses that listens to to a person.circus is a really good place to go on a filed trip. I like going to circus but some times bad things happens like when kids eat to much candy they throw up. But other wise tons of kids and grownups go to the circus and watch people dance and also do tricks. Alot of times when we do not get to go the circus because they all ways go to diffident places like when they go to oakland they only spend a coplue days out herte then they leve.At circus they always have a clowns that maybe when the circus is over the clown may make bloon  animals for the everyone. The circus is a really good place i love it a lot and that is all about circus my favirote thing to watch at the circus is the circus acrobact because it is so exticing to watch them hang on the rope and blance so stright that is why it is my favorite thing to watch at the circus.The circus is the best.

I grew up on my grandmas farm with cows, pigs, chickens, horses, and cats. Her farm was blue and she had a gray silow about 15 ft. tall next to it. She lived in a big yellow house with a nice big porch for summer days. Being on the farm isn't easy, their are lot and lots of chores to do and you still have to go to school all at the same time. I live alone with my grandma because my parents didn't love me or want me so my grandparents took me in and two days after I got there my grandpa died of a heart attack.                Sometimes when I would have to feed the chickens, I would really swing around on the rope, and do cool acrobatics. I loved doing that kind of stuff, it would cheer me up and remind me of my dream to be in the circus.               One day when I was in my room at 6:30 right before I had to feed the chickens, I heard on the radio from my grandmas room that there was an open auditon to be in the circus. I wrote down all of the information I needed and thought of a plan to get there. My grandma doesn't like the circus, so my plan was to say I was going to just watch, when I would really tryout. I practiced my flips and tricks over and over again till they were perfect.              Finally it was the day, the day of the circus auditions. I asked my grandma if I could go and I was right my plan worked! When I got there, so many people were there I couldn't believe it! My turn was up, I was about to burst into tears and run off stage but I kept my cool.             'Ana dear, the phone is for you and I will allow it since well, you can find out for your self.'             'Coming, and o...k?'             I came to the phone and figured out why my grandma said what she did, I won! Out of 3,789 people, they liked me the best! We packed my stuff because I have to move in with the circus I can't just live at home. For my last day with grandma she didn't make me do any chores, the whole day was just fun and games on the farm. I am really going to miss my grandma, she was the only one who ever cared for me and that really means a lot.             It's my first day at the circus and boy what a busy day I have. First at 7:00 A.M. I have to get up and eat in the pie car (food truck for circus people). Then at 9:00 A.M. I go to school, just because I am in the circus doesn't mean I get to skip school. Inbetween 3:00 P.M. and 3:30 P.M. I get to have a break and play arouond with the circus acts and my friends from school. After that when it is 3:30 P.M. I have to practice my act and do chores. Right before the show I eat dinner in the pie car but not much because we have a show after. When my show is over I am wiped out and ready to go to bed. Finally at 12:00 P.M. I get to go to the trailer and plop down on the bed to fall asleep.            The circus is my dream but I miss my grandma more that anything. Life is really hard without anyone to take care of you and love you. I can't wait for the end of our touring season so I can go home to my grandma and spend time with her.

It was 7:45 I was supposed to get up and be ready by 7:30. So I dashed over to the front door and quickly put on my shoes.                    Once I got to the pie cart my food was still steaming hot the way I like it. I ate my food kinda a fast but, then I slowed down because I started to choke.               I walked over to where that beautiful tent was supposed to get put up, and sure enough the crew was right on task. They were setting up the tent, bright shinning lights and some pretty cool music for tonight's show. Soon it was 9:00 it was time for school, so I said my goodbyes and went on my on way.                     When I got to school the fog was starting to clear up I was so happy that the fog was clearing. The school that I go to is a one room school house but the view that we see is just gorgeous. But, like any other school we have assessments report cards, but there is one thing that is different languages but, not me I speak English.          After school my parents lets me go play with my friends. My parents say that I'm in their hair to much, more like their in my hair too much. After I'm done hanging out with my friends I have to do chores. For my chores I have to clean the horses stables and clean them for tonight's show.

I get dressed and go over to the pie car for my breakfast.We're having bacon and pancakes, which is good, because I like pancakes.       Once we all get our fill, we have to set up the stage with lights and equipment. Then, we work on our training while the kids go to their small-sized school. We also have to take care of the elephants, horses, and all the other animals, along with making sure the equipment is clean enough to use.       We also have lunch in between there, but right now we are having supper. I go back to the pie car for my meal. We only have a little bit for supper because we will be performing afterwards.       When we all finish (which didn't take long, due to our meal size) , we go on stage for the big act. After a couple acts, I come on with the horses. I have them dance around and then I feed them some apples and carrots. Then some riders hop on their backs and I have the horses run around in a circle. My act is done. Me and the horses more off stage and let the other actors perform.       After we're all finished, the audience leaves and we go to sleep. Once I get into my bed, I wish I could tell my family and friends about my great act. I can't do that, though. We don't get to see home very much, so I just go to sleep in my trailer. . . .

She travels 20,000 miles in seven months a year. She works from day to night. Here's what she does when she wakes up: 7:00 A.M. she wakes up, gets dressed, and goes to the pie car for pancakes and bacon. The rest of the crews are setting up the lights, and music for their next show for the night. 9:00 A.M. Is school time. A one-room schoolhouse travels with them while they are on tour. Like any other school, this one has computers, tests, and report cards. Many of Bella's classmates can speak different languages like: French, Russian, and Italian. 3:00 P.M. After school, the clowns let Bella play with their unicycles and with their juggling balls. Then, she starts to play with her dog, Noodle. Bella has always wanted to be on a soccer team, but they dont stay at one place long enough. 3:30 P.M. After she plays with Noodles, she feeds, grooms, and waters the horses that are in the show with them.          Bella is working on leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back. The other children are practicing to juggle and do acrobatics. 6:30 P.M. Bella and her family go to the pie car and eat dinner when their done practicing. They have to do 10 shows a week. 10:30 P.M. The show is over and everyone is tired.  Two more days and then they will set off to another town. 12:00 A.M. Bella is thinking about the end of the tour session. She wants to go home already but the tour isn't over. Bella doesn't really know if she still wants to be a circus performer when she grows up.                                                                       Becoming a Circus Performer            Source #2      Kidzworld spoke with one of the performer about how it felt being in a circus. Her name was Philippa Hayball. She is an acrobat and dancer with Cirque du Soleil's circus show, Quidam. Not just anyone can join the circus, you have to have a special kind of talent. When Philippa was five years old, she was in circus acts already. She did musical theatre and ballet. When Philippa was 11, she knew she just wanted to be a circus performer, so she gave up on everything else and concentrated on her dancing and performing. Philippa has worked all over the planet including, Australia and Japan and all over North America. Circus performers have to travel ont eh road with 100 more people who are in the circus.            Philippa always gets a thrill from performing in front of an audience. She says you can see the audience being transported to another world. There are some drawbacks in being in the circus. Circus performers dont spend a lot of time at home, and they have to work for very long days. When they're on tour, they can't really call anywhere home because they go to a lot of different places. Circus performers are always thinking about the next show. Philippa says that she misses her home and she doesn't see her family that much either. She says that when you're a circus performer, you have to work very long hours and they have to work weekends too.

Well my friend Rose knows that a real circus is harder that you think.            On stage, circuses may look like all fun and games, but Rose knows it's not! Her day begins when she wakes up at seven o' clock. She gets dreasses and heads out to the pie care for breakfeast.            She often has typical food for breafeast. She might have bacon, or cereal. At around nine she goes to school. She has a traveling school with kids that don't speak just one language. Since Rose travels to perform at so many countries and speaks many languages. Her school still has tests, computers, and report cards, but its way more fun!            Three o' clock school is over, and she has a short break. She plays with the clowns, then she trys riding their unicycles. Three forty five is when she practrices for the show. She goes over her routine and then wait.            Six thirty. Dinner time! Rose hasn't eaten all day and is starving. However, she can't eat much because she has to perform.            Seven is show time. She does her stunts, and once again, she was nervous for nothing. Ten thirty show's over. And she has to clean up. At twelve shes in bed, fast asleep.                 Rose has a hard circus life, but it must be fun. I wish we could stay together, but she had her crazy, circus life, and I have my normal, life life.

His mother and father encouraged him to be a trapeze and worked hard always working and swinging.          But when he was seventeen he got his first job as a janitor in the circus each day he would watch the trapeze artists practice gliding through the air.?? But one night after cleaning he climbed up the trapeze ladder and there he was gliding through the air he felt so free and alive. From that point on he did that every night but one night Rita one of the Italian trapezes saw him she thought he was amazing that she told her boss about him she explained how graceful he was and how amazing he looked and from there her boss said to bring him in.           As Gustav walked in he was tense and nervous he knew what he had been doing all these nights after cleaning but he didn't think that his boss knew. He started to sweat so he spit it out and told his boss everything. His boss told him that it was okay and he wanted to see him do it again so Gustav went and did trapeze his boss saw him and hired him right on the spot. Gustav did this every night for 3 years but when he was twenty he left the circus and found a new circus called circus circus h was hired there to. He was working harder each day and then finally it as his big day the day he came to new york city!           He performed his hardest there doing flips and sins and catching the other trapeze artists. That night he as tired and he slept when he woke up he saw his boss and the old circus they wanted him back but then he convinced them to come to circus circus. Now Gustav is one of the greatest trapeze artists ever and still does flips and spins with his partner Frita and he has made Circus Circus one of the greatest circuses on the planet they travel around the whole world showing of there skills such as Gustav and Frita doing flips and twirls and spins and the clowns making everyone laugh and the lions roaring and the lon tamer taming it.

Well I have. there are circuses everywhere! In russia, italy,north america, and rome. You have to travel 20,000 miles every few monthes! That is a lot! There are also many things to do in a circus. Like acrobaticts, juggling, taming a lion, walking across a tight rope, and riding on elephants.                                                         To begin with, I will be telling you about clowns. A lot of kids think clowns are scary, but really, clowns are just there to entertain kids. They don't have to do much, but ride in a little cars which is amazing but still. Clowns are kind of funny looking. Clowns have purple hair, a red nose, a big tie, big shoes, white gloves, a really weird hat, a painted face, and a colorful suit.                               Another thing you do in a circus is acrobaticts. Acrobaticts is way more complicated than most things in a circus. what you do in acrobaticts is two people hang from a rope and swing around and around and around. that really gets the crowd going.what really interests people about acrobaticts is that they want the acrobats to fall down which is really rude. Acrobats dress in fancy clothing. They dress in white. The boys wear pants and a shirt and the girls wear a skirt and a shirt.That kind of act is personaly my favorite. It's my favorite because I like to see people from a high distance.                                The second to the last thing you can do in a circus is juggling. It takes a lot of talent to do something like that. There are many things you can juggle with. there are bowling pins, fire, chainsaws, balls, and metal rings. fire and chainsaws are really dangerous to juggle. thats why I said it takes a lot of practice to juggle amazingly. Its also embarrasing if you mess up. people don't want to see a bad show, they want to see well preformed show. If I wanted to be in a circus I would need to learn how to juggle because I would mess up badly.                                  The last thing you can do in a circus is to tight rope. Now tight roping takes alot of skill. You can get really hurt especially If you fall off. Thats why before having a job at the circus you practice by finding to trees that are parallel and tie a tough rope to the ends of the rope. If you make it to the end without falling, untie the rope and put it higher than it was before. keep doing that until you get as high as the circus rope. Then before you know it you will be doing that in front of a huge crowd. You will be a huge success.                                  As you can see there is a lot of prosess in being a circus preformer. All you have to remember is practice practice practice every day. In my opinion, I really don't want to be a circus preformor. It takes too much work and too much practice practice practice. You won't get anywhere in life unless you practice                                                                            ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.33254280784584,3.60211367417921,2

Even with the little elephant incedent.'' Zozo the clown had just finished the show of a circus. Zozo works in the Circus Talents circus. His job is being a funny entertaining clown. His best friends name is Marty, Marty was one of the acrobats. They travel together and perform for the same audiences.         ''Ya, I guess your right. Sure made the croud jump though.'' said a tired and disappointed Marty. Earlier that day in the middle of the show, one of the elephants got a little irrataded because someone stepped on her big soft feet. She had waved her head up and down in the air, and did a big circul around the stadium.          ''You know, I love all the kids and people that come and see us, but being in the circus is a lot more than just fun and games.'' said Zozo.   Zozo was right, not everyone is perfect, performers are just normal people with a dream come true. Right after he said that Marty was fast asleep. Just then Zozo recalled how he first got into the Circus Talents.           When he was a boy all his friends would call him Zozo the clown because his name was Zack. He always made his friends laugh and have a good time. That was his goal in life. Too make kids and adults laugh.   When Zozo started working in the circus, it wasen't such a great life. He had too wake up at 5 am every morning, take care of all of the animals. And worst of all he could only watch from the sides as the other performers did their show.          But afer two years of working super super hard. He was excepted in being a clown. And that was all that Zozo wanted. Too this day everyone enjoyed coming and seeing Zozo do his show and make people laugh, his dream had come true.                                                    The End.

I thought as I groomed the horses, who had just finished practicing for tonight's show.       'Cassidy!' I heard my mother calling. 'Honey, we're heading to the pie cart for dinner! The show is starting soon!'   I run after my mother and father and my sister, Amber, and soon we reach our destination.       As soon as we walk inside, Buddy the Clown greets us warmly.       'Ah, how are you, my dear Hillers? Sarah,' he turned to my mother,'how is your tightrope walking coming along? James,' now he turned to my father and clapped his enormous hand over my father's thin shoulder. 'I've seen you practicing your act where you'll juggle flames. Such perfect timing: tonight's show will be one of our best!'   My father laughed as Buddy removed his hand from his shoulder and now placed it on my head.      'Cassidy, are you excited for tonight's show? I can't wait to see you two somersault off Daisy The Elephant. That must take a lot of bravery!' He patted my head, as if I were a young child. People treat me differently just because I'm younger, but I'm twelve and very far from being the youngest one in the circus. 'Amber, your acrobatics are looking exceptional!' Amber is fourteen, only two years older than me, but she makes me feel as if she were another mom to me.        After we finish eating, we head to the main tent, called the Big Top. We are already in our costumes, and we all wait for the show to begin. My mother ties her long, fiery red hair back. The ringmaster steps out, welcomes the audience, and anounces the first act: James Hiller. Dad steps out into the spotlight and begins his act. At the end, my hands hurt from applauding. His act was fabulous!       Several more acts follow, including my mother and sister, until finally, it is my turn.      I step out into the center of the ring. The audience quiets, completely. This has never happened.      One man in the audience shouts out. 'That kid couldn't be older than nine! I came here to see a circus, not a ballet recital! She's going to get hurt!' Several others shout in agreement.       I hear my mother gasp from backstage. Out of the corner of my eye, I see my father, looking confused.       What is going on? I thought.       The ringmaster attempts calming the audience, but it is useless. 'Let's see your act, little girl! I am in the mood for some Girl Scout presentation.' The audience roared with laughter. I felt the anger boiling up inside of me. 'Ok, I will show you my act! Come on, Daisy!' I signaled for the elephant to come.       'Ok, just like we practiced.' I whispered in Daisy's ear as I climbed on her back. I rembered everything I had learned. I had to show this wild audience I was not a little kid, I was a talented young woman!          I gave Daisy a little kick, and she ran like the wind in circles around a small circular platform, where I will land. I slowly counted down. 5...4...3...2...1...       I remebered everything, even tucking in my chin. I did 6 flips and landed perfectly in the center of the platform.      The audience sat for a minute, speechless, then suddenly everyone, even the man who had called me a little girl, was clapping. I felt nothing but sheer pride and deep satisfaction. Not only had I done perfectly on my act, but I had proved everyone wrong. I was no longer a little girl. I was a confident young woman.

You may think that being in a circus is spectacular, amazing kooky, tops up crazy, and a one in a life time opportunity but it's really not. Here I'll show you.            Having the opportunity of being in a circus is great but to become you have to sacrifice some of the other dreams that you might have. When I was 9 years old I always dreamed that I will become an international singer and when I was 12 I always wanted to be a nurse.            15 I went to the circus. It was amazing! Ever since I knew I had to be either a fierce lion tamer, a daredevil tight roper, or a legendary trapeze artist. When I told my mom and dad about my dream they were full on with me they paid for ballet lessons, track in field, and swimming lessons.            When I became 19 I signed up for the circus. They put me in a dark room with blue curtains and only one little hole window pouring in dim and dusty light. The employ hit a lever (which I guess was the spotlight) and a bright light the shade of lightning hit my face. Immediately I re-flexed my eyes by shading it with my arm. The employ responded ' Bright eh.' I shook my head. ' Well then wait in tell you meet the boss, he's wonderful!' said the employ sarcastically. He then left the room. I suddenly became very frightened. After 10 minutes a man with a purple, green, and orange tucks and a completely bald head came in. He had a snigger on his face making himself look completely dumb. I couldn't help but laugh a little. The man suddenly shouted out ' WHAT ER YOU LOOKING AT BOZO!' I then saw his big fat pigs belly. I couldn't help but laugh again. He began shouting for an hour strait and than he stopped and became silence. Then he said ' Dance.' I didn't do anything in the shock of how he he just suddenly became dumb. He yelled 'DANCE.' I suddenly caught my train of thought and started doing my most recent and advance ballet moves I knew. When I ended I could see he was not impressed. I suddenly thought that my dream would come to an end. ' The names Gogachi Panini kid.' I stopped thinking where have I heard that name before. I then blurted out ' Oh, you mean from The Great, The Fantisimo, Circus DE Funda!' The man shook his head.            After four years when I was 23 the boss died we a had a special funicular for him. 1,562,349 people came! I couldn't believe that that many people would come. I was the first one to bless and give the boss the gift because I was the youngest person in the circus. It was scary but it helped allot of other people lose there fear.           I then took my bosses place of training and riding the elephants and being the master of ceremonies. It was scary at first but I came very fond of it.       Finaly I became 56 when I was the only member left. Charles the acrobat died 2 years ago, Haily the seal trainer left to go on American Idol, Goggie the trapeze artist died 12 years ago, Holly the entertainer died 8 years ago                         ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,4,2

I do all kinds of gymnastics and contortionist things. I love the circus but today was a scary day.       Today my best friend, Safira Exzlen, slipped off her beam and fell twenty feet down, but to my surprise the trapeze artist, Razic Caztiri, swung and caught her right before she hit the net. I ran towards her and saw that the trapeze coach, Yuri Raztac, was clapping and smiling like it was supposed to happen.       I went up to Safira after practice and asked her what she was doing. She told me that when she fell she meant to and Razic was supposed to catch her. I was a little scared for my friend and didn't want her to get hurt doing this new trick, but every time she does a new trick I worry but it always ends up perfectly fine. I said dasvidanya and left.       That night in my head I started thinking of a daring routine like Safira's. I thought and thought and wrote my thoughts down and finally came up with a greatly daring rouine. I would do a front aerial and then and front walkover and the out of the front walkover front hand spring stepout. I would then go to the end of the beam and put one foot on and one foot off the end and from there a backhandspring stepout into a back aerial.       I then thought of more. I thought, finally in the end, I would jump to a trapeze bar and hang by my knees and they would lower the trapeze and I would be about 15 feet off the ground (which would be a trampoline) and I would do a double backflip and land gracefully and bounce off the trampoline and do a front layout bounce back layout bounce front aerial land in a split finnish.       The next day I planned to tell my coach the next day. I told Tariza Raztac, my coach, the next day about the routine and she loved it. She made me practice every detail on every level of the beam. I practiced it on the line, low, mid, and finally high. I then perfected every thing on the trapeze and trampoline. I was doing grand in the eyes of Tariza by the time of the show. When the mattinee comes in four days I'll be ready to perform it. I am so happy I joined the circus!

It is about a circus with amazing creatures and people.I hope this caught your attention,because this story might be interesting.I wouldn't know myself,because everyone has opinions.Like my picky sister hates butterscotch,and Tavian hates snake because...wait,I'm getting off topic here!Well,this is a story about a 9 year old who goes to a circus and finds out...ARGH!!!I DID IT AGAIN!Ah,well,here's the story.          Once there was a boy named Jordan CrackleMcPickle,who was short for his age with red hair like fire,literally , red as a red crayon.His eyes were green as a green crayon,wait,why do I keep mentioning crayons?Well,I guess they were.He had no freckles,only on Tuesday ,which meant he had freckles on every day except Tuesday,otherwise he had freckles as orange as an orange crayon..I really need to stop doing this!!!He went to 4th grade in Mrs.Izmint's class.                     One day his parents told him they're going to go to Fizzychew Amusing Circus!They caught a taxi to the village of Villageville,where they got snacks,after paying the driver.The 3 walked to Avinew Avenue.There,they found the circus!!!!!It was as purple as a purple crayon [I've got a problem]with gold ribbons!             There was dragon flying acrobats with sparklers flashing colors of the rainbow!Unicorn riders jumped of in a back-flip on a trampoline,into the air and on tightropes,and then onto a trapeze set!People riding on fireworks the color of blue crayons[what is wrong with me and crayons]into the sky when the explode with the people landing on the mattress pile.Dancing trees and talking dogs!Snake that grow giant with one drop of milk!              Jordan loved the show more than crayons[ARGH]and I would too.They even ate all their snacks and took a picture with a unicorn!They took a dragon ride also!They even bought one of the sparklers!When they left,they never forgot that day.

I have to work really hard every perfomances and make sure I don't mess up. Sometimes I have a partner but i usually work alone. I've probably went around the whole world! But it wasn't easy at all!       When I first joined the circus I was not good at all, I mean i could do a few tricks but still i was a rookie. one time when i went up to perform and i fell doing a hard trick. Everyone was laughing at me! I thought i was never going to be an acrobatic again but i practiced more and became way better. After that i relized how careful i had to be. now i always make sure the rope is strong so nothing bad happens.           if you ever want to join the circus you need to make sure you really like it because you are always doing work. i only see my family three times a year but the circus is also my family.You also have to be the perfect fit for your act like if you want to be a clown then you'll have to have good face expessions and don't mind getting a little embarresed.       clearly, Being in the circus is hard and you have to be careful but it is totally worth it.

He lived in a house that was haunted. He said that he could talk to ghost, but no one beleaved him.       It was Friday, The 13th, 1997, The Invisable Man also known as 'Ghost' was walking to school one day. People always made fun of his since he wore a mask the looked like a skeleton, and he had enough. When he was 17 he made a potion that could turn anyone invisable.       The next hour in that day he was invisable no one could see him. So Ghost decides to go outside scaring people. He was the scariest person in New York, so people started to cry and move away from New York.       He once saw the love of his life, her name was Betty.

Mary Jane was a 11 year old girl just getting ready to do her circus performance, she was going to ride on her pet lion and leap over a circle that was on fire. She was nervous every past minute as she watched Johnny Lunar do his performance. Mary had a bad feeling but she couldn't tell if she was just nervous or she thought something bad was going to happen. Mary and Johnny were friends about 3 months when Johnny became a circus performer. he was the same age as Mary that's why they were very close friends. The act that he was doing was very hard because it had a use of fire.           When he lite a match to light the rope for his act, BAM!!!! the place caught on fire. The audience were all panic and couldn't get out because the door way was on fire. Circus performers were leaving from the back door leaving the audience, as Johnny just stood frozen solid. Mary was just about to leave as she looked back and couldn't help but leave without trying to help, so she ran back. She ran around looking for anything too stop the fire as she saw a firestingursher. she took hold of it and blew out the fire from the doorway and yelled out 'run out hurry' so everyone did. Finally firefighters came.              Mary was releaved everyone was safe. As she was walking she saw Johnny and ran to him. They talked about how Mary didn't do her act because of Johnny, but all Mary said was 'as long as everyone's safe it's alright'. A few weeks later Mary got to do her performance. at the end everyone applaused for her as she waved for the crowd.

In the circus you get to jump off diving boards,jump through firing hoops,and more crazy things like that.A lot of people thing the circus it just all crazy stuff and playing,but you actually have to work a lot to become a expert in the circus.       People join then find out they have to do a lot of work to perform on stage.When people find out about how they have to travel a lot they may miss home,but when they are on stage they forget all about it because they are having so much fun.The circus is very hard but when you get on stage all that hard work you have done goes to work and turns all that hard work into fun.

If you are wondering what it is like for me to be in a circus, well I will tell you straight off the bottom of my lip. It is really amazing to be around a big crowed, and seeing them smile. I think thats the best part about being in a circus! Would you ever be interested in being in the circus? Well it takes alot of effort for a person to be in a circus. You have to have strength and balance if you want to acrobat. You have to be brave to be a clown, because your in front of a bunch of people. And tons more, but I am here to tell you what I do.       First, When schools over its time for a quick break. The clowns let me play with ther little unicycles, juggling balls, and also their shoes to act like im big foot. Sometimes I even play with our snake,Cheese; but don't worry the snake won't bite! Then it is time to do the things on my list.       Next, It's time for chores. I feed the snake, groom and feed the horses we use in a act.Then check if my costume is ready for tonights show, and see if every body else has theirs too. Last I check to see if every one has their schedual for tonight. The schedual is for the time their on  and everything they need to know for tonight.        Next, Its dinner time. My friends and I eat dinner outside. We are eating chicken, vegtables, and water. We have to stay strong in our body, so no junk food. We can not eat too much, or when we preform tonight our stomach will hurt. Have you ever had cramps in your stomach after you ate alot and jumped around? I sure have, and I do not want that to happen again!       Last, The show is over. now I am in bed thinking of what is going to happen next in my future to come. Working in a circus isn't so bad, it's actually quite fun to be in. Being in a circus is a busy tough life but I know I can make it around when I am with my friends to support me.

You have to have skills to be in the circus.You also have to have time to be in the circus because the circus takes up a lot of your time.. But, it would be really fun to say '' I am in the circus.'' We travel 20,000 miles in seven months, each year. We also visit 150 cities. I work from sunup to sundown.        So that is the life of person in the circus. It is really fun to be able  to have this opportunity to be in the circus. You should try it someday.You will love it once you start doing it.Well I hope you enjoyed the show.

Actually, my real name is Loupo, not Loupo the magnificent, and I was actually brought here against my will. I am now two years old, and my first show is tonight.   I am supposed to jump through a sieries of rings, follow simple(and stupid) commands  and ride an elephant in circles. The trainers think that they trained a wild cat from Africa, and they think that they did it all on their own. It's actually the animal's choice to be trained. I only did it because I thought they would hurt me if I didn't. It's hard to live when you're afraid of everything. The only good thing that comes out of the circus, is the meat that you don't have to fight for...       I sat in the corner shadows of my cage, in the cart that has LOUPO THE MAGNIFICENT painted in gold all over it. The spectators stuck their hand in my cart to try and touch me. I growled at them, and they cheered. I actually wanted to just get to the show so that no one could touch me.   The trainer pushed through the crowd with a handful of meat in his hand. I groaned. He opened the little trapdoor and threw the meat inside. I sniffed it, and then licked it, then I took it in my mouth. The trainer stood beside my cage and yelled, 'Behold, LOUPO THE MAGNIFICENT!' The crowd cheered so loud that I put my ears back, crouched low to the ground and groweded fiercely at them. They cheered. Ugh.   One by one, they all dispersed. It was now the evening, and I lay down to watch the sunset. That's when the trainer came up to my cage saying, 'Hello Loupo! Who's my little leopard? Yes, you are! You are...'. One day I would run away escape this embarassing talk. He opened the door and said 'Up!' and I got up with a groan. He slipped the noose over my head and 'led' me out.   There was a long line of animals and acrobats waiting to be called into the tent for their turn. The trapeze artists were first, and as the Ring Leader called them in, they danced inside as the crowd clapped. Next were the Poodles and Jack Russel Terriers. They did their part: balancing on balls and jumping rope. Next were the acrobats, and they did tight-rope walking and flying across the cieling. I never cared much for the acrobats, they were always bragging and showing-off and telling everyone what to do and where to go. Then there were the circus horses, then the bears, then the elephants and elephant riders. Then the clowns and dancers, and then there was me.   As the dancers finish their show, the Ring Leader called: 'And now, for the show you've all been waiting for, the wild cat, wrestled from Africa, tussled and trained. The cat that has become a world-wide star! I give you, the marvelous, the magnificent, LOUPO!' That's when the trainer loosened my noose and shoved me into the ring. A clown ran up behind me hollaring, and I did what we rehearsed: Act afraid and run up onto the platform. The crowd cheered. Then the Ring Leader called, 'And now, the magnificent Loupo will perform his first trick: the hoops!' Several clowns pushed up some rings in front of me. I slumped off of the platform and walked through the hoops as they wanted me to. The crowd went wild. Then the Ring leader said, 'Now the magnificent Loupo will follow my every command!' He faced me and said, 'Sit!' So I did as he told. The audience clapped. 'Roll over!' I rolled over. The audience cheered. 'Dance!' I stood up on two legs. The  audience hollared. I felt more pathetic than I ever have been before. Then the Ring Leader said, 'And now, Loupo will achieve the impossible! Loupo will train an elephant!' Then in walked Brophy, the elephant. He did what he was told to do: act wild, act angry. I did what I was told: Growl at him, and pretend to scare him. He did what he was told: Lie down when I growled, and whimper. I did what they wanted me to do: I climbed on his back. He did what they wanted him to do: Stand up and walk in circles. I guess we both felt stupid, but the audience loved it.   When the show was over, I was led back to my cage. I was upset, and angry. About 10 seconds after I lay down, the audience had crowded around my cage. Whooping and Hollaring and sticking their hands in to touch me. This was going to be a long night.   It was about midnight, and everybody had gone back to their trailers, all except the Ring Leader and the trainer. This was their conversation:   Ring Leader: 'So, are you excited?'   Trainer: 'You bet. It's not everyday that you get to train two new leopards.' Ring Leader: 'What are their names again?'   Trainer: 'Ocapoco and Lucapaca. They're going to be in the backround of Loupo. The manager said that the show would bring in more buyers if Loupo had backup.'   Ring Leader: 'But we could barely fit these people in the tent, how are we supposed to fit another thousand?'   Trainer: 'No idea.'   Ring Leader: 'When are they arriving?'   Trainer: 'Tomorrow.'   Ring Leader: 'Oh, well. Good luck.'   Trainer: 'Thanks.' That is how their conversation ended.   Well, the next day there was a lot of buzz. I guessed it was about the two new leopards. Two other cages were attatched to the back of mine, one was painted in silver that said, LUCAPACA THE AMAZING and another blue one that said OCAPOCO THE EXOTIC. The two leopards arrived cowering and bloody.       It took two months for them to heal, they were pretty traumatized. When we first started rehearsing together, it was odd. They wouldn't cooperate and they always would cower behind me whenever someone scared them. I had much pity for them.   In the days that passed there was a lot of disorganization, and it was because of Ocapoco and Lucapaca. Ocapoco got loose, and Lucapaca would snarl at anyone who came near her. I followed their examle with going on strike. First I wouldn't follow any of the trainers commands. Then I would do a Lucapaca and growel anytime someone came near, and I even learned how to open my cage and do an Ocapoco. We went that way for weeks, not once having a show, and Ocapoco and Lucapaca were greatful for my strike. We nearly drove the trainers, acrobats, managers, and advertisers mad by going on strike. As a result, this is what happened:   It was day 47 of our strike, and the trainers were afraid to come feed us, but we just kept our strike flowing. Then one day, the trainers finally gave us some food. We ate it, only to find that there were sleeping pills inside. We slept hard, and when we woke up, we were in crates on a plane. The younger two were scared, and so was I. Then, the trainers opened up the door. They hobbled in, for it was bumpy in the back of the plane. They gave us some more meat, and we were too hungry to even consider that there might be pills inside...idiots. The second time we woke up we were in the same crates, but we were in a car, not a plane. It was hot outside, and the road was bumpy, light streamed in through the few holes in our crates. There was a weird sence of home here, though I could not put my finger on it. Then, the car stopped. Our crates were put on the ground, and they were opened, and I knew exactly where I was: South Africa. I bolted out of the crate and I just kept running, running into the warm sun, running into the long golden grasses of home. I could hear Ocapoco and Lucapoca behind me, but I kept running, I was rinning home.

When I was young...I wanted to be in the circus, so when I was five I did ballet. I ended that when I was 10. When I got home I got out my backpack. My mom, she was coming! What am I going to do? I put my backpack under my bed, the door handel was slowly moving. My mom yelled to me 'Do your homework' I said 'Ok'. I got my backpack out I got everything I needed. At 8:00 my dad said 'bed time'. At 9:30 I got up, I was out the door in a second.       I ran away, I got to the circus tent in town. I told the people 'I want to be in the circus'. They all said 'We do need someone new'. I was in the circus! That morning we left town we were off. I loved all the nature that went bye. We were in the next town in a week. There was a leader his name was Zoco. He asked ' What do you want to be?' I said ' If I could have a job it would be to work and train the elephants and do a horesback trick'. He said ' Ok'. He put us in partners. My partner was Zoozoo. Over the years Zoozoo made me awsome.       I was 13 years old I was very sad I didn't have a family. We were going to my old town I ran once we got their, I looked for the little red house I opened the door and yelled 'Mom, Dad'. They both ran and I showed them I loved them. After that I told them the whole story. The End.        Thank you for the graet time I had. I hope you liked it.

I walk to my trainer and tell her im very nervous.  'You've done this correctly every time we have practiced. You wont mess up I promise.'  My act in the show was a tightrope walker. It took me over 2 months to learn how to tightrope walk wihtout falling off.        I heard my act being accounced. I was the first act.  I walked out slowly and nervously to the tightrope. I walked a little faster.  I wasn't nervous the times we practiced, but now theres an audience and i'm sure ill mess up.  I climbed the ladder leading to the tightrope and waited about 10 seconds. I knew I was going to fall off but i had to try.       I had to remember the good things about walking a tightrope.  There was a net under me so if i fell off i wouldn't get hurt.  I realized i'd been standing at the top of the ladder for about 2 minutes.  I didn't want to keep the audience waiting.  I slowly started walking along the tightrope. My heart was beating very fastly.  I started to get cold chills.       I looked at my trainer.  She looked very nervous and I really didn't want to let her down. I realized I was alittle more nervous about this than I should be.  I started walking confidently along the tight rope. I'd gotten halfway through without falling. I suddenly noticed something in the middle if the tightrope. There was a tear in the middle of the tightrope. I knew if i stepped on it the tightrope would break.       I walked carefully towards it.  I stepped over it thinking it would break. Even though the net was under it, it still kind of hurt when I fell because the net was scratchy.  I walked over the tear in the tightrope and it didn't break. I carefully made it over to the other side. Everyone started cheering and I felt very proud of myself.  I looked at my trainer and she looked very proud too.

In the circus you get to dress funny , like a clown. You can juggle, ride a horse , it doesn't matter just as long as you are having fun doing it.        You may have a special talent. Acrobatics is a great talent to see. people hanging from ropes , chains, even by just hands and feet. Juggling is fun once you get the hang of it. trowing up more than ten thuings in the air is an exciting scene.         Tightroping is thrilling. someone is always scared you will fall , but that generally doesn't happen at the circus.          People will train for months doing these stunts until they get them perfect. Not all stunts have to be of the ground, you can be a clown, ride a horse, be a comedian, or any of those things really.           The circus is fun to see. Don't ever be afraid to chase your dream. If you want to be a clown , be a clown . Whatever you want to be it.

I work from sunup to sundown and I devote myself to become a performer even though I am only 11 years old.                 Every day I wake up a 7:00 A.M. and do what everyone does: brush my teeth and get dressed. Then I go to the pie car for my breakfast of pancakes and bacon. Currently, the crews are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.                  At 9:00 A.M. I go to our circus's one-room schoolhouse to learn. It has everything a school has. For example computers, tests, and report cards. Because my circus travels around the world, I have many performers that speak different languages from me. Our geography lessons come alive when we travel.                    School is over at 3:00 P.M. and I have a short break. The clowns usually allow me to play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I want to have a large pet, but our trailer is too small. Even though I love my life as part of a circus family, I sometimes want to join the swim team. However, we don't stay at one place long enough to.                     After 30 minutes, it's 3:30 P.M. and I have to do my chores and then practice. I feed, water, and groom all the horses. Today, I plan to practicing my tricks with the horses.                     At 6:30, I eat my dinner in the pie car. However, we don't eat much because tonight we are going to perform. We usually do 15 shows in one week.                     After the circus's performance is finished, I flop on to my bed and go to sleep, dreaming about what I am going to perform next. This is my life as a circus performer, and I am proud of it.

I, Josh Camp, would know better. I am a lion tamer in the Kidzworld circus.       Here is my typical week.       Monday:  Wake up and go to the pie car to get breakfast. Then go to the school car. Most of the kids there are from all over the world, but we actually get to learn each other's languages. I currently know Spanish, Korean, Japanese, French, and English. After school I have a little free time, so the clowns let me play on their unicycles, as long as I don't break them. I do this part every day. Then our special Monday performance is what I like. we do our trapeze stunts, the sword-swallowing, and then I come out with Bernard and Fabia, my two lions. We do our famous human/lion totem pole.       Tuesday:  Wake up and go to the pie car for breakfast. Then I do the usual for weekdays: school, play, and practice. Tuesdays aren't my favorite days because I'm stuck with clean-up, but it's actually pretty fun.       Wednesday:  Wake up and go to the pie car for breakfast.Then I do the usual for weekdays. Wednesday is my favorite day of the week, because I get to perform for our normal performance, as well as our Wednesday matinee. Bernard, Fabia, and I do our totem pole, as well as our famous double ring jump.       Thursday:  Wake up and get breakfast. Then the weekday usual. We have one performance, and it's the trapeze performance, so I'm stuck with setup and cleanup.       Friday:  Get up and get breakfast. Then the weekday procedures. We have no performance tonight, so I just relax and enjoy the scenery.       Weekends:  Wake up and get breakfast. We finally have no school, so we get to mess around until about 4:00, when everybody performs three times each day. Once I get home, I'm wiped out and ready for bed.

I am going to talk adout how it s to work at a circus.           First, the people who uses animals in their proformence has to groom the animals. Groom means to clean and brush the animals. If they dont groom yhe animals, they would be stinky. They also have to feed the animals. If they dont feed the animals they woudlnt be able to do their performence because the food gives them the energy they need.            Also, the proformeres have to eat. They eat at the pie car. It has pie, pizza, and ect. If they dont eat a great meal they will be hungry during their proformence. The proformers needs a lot of energy, if they run out of energy they would be tired during their proformence. That is why they have to eat a good meal.             Lastly, when the proformers are done with their proformence, they are wiped out. Wiped out means to be very tired. When they are done with their proformence the go to the pie car to eat because they be so hungry and tired. They have to get up really early in the morning to get ready to go to the Circus. They barly have enough time to get some rest they need.               As you can see, beaing in a Circus is a lot of work. You have to travel 20,000 miles. Some people in the circus are use to it because they probally worked there for 20 years. They have to wake up early in the morning to get to the Circus. If the performers are using animals in their proformence, they have to groom them. If they dont groom the animals they would be stinkyand all. They have to eat  good meal so they wouldnt be hungry during their proformence. They need energy so they dont be wiped out. Circus can be very fun.

Its really fun and not so fun at the same time.Circus performers, get to travel around the world which can be fun and tiring.Some people that work in the circus have fun while others don't.           These are reasons why some people like to work and live in the circus. They  have fun because they get to work with animals.Trainers work with elephants,lions,and chimpanzees.Some tricks they do are somersaulting off a running horse,or leaping from a trampoline onto a horses back.The kids juggle and do acrobatics.They like doing that because its entertaining.Another thing that make people like the circus is because they travel around the world.Traveling around the world gives an opportunity to meet different places and different people.            These are some reasons why some people don't like to work and live in a circus.The circus is a busy and a tough life.They have to wake up early, at seven in the morning, and sleep late.Circus performers work long days and spend a lot of time away from home.On tour, They don't have anywhere to call home.Circus performers, don't see their family that much.They have to work long hours and weekends too.Although for some people the circus is fun, for others its difficult.               As well as the circus performers like and don't like the circus, they can learn new things.When they travel to different places, they get to learn about that place.They learn the culture and the celebrations that place has.This can be an advantage for the circus performers.When the circus performers travel to different places, they can visit their family that lives there.                 Those are some reasons why circus performers like and don't like being in the circus. Just because being a circus performer might seem fun, for others its frustrating and difficult. If the circus performers don't like the circus or if they do, they get to travel and learn new things from different places that they have never seen or been before.

Some people think it is fun to work at the circus, but they don't know it is also difficult.  We asked Ally to tell us about the circus.           In the circus their are clowns, juggling, acrobats, a tightrope walker,and even horses. When you come in a circus you see all these amazing things that you think you want to be in the circus oneday, but what you don't know is that  behind those curtains people are practicing a trying to  do the best to intertain the audience. All of this starts in the morning. 'In the morning everyone gets wakes up gets dress and goes to the pie car to eat breakfast. Then the chidren go school while the parents or adults stay  and practice. In school the children go to school to learn laguages  and to learn  things about the city they are traveling to.'           ' In the afternoon the children get out of school and go to practice and do chores.   Everyone at the circus works really hard and they are trying to do their best preformance every. After practicing they go to have dinner at the pie cart. No one has a big dinner since they are going to preform.          When show time comes the preformers put their outfits on and then the show begins. Once the show begins the magic begins. Everyone  is  quite.'  Ally enjoys preforming in front of people. She always has a smile when she  faces the crowd. When the show is over  she is really tired.          ' The circus  is a very great place ,but it is sometimes hard', says Ally. The circus is always filled with excitment.

I was so excited because I've always wanted to go to the circus because it's cool and fun to watch. My favorite act is the acrobats. I just love the way they spin in ropes.                I went running to my mom and said 'Mom can we go to the circus and watch the fabulous acts.' My mom quickly said yes because she was in a circus when she was young and maybe she would meet one of the people she worked with before. We all got ready hit the car. As soon as we got there, I saw many lights and colors. My dad went to go purchase the tickets while we wait at the door. When we got inside my sister found us front row seats.

I'm here to tell you about the ways of the circus. I'm a stuntman, but that's not close to all the cool stuff    you can do at a circus. The circus is a place where dreams of some come true. Circuses are very fun ,but then the work kickes in.                                                                                                                                               First of all, you must always be focused because you can easily make a mistake. You will travel a ton through the year. In a circus you only get 9hr. of sleep or possibly less. You can also learn different languages from different classmates.                                                                                                                                                                         There are many types of jobs as I said earlier.  For an example acrobats can be something you might like. As I was a kid, I would love to watch the circus's performances. Now I'm what I always wanted to be and anyone, even you can make your dream come true just as I did. You can be a juggler, tight rope walker, clown, animal trainer, a stuntman like me ,but that's not all there is to a circus, there's plenty more to explore!                                                                                                                                                                                 When you come into a circus, be prepared for what awaits you because it's not all that easy, you have to really want it, you have to strive. The challenges ahead will not overcome you, you will overcome it. Take this advise and hit with your best shot!

Do you think its hard walking on a tightrope?Yeah its hard but what would happen if they fall or the rope ripes they could break their back or head and that would be really dangerous.       I always use to think the circus was fun and not dangerous but when i saw what they did i was shocked that takes alot of work to do and time and they have to take alot of risks to do something that hard.Then I tought how cold they do that that lokks so scary and their faces dont even show they are scared.Now lets talk more about the risks it takes to be in a circus.Would you get homesick when you stay somewhere for a month and then left would that be fun.I think it would not be fun.And would you like to eat in a pie car.It would not be fun to get sick and then stay in a trailer all day long.Or travel in a  litle trailer with a big family and be all squished.I woul not like to live like that that would be horible.I am going to tell you a story of a girl,there was a little girl,she was ten,she did not want to be a clown or work in the circus she wanted to be something else but her parents wanted her to work in the circus because it was a tradition she felt bad and said,'I wish i had  a normal family'but she new that would never happen and she decided to work on the circus she was not happy but did not wanted to dissapoint her parents and she said to herself,'When I have kids I am going to let them do whatever they want to work on.'The lesson I just told you is triying to explain that you are lucky to have a normal family.                                     I would really like to work in the circus but it may be hard you have to do the same routine dail.That would be really hard for me would that be hard for you.Would you like to go to a circus school or a normal school.This a story about the crazy life in the circus.

I am a acrobat.I love what i do but let me tell you that it took a lot of hard work and effort to be able to be in the circus.I started when  was young and if you want to be in the circus i recommend that you start when you are young its a lot easier to start your career.   Many people think that being in the circus it all fun &amp; games but it is not.We circus performers work very hard and practice for a very long time.Also because of all the traveling that we do while we are in the circus you don't really have time to  see our family when we have a break we enjoy and treasure it very much.I have to practice my tricks and moves everyday but it is worth it when you get out in the ring or as for me get on the bars and start to move the audience almost seems like its moving with you doing the tricks right beside you.Almost as if the audience is there to catch you if you fall.Like you will always be safe and the sense that you get when you nail a perfect new move!being in the circus is a lot of fun but hard work also.    I started as a dancer we learned lots of flips and tumbling that came in handy when i decided to start gymnastics.I found a love for gymnastics and also found that i was amazing at it i won competitions and could do many different moves.When a circus directer asked me to join i was overwhelmed with happiness,but my family didn't agree.It took a lot of hard work but i finally got them to agree.Now my family is very supportive of what i do,and i will always treasure them because if it weren't for them i wouldn't be here doing what i love and it took a lot of courage in your daughter to let her move away forever so she could fill her dreams.

Though circus life can be hard and tough, it is fun at the same time.                             A day at the circus is very tiring. I work all day with the rest of the people in the circus. Every week, I perform 10 times. Due to this, I practice and practice. One upside about working in a circus is you get to travel to many different places you have never been to before. The circus gives many people an opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many different people. There are many good things about working in circus but there are many bad things as well.                                           Though many people think that working in a circus is easy, working in the circus is really not all fun and games. You have to work long days and you don't really spend too much time with your family. You can't call home either because it all just comes back to the fact you don't have much time. Before you join a circus you might want to think about the very fact that you will be away from your family.                                  There are many things to think about before you join a circus. It's not as easy as you think it is.  Would you like to go to school in a moving vehicle? Well, if you work in a circus you will work in a one-room schoolhouse. It's like any ordinary school, with computers, tests, and report cards, it's just that you will be in a cramped place, studying. After school, it's break time. But that's the only free time you will have for the rest of your day. Then, I usually go straight to chores and practice for the show I will do at night. Finally, it's show time for me. Though I am really scared I am happy at the same time. I tried my very best and now the show is over. I am tired and ready to go to bed.                                 I think that working in acircus can be hard but it is very fun at the same time. I put a lot of thought into joining the circus, and now I think I made a fairly wise decision. Though I sometimes feel that working in the circus is very tough, I really enjoy it.

I am exhausted because I had to handle the animals. This is usual for me because I work in the circus and the circus life is crazy. I went back to the trailer which we live in. We are on our way to Chicago for our next show. It is 9 AM right now so it is school time. In the circus, the school is the same as any other school. Now, I have a quick break so I go to where the animals are. I play with Bubbles, our chimpanzee. I have to go and work with the animals, now that the break is over.         I went to see Bubbles but she wasn't there. I panicked, I searched everywhere but I could not find her. I had to talk to my boss but when I did I was surprised because he was not mad at me. He said that this has happened before and that he was pretty sure where she was. I followed him and he took me under the trailer where I saw a hole that I had not noticed before. When we looked into the hole she was not there. My boss was speechless, this was his prize monkey and now it was gone. He said that if I don't find out where she was he would fire me. After he went back to his office, I went to my bed and thought hard. Where could she be? I asked myself.       When I went back to the animal tent, I found a note that I hadn't noticed before in Bubble's cage. It said that I had to pay 80,000 dollars if I ever wanted to have Bubbles back. I told the manager abot this and he called the police. The police found fingerprints on  the note and found out it belonged to the former animal handler which I replaced. My boss said that the former animal handler was mean to the animals and was greedy so he fired him. Also, he wanted revenge against me because he thought of me as an enemy. When I was in the university, I was the best at everything and he was second best. He always tried to be first but I always did something creative. I kind of remember him but its been a long time.       Once the police got his address they put him in jail for theft. We had a celebration after our show to honor me for finding Bubbles, our star. Every month I went to talk to the former animal handler and soon we became friends.

I'n just about to tell you why!            One reason I like woking in the circus is becuase of everything I get to see. Since the cirus I work in travels global, I have been to nearly every part of the world. Just think about it. One week, I wake up in the Niagra falls and then next week I am in Manhattan! I have also seen all the seven wonders of the world.            Another reason why I love the circus I live in so many unique places such as Austrlia, India, China, Costa Rica, Rio de Ja&ntilde;ero, Africa! I see new animals, places, and I meet new people. I bet you don't get to do that!            Some people ask me, ' Aren't you afraid of falling of that high tight-rope?' Well, actually, once you develope the balance, Tight-rope walking is like riding a bike. And it is super fun to walk high up and look at everybody watching me below.

Being a circus tight rope man is very exciting.                The good part about being a tight rope man is that you get to have a lot of hard tricks and you get to stay with your family. The food is your choice. You can see your neighbors and watch them do amazing tricks. No need to go all the way to a circus to see everyone. You are getting the behind the scenes look that no one else gets except the other circus people and the manager. I went to the second show and I was about to fall of the tight rope, but the people cheering me on were encouraging me. 'It is not over until the crowd stops cheering' is what I say. The encouragement is good to persevere you, but it is risky. This is my daily schedule ten shows a week. It is trying, but it is worth the loud cheering for me. I hope you can join too.

I first started off as a baton thrower. Now in the present I am 17 and an acrobat. Life in the circus is tiring. You need to wake up really early, Then you need to start practicing for the next show. We practice from the time we wake up until lunch then, after lunch we practice more. Once its dinnertime and dinner is finished we wait until the next show. Around 7 o'clock we crowd in to the circus tent. The clowns paint there faces, the baton throwers get there batons, The acrobats do warm ups and the lion tamers get there lions. By 8 o'clock we're ready to start the show. We walk into the clearing and we look at the happy faced audience and we all smile for there gratitude.                 'ALL UP!' The lion tamers yells as all of his lions stand up. The lions gather in a circle.                 'READY!' The lions wait for the Que. The lion tamer throws a ball in and the lions bounce it to each other. One little rebel of a lion decides to sneak off. The crowd gasps in horror as the lion starts to walk the tightrope.                 'SOMEBODY SAVE THE POOR LITTLE LION!' A little girl from the crowd screams. All of us turn around to see the little lion struggling to get across. Peter our tightrope walker jumps on our super-duper-bouncy-jiggly trampoline he lands on the tightrope. He pushes the lion off of the tightrope to the trampoline. The lion is safe! Everyone sighs letting there stress be relived.                   We continue our show the tightrope walker started walking on the tightrope. The baton thrower did there skit.                  It came time for me to do my skit. I started to do the acrobats but I failed. I started to fall and I thought of a quick plan.                     'I NEED A TRAMPOLINE!' The lion tamer heard me and put a trampoline on the bottom of me. I dropped on the trampoline safely.                      By the time the show ended it was 10 o'clock and I was tired. I lay my head on my pillow and dazed off into a endless sleep. I had a dream of the show awaiting tomorrow.

They all loved each other the same.Then one day they saw a banner that said, '' Circus in town, See it Today!''.Then they knew at once they had to see it.Then there was one problem.Biaunca was afriad of clowns!They tried to make her over come it by having a clown come to their house.She didn't come out of her room.Then when she came out they told her how nice they were by having it give Kiauna and Tiaunna a flower and it worked.I did n't sleep over because I don't like clowns.           While the others were geting dressed Tiaunna and Kiaunna and I snuck into the circus to see the training.We saw acrobats,lions,leopards,and the ringleader.We saw how tough it was to be be in a circus and went back home.While we were walking home we saw a banner that said the show wasn't until the next day..When we came back to the house they got dressed but told them the news.They just shrugged put on a movie at some candy, icecream ,and popcorn and went to sleep.           The next morning we woke up and at breakfast.The show didn't start until 5:00 P.M.We had seven hours to spare so we went shopping,bought fast food,went to the park, babysat our baby cousin Cayleigh down the street, and finally it was 4:00.At 4:30 we first dressed their baby cousin then ourselves.We were all ready at 4:50 and went to the circus. We got lemonade, hot dogs, ice cream, popcorn, and candy.           Since we were a little early they got to meet some of the people before they did their acts.They even took many pictures with them.They got to ride an elephant too.By then it was time to get our seats.Before we went offstage the teams told us to come back after the show to spend more time with them and we said 'okay'.       The acts were more than what they expected.They saw the lion do tricks,the acrobats doing things they never seen not even a gymnast do,they saw clowns on unicycles and more.At the end they did something really special they never did before.Even I Jayia saw it myself because I was there.They told us to come on stage during the show and they said it really loud!We ended up doing a magic trick that we didn't even attempt to do.At the end of the show we thanked them a lot and hoped to see them again.Then I came up with a good idea!I told them,''come to the pool with us tomorrow'' and gave them the address.The next day thay showed up and we all had fun.When we came in the house we went on the computer and saw our pictures online to the world,then we turned on the t.v and were on the news!

So he made a museum for the rich people it worked out good for the owner. He was happy.                  It worked out good for me and the owner. The owner was a boy. His name is Carlos.

Also you could be acrobat which is when you are swinging back and fourth on this thing and you have swich rope with another person but you have swing on the rope and do a trick.Then you swich in mid air. You also need to have a lot of practice you just cant walk in a circus and do a show and make your performance come out perfect.                                                                                                                                                You need a lot of practice because if your a acrobat and you have no practice and your in a show and you mess up a lot and next time that many people will come or maybe no one will come.And you also need school because you travel around the world and you need to speak diffrent launguages. Because if you just speak english chinese people wont understand you.You also need school to know how dangerous the circus is because what  if the circus animals get out of control you could die.Also if your acircus tightrope walker you could fall off and you can break your head and die because of how high you   are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is what i was going to tell you guys so if you join the circus remember all these things.So see you in the big city if you become famous because you might become famous because this will give you good advice on what to do in the circus.Oh and i forgot to tell you never be afraid and alwalys try your best in whatever they put you to do so good bye and good luck.

I have two teachers thier names are Mrs.Kirby and Mr.Jordan.I love to go to school to get an good education so I can go to an university or college as long as I am in school while im in my teen years.                                 If I had a mother and a father that were circus people that means that would like to attend the circus and  acually took place in one or even live in one it would take practice and we propbably would never get to have family time like go to the mall and go to a fancy resurant and eat out.                                     I would not certainly want to live in a trailer either because a house is much bigger and can hold heavier things like the bed, dresser, oven, dryer and all of those good things would maybe make the tires of a trailer burst and also a some houses do and do not have wheels on them.

I joined the circus when I was 3 years old, I get to do acrobatics. When I first started being an acrobate I just did flips and cart-wheels but now that I am 15 years old I get to do all sorts of things, in my latest act I swung off the pole did a triple back flip and landed ontop of a matress straped to an elephant! Ok maybe it was just the net but the elephant would be way cooler. Oh and sometimes I get to help the sorwd thrower by being put on a spinning wheel and have knives thrown at me! It really gets your blood going not to mention your stumache turning! My mom and dad are the owners of the circus so I get to see them every day, unlike the other circus performers who miss their familys a lot. My best friend Lilly is in the circus too we get to do some of our acts together. But I feel bad for Lilly because she doesn't always get to see her family, but we kind of took her in as a family member.            Life in the circus is hard work, practiceing every day 12 shows a week! Not to mention still having to go to school. Sometimes I wish I just had a normal life and didn't have to work so hard. My little brother Tiger or Ty is what I call him wants to be a clown so he's always doing things to make people laugh. One advantage to living the circus life is being able to vist a these cool places like France, Rome, America, Cuba, and all sorts of places. I love the cirus life and I wouldn't give it up for anything.

Then if you like training animals such as lions, leopards, and elaphants then you should by a pet like a dog.Then youshould train it, and then you could start with different animals.               Living in a circus life could be different. First you will learn new things such as, walking on a rope, acrobats, juggling,and training animals to do tricks. Then you will ride to different places to perform.Then you perform 10 times a week.You might like working with clowns, because you learn new things. Finally you might hate working with the clowns because you will have to ride tons of miles just to do a performance.                There are many things to do when you are working with clowns.

When you get back from school relax. Next, do the chores and practice. Now it is dinnertime. Finally the show is over and I feel so tired I also wonder if I will ever be a performer like my parents.                  In the morning I wake up and get dressed. Then I go to the pie car. We call it a pie car because clowns love pie for food and to throw at people so that is why we call it a pie car. We eat pancakes and bacon. Mean while the crew is getting ready for tonight show.                  Next, it is school time! We have a room for school in a one- room schoolhouse. Our school has  computers, tests, and report cards. The kids in the class speak all kinds of languages because they are from all around the world. Our geography lessons come alive.                   School is over. Now I take a quick break. We get to play with the materials that the clowns use. I also can play with my puppy Candy. She is a poodle because they do not allow big dogs.                     Chores and practice. I feed, water, and broom the horses. Today,  my father will practice siome somersaulting off a running horse. I am working on leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back it takes balance and concentration.

And my name is Bob Perez and i am a Acrobat in a Circus.                              You have to practice a lot in a Circus like an Acrobat. It takes a lot of work to be in a Circus. Almost every single day you have to practice being in a Circus. Like practicing how to train a lion, juggling, being on top of a elephant, and doing acrobatics. And you have to do all of that on a stage in front of a lot of people.                                 Once you practice you have to go through every step. Like first jump on a trampaling then on the pole and then the other pole. And once you perform in a Circus you have to memorize everything that you have done while practicing. And sometimes they put it on T.V. so you have to really trie your best. And sometimes you have to do more shows after that and after the first show you have to practice even more until the second show starts.                                    And in the second show you have to do a lot of different moves. So you have to try your best on both of these shows.

Then you would make sure the animals aren't sick and make sure there cages are clean and if they aren't well you have to clean it up. Then you would get dressed and put everything up like the bleachers the tight rope and the ladder pool beach ball and put out the rest of the equipment.Then collect the tickets and let people inside then when everybody has took there seat you would have to get the animals and have the show.

You will see things that you have never seen before. When you go to a circus there is only one thing you need to look out for. Having two much fun! I will tell you the story of how the circus is brought to life. I will tell you about the Setup, The Clowns, and what a show is like.               Our setup here at the circus is very interesting.We live in vans with about two other members of the circus. In all we have about two hundred members in all. On a normal year we have one hundred vans! Inside the van's are two bedrooms, one bathroom, a TV room and a couch, oh don't forget the kitchen. Our meals normally are things that you can put in the microwave. Sometimes if we are lucky we get to go out. The animals sleep in their cages. We have a special place for all the cages so none of the animals get taken away. When you take a overview picture you will see a place for all the vans. A huge amount of animal cages. One mini house that contains some bathrooms. Five mini food stands and then the circus. The color of the circus is red and white. The pattern is like swirls. We are known as the BIG APPLE CIRCUS.              The clowns are the main attractions. That is because we put so much time and effort in to them. When the clowns get out of bed the first thing they do is walk to the costume designing van. ?When they get here the costume designer makes sure that they get the worst clothes to mach. This makes them look really odd. Finally there bow tie with sparkles tops everything. When they have all of that they walk over to the hair designer. The hair designer gives them a very wacky wig and a very bright hat to top their head. When this is all done they have one more trip to make. The face painter! Our face painter gets all of their face red, then white, then a big red button for their nose. Finally they get to put on there gloves to show that they are ready to show off there skills.   Finally it is time for the show. Get the clowns ready, get the horses yapping and let the show begin. 'Welcome to the circus! As the lights start to dim backstage is a tsunami waiting to irrupt. Finally the irrupt explodes and the actors do what they do. The clowns are falling on their backsides and the acrobats jump all over the sky. The juggler juggles bananas on fire. Horses cantering all around. This is the BIG APPLE CIRCUS. Memories that i will always remember is the day i was in the circus. A clowns job is always to tell stories that are funny to the mind but all I want to tell you today is that great things happen even when you do not expect them to happen.         The circus is an amazing place and i hope you enjoy the experience one day two.

Bella's parents are in the circus along with her being in the circus involves time,   dedication,talent,flexibility and luck.              The circus has things like...  tight rope walkers,Clowns,acrobats,Circus horse acts   and Circus animals! The Circus is where Bella works and she sees people from over   ten shows a week.Being on the road with a circus can have some downs too.You   only get to see your family outside of the Circus when you are in the city they live   in or take time off. Also you work on the weekend and train on the weekend too!                    At the end of the day you are wiped out but it is all worth it because now everyone your the person who jumped on a horses back! And you gave that thought to all   the kids who came to see the show. The circus is fun to see hard to perform  but amazing all together.

I will tell you.           The first thing you need to know is dancing. I know its a circus but dancing is an important factor. You need to learn how to do certain dances. These will help you in your performance.           You need to learn how to unicycle as well. It takes balance because your on one wheel but once you got it you got it. You then need to learn how to juggle. This is a hard process but you have to be able to throw the balls in the air and catch continuing this process while on the unicicle and you have to know where the ball is so you cant look down.

'No,actually i just finished.'Her answer didn`t surprise me;she tends to get up at 6:30 in the morning.   When I finished my breakfast,I checked the time;7:50.Just in time to see    the tiger.When the train started to come to a stop;I got up so fast I nearly tripped over my footing.I loved helping set up,but I really wanted to see the tiger.I ran outside when the train came to a final stop and caught up to Mauricio.When I opened my mouth to say something he stopped and said in his italian accent'I already told you could come,you don`t have to keep asking!'.I blushed.I knew what he was talking about; lastnight,I`d begged him halfway to death to let me come.Finally after two and a half hours of saying please,pretty please,please with a cherry on top(I have a record for holding my breath)he`d said yes right when my voice started to get sqeaky.'I was just going to say good morning but yeah that works too'I told him.'I`m just going to get my backpack and i`m ready'I told him'O.K, I`ll see you at the train stop'he replied.I nodded and ran to my train cart to get my phone(pictures),wallet(you never know when there might be something pretty on sale),and my backpack.I rode Blackjack;one of our horses(my favorite one in particular)and rode off to the train station.   When Maurico and  his assistants came I told them 'Finally!'   I had been waiting for forty-five minutes.I had been jumping from excitement,or maybe just ten cups of coffee pimps me up a little.Ross;one of Mauricio`s assistants rolled his eys at my exitement, but i just ignored him.We made our way to buy the tiger.When we got to the other circus manager him,Mauricio,and his assistants all went inside this big room to talk leaving me alone in the hallway.When Ross finally came out he told me we had to wait but the deal was done.The other assistant came out to tell us that we should go to camp,it was going to take a while.We got our horses and rode off to camp.When we got back the whole camp was set up so i just went insiide and read a book.three hours later;it was time for the show and mauricio and the tiger still weren`t back.I went backstage to get ready.         After I finished putting on my make up and changed into my circus clothes I heard Mauricio`s voice on speaker for the introduction.It was my turn.I got behind the curtain and got on Blackjack.Once we did our performance;which was riding Blackjack through flaming hoops,no biggie.we went around the back and watched from the audience.The acrobats show was amazing.Shannon and Isabel had learned new tricks.the tightrope act was kinda tricky at first but he got the hang of it.It was time for the tiger act.the white tiger galloped out there and did all these amazing stunts you couldn`t think were possible for a tiger.It did the craziest of things and listened and obeyed Mauricio`s every command             After a while we went to sleep.You would think that after seeing a tiger you couldn`t fall of sleep .I think i beat that statement easily.

I have been studying it ever sense. Whenever the circus is in town i always beg my mom i want to go but, we couldn't go because we didn't have the money. When i was six years old i started to watch videos of the circus. I started to get more and more into it.   In one video i saw people bending and twisting no other humans can bend! I was very amused.So I started to give it a try. I practiced and practiced until i can do it. One day later, i finally did it! I can be flexible.                         One day, i was watching TV then my mom came in with a big smile on her face. she said that we had enough money to go to the circus. Then, i started to have a big smile on my face. I jumped up and down, up and down, till i got dizzy. My mom said more . She said that we have tickets and our own show! The smile on my face got bigger. I also said how many people can we take? My mom said we can take the whole family. 'One ticket for me, one for you , one for your father, one for your sister , and one for your brother'. 'So i bought five tickets'. I began to do cartwheels all around the room. I don't think i can go to sleep tonight.                         I told my brother and my sister about what happened, and they got really exited too. Tomorrow is going to be the best day ever! At night, i started to do a back flip and a front flip. My mom came into the room rubbing her eyes and said 'go to sleep young lady'! I hopped into bed and pretend to go to sleep. When my mom exited the room, and i started to do flips again. In the morning, i started to get dressed and eat my breakfest. So did my brother and sister. We were all ready to go to the circus. When everyone was ready we all went to the car and drove to the circus.                                                                                                                               By the time we got there i saw a lot of people in line to go to the circus. We had to wait a long time to get in front of the line. When we got in all of the circus people were going nuts. I asked one clown what was going on and he said 'our flexible person is sick! We don't have backup'! Then i said'no the show must go on'.'But h-how are we going to do that'? the clown said. 'I saw videos of people being flexible in the circus, i started doing it and i mastered it perfectly'. The clown said 'great, we'll put you in a costume then. The show must go on'! He grabbed my arm and pulled me back stage. There were a lot of people crowding around me. They put an itchy costume on me then, they put me in line.'i don't think i can do this any more'. 'Oh relax you will be fine' the clown said. I gulped and tried to calm down.                                                                                                     Everyone was lining up behind me, then a guy was on the stage saying 'who's ready to see our amazing bender'. Everyone cheered. Then the clown said 'that's your cue'. I gulped again and walked up to the stage. I saw thousands of eyes looking at me. I pretended that i was alone, and started doing tricks that everyone couldn't do. Everyone oohed and aah-ed, then the guy came up to the stage and said 'let's give it up to the amazing bender everybody'. Everyone clapped and cheered. I walked up back stage and saw my family and the circus people smiling my mom hugged me and said that i did a great job. When the show was over the guy walked up to me and said ' hi my name is Bill, i think some day you are going to join the circus'. 'ya' i said. I looked at the stage one more time and said 'some day'.

We had been on the train for five hours, so I figured we were getting close. I looked around, watching all the other acrobats and clowns practicing their tricks. I was about to get up, but my feet were so sore from walking that skinny tightrope, that I decided to just rest.          My name is Alexis Bone and I am a tightrope walker. For many kids, I have the dream job, but it is not all you think it would be. I'm talking about long days, late nights, and being away from home. I figured that it was all worth it when I got named 'Best Tightrope Walker in America' at just age eleven. I was excited for our biggest performence of the year, but nervous too. I looked out the window- we were there.         It was 5:00 P.M. The show starts at six. Our crew works on the finishing touches while I warm up. I looked at the clock- six. I started to hear the familiar voice of our ringmaster, Mr. Brian O'Haris.   ' Hello, and welcome to... Circus Sundown!!!'   His voice boomed throughout the large tent. First up was the acrobats. Next were all the clowns and animals. Finally it was the trappeze people and me.          I decided to rest my feet and watch the performences through the T.V. backstage. I watched the acrobats do their amazing stunts, I watched The clowns riding in the small car next to the huge elephants, and when I saw the trappeze people coming out, I stood just behind the entrance, waiting for my cue.         I saw my cue to start climbing up the tall ladder in the back of the tent that leades to the tightrope. When I got up to the top, I felt like I was going to be sick. My nerves went crazy as I heard my final cue.         I stepped onto my platform- the crowd went crazy! That made me feel a little better, but when the music stopped, I went back into fully terrified mode. I stepped on the wire, scrunched my feet, and began. I tried to look confident as I started to make my way across the wire. I was focusing so hard on not falling, I didn't notice that I was done. I threw my hands up and bowed. The crowd went crazy as they gave me a standing ovation.

Well I can say yes to all of those questions! My name is Rachel Dolphie Loveer and I'm here to talk about being an acrobatic in the circus and what life is like in a circus. Just to begin let me say it is an exciting, amazing, but incredibly hard job. You have to practice, practice, practice every day. But when you get into the ring every minute you spent practicing is worth it. The crowd cheers and all you see is the smiling faces all around you.                                                                              After I wake up and eat my breakfast its all about school and acrobats for me and my family. First I learn regular things like you and then I practice. Then after a half an hour of 'backbending' work its time for a stretch-break. At  4:00 p.m its more practicing for me with multiple water breaks in between. Then at 7:30 its show time!              Everyone goes into the backstage tent as our director tells about our circus. After two hours of a light show-time practice its my turn to shine. Verso, our circus director, says, 'And now for our youngest little acrobatic! Who, at age 13, can do more than her father, Marcos! I introduce to you Rachel Dolphie Loveer!' I cartwheel out and twist and turn in the air as I jump into center stage. I lift my head to a squealing baby girl in the front row. She breaks into a wide smile as I climb into the air before twisting, turning, and swinging everywhere. I jump and spin like no other while still being the most graceful acrobatic in the ring. This is what the circus is all about to me.               Then I bow to the audience as they clap, whistle, and shout my name at me. I back bend slowly then walk out on my hands to enthusiastic applause. My family pats me on the back as soon as I'm in the backstage tent. I hear everyone telling me how amazing I was as I smile, hug, and high-five my family. The circus is the best place in the world for me at this moment.                I would give up everything to be right here everyday. And I am! My life is perfect in this moment right here. This is my circus life! I watch as everyone does there acts while congratulating everyone who finishes. After a few more hours the circus is finished. I settle into bed at 12:00 a.m. but that's alright. I did amazing at the show and that's all that matters. Tomorrow it will start again until I'm to old to bend so well. But that doesn't matter right now. Because I'm in the circus, and this is my life.

As said from Bella Castini and Philippa Hayball, the circus life is difficult and can't be done by just anyone.  There's many things to do like practice or fit in a good meal, and then there's getting started with it all.                 When ever you feel like joining the circus, you must remember some important things first.    The circus is not just a huge playground with an audience all the time.  You've got to travel very far distances from home all over the world, sometimes even 20,000 miles in seven months each and every year could be your life.  Hopefully you know different languages.  The day is work from when the sun goes up to when the sun sets down.  There's also the getting in part of the circus.  You must have a specific talent to join, and you must be good at it.  When you get in, the day seems very long, if you are a child, don't think you've just avoided school for the rest of your life.  It may not be exactly the same, but you still have tests, report cards, computers and everything a regular school needs.  When you're ready, it's time for the show, remember, you have at least until late in the night for relaxation, practice, and food.  The way the circus works is tough so you should be ready for a whole different turn in your life.                                          Now, the life of a carney in the circus is insane.  You wake up early then head to get breakfast.  For the kids, it's school time right after.  You must be able to memorize languages from all over the world.  The classmates you have could be from France or Italy and still not speak your language.  Even though you have a busy day, you still get tests and report cards.  As soon as the school is over you might have time for a short break, but then it's off to practice.  Oh, and don't think yo have no chores any longer!  You then get dinner and then it's off to the show.  As soon as the show is over you may just want to crawl into bed.  You get about 7 hours of sleep, maybe that is.  Your usual bed time is around 12:00 A.M. The life of a carney is crazy and tiring.                                 The talents you need must be very different and unusual.  There's singing, dancing, and being amazingly flexible.  You could be an acrobat or perhaps a trapeze artist, maybe a clown or a juggler, there's the job of a tightrope walker as well.  You may have wanted to be a performer your entire life or you have just gotten sick of your regular life and wanted to do more.  Some people have been doing performing for years.  Like doing gymnastics, music, or acting as a starter.  Philippa Hayball said, 'When I was 11, I knew I wanted to be a performer, so I went for it.'  One talent that every carney should have is concentration.  You need to put your heart in it throughout everything.  As a carney, you have the priorities of being in the circus.  You need to have the talent they have every day to be in the circus.                     If you ask anybody who lives in the circus, they will tell you their is and upside and a downside to the package of the circus.  The upside includes the chance to travel around the world.  You may be able to make new friends too.  Everyone you meet can become your family.  The thrill itself of performing for a live audience is amazing.  Their job is to play and have fun every night.  They see it as a pleasure to have our faces be filled with such joy that is so unexplainable to anyone.  The audience is almost taken to whole different world.  Sadly, there is a downside to the job of a circus performer.  The fun and games has an end at some point.  Even though it's a glamorous lifestyle, there are drawbacks.  There's nowhere you can really call home and that can really enter the mind during a night's show.  Some miss their own gardens and pets and family.  Truly but sadly, they don't often see their family.  Plus, the work is so tiring during the long hours of the days, even weekends.  The upsides can be great, but the downside can be most unpleasant with the life of a carney.                      The life of a circus performer is like living in a, well, circus.  Crazy, wild, fun, but also sad.  Philippa Haybal and Bella Castini have their experiences with the circus.  It can't be easy all the time and there is the day when you just can't do a thing.  They have said that when you're in the circus, your whole life begins to change.

Jumping over rings of fire to clowns juggling on a unicycles it made them look bewildered. So one of the people in the group decided that they should join the circus. They ended up becoming performers and were sent straight to work.       First, One of the people in the group loved animals and signed up to be a animal trainer. So when she got to her area she realized she saw a sign labeled Lions  and on a little table there was a whip and some meat for the lion. She crept inside feeling very terrified that there was one large lion just sitting there looking very hungry. As the girl crept up to the lion it began to growl  and then roar. Quickly the girl whipped the lion and it crawled to the corner looking very angered because he was  whipped and it stared at the meat for a long time until the girl gave him some. after that they started doing a lot of tricks.       Next, the tallest of the group and he oldest decided he wanted to tightrope walk. All he had to do was cross the tightrope and he would be done for the day.when he got on he made it thirteen steps until he fell then the next was fourteen steps and then fifteen steps and then he finally did it he passed the twenty step tightrope and collapsed on the ground do to him being extremely tired and after he climbed down the ladder he rested on the ground.       Then, the next person who was the youngest in the group joined acrobatics when he jumped he missed the rope and broke his arm. After the ambulance came for and put on his cast he came back because he didn't want to miss the matinee and once it was his turn to jump he sprinted and then jumped but this time he didn't miss the jump and he started becoming known as 'one arm'.       Finally, The group walked back to the pie car after the show and talked about what they did. The girl talked about the lion and the oldest talked about the tightrope and the youngest talked about his acrobatic accident. After they thought about they realized that they all faced their fears.       When the whent to sleep they all thought of their journeys and what they did not realizing that they had another big day ahead but none of them cared they only wanted rest.

Living in a circus life can be  very tuff sometimes you have to do dangoures stuff,  like going on a rope and trying to cross it or jumping through a ring of fire.           If you are in the circus you have to be willing to give up time to practice, work on tricks, and even travling.          You may think that a circus life is easy but you have alot of responsibilites being in the circus you have to make sure you don't get hurt and make sure you don't hurt anybody else.         A circus life is fun being with your clown friends but it isn't so fun when you have to practice but that's a part about being in the circus you have to practice, if you want to acomplish something you have to practice they didn't get that good by just watching somebody do it they practiced it.     They have to travel places all the time for shows, they have to make riscay disions, and live in a trailer.          You have to study to get tricks.    Being in a circus isn't all high-flying fun and games and clowning around but it's more glamorous than being a accountant.        Circus people don't get to see there familes as much as we do because they are always on the road   you have to do alot of hard work.  Circus people are amazing.

I mean, I should know because I, Sarah Newton, am a circus performer.  I do many things in the circus.  For example, I'm a tight-rope walker, and I am wonderful at acrobatics, which is a wonderful combination. Would you like to here about my life in the circus? Well then sit down and listen, because it's a long story.      A morning at a circus is hectic for me. I have to go over my routine with my partner, and my solo routine. I must help to set up the tents and a few rides so that the circus is ready for you. It is hard work but it's all worth it to go on stage and perform! It is amazing to know all of the people that I know; in the circus people have many different personalities, but we all have one thing in common, we are very, very, very daring. There is a swordsman, Richard, who puts a sword down their throat and doesn't feel a thing! There is also someone, whose name is Jacquelin, lays on a bed of nails and it doesn't even faze her! My partner in acrobatics is Christopher, and he is very charming, but sometimes when we practice, he acts like he's going to drop me. Those times are quite frightening, but I now know when he is fooling around.      An afternoon at a circus is nerve-racking and exciting! I do my stunts with Christopher (hanging upside-down is plenty of fun) , do my solo in ballet with a mixture and pop, and watch the other amazing performances. I am everything at once when the circus performance of that day is over, I am exhausted, excited, happy, and sad that the show is over. Many people congratulate me, and I them. It always is a WONDERFUL day!      At night a crawl under my sheets and blankets and think about what tomorrows show will have in store, and where we'll be in a week or so; there is always one last thing that I always think before drifting off to sleep though:                                                           Circus life is wonderful, fun, and tough.

Like 7:00 they did a show at night . At 3:00 the clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls.At 3:30 trainers worked with elephants, lions, and chipmanzees. At 6:30 they did anthor show at night they do 10 shows a week.                   I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration. other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics.Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.                   10:00  the show is over I'm  tired and wiped out from the show. when walking back to our trailer,we pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables,and trailers. Two days from now, we all set up in another town.               12:00 in bed i'm thinking about the end of our touring season. When I grow up, will I still be a circus performer like my parents? Who knows? The circus is fun, but it's a busy and tough life.           not just anyone can go andjoin the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist.

My parents vanished and I had heard really bad things about the orphanage. Just like what most kids would do I ran away to join the circus. My name was Angelina, but I was worried the police would find me and put me in the orphanage. So I changed my name to Taylor. I found a circus that was heading out of my town. They let me come along but only said maybe when I asked if I could join their circus. Soon I got to know some of the other circus kids. There was a little red haired boy whose name was Jimmy, there was the acrobat, Lea who was 15 and really nice, and then there was the Grinto triplets they were a fun group of little girls, their names were Jenna, Joy, and Janelle. I was new to the show and had to practice hard. I stayed with Lea who was also a runaway, soon she seemed like a big sister to me. We had shows every day and it was really tiring. The circus was soon like my new family. I was training to be an acrobat like Lea. Soon I was ready and got to perform with Lea for the first time.              I forgot about my life before the Clover Circus and my troubles before the circus too, until it was time to pack up and leave for the two month break between seasons. Where could I go? Lea and I both had no where to go. We wandered around the town together. But then we saw it, the miracle we needed. We went to the door of a building that said,' Do you need a home for a little while or some one who can take care of you. That's me, Miss Peps and my crew.' Taylor and Lea had found their stop. They rang the bell and sure enough there was a nice looking young lady with some small children beside her. They were welcomed inside and then explained their situation. The two girls were given a room to share and were graciously welcomed into the household. Soon enough our two month break was over and back to the circus we went. We re-trained and went back to performing. One day we were ready to perform but Lea was not in the prep area practicing. I knew something was wrong. I hurried to our trailer only to find Lea lying in her bed. I looked at her and I could just tell she was very ill. I told the rest of the cast and crew who imitiatly called a doctor.             I did the show without Lea but it wasn't the same. Lea had been in bed for days before we found her sickness. She had the Mario sickness which could be deadly and was rarely cure-able. The doctor gave his medicines and the nurse tried her remedies but Lea did not get any better. By now she had been sick for three months. I was very worried indeed. The doctor said that Lea's case was very hard. She was inching closer to possible death each day. She was moved to a hospital where she was tested and treated some more. One day she got a call from the hospital but she was so worried that it was bad to pick it up. She weeped and weeped thinking that the call had been because of Lea's passing. Then Jimmy knocked on the trailer door and then quickly came in. 'What are you so sad about Taylor?' 'I thought you would be exited to know that Lea is recovering.' 'What?' Asked Taylor. 'Yeah, her sickness was cured.' Sure enough about a week later Lea came home.             Our show went back to normal and Lea and I stuck together. We always went back to Miss Peps during the off season. We both stayed on the  Clover Circus our whole lives but we both made families. I married Jimmy and we had two little girls and one little boy, their names were Angelina, Lea, and Zack. Lea married a man named Brad and also had three kids, two girls and one boy whose names were Taylor, Marina, and John. They all lived a great and successful circus life.

My name  is  _________ me my mom and my dad are big cat trainers in the circus. I started my first aproaches when i was 9, at first i was very scared i knew what big cats are like and at first didn't want anything to do with them but luckily it wasn't as bad as i imagined it being.       Jasmine is my favorite out of all the cats she is a female tiger and fun to practice with. Me and my parents got her from a zoo in _________ when she was just a cub shes been my best friend ever since. Although it was fun at first taking care of the tigers,lions etc and helping my parents train them it was LOTS of work i had to get up 5:00am-6:00am to clean all of their cages feed them and get them new water before i went to the performance that we had to get ready for inbetween 7:00am-8:00am (1 hour drive).       Once we got there i still wouldn't get a break from all the work i had to do in the morning once it starts the bright eyes would always hurt my eyes and my ears would pop while the man talks into the mimchrophone. It's also hard to keep your patience when you wait like nearly an hour to go on and once you to go on your so stressed out you want to puke.and i dont know how many times i've messed up the performance with the easiest job! Walking the cats around the rign! How easy does that sound? Well its easy enough until the cat freeks out or get distracted! also it makes me mad that my parents get all of the money that we earn i mean cant they see that im part of the performance to? I mean am i just working for nothing!?       Once we get home i have to feed the cats, clean their cages, and get them new water all over again while my parents relaxe adn watch tv in the house. Right after i finish we have to go to another performance and do it all over again and you know what when your parents are in the circus with you there is no backing out so im kinda stuck here until i get married and buy a house or until my parents just pass away so if you want to join a circus i suggest changing your mind because the is a 100% chance your not goin the enjoy it that much and its not as easy as it looks, you need to be skilled like you cant just do a flip on a trampoline and decide to be an acrobat but there are still possibilities that if you work really hard your dream will come true and if this is really what you want to do, go for it down back out keep going there will be rewards for doing it!

Its not easy sometimes because remember, I do this everyday.I have to get up early everyday,and get ready for school.When I get to school it stresses me out from all the learning! When school is over,I have to practice for the circus. It takes lots of practice to get everything right. After I practice,im still a normal person, so I clean my trailer because it makes me feel better.But dont forget,the day isnt over yet. I still have alot more work to do before the day is young.Next I eat dinner but since I have alot of shows everyweek, I have to eat light. Now since im done eating, I practice a little more before the show.When they call us out and we see seats getting filled with people,we know its time to start.After another big day,I go home wondering how the next show would be. Im tired and all I can think about is sleep. I always dream about what my life would be when im older. I wish to be an amazing performer! I also dream about my home and my family. I dont get to see them often becuase I work weekends too.If you ever want to join the circus be prepared and know that when you leave your family,you only get to see them for a short time. But although the circus is fun and you travel everywhere with your friends,dont forget to visit your family sometimes. Well my day is over and this is the life of being in a circus, you should try it sometime and you would know that its amazing.

Would I have a normal life with normal friends, or a nice cozy house where I could lay next to the fire place with my pet dog? People who have normal live's always wish to have one like mine. They just don't understand how hard it is!                 When I wake up I have to eat breakfast, go to school, and when I come home I'm still busy practicing for our show. There are some upsides to being in a circus. I get to travel around the world and see all the the different places. I also love going on stage and watching the audience's excitement when something happens. On the other hand, living in the circus is hard. I never get to sleep! I am always so busy, I work from sunup to sundown. I hardly ever see my family either.                      In the circus I have lots of friends, they're like a second family to me. We always have time to play, just not very much time. The clowns always let me play with their stuff, I especially love to ride their unicycles. Some of my friends own lots of wild animals. They ocasionally let me walk with them and their animals.                  Having a life in the circus seems cool, and it is, but having a normal life seems fun too. I don't know if I'll stay in the circus when I grow older. I guess I'll have to grow up first then find out. All I know now is that living in the circus is fun, but it is a busy life...

She had a brother named Alex.Her moms name was Arika,and her dads name was Matt. Addies birthday was coming up,she was going to turn seven years old!!She wanted to invite three friends and go to the circus. Addie always dreamed of going to the circus, so this was her chance to ask her mom and dad to go to the circus with some  friends.  So three days before her birthday she asked her mom and dad,'mom,dad ,can we go to the circus for my seventh birthday?!?!' Asked Addie with out taking a breath.'Um... we'll have to think a bout it Addie .Ok. Now go to bed its already 8:30!' Said Addies mom.                       So as Addie walked up to her room with her nightgown her gramma gave her. When Addie got in bed and lay there. she thought about the circus.'what fun it would by' Adddie wispered to herself. The next morring Addie ran down stairs to wake up her mom and dad. Now it was only two more days befor her birthday.'Mom!Mom!Mom!'Yelled Addie running down stairs.'Have you thought about it?! Did you make a dission??' Asked Addie.'Well'.said Addies mom in yawn.'We did infact...Yes!Yes you can go to the circus!!! Said Addie's mom happily.'Can I go wake up Alex?!' Said addie.'No you should let him sleep for a little while longer- 'BUT I'M RIGHT HERE !!!'Yelled Alex jumping up from behind the bed with a huge smile on his face. 'Go play you waky kids!!! Said there dad Matt.                                         As Arika and Matt were making pancakes for Addie and Alex Arika said,'So should we make some calls for Addie's birthday party? Asked Arika. 'Why don't I go geet her so she can make the choice.' Asked Matt. Addie had three best friends one named Sofia. One named Rose. And last but not least, Annabell. So they called Addie down  and this is what happened, 'We need to know who you want to take to the circus??' said Arika. 'Umm... lets see.. One is Sofia Two is Rose and three is ..Annabell!!!!!' said Addie happily. 'Ok Addie thanks, you better get up stairs you brother is is building a fort so none of your bombs get him!!' said Arka. 'Hey no fair!!' yelled Addie running up the stairs. 'Oh jeez Matt, flip the pancakkes your going to burn them!!' said Arika as Matt went to flip  those pancakes.                                               'Hello, yes this is Addie's mom Arika. I'm good how are you? Well I was just wondering if Sofia could come over on saturday for a circus that were going to for Addies birthday.... Oh she can make it! That is great. We can pick her up at 3:30 on saturday. Bye have a nice day to you too.' Siad Arika hanging up the phone.'One down two to go.'Hello, yes this Addie's mom.how are you today?

So Arika dieled rose's mom's phone number,'Hello, this is Addie's mom who is this? Oh hi Rose can I talk to your mom please? Thank you, bye Rose. Hi Ms. Sapet how are you? I'm fine. Can Rose make it to a party this saturday for Addie. Oh... Well thats fine, have a nice day. Bye!'                                          'Addie!!!!' Yelled Matt 'Come on down.' Yelled Matt as Addie ran down stairs. 'Yes daddy.' Said Adddie. 'Annabell can come, Sofia can come and Rose can't come' Matt said. 'What do you meen Rose can't come?' 'I meen rose can't come.' Said matt with a frown om his face. 'Addie it will still be fun.' Said Arika. 'Ok.' said Addie. Addie wasn't that happy when she heard that Rose couldn't come.  So that night Addie lay in bed thinking about her party and how fun it would be. then she wispered to herself, 'It will be fun... Right I know it will if Rose is there or not.' Then addie got up out if bed and got her favorite teddy bear named Mr. Teddy. 'I wish you could com to the circus with us.' wispered Addie. And she slowly went to sleep.                               The next morring Addie woke up Alex and the played and played, until alex said,'hey, we should go out side and play' 'we should shoudn't we.' Said Addie. But there was a twist. There parents told Alex to say that because down stairs Addie's  parents we're waiating for Addie to cime down and the would yell,'SUPRISE!!!'  So Addie got dressed in her play clothes and heade down stairs andall she saw was glitter and confetti. And what she heard was...'SUPRISE!!!!!!!' Yellled Matt and Arika.                              So at 3:30 the all got in the car and headed to Annabells's house. when Annabell got in the car with a HUGE gift Alex's mouth opened wide  and nothing came out.'Hi Annabell, how are you doin'?' Aksed Matt. 'Good, how are you Mrs. and Mr.Lincon?' 'Good thank you.' They both said at the same time. 'Where off to ge Sofia!!' said Alex. So they we're off to get Sofia.when Sofia came in the car with a smaller present Addie was still happy with what she got.                            They finnaly got to the circus and the show began. First there was a clown show, then there was aacrobat show. Sofia was amazed with acrobats. 'How much do you think they practice?'Sofia wispered into Addies ear. 'A bunch that's for sure. Then there was a juggler, then a tightrope walker. 'Do you think hes going to fall?' wispered Addie in to Annabell's ear. 'I dont't think he is.' Anaabell wispered back.

If you are all of those and want to go to the circus go when old enough.You have to be flexible because if your an acrobat you do flips in AIR and more,you also should be strong if your one of those heavy lifter guys or dudes,scraed of heights for an acrobat and tightrope,and last but least not having stage fright you cant have that if you want to be in the circus or any show!

I live here in the circus with many actors including; Billy, Larry ,and Joe the clowns, the elephant riders Susan and Marcy,and my favorite, the acrobats Silvia, Trent and Me!               Life in the circus is hard work especially if one of us gets sick or injured before or during a show. I remember the time I was walking the tight rope and I fell  just like in practice and Silvia caught me,but when she through me to Trent he didn't catch me so I fell the 30 foot drop.  I ended up breaking my leg. Most people blamed Trent, but I forgave him after I got my cast.                   Our work is very dangerous because of the animals and acts we do. The lions and tigers that we use are wild animals that have to be especially when we train them.One times when I went to welcome them they tried to attack me! Its also dangerous for the acrobats because If they fall they could get so injured so bad they could die! The tightrope walkers also need to be careful cause if they fall, they can also get injured.               In the circus you get lots of free time. As a dog, I use my free time sleeping and playing with Silvia and Trent. Different actors and different people do different things with their spare time, like the clown do silly jokes, while Susan and Marcy groom the elephants. there are tons of things to do in the circus.

A new circus came into town.  'The Plascencia Brother's Circus'! It was the highlight of the fair. Everyone came. From the hobo's in the street's, to the rich people in their mansion's.          I bought a ticket to watch the 8:00 PM show. before that I wanted to play some games. The first game I played was the show your strength game. When I was in line this one guy cut in front of me. I told him to stop cutting. He didn't do or say anything. He wore a black jacket, baggy pants, and had a bag full of water bottle's.He was guy in his teenage year's. He stayed in line until it was his turn. When he finished he just ran off? But my curiosity got the best of me. I ran off after him. He stopped at a wall looked back, got one of his can's then sprayed it. After a while he went away. I looked at the wall and it was graffiti! Those can's weren't water bottle's! They were spray paint!          I had to call the police, but they said they already knew. They said they had been getting reports about graffiti all over town. The police station it self was graffitied! I knew I had to take matters into my own hands considering I saw him myself. I knew he graffitied every where so I myself painted over a wall white. After a few hours he showed up and started painting. He saw me so I chased him up to a dead end.   I asked him why he did it and he said. ' I paint the world as I see it '! He tried to climb the wall but fell. Landed on his back and just moaned. I called the policed, had fun at the circus, and still had time to watch the show.

For a solid month, all we had done was prepare for this day, and when it finally came around, none of us were ready.           We worked hard for the next hour, and just as the audience began filing in, we were finally ready to perform. 'Hey Lucy, I see the promotor. Let the performers know that he is on the east side of the stadium.' 'I'm on it,' replied Lucy.           'Ladies and gentlemen,' I began, 'Welcome to the Neon Animal Circus.

I can't sign your circus on a France Tour. I'm sorry.' Sigh. 'No, It's okay. We understand. Thank you Mr. R.' I replied.           Although discouraged, the circus headed to the pie car and quietly ate a dinner of fried rice. Even Mikayla, who never felt down was clearly slightly disappointed. 'You know what,' she began, 'we may have been let down this time, but the circus is our way of life! We can't give up now! I say we try for an American Tour!'

I am very famous for my tricks and my stunning beauty. People come all over the world just to see me perform. Today is a big show. We are performing in New York, New York. People like Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, and Taylor Swift were coming and I was going to get an act all for myself where I would be the star. I remember how proud my parents where when I told them about my star act       (flashback)   I was screaming,' Mom, Dad.' Then my dad and mom said what. I told them about my act and then they looked at each other and smiled then my mom said, 'We where waiting for this day to come.' 'What do you mean', I said curiously. 'We named you Stormbringer because we new that when you would grow up and become a circus performer, you would be very famous and beautiful so we named you Stormbringer because your beauty looks like it is based on that', said my mom in her musical voice 'Make us proud Storm', my dad said in his deep bass. I had a lump in my throat then I said, 'I will, I promise.'       (flashback ended)       I always wondered why I was named Stormbringer and now I knew why. I finished practiceing my grand routine and headed for the dressing rooms to change. I was surprised when I found my mom there. She and my dad are trapese artists and were dressed in black clothing with sparkles on them. My mom said,'You know your grandmother was a acrobate like you right? I nodded. 'Well she has a beautiful dress she wanted to save for your big night, and your father and I believe it is this night.' my mom said. She showed me the dress and I loved it, it was a white and black with sequins that sparkled and it had designs like storm clouds. I put it on and kept my hair in a high ponytail with a silver band. I looked and felt beautiful.           It was time for my act to start. I felt extremely nervous, but as I faced the crowd  and made my way to the place where I would jump down onto the ground in a 150ft jump, the cheering made my nervousness change to confidence. I looked great, my routine was great, I felt great, and this was my night to pull up a storm, for I was Stormbringer and I would make my parents proud.       The announcer, Jason said, 'I now give you the one you have all been waiting for the beautiful, and powerful Stormbringer!' I smiled the announcer was my friend and and I have a huge crush on him so immediatly I felt even more confident. I flipped out onto the ground a huge cheer came making my ears ring. I twirled, flipped, cartwheeled, and did so many other tricks. The crowd loved it and I was presented with a boquet of roses. I shined and I had created a Storm, for I was the great Stormbringer.       All the other performers did great, but as my name was called out, I got the loudest cheer. I looked at my parents and they looked very proud, I had done it, and I had done even more.       After the show I went to my parents and they looked so proud. They said, 'You have done a great job and made us prouder than we have ever imagined' I was in Cloud 9. I looked outside and saw a huge storm had come. There was lightning, rain, and thunder. My parents went to dinner while I changed into a fancy black sequined dress, I loved my grandmothers, but this dress meant more to me. I went outside to the storm, I wanted to stop, but I felt as if a force was propelling me. I felt the rain on, my dress, listened to the thunder, I lied down in the grass, and set my mind to wonder all there is to do and life and all there is to try, and soon I was singing to the storm.       'Hey' a voice said. I turned around and it was Jason. He leaned in and kissed me and I felt like I was floating, I understood what he meant, and said yes. He grinned and said, 'Come on let's go to the dining car.' I badly wanted to go, but I said,'You go, I will stay here' I stayed in the storm for an hour and found Jason waiting for me. We went to the dining car and ate. I smiled, I finally found my true self. I was Stormbringer Light. The bringer of storms.       That night when I went to sleep, I dreamed of my grandmother, my grandmother died when I was 3 months old so I never met her properly. People always said I looked just like her. Now I understood why they said that. I could have been her twin if I was way older. She said' Hello, I am your grandmother Moonshadow. Like you I was an acrobatic, and very famous and beautiful. People always said that the Moon would shine brighter when it saw me perform. Then I had a very famous show like you where everyone would come to see me. Then after I had performed my best ever, the moom shined so bright, and it was a full moon when it was not supposed to be one. I had a moon and you had a storm. You have many doubts about yourself which are not true. You will have a very successful career and make me very proud.' Then my grandmother dissapeared in a blinding flash of light along with my dream. In the morning I remembered her advice and grinned. I was ready to start the new day.

In order to become a proffesional circus performer you have to be willing to tak risk, practice everyday, and practice hard. I remember when I was little there used to be a school traviling with us. We had Geography lessons, Math lessons, and Literature lessons almost like your normal day at school.                                                             I became a adept juggler by training and teamwork. It requires a lot of teamwork to master this skill you need to help others in order to reach victory. On some occasions, I had hurt myself when I was practicing juggling torches. Sometimes these type of things may happen to you in the circus.

Well, to be like me, you must have a special talent in yourself. For me, that special talent is balanace and coordination.        Generally, to be an acrobat, you must take very dangerous risks. You must also learn very complex, tricky tricks. For example, what if your acrobatiing partner does not catch you at the correct time? You would fall down and possibly break your neck.       Another reason you must have very good balance. For example, what if your rope falls? You and your partner will die or get serious injuries. If you want to be an acrobat, it will be a very tricky desicion.

First to become an acrobat you have to have an excellent sense of balance, not just like balancing on a balance beam I mean on a trip wire.Second you have not be afraid of heights, if you are then don't be an acrobat! third of all you need to do gymnastics or ballet to train yourself female or male. Lastly join the circus.       Once in the circus get ready for some amazement in your heart like I did, it lit a fire in my heart. You will have a front row seat to amazement with all your fellow performers. Once it is your turn partner or not do not be afraid just go in and do it and the crowd will be in awe.you will run, then jump, and  accompanied with the spotlight on make an amazing performance.        After that incredible performance you are tired and want to go directly to bed, but your fellow performers stop you in your tracks and take you out to eat and celebrate.When you finally are in bed you  say to yourself 'what a performance' and then drift off to sleep.

This profession is   being in a circus.  A circus is not really a show where performers goof off and have fun.  It is actually a show which requires balance, practice, skill, and talent.        The performers travel all around the world when they preform circus acts.  For example,     Australia, Japan, and all over North America.  So many places to travel is so tiring!  Hi, I am Phil Johnson, and I have experienced all of this traveling.  But wait until you hear all of the other things that I have experienced, because it is so tiring!       There is also a variety of circus animals such as Tigers and Lions, and maybe even bears     or horses.  Some circus acts do tricks with the animals.  Tigers or lions could jump through a hoop!  With horses, someone could jump off a trampoline and onto a horse's back!  This requires lots of balance and practice.  But people should be super careful about how they are with these wild animals.  The animal could attack the person, or maybe even kill it.        Sadly, the performers stay away from their hometowns and families.  This makes me feel a little bit homesick.  Although the circus is a tough life, it could be very fun on stage doing difficult tricks in front of so many people watching you.

Everyone calls me that because I'm the best at the trapeze. I travel all over the world doing my tricks, everybody loved me until one day. That day was today.      'Remi get out of the bed we need to practice' yelled my partner Dana.' I am just let me get my stuff'! So I got my things and we went to the tent but when we got there someone else was on the trapeze.  'Who is that', Dana and I said at the same time. Ann over heard us.'Oh that's Rosie and Sydney they are the best from the US'Ann said. 'But we are from the US!!!' I said 'Well not anymore they are' Ann said. 'Lets go talk to them' said Dana. 'Fine' I said       'Ummmmmm excuse us' I said in a polite voice. 'What do you want smalls' said Rosie. 'Well I heard you guys are supposedly the best trapeze artist from the US' said Dana. 'WE ARE ' Rosie and Sydney said in unison.' But we were voted the best in our country' I said. 'Well let's just see who's the best then later tonight when everyone shows up here thy are going to vote to see who's better' said Sydney. 'DEAL' Dana and I said at the same time.        ' It's time for the show' Dana said. 'We are going to have a little competition to see who's the best at the trapeze Dana and Remi the Great or Rosie and Sydney, we want you to vote on your phones ' the announcer said. 'Remi the Great and Dana are up first'. ' Break a leg'said Rosie. Next thing you know Dana breaks her leg while walking out there. But that wasn't the worst thing I didn't have a partner to do the trapeze with. 'Thanks for jinxing us'. I hope you brake something but then her partner got really sick and started puking. ' It looks like none of us are going to win'said Rosie 'Or let's just team up'.' Fine Ill do anything just to perform said Rosie        The crowd loved us they wanted us to do it again so Rosie and I are partners now and we are called Remi and Rosie the Great.

Bella Castini is one of the circus preformers and she lives in a trailor with her family . They travel 20,000 miles in 7 months each year , visiting 150 cities and they work from sunup to sundown . here's a typical day for Bella at 7:00 am she gets up , gets dressed , and goes to the pie car to eat breakfast ( pancakes and bacon ). The crews are setting up tents ,lights ,and music for their nights show . At 9:00 am its school time . Her one - room schoolhouse  travels  with them . Like any other school , theirs has computers , tests , and report cards . Because the circus preformers are from all  over the world , many of her classmates speak other languages : French, Russian, and Italian like Bella's family . As they travel around the country ,their geography lessons come alive!                               Secondly, some fun things they do in the circus is play with the animals and learn new tricks . Some of the animals they play with is girraphs , tigers , monkeys , elephants , and so many more  they train the animals to do fun thing and if you like the circus come and see the animals and pet them . They are all trained and to do tricks.  Becareful  with the tiger he is the one who thinks your a treat!                         Finally , to become a circus  preformer you  have to a specific talent , the right  body type and be very determined . You have to put your heart into it  and be certain that thats what you want to do .One of the upsides of being in the circus is that you get a chance of traveling the world! And your audiance is intertained and they clap as loud as they can if you try your best.

The first reason I think it will be fun is that you get pick out a circus act you want to do.For example,you could pick anything you want to do,like acrobatics,juggling and training.I would like to do training, so I can train with different kinds of animals.Such as horses,birds,bears and maybe tigers or lions.I would train these animals so good they would know what to do when they walk into the show.                  The second reason I think it would be fun to be in the circus is I get to practice my circus act all day to get better at it.In addition,I would teach the animals to do tricks like jump,juggle for the bears and speak for the birds.Also,I would hug the and give them treats for doing tricks.I would also give the food,water,and baths.I think that my animals would be the best trained animals in the whole world.I would be so proud of my animals if they got a reward for best trained animals.                    Lastly,I would like to do my act at the show with all my animals I have trained.They would be the best animal act there and people would love themso much they would get a standing applause from the audience.The adience would want to take pictures with the animals every time they would come.                    As you can see,I think a regular day at the circus would be fun and exciding for three reasons.To pick out a circus act ,practice it and perform it.

I am a circus performer. You might be thinking being a circus performer is all fun, but it is not all that fun. The circus is like a paradise with all the shiny colors, but you have to perform and practice from sunup to sundown.              It is really hard. It all starts at 6:00 A.M. I wake up and go enjoy my fabulous breakfast. The stage is getting set up. They put red curtains. They are inserting all the different color lights.             Then it is time to learn at 10:00 A.M. We go into the room that moves with us. We learn about different places. There are many people from different countries and some of my best friends speak diferent languages but somehow we are able to contact with each other.             After that, we start training at 4:00 P.M. I like to practice doing juggling and acrobatics. Some of my friends do dangerous things such as jumping onto horses from trampolines.We also practice with the stage animals. It is a lot of fun, but also it is a lot of tiring work.            Finally, we perform. I do my acrobatics and have a lot of fun with the stage animals. Everyone does great and the crowd goes wild. We are all happy because our work payed off.            We eat dinner and sleep. We all think,'What a day. This is my fabulous life at the circus.

Alot  people have to do jobs in the moring to get ready for the rest of the day. They travel a lot to different places and meet different people. Not all of them are adults some are kids because their parents were in the circus and so know they are in it to. They don't stay in town so they just stay their for a few days and then they go to the next town. They do ten shows a week and are very in a tight schedule. Have to practice alot so itcan go well in the show. Hardly get to have a rest and berly see their family but to them the circus is their family. Don't have a place to call home. The circus is very hard but they still get to have fun.            The young people that work at the circus have to go to school even while they are on the circus. Take lessons on geography would come to life. Their is alot of people that don't speak English just other languages. It is like a regular school they have computers, tests, and report cards. The school travels because they don't stay in one place. They have to learn alot of things because they travel the world or county. To themit is like our life just that they travel and act and do tricks in front of people. They have to work hard to put the show on for alot of people. Have berly time to rest have a very busy day. Each day they have to do the same thing but in different places. They don't have a easy life like ours.            Some people run away to go to the circus but you don'tget in that fast you have to have a specific talent to be on the circus. Have to be determined to join. Their are ups and down to the circus. The happy thig about is that you get to do tricks in front of people and do  what you want to do you just have to have fun. But it is still hard because you hardly have to have sometime for your own. Have to work hard to make the people that are going to watch have fun and enjoy what they seen. Could make people laugh and enjoy the day. Little kids that go want to have fun and play and see that acts. The circus it is all about having fun. They do hard tricks so they have to practice so it can go well. To the aduance it looks easy but it is really hard so that it makes people have fun at the circus.             The work that the people do is very hard it is not easy as it looks. They have to practice everyday so they have to work very hard to do it in  the show so it could go well.

I was eating peaceful when somebody called my name.My friend Alex was the one who was calling me.'Hey Coner are you coming to practice or what'.'Of course'I said.We went running so fast that my friend Alex fell.I helped her get up and once we got up we saw this flyer up n the tent..2 We wanted to see what it said so we went to the pile of people who were covering the flyer and read'Dear im here to inform you there is no practice today or the next 3days because you will have to do a special talent of your own but if you fail you would be FIRED!We were afraid we were going to fail,but we promised we would try our best.The next day we actually had free time because practice was canceled,but Alex and I used that free time to practice.Alex already knew what she was going to do,but I still had no idea what I was going to do.I began to get worried.3 Next day I went to my friends trailor to talk to her, I still didn't know what to do and the show was in 2 days.She told me to calm down so I did so.She also told me to think about it and do what you like the most .I decided to take her advice.I finally knew what I was going to do only I thought I would fail in one minute so I started thinking of something else. I was freaking out I now only had one day.4 Ahhh! The show is today. I am so scared, if I don't pass this i'll be out of this circus!I was thinking but then inturupted by the host, he wished us good luck.I got it! i'll get on a horse jump of then i'll juggle then lastly say suprise that would be perfect because its not that hard to practice. Once the show started I began to get nervous but I had a flashback of my friend and what she told me so I just calmed down.It was finally my turn and the host said I passed I was so happy.5When that happened I learned that I have to be brave and have fath in myself.

When in all ready I like to go to the breakfast car and have breakfast with my clown friends.after that we set up the lights for that day and clean the     tent.     When that is finished I practices my acts in the circus. Later I go and do the daily training with the elephants if they do a good job the get a treat.Some times I like to go to the horse cages and play with the horses.My friends work with the leopards and lions.

Bella is waiting for the tour to be over. Bella doesn't get to see her family a lot. Bella doesn't know if she will be a performer when she grows up to an adult. You can't just join you need lot of training for just one stunt and lots of practice so you don't get hurt.                 Bella gave up nearly everything for the circus.

Some people in circuses have to groom horses or train animals. Circuses have many different things in them. Some circuses have elephant rides, some have horse rides, some have acrobats, and some have large or small animals do fancy tricks. In the next paragraph you will learn about some of the jobs people in circuses have.             I will tell you about some cool jobs and maybe some scary jobs. Some people are tite rope walkers, imagine being one of them walking high in the air on nothing but a thin rope doing flips and things like that. Imagine being a acrobat, I think it would be scary fling in the air jumping of ropes and grabing onto other ones and if you have a partner you have to trust them. Those are the talented jobs but some other people get stuck with jobs like the ticket booth stand or the popcorn stand. Some audiences like certain tricks better than other, like some might like seeing animals do tricks and some might like seeing people fly through the air.            I have a few questions I want to think about. The first one is would you join a circus? If you had to choose a job in a circus what would it be? What is your favorite thing to watch in a circus?

The circus life is very fun and adventurous, but is very tiring and hard work.             When I was was a little girl, my parents always expected me to follow their paths of the circus life. When I was 7, I was already taught how to juggle and walk on a tightrope. When I was 11, my parents knew I was ready to perform on the live stage in front of millions of crowds.          I was extremely nervous for my first show and stage fright got the best of me for when I was walking on the tightrope I fell to the ground. The crowd suddenly fell silent. That night I felt if it was worth it being in the circus and what it would be like if I was a normal girl just living at home like a simple life. My parents soon came in and consoled me and told me to 'never give up,' and 'the show must go on.'          Ever since then I knew I was meant to be in the circus. I learned brand new tricks such as training an elephant to walk on a tightrope and having a tiger jump through a hoop. I even been working on my latest trick to walk on a tightrope while juggling apples. Of course I fell several times but I got back on my feet to try again. I even still get stage fright before shows, but I know that being in the circus is in my blood.          If you ever want to join the circus, I suggest you should. But you need to make sure that this is what to do for life and make sure you enjoy doing it.

The circus had finally come to our town London!!! Oh, how much I longed to become a circus trapeze artist. I had been doing gymnastics all my life, and dreamed to be in the circus. Well, one day I got the chance. The same circus I had watched was holding tryouts to becoem a backup trapeze artist. I practiced everyday after school, and prayed that I would be chosen. The day finally came. As I went to the circus for my tryouts, I gazed and studied the other people who came to try out. Just by looking at them, I knew I would get in. Of course, I was right. I was chosen!!! The ringmaster said to me, 'Ella, you are our family!' I beggged my parents to let me go but they could not bare to watch me go. The ringmaster told me that they were leaving tommorow, and I had to make a lifelong desicion.                  I decided to run away, and join the circus instead. At night, I grabbed some food-bread, cheese, that kinda stuff, then made a dash for it. After I was far out in the pasture, I looked back, but then decided to keep going. This is my dream! I had to keep going, and I kept running to the trailors where the ringmaster was waiting for me. There was no turning back now. I saw the trailor ahead of me and waved to hthe circus master. 'Wecome,' he said, in a  thick French accent. 'This is your trailor. You will be sharing with Maria Grande.' As I went into the tailor, a pretty girl approached me, saying hello in French. She had told me that she had run away from home five years ago, and was a trapeze artist too. She missed her parents and was sobbing about it. She had gone outside to get some fresh air. I told her that I had run awy too. She said we shall go return you back to my parents. She said that she was orrow and griefed in pain to never see them again, and she did not want me to the same mistake. Suddenly, the trailor started. Now, there truely was no turning back. I plopped down on my bed feeling sad. I eventually fell asleep.                 In the morning, I woke with Maria shaking me. It was the first day of circus, and I missed my parents terribly. During my first show, I loved it!!! Everyone loved my trapeze act, and it made me feel warm inside that people liked what Iwas doing. The ringmaster was pleased with all my hard work, and he gave me a promotion to the next level. We traveled all over the world, and met new types of people. I had made many friends at the circus, including animals. I learned and made up new types of trapeze and gymnatic acts. Everywhere we went, we werewelcomed and loved. Life in the circus was good, except for one problem. I missed my parents dearly. Five years had passed, and now Iwas seventeen. I finally  knew what to do. I asked the ringmaster if we could go back to my own town in London. He agreed, and we traveled there.                  I knocked on my house's door and my mother opened it. I was so glad to see her. Then my father came outside and welcomed me with a bear hug. I then knew what to do. I had to quit the circus. I said goodbye to all my friends, and they promised to come visit me. I knew it was the right thing to do.

When I i make my audience laugh i just smile back at them and just making them happy. When your a circus peformer its not all about making people laugh you have to do some other things like taking care of the animals. When a animal gets hurt we cant peform with it so we do a act longer like if a horse gets sick we do the lions more longer. Its hard being a circus peformer you have to travel around the world so unless your family comes with you it will be hard to see your family and your friends and your house because you travel all around the world.          At a circus show we try to amaze them but if we cant we do something unexpected like jumping over a horse or a lion anything like that. My normal day is that i wake up 6:00 in the mourning and get breakfest and at during my evening we usually do a show that time because thats the time where people arent tired. When the show is over we just lay down or we practice for the next show but mostly lay down. If a peformer gets hurt during the show we would cancel the act and move to the next one.          The first time I did a show was when I was 10 years old I did an act with a horse and I was really nervous and scared.

I've been working in the circus for a really long time. Its not really fun working in the circus when you berally get there.But when you get used to it, it starts getting easy so but this is a really fun place there's alot of clowns, acrobats,and grommers but theres other stuff i cant really explain.                                                                                       First, of all Ive been working at the circus for a really long time. I get so excited when there are shows coming up.Its so fun when you watch when people are really excited to see the animals,acrobats,and people jugguling on a unicycle its super fun but when we get ready to clean up its not fun there's always popcorn on the floor and especially when you have to clean up the animals busniess its so gross blaugh.                              Second, i have to get ready to eat with my family but we dont eat that much because where getti ng ready for the next preformance tonight we always are so happy when there are shows coming up well who can blame us kids,and parents they always have there fun at the circucs the never get old.They always i mean always have the greatest time i see there smile and them laughing.                                  Lastly,we get ready to go to bed. I think in my head that I so happy that i work at the circus if you grow up to be a circus person i tell you that its going to be fun and i mean really fun i was so glad when i found out that i was moving close by the circus i was so excited that i was crying of joy.I was crying because I always wanted to be in a circus even when i was little.So that how my life was when i was at the circus.

I have been in this Circus for now (counting years) 1 no 2 no 3 no but 4 years I have been here. I am a girl and I have an italian accent.I have many great stories of the Circus but today I will tell you my favorite story.                It all went down on the 2nd show on Sunday... I was getting dressed up by my trainer Savanna.She gently slid her hands up and down and side to side among my Beautiful pink dress checking for bumps.I wore a little pink and white polka-dot bow on my left ear with som little soft comfy white booties.Iwas almost done getting my dress on when Ace my partner came in and sat on the floor eyes set on me, he wore a black tuxideo with a top hat.I looked at him with barking twice to note him I was almost done getting dressed.A minute later Bo Ace's trainer came in putting a hand on savanna's shoulder.                I got VERY anoyed with this constant act of affection for Bo and Savanna.every time it happened I jumped up and down barking at the top of my lungs, but Ace didn't seem to mind that at all I could tell he thought him and I would do that someday too but I coulden't amigan.I broke this love fest up with 6 howls and a yip then Savanna put on my last bootie and set me on the floor.               I ran to the curtain just waiting right behind it so when Savanna,Bo,and Ace came we could all run out on the big platform and Ace and I would jump through hoops,fire hoops,and jump onto Savanna's back while Bo held a hoop for Ace to jump in.The curtain went up And Ace and I were center attion, suddenly that very moment Ace stopped jumping and walked up to me and gave me a quick little lick.The crowd's booing went on and on I couldn't take it much longer so with two leaps I jumped onto the trampoline and did a front flip and landed on all four.The crowd stopped silent for a moment then a HUGE wave of applase was let apon me and my crew.               little 6 and 7 year olds ran up to the small fence that blocked them going in to the big stage.They held notebooks and pens in their hand sreaming and hollering 'I WANT YOUR ATOGRAPH!!'.I heard a faint screeching in my ear getting louder and louder then I couldn't hear the fans screaming anymore,I only saw the kid's mouths sreaming.               My crew and I all waved and walked behind the redish curtain and we were done for that night.Before I went to bed I walked up to Savanna and put my paw on my ear and scratched sooo hard.Her mouth moved but I didn't hear what she said.She quickly picked up the telephone and dialed Doc Bellin's number.I layed down waiting for the door to open and in come Doc Bellin.As I supposed he bursted through our small door and hurled himself onto my bed.He opened my moth looked inside my nose and looked in my ears.I senced worry in Doc.He said something to Savanna and she cried.             Doc rubbed Savanna's back and talked to her.He brought out a needle and stuck the needle into my neck he patted me until I felt woozy and fell asleep.I woke up with my ears hurting and throbbing.I saw Savanna's mouth move and...'I CAN HEAR!!' I thought.Savanna moved her mouth and said without any motions 'Come here Zepher.'.I got up and sat at her feet.She sighed and said to Doc 'She can hear,She's not deaf!'I looked at her with suspicion.She patted me an said It's ok girl then we all slept for that night.            Acouple months later Ace was a father and I had 4 lovely puppies 2 girls and 2 boys.After that things were all good.             And that was my favorite Circus story.Hope you enjoyed it!!

In the circus I got no family, but I feel like all the other performers are my family.                 When I first came to the circus I wanted to be a trapeze artist but they said I was to chubby and they couldn't carry me. Then, I asked if I could join the clowns. They accepted. I went to practice with the clowns the next day. It was very funny to practice with them, they did very funny things. When it was my turn to show my skills the clowns didn't like me, they said I wasn't funny enough. I thought I was never going to find the right thing to do.                 Then, I saw that the person that got shot out of the cannon quit. I thought 'This is my chance.' So, I went to ask the ringmaster if I could do that. He said yes but that it will take a lot of practice. I kept practicing until I got it. The only thing that bothered me is that what if I didn't land on the net. Tonight was my first performance.

One night Joseph went outside to throw the trash away.A big wind came a blew him to a tree he went asleep on the tree.The next morning  he woke up he was in a circus he didint know why he went wandering around and found his parents.His parents were clowns!They did a show Joseph wanted to be a clown and play in the show.His parents gave him a front row tickets to watch the show.

Joseph was a clown that had to go on the tightrope and hit himself with pie walking on the tightrope. He didin't care he only cared that he was a clown. He was about to start the show. He woke up and it was just a dream but when his parents came in the room they were dressed as a clown and said Happy Birthday Joseph! And gave him a big cake for him. And took him the the circus for his Birthday. And he got to be a clown for a day.

You have to learn lots of things like a being a funny circus clown, Doing difficult acrobats, juggling, being a tight rope walker. Training circus horeses, and more.Its also hard to wake up early and trying to do lots of things.Its fun to do other jobs like being a food vender or stage hand or usher  but training animal are the best. you could train elephants,dogs,horses,snakes and more.                          During the circus thousand of people come to see us do ammazing tricks. But since we have to go to about 150 cities we might have to know new languages for them to undestand us and if were going to different places we meet new people thats what Ilike about the circus. when we go to diffrent places its really fun to see different views like Big Ben, going to Paris.                             I like working in the zoo beacause playing with exoti animals,traveling alot, fun to see all acts,get to expirence things you never done, and learning new things. The toys they give out at the mercandise shop are awsome. You could get a stuff animal, bracelets,t-shirts, and hats.Thas why I like the merchandise shop.                          Clown are my favorite part of the circus they might be funny or scary but are so cool and I think its awsome.Then I think the food vender is good at making food they make hot dogs, cotten candy and other delicious food thats what you see in a circus.

There is a reason for that nickname, and I'm going to tell you why. When I first joined the circus I was just looking for a college job. But after a while I started to want to stay. It was fun and exiting. I liked the risk of flipping through the air. Oh, by the way, I'm a trapeze artist.            'Are you ready yet?' The circus master asked. 'Totally' I replied with a grin. It was my first live performance. I watched the clock as the second hand curved toward the twelve. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0! I was on! I ran off the platform and savored the roaring of the crowd. I flipped off of one swing and onto another. I went soaring through the air and flipped one way or another. Then I noticed something out of place.            Where was the landing platform? I realized with panic that there was nowhere for me to land! I made a split second decision and jumped toward an elephant. I landed on his back and bounced toward a  swimming pool. I landed with a loud KER-SPLASH! The crowd went wild! And ever since then, I have loved performing in the circus.

Her vision was blurry but she could see the lion clearly.She stumbled to get uo then hit the floor again.She opened the mini fridge and saw a huge piece of raw steak.Jennifer stood up and retrived the meat. The lion roared again and he pounced.Jennifer dodged it and ran out.'JAMES!''

He didnt want his friends toknow  thathe works at a circus.so when he say one of the memmbers he freaked out and  went to  the restroom to hide.          The next day he asked his mother to shave her beer of  and his mother asked why and the son said for no reason,and they just moved along.The night had com and the son stayed up and the mom fell asleep and the son went to get a shaver and at night he was going to shave  her beer og but the mother woke up and the just gave her a kiss to not make it suspicieos.         It was the day of the circus for the special event. The sun was going to be part of the show .He was getting ready to go on a rope to balance the rope was pretty high. When he was about to go on it he saw his friends and got scared and emberess so he wasn't concentraded so if you get on a rope to balance you have to be very concentraded but the son was not concentraded so he fell of the rope and droped off from about 8 or 9 feet,during the circus. His  mom tried to help up but he didnt wake up.           So after that they toke him to the hospital and said that he would have to be in a wheel chair for a pretty long time unless that he learns how to walk again,but the doctor daubted it.So they went back home and the son was really mad at his mother. He started screaming at his mother and told her to shave off her beer , but his mom didnt shave her beer off because she makes jokes in the circus whith her beer and if she takes it of she will get kicked out and not make money to help her son not to starve to death,but then he also refused not to go to school untill he learns how to walk again.So then he didnt go to school.             So the next day his friends heard of what happend to him and they went to visit im but he didnt let them in because his mom was their.So the next day he actually went to school and his friends saw him and told him that he felt sorry for him at that moment his mom came to pick him up and he started screaming at her telling her what she come for and the guys started laughing and the girls were just telling the guys to be quiet and they left the girls went to visit him and talked to him not be emberessed by what his mom looks like or have just ignore the people who thinks its funny. So he went to a place were they teach them how to walk again and he laerned how to walk again and he wasnt emberess anymore and he kept working in the circus very happily.

In the circus they have to travel all over the world just to fascinate and amaze many different people.you need to set up evrything so people can get amazed and go to your circus,like for example big posters that say ''Circus circus come and enjoy our fun loving circus now!evrysingle day your probably going to have many different people come and enjoy the circus,but evry single day your going to need to clean up after them.It's pretty much true you are going to need to clean up after them because the audience does make a big mess evry time they go to the circus,like litterally all the popcorn and soda spills all over the floor.                 Many circus's have a special place where performers from the circus go to eat,they call it the ''Pie car'',and no they don't eat and buy pure pie right there,only becauase it's called a Pie car doesn't mean they sell and eat pure pie there.you can't eat too mch though because you still have to do some more performances!many performers enjoy the food there.                Circus workers need to travel evry where almost around the world,and this is all just so people can come to the circus.It is very difficult to travel sometimes because the workers may get sick.Even if they get sick they still decide to travel.they all ways travel no matter if it's near or far.they travel evrywhere evry single day.                As you can see working at the circus is easy and hard at the same time.You get to do many different things at the circus but some thing include lots of training.They also travel alot and you might get sick on the way to your destination!Your always going to need to clean up after the audience leaves because if you don't it's going to be a mess.remember their your adience let them be proud and enjoy the performances!

I am supposed to perform being shot out of a cannon doing a 360 back flip ,swing on acrobat monkey bars,and land on a mattress.And that will be the final act or event in the show.      3 hours later... The announcer came out. He called the first performer(The Tight Rope Walker). His act is to walk on the tight rope without falling and juggle too. He called out the next performer((horse)Flame Jumper). The horse's act was to jump through the hole of flame. After that he called the next performer s(Flying Man and Miss Hanger).Their act was Miss Hanger grab on to the acrobat monkey bar and Flying Man grab on her legs,swing,put legs on on other acrobat monkey bar,and let go.On the come around Flying Man grabs Miss Hangers legs and when Flying Man swung back to other platform while Flying Man fly's on to a mattress.      Now on the grand finally the one you've all been waiting for (Cannon Flip Acrobat o Man).When I got shot out of the cannon I could see much awestruck in the peoples eyes. After I finished my act everybody was screaming my name, throwing flowers, and also wanting my auto graph. So when the owner of the circus saw me he was amazed he was so awestruck he was so dumbfounded it was so manifest in his countenance.      When he could speak again he told me I was gonna be on TV and on the newspaper all around the world.

I practice doing horseback riding. Horseback been my family for years. I am going to jump of a trampoline onto a horse's back today. Before I practice I have to groom them and feed them. It is hard to do it thought. You would have to be brave enough to do a stunt like that. Remember to use safety items on.

Now, these two kids have names, the boy was named Oliver and the girls was named Astroria. Thay left the orphanage because they where called runts (ironic, right?) and always left them out. Impressively, they managed to get out of there and decided to live their life as two performers to get away from the orphanage and the bullies. The day they made it to the circus it was ,of course, a nice morning. Let's start this story, shall we?'Finally, were here!' shouted Oliver, that had his mouth covered quickly. 'Shhh!' said Astroria, 'you'll wake the performers' she continued.They had to wait for the gates to open before going in.  Eventually they waited until the gate was opened and quickly scampered in. Once in they met the owner of the circus.'Mister Tillman!' Oliver called out.'Who's there?' Tillman answered. Tillman was a strong man and also is a performer, but only for the beginning.'We'd like to be in your circus!' Astroria replied. 'Where are your parents?' Tillman asked. 'W-were orphans and we'd like to be performers!' stutered Astroria. 'Are you two related?', Tillman asked. 'We think not...' said Astroria. 'Well it's okay if I let you two be performers if you guys promise me your acts could be chosen.'Tillman asks. 'Of course' both reply. Many months past and the two perfectly fit in with the others, but one day. 'Okay todays act for you two is......acrobatics!' said Tillman. Over the time, both kids have became more skillful at the circus and acrobatics were their favorite act. Before the act starts Oliver ask Tillman for fire effects at the end and Tillman agreed. Durring their show, everyone was amazed by their moves and tricks. 'Okay this is it , try to do as many frontflips as you can!' reminded Astoria to Oliver. 'I got this' replies Oliver. Oliver springs off aboard, does a few flips and perfectly lands in the safety net. At the same time Astroria, still standing on the board falls off because of a shining light hitting her eyes. Oliver notices and (by pure luck) finds a trampoline, bounces on it, catches Astroria, does another flip, and perfectly lands as the fire effects go off. Everything is silent but out of nowhere  the crowd chants,shouts, and whistles. Later that night everyone treated them with even more respect than they did before. They still performed but they chose their permanent act would be acrobatics. The End.

Well, me and my folks could use some of that money, so I hurried up with my tasks and went home to tell my folks about the chance we had. They were ECSTATIC about doing it. They wanted all of us (Lewis, Sarah, Miles, and I) to try out for it. 'It'll give this family a better chance of getting in!!' My mama said. 'And which ever one of you gets in-you go for it!!' On the 'Try-outs' we were so exited! when we (individually) tried out, me and Sarah got in, but the boys didn't. Lewis was fuming! He was so mad, he almost broke his computer!! 'I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN IN THERE!! NOT SARAH AND LEIA!!' He shouted.   I'll bet you're wondering how my first day went. Well, on the first day we had a lot of fun. First, I walked in to the tent they had put up. Then, I saw all of the Circus! All of whom I saw was: the Clowns: the Acrobats; and-OH, MY, GOD!!! The Tight Rope Walkers!!! I walked right over there, and they welcomed me as if I had been their friend forever. They helped me do their routines, and they even let me do one on my own!!! They were so kind, they let me use their ropes (since I didn't have on yet) and made me feel right at home. I was so happy, that I forgot I had a performance that morning, AND that I was dreaming about the first time I walked in and met every one!! 'That was the best show yet!!' Sarah said. I had told my sister about my dream and she thought I was re-imagining how I had felt because I was nervous. The fact is, I am nervous. But I don't dream things when I'm nervous. So, I don't know what to think of it. 'Well, wish me luck!' I said. She and I said 'See ya' and I went to the 'Performance Tent' to rehearse.   I was the BEST out there. When the crowd cheered, I just stood in the finished position and just Smiled. That was the best day of my life!!

First of all, having fun at a circus having fun at a circus is a dream come true because a circus only comes once a year and with alot of good musicians,circus clowns, circus acrobats, circus jugglers, circus tightrope walkers,and sometimes circus horses. When i was about 8 yrs. old my daddy took me too the circus and an actress was performing at the circus. She had a Michel Jackson dance contest and ofcurse my brother won. The winner got to take a picture with the actress and the actress put her leg on top of my brother. it was really funny but sence then the circus didn't come back and no one knows why.                             Second of all, enjoyable peaple should enjoy the circus because their are alot of good ,talented, and amazingly greatfull peaple actresses to come and do a show for us.Clowns are very nice some of them and some peaple are afraid of them like little kids love clowns i know i still love clowns and other peaple don't sence they are little kids but they don't know why. I was afraid of clowns once but my friend Victoria her dad is a clown and he talked me out of it and sence he talked to me about not being afraid of clowns and i haven't been afraid of clowns any more by the way my friend victoria's dad is very halarious.                     In Conclusion,When you go to a circus you have to have fun enjoy it and love it because like i said it only comes once a year and maybe the story that i told you may help about me and that story is true. And if you ever get to go to a circus again make sure to buy alot of suff like lights, nachos, icecream cones, cotton candy, enter contest and alot more of alot of activities. I know i loved playing all kinds of activities and buying icecream cone. So if you ever go to a circus enjoy play eat and love it.

Being a circus performer isn't all fun and games, I still have to do homework like any other kid, and practice preforming. An advantage for me, is that you get to travel all over the world and meet different people. It's really cool because making people from different countries laugh and amazed is a really good feeling.                      My family and I usually have to sleep in a big trailer and have to spend a lot of time from home, but I'm cool about it. I sometimes think if I'll ever to actually live in our house, but I guess it's just one of the backslides you get as a circus performer. I do get homesick sometimes, but I try that not to stop me from preforming.                   People usually think that preforming is really easy but it's really not! We may make it look easy, but those moves takes a lot of training and talent. I joined the circus 2 years ago when I was 8. I started with gymnastics and then started wanting to become a performer. I knew it it would require patience and talent, so I tried my best. My parents were kind of worried about me not being home all the time, but I told them I would be OK.                 As you can see being a circus performer has it's advantages and non-advantages. I still love being a performer in front of people, but people should make sure to think about it first.

Suddenly, the circus was there and out stepped Max, the famous single-man circus. Why did he join the circus when he is only ten years old and makes everyone laugh. He wears regular clothes for his circus acts and his parents work at the most high-tech software company every.                When the circus started, he was the circus acrobat, circus juggler, the circus clown, and the circus tightrope walker. What made the people laugh, is the announcer called different names, but everytime it was Max. When the circus was over Max had earned one trillion dollors from the some of the trillionaires watching the circus total, in one circus act. he earned more money than both of his parents mony combine times ten.

My mom and dad pushed me in to being a circus performer when I was 4. I was very flexible for my age. That made my dad very happy because he was a  tightrope walker so I can be a acrobat. When I was 6 my dad went to go do something and left me next to the rope. When he came back  I was doing handstands on the rope. He was flabbergasted when he saw me. He said you are two in one and there is no way they won't exept her. When I was 8 my dad toke me to the owner of the of the circus and he was happy too but then he said that he already had a girl like her and only had two men but only one of them was like her too. He said we will do 3 shows first to two wins.   I met the girl the next day she seemed nice until I talked to her she was tring to put presure on me so I will mess up and she gave me a pair of shoes that were so slippery that i fell every time i spun around. She wasn't going to play fair she was going to cheat.        This is the first show and to told her to get the my new shoes and I lnew she was going to get the ones that were slippery so I fell and blamed it on her. She won that show but the manager know she cheated so he is watching her now so I will feel more safe now that he is watching. The nexted show I won because he said that I was fresh, eligant, and graceful. My dad was right there nexted to me after that show he was so proud of me. Then I got wrried if I don't do something new I could go home. My dad was tring to think of something to do and it reminded me of me childhood. Then I forgot that my mom was going to be there. I wanted to surprise her. I remembered that I loved to do the monkey bars and I can try doing a trick on it. Then my dad remebered that i was good at throwing and juggleing.I found what I was going to have a volenteer stand by a wall and I will juggle knifes and throw it at the volenteer while I am on the tightrope.Also I am going to pretend to fall off but catch to ropr and do a flip and land on my feet. The fun part is that the volenteer is going to be the other two in one girl. The show went just like I planned it and the knife went right above her head.         I won the last show so I get two stay in the circus it was fun to win but my effert and detrmination won it for me and my genuis helped alot to. In the end you can be the best and not make it because you didn't push your self. It is good to take risk sometimes if the risk is worth taking.

Tight roping is where you are about 50 feet in the air with a 12 foot long stick to balance you for walking across a 1foot wide rope thats 30 feet long that you have to walk across. sounds crazy right,thats what  i do every show.       When i put my feet on the rope, it sinks down from my weight and i start walking, thats when my head starts spinning but i just keep on walking. If you've ever stood on one foot this is nothing like this, this is one foot in front of the other and is much harder than balancing on one foot, walking on that tiny rope feels walking on air , really really  high in the air with a stick for balance.

Well, it contains hard work and a lot of dedication and you must have the right body type. You need a lot of fexlibility and training to be a circus preformer. There are many ups and downs of being a circus preformer too, it isnt just perfect there are many hardships that you will face along the way. Bella ( a circus preformer) traveled 20,000 miles in ONE YEAR!  You will probably also be wiped out from the practices and the show that you will do. You also have to STILL do school but, in a one roomed school house! The ups of being in the circus is you can practice stunts and flexibility. You also get to see all the different kinds of animals that are in the circus which are mostly wild ( but tamed) animals.

I don't ike the cold stares people give my mom when we go out in public with our face paint on. I don't want to be in the circus, but it is seomthing that I love and can't quit! I first joined the circus when I was 4. My parents wanted to keep me at a reasonable age to join the circus because there were so many different stunts involved. I first started meeting with a dance and gymnastics teacher every day, every week. We practiced keeping the beat and ometimes even different stunts. Soon when I was 8 I could do any gymnastics trick that anyone asked me. I was a terrific gymnast/ dancer and I officially joimed the circus after that. The first time I did a stunt it was revolting and unrealistic. I swung from bar to bar until I reached the end of the fish net. it was so scary yet so fun that I wanted to keep on doing it until I died. When I fell I just got right back up. My mom called me Wonder Women. Now, its different.       I get to have my own part in the show! I will be doing gymnastics AND dance! It will be so much fun! It was totally worth 10 years of waiting! I guess since I am 14 I am old enough to run the show! My first dance was a major hit! People loved it and applaud me loudly! It was the most beautiful clap I have ever heard in my entire preforming life. I would have to do a gymnastics act later tonight. My gymnastics act was even better! The claps were louder and more real. Back tucks and Front tucks were the main idea of what I was doing. People wistled and screamed my name! If I could do this all my life I would. Our next tour is in Boston ( I read my bosses planner  ) I hope they liked our act as much as Florida did!         Boston tour wasn't any different accept for my routine! The crowds applaud me like Florida did and they also screamed my name! Finally, people decided it was my time to do something that I wouln't do in a million years, I ran through the ring of fire! Johnny Cash blared through the radio and I looked at that small ring and jumped with all my  might. The fire burned me but it was something I could fit through.

It is very fun but I never can call a place home or join a sports team. I will tell you how fun and difficult a circus life can be.           6:30 am  I wake up and get dressed in my acrobat suit and go into the food car and eat pancakes with the clowns. The clowns are fun to eat with but they always want to play with their food. A lot of times the human cannonball man makes the pancakes.         7:15 am I start practicing my acrobat routine with my brother. After I finish practicing for the night show I play with the clowns. I love to ride their unicycles. Happy the clown showed me how to ride one. Happy is my favorite clown because he always wants to play boardgames with me.         8:45 am School starts I usually learn about math, science,geography and reading. Some times we have a lot of homework and if I need help I usually ask my mom, dad or Happy.Whats really fun is that for recess we get to play with the monkeys. My favorite monkey in named Ty, he is the smallest of all the monkeys.         2:30 pm Schools over and I have to start doing my chores. My chores are to feed all of the animals and practice with them so they are ready for the 5:45 and 9:30 show. I practice with the tigers to jump through a ring of fire. I don't really have to practice with the elephants because they don't really do anything people just do tricks on them. Last I practice with the monkeys, they do acrobatic and tightrope acts. It is actually kind of fun to practice with the monkeys.          3:00 pm I have my meal before the show. I eat with the clowns and my brother, mom and dad. My mom is an animal trainer and my dad is a tight rope walker. I have to eat my supper at 3:00 pm because if would eat right before I do my acrobatic act I might get sick during the 5:45 show.         4:30 pm  We start setting up the stage. It is horrible setting up the stage for every show because when we tour the world  we have to set up each time we move cities. It is really hard for me to carry the big safety net for my acrobat performance. It must way 100 pounds!         5:45 pm We start the show. That's my favorite part because all of the hard training will pay off. It is very exciting being an acrobat because it fells like you are flying through the air and just when you are going to hit the ground I get swooped up by my brother.             8:30 pm We just finished the show. It was super fun, I love performing in front of people. All of the performers get a quick break before we all have to do the 9:30 show. I've always thought the 9:30 show was to late at night but I still have to do it anyway.         9:30 pm We have to start the 9:30 show. I know I said I love doing my acrobatic show but I hate doing it all over again. I'm really tired after the first show but I still have to do everything again! It is horrible.         12:00 am All of the shows are over for the day and I am pooped. Everything I do is super tiring And I have to do it all twice! It is super fun to be in the circus but it also has a lot of down sides.

Me and my friend Rily want to the Amozon Circus for the inside scoop. Of what they do, me and rily want to find out what happens in the circus like, how many people perform, how they fly on the silks, and how they teach the animals to do cool tricks.       So me and Rily went to talk with the main cheif of the circus Mr. Hoeny. He said that each night they perform they have 60 people perform exact. He also said that 10 people do one trick on the animal they have been training but they each go one by one. Then the next groop will perform what they have to do. Until they are done the people who are not performing they will help run the show. So that what me and Rily got about how many people are in the circus.       Next we went to the flying silk tent and me and Rliy had to find someone to help us. So we found Madam Kishca the famous Silk person. So I was talking to her and she said the flying silks are really hard to master it anly took me 2 years to learn how to use the silks because I wanted to be in the circus and wene they had tryouts i was only 5 and i made it to the circus the gudges were impress about how well I did. So back on the report well on the flying silks we have to be flexible so we have to do gymnastics wich is easy if you have been doing it since you were 1 years old which i have been doing said Angelina the reporter. Next you have to  have good grips on the silks because it will hurt you if you dont have a tight grip.       The last thing is how do people train the animals. whaqt they do is that they use treats to help them understand what to do like counting painting and other stuff. that all you really need to know about the story.

One day while I was sitting on my bed, I wanted to go for a walk. When I was outside I saw some flyers that said' JOIN THE CIRCUS TODAY!' Then I said to myself 'I want to join the circus now.' When I had got home I had asked my mom could we join the circus, surprisingly she said 'yes'. So we got Evey thing that we were taking.Then we had go plane tickets to go to our destination which was Africa.When we had arrived at Africa's airport we saw a big white and red tent. My mom and I had went inside the tent and signed a white sign up sheet. We interred the big tent and we got taught many of tricks. When everyone got their together we had a show. There were thousands of people there just to see us perform. Soon as the circus crew saw the audience they knew what they had been practicing.                             The performers!      The first performer was Andy, he was a lion tamer.  Andy had brown lions, and white lions. After Andy there was a gymnastics girl names Kate. Kate did back flips, jumps, and she cartwheeled off a moving horse.Finally, it was my turn I was the one who controls the elephants,  that had to be the best job of all of them. I made the elephants stand up.Also made the elephants hold up one hand. The whole crowed cheered and screamed.The circus did the same act everyday of one week . After the week was over we would make up new acts.The circus is like school you would go for a few months and then you would have a few months for a break.                                      After the shows I would help the other kids groom the animals. There  was two people there that I was really close to  her name is Madison and My mom. Madison is my best friend.When the tour around the world was over everyone went home. My best friend Madison moved next door to me ,so now I can see her everyday.We go to school together and we are in the same class.After school we go outside and practice some old circus acts. I all ways wished to be  in the circus and my wish came true.   Madison and I said when we grow up we would be awesome circus actors.That was my time in the circus.

There was only one thing to do. Practice, Practice, Practice.So Joseph left with an alarming,''By!'', hopped on his bike, and started pedaling. He checked his watch, 9:34 a.m., when he looked up, all he saw was the red and blue of the circus tent.On his way in he waved to Matt, his best friend out everyone at the circus. He quickly climbed up the ladder, and hung on to the trapeze. Before starting he took a big, deep, slow, breath. While he swayed he did amazing flips, alternating as if time didn't even exist anymore. This is how he always felt on the trapeze, but while he swung he saw his parents along with all of the fans. He was still looking when he plummeted into the net.          Oh no! He had forgotten he had a performance this morning!          When he woke up he heard,''And now, Joseph  Kelleman!''What the heck was going on!He looked down and saw Matt giving him two thumbs up, and managing a slight smile. Ohhh, Matt had brought him up here. Well, now or never. He grabbed on, and he did it!While he swayed back and forth he saw his parents smiling.

Every morning its get up, get dressed, clean up after the animals, do your chores, eat breakfast, do some school work, practice, eat lunch, get ready for show, practice more for show and do the show.            I have to live like this everyday, it can get annoying, but you can't quit my family is in the circus with me. They can tell you how hard it is too, the clowns when I have time will sometimes let me ride their unicycles, its hard luckily I don't have to do that for a show, then I have to care for the animals more.             You will be surprised by how much you have to do shows, every few days you put on a new show. I have to help put up the tents, bring the animals in, fed the animals, get everything to the places they need to be and always be prepared for the worst in the circus life.             There are many animals we have to take care of, leopards, lions, tigers, elephants, chimpanzees and more but there are a lot of them. We have special trainers for the animals to do their acts with, I take care of the horses and elephants mostly, the elephants are the smelliest animal I'll ever meet!               My act is standing on two running horses, and then when they start getting farther apart I do the splits with my feet on different horse backs. Many of my family members travel with us, and other people I know come with us. Many of the people in the circus are either from my family, or my neighborhood I lived in.              Back when I lived in my neighborhood I went to sleep at 8 p.m. but here, I don't get to sleep till 12 in the morning. Living in the circus is hard, and it takes forever to get used to, but when you do get used to it, you won't ever go back.             Bad part is, if you wan to be an acrobat, you have to be right body shape and have determination. Some people join for fun, some wanting to see the world while having a fun job, many come by themselves and have no family with them. When you come by yourself, it feels like you are a stranger in a world of people knowing each other.            Life in the circus can be hard, after awhile of living with it you will start to like it. Being i the circus isn't just doing fun things all the time, it has to do hard work, determination and many chores and jobs you need to do, so don't think its all merry good time here, think and study what you do before you join.

Learning the circus routines is hard because you need to be on time when you are doing tricks and need to be confident in how you are doing. Circus performers do 10 shows a week and travel 20,000 miles in seven months just to do performances. All you do is work from sunup to sundown and after that, they still have to perform. Most circus performers are wiped out after they are done performing. They even cant go to bed until 12:00. Imagine riding a unicycle and doing a trick at the same time. Well that is what they do. They are always away from home and I cant even imagine being that home sick.           When you are in the circus, you live in a trailor. You sleep and groom yourself in there too. When circus performers wake up, they eat breakfast in a pie car which is where performers eat their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Can you imagine that?! Since performers perform at night, they dont eat much dinner before they go out on stage or else they will puke. They perform weekly plus a matinee which is an afternoon show. When most performers have nothibng to do, they are practicing. Kids practice juggling and scrobatics while adults practice flying up in the air and balancing on wires.            Now you know how hard it is in life in the circus. If you want to join the circus, make sure you are confident and ready for any expectations coming your way because you are in for a ride. Also be strong and practice practice practice. Remember, practice makes perfect.

I Christopher T will tell you what I do at the circus.       Circus workers work all day with very little brakes.   It can also be dangerous.Like if you fall of the tightrope during performance then your messed up big time!  One time a guy was doing a triple backflip off a elephant and he got all stomped on and died.  Thats why the circus doesnt like to hire people who will most likely do that these days.       Not everything at the circus is boring.The circus is dangerous doesnt   mean it isn fun.  It is fun because were risking to do stuff like that.  A very risky and my favorite is the human canon.  Its a canon used to launch performers through the air.       I live in South Carolina.Well at lease thats were I used to live there   before I became part of the circus.  Lets just say for now that I live everywere the circus goes to perform.  The reason why we can't live in a house is because we only stay for a week in one place and thene pack our bags and go somewere else to perform.       Wait,  I forgot to tell you guys about the things we do when were   not performing or practicing.  We still have to work no matter what.  I do chores (yep, we do chores still) like feed the animals.  We eat at a cart called a pie cart which doesnt have pies there sadly.  And we clean our own trailers.

First, his parents denied his request and  said,' The circus  is too dangerous for you to join. Your father and I both love you so much so we don't want to see you at a young age.'           'Well, I am an adult now so I have my own decisions of what I want to be. So, no matter you agree or not I am going to join the circus.            A few days later, Bob went to his room and packed up his clothes and everything else he needed.Since Bob had his own car, he took off driving to the Bellini Circus. When he arrived, he applied to join the circus. The manager said,' If you want to be in the circus, you'll need years of practice,'           ' Sure, I am all ready. I don't care if I have to practice for years, being a circus performer is my dream.', replied Bob.            The manager took  Bob to the room where all the newcomers belong. ' Bob, this will be the room that you practice in. If you need any help you can ask the teacher here, Jimmy.' Bob wanted to learn how to juggle so he took three balls and tried to juggle. He failed like 300  times but he did't give up. He walked up to Jimmy and asked,' Hey, Jimmy I need help on juggling balls.'            ' Jimmy took two balls and started juggling. See, Bob the trick is that you always keep your eyes on the balls so you won't loose control. Start just with two balls, learn from the basics.'             After two years of practice, Bob finally became a professional circus performer. He began juggling rings and walking on tightropes. He performed at the Bellini circus for five years. In the sixth year, he missed home. In the circus, there are no phones or any devices that can contact your relatives.  He started crying, whining that he wants to go home. He tried to sneek out of circus but got caught for about ten times.             At the performance in San Francisco, where his home is. He was performing walking on tightropes. He felt homesick when he was walking on the rope and he fell off. The manager annouced ' Sorry, one of our professional performer fell off the rope, named Bob.              A woman from the audience got out of her seat and walked to the performance area. It was Bob's mom. She looked at the performer named Bob and there it was, her son, laying down on the floor moaning in pain. ' Oh, poor Bob, if you had listened to me, you wouldn't be in a mess like this.            She dialed 911 and the ambulance came. They carefully put Bob in the ambulance and brought him to the hospital. The doctor said that he had his bones fractured in his right leg. When Bob woke up, he saw his mother. ' Oh, mom. Am I glad to see you. I was crying almost everyday because I missed home. Well, here I am, home in San Francisco. Oh by the way, thank you, mom for rescuing me from the circus. It was a nightmare! There are no phones to call home and barely any free time. All you do there is just practice, practice, and pactice.If I had just listened to you I wouldn't be here, in a hospital bed where my leg is fractured.'             When Bob's leg healed he went home and apologized to his mother and father for not listening to them. Later on, when Bob wanted a new job, he will always ask his parent if they agree or not.

My experience at the circus wasn't that great and i did feel bad for the girl at the circus when she fell and for me that circus experience wasn't the greatest but at least i got to go to the circus and that was my experience at the circus.

Sometimes it's hard becuase you have to dedicate yourself to go to the next level and you have to work day and night. After you have to practice doing tricks like doing flips summer-salting and that gets you exsuasted but you have to keep going and going. Then you have to dance and practice you acts. Next you have to travel all around the world and its hard because you have to live in the trailer.                               The you have to clean up and my clown friends help me clean up after the show then we all go to bed. Next we go to different country's and preform and sometimes we make friends with the people and the give use high fives and say good job. Next we pack up and we go to the next state and we preform. Then some of our tricks is that we walk on lines and try not to fall down. Next we ride  motocycles in a circle cage. All these tricks we do are hard so we have to practice and practice. After we make the animals do somet tricks too.                        All the things in the circus we do take lots of  practice and hard work.

You must do flexibility for an acrobat. You must be brave for dealing with the lions. You also must have funny jokes if you want to be a clown. Training is very important to join the circus.          Lastly you must do these following things:   You must get up get, dressed, eat breakfast, and then go to school like a normal child. You must finish school, come to the trailer, eat a snack, and then do your chores again like a normal child. Then you have to go practice for the circus when your done with your chores. After your practice, you eat dinner, and you must get ready for your show. Lastly, after your show you take a shower, brush your teeth, wash your face and get ready for bed. Then you have to repaet that routine every day.           That is how life in the circus is difficult and fun.

I am finnaly old enough to tame a lion and its a shocking surprise. This is not for me its for the audience.

When I was done with that I went to see the others.I saw some clowns going inside a little car which was amazing how they all fit. Then I went to see some circus acrobats. One of them fell off luckily there was a net underneath so the acrobat got off and climbed back up. I saw cirus jugglers tightrope walkers and circus horses.        I went back and groomed the horses. Some people were sent to put up posters everywhere. I looked out of the tent and noticed the sun going down. I also noticed alot of people buying some tickets. I know you must think if you did it you would get stage fright but once you get use to it it actully pretty fun. When everyone was seated and the sun went down a man yelled in a mircrophone, 'LETS BEGIN!' and so we did.Circus music played and I saw the tightrope walker walk slowly then fast, then a man threw a cane at the tight rope walker. The tight rope walker caught it almost falling off. I noticed a lot of shocked faces everywhere this shock was a surprised shock. There were some circus acro bats swinging and tossing each other. It was amazing how they dont fall its like there a feather when they get thrown in the air then they grab on amazing!        It was later my turn to do my trick I was thinking to my self i can do this and so i went on the stage with a whip on one hand and a chair on the other. I whipped the lion and the lion roared. I put my chair up quickly so I won't get attacked. The lion was sitting there doing nothing. I had to finish quickly or the audience will get bored. I added some things i whipped the lion hard and the lion got up fast. I yelled, 'ha! ha!' the lion was walking back into its cage. Everyone cheered a I noticed a scratch on my cheek. I bowed and went off stage. I watched some clowns get in a small car and drive around. I heard some people whispering and clapping.        I yawned as we were done. We took down the tent and we got in the pie car to travel to another place. Its fun but yet busy. Dangerous but normal. I grabbed some banges and put on my cheek. For my opinion its dangerous and hard. I would need more pratice. I wish i could tell more but im wiped out.

At first I thought it would be fun, but now that I'm in a circus I see that it is very challenging. Since I once worked at zoo, I agreed I would take care of the animals and train them. Its VERY hard work!!      Every morning I feed the horses, lions, seals, and chimpanzees. Next I go get somthing to eat at the pie car. Then I help set up the tents, lights, and music for tonights show.  A few other trainers and I work with the animals. Yesterday we got a new animal, a cheetah I named Namarah. I got to work with Namarah on jumping through a ring of fire. She did really good!!!!      That night people came through the tent talking, laughing and guessing what show we might put on for them. We were all nervous for the big show. We had planned to do things we had never done before! As Seth, the director of our circus walked out in front of the big crowed and started anouncing some things that we might do tonight, I help Namarah into her outfit.      The first to go out was Zan, our chimpanzee, and his trainer, Bob. As Zan juggled bowling pins and rode a unicycle I ran out with Namarah. Namarah jumped over obsticles and through tunnels. I heard some of the audiance go 'OOOHHH' and 'AAAHHH'. Namarah stopped where she was supposed to, to start getting ready to jump through the Ring of Fire. I set the tiny ring a couple yards away from Namarah and set it on fire. She stared at me, fear in her eyes. I mouthed ' Do it just like we been practicing.' She seemed to understand. I saw her load back and fire herself right and the ring. Then she leaped, I held my breath and closed my eyes.       All of a sudden I heard screams of joy and clapping. I open my eyes to see Namarah standing right next to me, rubbing her head against my leg. I bend down and look her right in the eyes and say 'You did great!!!!!!.' Then I kiss her on top of the head, and she licks me in the face. I stand back up again and take a bow, I see Namarahs eyes sparkle with joy.     I learned that a circus life is tough but Namarah always makes it fun.

He told me we are heding to the circus he asked me do you want to come Isaid''yeah''. he said if i wan'ted to do the aked with him I said ''yeah'' but can I be a juggler and he said ''I will ask''.I was glad i might be able to be a juggler I just hope they say yes. So when we got there they said NO but you can be a play the circus horses aked I said ''okay''. I was nerves when it was my uncle the clown he did a good gob and thoose jokes were funny but then the boss said I had to work with his neffue ozzie.

So my uncle sed do you want to come to the next circus at Las Vagas I said sure any time so I had to go with him on the circus train and ozzie told me that his uncle said  that we can do the juggler. So we practice and practice till we got a hang of it and we still practice so we could do a good job the day before the show we were nerves so we went to the pie cart and we ate a little because we had practice after when we went to practise we found that our torches were missing we looked every werebut there were gone we went to go ask ozzie's uncle and he said he didn't have them ether so we went to go ask our teacher and we got lucky she cot someone stealing them so she told him give them to me but now I can give them back to you guys so now we got there and we practice one last time before the show started but this time we practice on the stage my uncle said we did an exellent gob when it was my uncle's turn he did his aked with some one else and there was a big crowd so if we mess up they would never come back again and we won't get MONEY.

The circus travels many places in a year so you won't really see your family unless their in the same circus too.       As you can see life in a circus is very hard.

He said it was 'Amazing.'   he told his mom to park already,so she did.   He ran as fast as he can to go buy food and drinks so he can get in the tents fast and get front row seats.                  After waiting for thirty minutes the lights when off and the other shining lights turned on.   All Frank was focus on was the animals.   Frank loved animals and was so excided he saw them on stage.   The host came out with a stick and cards on his hand then said, 'Lady`s and Gentlemen, put your hands together for the Jugglers.'  Frank saw many Jugglers some of them even had sticks with fire and some juggling rings.   Frank was so amazed he couldn`t keep an eye off the show.   Until he saw the Lion Tammer.             The Lion Tammer was herting the poor lion than he got so sad he didn`t even want to see that part.   Thankfully that part was over and Frank was able to enjoy the show know.   Frank was ready to see the Acrobats.   He likes how they swing up into the air.   'It looks like they are flying, he says.   Frank likes how the Acrobats work together to swing up in the the air.   The Acrobats bowed  and it was time for the clowns.          'The entrance was funny ', said Frank. They came out of the curtains in a tiny  car and when the clowns came out there was about seven clowns that came out of the tiny car.   Frank was wondering how they all fit in the tiny car it was the size of his dog`s house.    'The clowns were really funny ', said Frank.  It was the end of there act and everyone was clapping.    Frank was still wondering how all seven clowns fit in one tiny car.             The show ended about two hours later.    It was so great.

I was waiting at the end of the tight rope, waiting for the signal that let me on. I was extremely nervous, but excited at the same time. I was supposed to be on a unicycle, and juggling five balls across the tight rope. The horses and the elephants were out. It was my turn. I mounted my unicycle. I made sure that I had the five balls in my hand, and started out on the rope. I wobbled at first but I don't think anyone noticed.

I was falling.....spinning forward,and sideways, I landed on the trampoling with a SMACK!!!, and fell off of it. I luckily landed on my feet. I wasn't badly hurt, on the outside. The inside of me was what hurt the most. I had let my whole team down. I just smiled, and ran out. Back stage, everyone crowded aruond me. They all asked me if I was okay. I told them all that I was sorry, and I had let them down. We were sure to lose the contest now.                         At the end of the show, the announcer told the winner. It was us!!!! Everyone cheered! It was great!! I had no idea how though... I mean.. I fell. The other team did perfect. Later I talked to the announcer and asked him how we won. He told me that I did absolutely wonderful, and the way that I had jumped off the rope, spun in the air, landed on the trampoline, and bounced off with a perfect landing on the feet! I was amazed! Did he really think that I had done that on purpose?! I started to tell him what had really happened, but the crew came in and told me I was late to celebrate!

I sighed, and started to slide out of my bed on a circus trailer. I looked at the clock on the wall-6:51 A.M. I decided that, since I normally got out of bed at 7:00 A.M., nine more minutes of sleep wouldn't hurt. I plopped back down onto my bed and started to close my eyes.        I was awoken again by a light knock on my door. I bolted out of bed and looked at the clock again-7:16 A.M. I had overslept for the first time! I quickly got dressed and went to the pie car. There, I found that most of the performers were already done with breakfast. The ringmaster noticed me and said, 'Is this the first or second time you overslept, Emily?' I sighed once more when the ringmaster had gone. The day was already starting out badly.         I quickly finished breakfast and went to the schoolhouse. Fortunately, that went well, unlike when I got up and, as I would soon find out, my practice and performance time.        At 3:30 P.M., school was over, and it was break time. I saw that we had arrived in our destination-Kansas City. I played a short while with my teacup chihuahua, Teacup, and started practice early, thinking that would make up for me oversleeping. Unfortunately, that was not true.       I began my practice as normal. I started to jump from a trampoline onto a horse's back. After several times of doing this, I began to relax and daydreamed that nobody had noticed me oversleep. My daydreams eventually evolved into a dream of seeing my family and living back in Miami, Florida. Oh, how I missed that time. But I had taken a liking to acrobatics and determinedly joined the circus when I was 11. Now I had been in the circus for five years now. I have traveled all over North and South America. Now, still daydreaming, I leaped again from the trampoline, imagining I was bouncing down the stairs. 'THUMP!' I was jolted from my daydream by pinpricks of pain shooting up my leg.       I was surprised to find myself sprawled in the dirt, wondering how I had gotten there. I had thought I was jumping down the stairs to the a kitchen. I then remembered that I was in the circus, and I was practicing jumping off a trampoline onto a horse's back. I realized I had jumped straight off a trampoline 15 feet in the air with no horse to support my fall.       Wincing, I tried to get up. I made the mistake of putting my weight on my injured right leg and collapsed. I heard other performers arriving for practice. A man leading an elephant saw me first. He ran to me and called to the others for the ringmaster. He then also left to find the ringmaster. No! I thought. I already have embarrassed myself once, but I will not be embarrassed twice! I slowly got up, and started to limp around. After a while, the pain in my leg subsided, so I decided to continue practicing as if nothing had happened. The ringmaster arrived with a worried face. I rushed up the trampoline.       Seeing me seemingly all right, the ringmaster's expression changed from worried to confusion. He then became angry. He turned to the man who was leading the elephant and started to scream something about tricking him. I just continued to practice, trying to ignore the pain in my leg.        After dinner, we all started to prepare for the show. By now, the pain in my leg had nearly gone, so I decided I could make it though the show. My mind insisted on it-performing in a circus show, having fun performing, and seeing the audience so absorbed into my performance were the reasons I joined.        I went with the others backstage. After a while, I heard the announcer announce my name. I took a deep breath. In. Out. Shakily and painfully, I got to my feet. I went in the direction of the stage. In. Out. I emerged onstage, and I heard the audience clapping. In. Out. I climbed the trampoline and waited for my horse, Creamy, who was named for the color of her fur, mane, and tail. Not yet. Not yet. NOW! I jumped off the trampoline just as my leg bent in an awkward position-the position my leg was in when I fell at practice.        I lurched in midair, and was about to slam into the ground. My life is over, I thought. I had forgotten about the safety net, and had not set it up. But just then, Creamy doubled back and, amazingly,  caught me. The audience clapped again, thinking this was part of the show. I rode Creamy back backstage while murmuring to her softly, praising her.        When the show was over, the ringmaster praised Creamy too, saying I was lucky to have such a brilliant horse. If not, I would have died that day.        Nearly a month has passed since then. My leg has long since healed, and I continue to practice and perform successfully with Creamy, my life-saving friend and companion.

The circus let's you travel places you've never been before while travaling with your new family.                                    You should join the circus because you can travel to new places. Here are a few reasons why . First, you will be able to go on many adventures with your 'family.' For example, you may go to Hawaii for a performance and have fun snorkling. Next, you will be able to try new foods. You can try some exotic Chinese food that you have never tried before. Finally, you will be able to explore new cultures. You can go to India and learn about their culture and festivals like Diwali.                        Join the circus because you can make a new and supportive family. Not convinced, i'll give you a few reasons. First, you will have many people who will care for you and love you just the way you are. Some kids in school might be insulted because of their flexibility. In the circus you won't  have that problem because your family and friends all are very flexible. Next, you will h ave people who unerstand you. if you feel down or angry your family will know how to comfort you because they have probably been through this before. Finally, you will have someone to trust because in the circus, most of the people there are very well trained.                          Joining the circus made my life better. If you love gymnastics and dancing, try joining you might find your home while touring the world!

My teacher clapped her hands and said, 'Students, I have an important announcement to make. Our school has won one rare ticket from the five to attend the Bellini Circus in the front row seats! That's right, one of you very lucky students will be able to win the free ticket by writing the best essay in class'.       As I walked home with my best friend we both discussed how we would write a essay. The instant I reached home, I started to write my essay:       'If anyone would think special talents were gifted to you, that is wrong. Even people in the circus must work harder than ever; often sacrificing extra time with friends and family to achieve their dream of performing in the circus. Take Philippa for example. When she was 11, she had her heart set on being a performer. She gave up everything and concentrated on her dance and performing. This is how to achieve your dreams.       Being part of a circus doesn't mean a free pass from school, in fact the one room classroom has everything a regular class has from a whiteboard to tests. Since circus performers are from around the globe, classrooms are often filled with a 'mixed bag' of students. The circus performers live in a trailer where there is a pie car (it is like a restaurant), a classroom, and of course a home for performers to live in.                                                                                                              When school is over it is time for some fun; circus style. The children get to see what the others are training and finally, kids get to try some tricks them self. People in the circus must be daring and adventurous. Tricks may include: leaping form a trampoline onto a horse's back, somersaulting from a horse's back, acrobatics, juggling, walking baby leopards on leashes, and training animals such as elephants, lions and chimpanzees.       Like all other jobs, working in a circus has ups and downs. One of the upsides is that you get to travel around the world. Performers get to meet people from around the world with interesting backgrounds. Another pleasure is the thrill of performing in front of a live audience. The downside of working in a circus is that circus performers  work for long periods of hours. In addition, performers are away from their family and home.       As you an see circus performers have a different, but somewhat hard life. If you work hard, your dream can come true'.       I looked down at my essay, and realized that I didn't care to win. Writing this essay was the gift after all. I had learned so much about the circus and realized that I might want to be there. I might want to do that. Being a glamorous star of the circus became my dream that day.       The next day, I walked to school with my essay in my hand. I told myself, 'I don't want to win, I have already won a big dose of inspiration'.       I handed in my essay in the morning as the teacher smiled. In an hour the teacher would announce the winner. As the clock ticked, it was hard for me to concentrate. Finally, the teacher announce the winner, and it was me. I had won a front seat ticket to the Bellini Circus. My career seemed to fly from then on. I got to meet Philippa, and she gave me a few words on how to succeed. I worked harder than ever at gymnastics now. I decided that I would awe the audience with my difficultly and flexibility. That is how I reached my dream and became The star of the circus. I was nicknamed Philippa #2. I tell youngsters around the world that it all started with a little dose of inspiration.

Ihave been in the circus for almost 9 years. So let get with the subject.When i am practicing it takes all you got we have to dance, jump,jugle,throw fire, and do even harder more dangerous stuff.We practice for more than 2 whole months.Then we perform in the circus.           When we get to the circus we have to set up everything then start.It is not easy,it is a very tough job.I love my job though. I think the toughest thing is the string i hate it.You have to be very balanced espeally on the one wheel bike.           When we dont put on a good show we are very disapionted,becuase we work so hard on being in the circus it really puts us downn. after we know that we just needed more practice on our work so we can do better next time.when we dont do a good job our directer will make it harder on us and in our practices.When it is so bad we can get kicked off of the whole team intill we are ready to do better and make more progress.               so that is preety much about the circus life. It can get trickey and a little to hrad but it is worth it if you just try your best and belive thaat you can make mor progress the next time.So be ready for the time of your life cause your not want to miss it.

The show was about to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       First there was a man and woman holding onto ropes swinging back and forth. Then the lady let go and the gentleman caught her.  Then the man let go. The woman fell, but as she was falling she grabbed onto a laced rope that hung from the ceiling. she gracefully went down the rope. The crowd went roaring.               After that some clowns came out on unicycles. They kept falling and bumping into each other. It was very funny.  then there was a lion. It jumped and roared. It did its master told it to. There were also people on horses doing tricks. Then there was a man  that walked  across a tightrope. There was also a woman that was able to put herself in a very small box. then there was a man juggled many figure.             IT was very interesting and exciting to see all of those amazing acts. At the end of the show we were able to meet some performers and ride on the horses. It was a night I will never forget.

To begin with you have to train many things that you do in your performance you have to be training for many many hours and you got to now what you are practiceing or else when you do your preformense you will do the wrong one, you also need to practice juggling it could take you like three years to learn how to juggle. Mostly what takes you to a lot of years to practice is to be a acrobat because you need to hold on to another person for for a few secons.                                                                                                                                        On the other hand you have to jump off many things while all of your performances, when you are practicing jumping off thing you also need to put a trampaling in the bottom so if you fall you land there, and you need to pactice almost all day to now how to jump from here to there and you need to start little to little before you start to jump all of the of the big tall things.                                                                                                                                   Thirdly you also need to practice holding on to ropes while holding on to another person that takes you many hours an days and weeks, because you have to hold on to the person then bring them up to the handle and you have to bring your self up with no hand just use youre legs to push your self up and some times you have to hold on with a hook atached to your foot.                                                                                                                                       Fourthly you also need to learn how to do the splittes if your a women. It takes you a few days to learn how to do the splittes and you use it when you are doing acrobat while you are on the ground but if you are a guy it takes you a few weeks maybe months, when you start to now how to do it you start to it from little things to big things.

Circus life is far from all fun and games.  Every day, and sometimes twice a day, we entertain a large audience for many hours.  Everyone works from dawn to dusk.  Here is our normal schedule:       6:30 A.M.: Wake up and prepare for yet another long day.  We head to the pie car for a quick breakfast.        8:00 A.M.: Time for a long, boring day of school.  All the kids are packed into an extremely small trailer, which makes learning hard.  Just like a normal, non-traveling school, our school has tests and progress reports.        3:30 P.M.: School's out!!!  But the work is just beginning.  We have to practice for tonight's show, and for the following shows.  While the crew continues to set up for the show, all the performers practice their respective stunts, such as walking on a tightrope, training wild animals, juggling objects, and jumping on to and off of a horse.  Beinng a good circus performer takes, balance, determination, and concentration.       6:00 P.M.: Everybody returns to the pie car for a light dinner.       7:00 P.M.: Showtime.       10:30 P.M.: The show is finally over.  The audience really enjoyed the performance!  I managed to juggle three bowling pins!  However, I am very tired and eager to go to bed.       11:00 P.M.: I hop into bed.       Circus life is a very tough life.  But it is also very fun. So despite the downsides of circus life, I enjoy it and am eager to take the stage for every performance.

Then, he brings out this big long whip looking thing and pretty much tames the lions. Came out the swinging trapeze and they grabbed to the ropes one after the other. It was so cool! Next ,came out the tightrope and the girl hoped up on it and cut flips, jumped, and sprinted across the rope. At half time my family and I got up to get popcorn and I rode the giant elephants. After halftime was over the clowns came out and stole the show. They had everyone laughing and cheering.  When the circus was finally over i got some of the clowns autograph and met some of the performers. In all, the circus was a fantastic experience and the next time we have a circus i am definitely going to it.

I hope to be one of the numerous animal trainers.        We usually stay in a town for a week and then do strenuous work to pack up.  That is what I hate the most. I meet lots of people and many new friends.  Our portable school is just like any else.  It has computers and report cards and we have grades like everyone else.  I really strive toward one day going to a real school and meeting regular people.  I want to live in a neighbor- hood and have friends.       One day I decided to watch a circus show.  I pretended I was a kid in the crowd and it was so cool.  I saw lion tamers and people swinging on the trapeze.  I told myself that one day I would be that good.

I finally get to sleep. Too bad I can't party in the pie car with everyone else because of mom and dad. Mom and dad are so mean to me. They say I have to be in the circus 'till I'm 65, and I can't party inthe pie car 'till I'm 18. And you know what? Today is my birthday. I'm turning 18 today, and I didn't even ggo to the party. They completly forgot. Maybe they don't even care about me..... I don't know.            I'm sorry I don't do this every day, but I barely get even a spare second in a week. From 7:00am to 10:30pm every day, I work and practice my horse riding standing and dismounting my horse, Shamrock. I don't even get a full education. I only do school work 3 hours a day, and right now I'm supposed to be in college.            Today my schedule was even worse. Mom made me practice during school, so I missed learning what an antacedent is. Dad made me do the heap of dishes in the pie car, because I didn't put my dish in the sink. Also, the director got mad at me when on of my bells flew off my bracelet Annie gave me last year. I don't even know if Annie is my friend or not. She just is kind to me. We're both the same age, and we have a lot in common, but she has been avoiding me lately.            Although, one part was good today. I finally did everything perfect on my routine during practice, but my directer didn't even notice I did it flawlessly. The only person(thing) that noticed me was Shamrock, and he was licking and slobbering all over me.           Today was horrible, with one good part, but in the circus isn't that bad, especially when I can actually talk to someone(something) that will listen.

I wake up and go to the pie car to have breakfast. I usually have scrambled eggs and pancakes. Everyone is startingto set things up for tonight's show.       9:00 A.M. I go to school. I learn different languages, sometimes on a computer. When I travel the world, I'll have to know how to speak to the audience!       3:00 P.M.

I have to jump on a charging horse.            The horse is released, and I get ready for the jump. when the horse gets close, I jump! If I time it right, I will land on the horse and I will be able to gain control of it. It is a terrifying trick, but I've gotten used to it!

Now that made me mad! But that's why i came to Rome. So i can get a fresh start as an acrobat!I have been here for a month and am having my first audience tomorrow. I have been going to the town gym to practice.It was tough competition at the try out but i thought i did well and that's all that maters. i hope i get the part.           I got the results and......I GOT THE PART I AM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!! Plus the stage crew seemed really nice. My first practice is tomorrow night,my first gig is next week.                                    *Next week at the show*       My first show was very difficult, i messed up twice,and if i mess up again I'm fired!  So i decided i need to practice more before my show in 2 days.        At the gym I worked on all the gymnastic stuff. i practiced for hours and hours until it was completely perfect......That took a while.After that i thought i would go out for ice cream at freezable. I was told it was the best ice cream in the world!       Then i went home and slept i needed my sleep for tomorrows show.       When i woke i looked at the clock. It was 4:30 P.M. I was late and for sure i was going to be fired. So i ran down to the circus as fast as I could and when i got there everyone was upset.      I went around to my booth and got ready but still no one came to there booths. Then  was soon as i knew it everyone was at my side. Yelling 'where have you been we had to cancel the show because you didn't show!' I said 'I'm so sorry it won't happen again.'     after that the little magic man came and said 'But it's ok because here we're all a family and we stick together.' Every one agreed and called back on the show and in the end I found my true family!

She had long black hair and big brown eyes. Her lips were full and her eyelashes long. Her body shape looked as if it was good enough to be a gymnast. There was nothing more she could possibly want. She had her own room, painted rose pink. Her name was painted on one of the walls. By the time she was eight, she was spoiled rotten. She had candy in her room. She had decorations in her room. All the children at her school adored her because she would always get money from her mom, take it to school, and give them some or buy them something.             One day, when Tiara took money to school, she lost her money somewhere in the school. she asked everyone if they saw it but they all had no clue where it was. She began to cry. Everyone in the area looked at her and began whispering in each others ear. She could hear them say, 'Is she really crying over money? I can't be friends with a crybaby so everybody can be talking about me.' Could this be the end of her popularity? All because of crying? She stood up and told every one to stand up and empty their pockets. Right when she said that everybody did so, maybe she didn't lose her popularity after all. as soon as Joe emptied his pockets there it was, low and behold, Tiara's $50.00!              Everyone gasped. 'Joe, how could you?' everyone gasped. Joe apologized to Tiara but she did not forgive him. It is one thing to borrow, but stealing is not the way. Soon it was time to go outside for carpool. When Tiara got into the car she told her mom what happened. As long as Tiara had her money back her mom was not disappointed.

The people had just arrived to the Bellini circus people buying popcorn and cotton candy the performers getting ready for the show and the family's waiting impatiently for the show to start. The lead act was the clowns doing some jokes and some other stuff but just as the clowns ended the circus tent collapsed. People were going crazy this was just like when the Minnesota vikings stadium collapsed except there was nobody in the dome when that happened but today there were thousands of people. The circus director was going crazy so he called the fir department. When the fire department got there they evacuated the rest of the people that hadn't already left the structure. Then the manager soon found out all of the circus animals got loose so he had to call animal control to wrangle the animals. Then came news that some people got injured so we called the medics. They ended up being okay they were just minor injuries. There was still major chaos all around and in the tent.''What happened'' and ''What's going on'' were questions a lot of people had when leaving the venue. They found out that people outside the tent did something to make the tent collapse and fall. To this day nobody knows how the tent fell and who did it. It will probably remain unknown forever. At the end of it all nobody died and only one animal they didn't get back a baby elephant.

(As you can probably tell) I play the part of an Acrobat. I work night and day. Most people think that being in a circus means that you get to play all the time, but that is not true. The circus is about hard work and dedication. I've been working at the circus for 10 years and I still haven't gotten the hang of the schedule.The circus may be a fun place to work at, too, despite all the bad stuff, but you still have to travel a lot of tedious road trips. You also have to put up with schools and colleges that are a little too much on the wacky side.                      If you're wondering why I chose to be an acrobat, my answer would be that doing all that work really pays off when you show all your awesome moves, like front flips and jumping off and catching yourself, to the world (where-as other jobs don't pay off as much).                     One really awesome thing that is probably the reason I joined the circus is that instead of sitting in a desk and looking at a book for geography, we get to see our geography lessons come to life as we travel the world, now that is something truly amazing. So if you're looking for a job and love to meet new people and do new things, why not the circus, you got nothing to loose.

Since I am in the circus I do not get to see my family and it is very hard for me because I miss them so much. Lots of the other people that are in the circus like me even though I am much younger than them.       Circus life is very hard. You have to practice basically all day. This afternoon I practice for nearly four hours. before that I had a delicious breakfast with bacon and eggs in the pie cart. I am lucky to get such good food from the Pie cart. Lots of parts of being the circus is fun too because I get to be the clown and get to use unicycles and juggling balls and make people laugh. In the circus life is fun and hard.       This is it. It is time to go on stage. I only have one part on stage and it isn't very long. I can't wait. First I act as a mime and pretend I am in a box, even though I am not. Now I am done and I have to put my clown uniform on.       You have to change into new clothes very fast in the circus business. Now I am trying to sell cotton candy and other foods and condiments. It is pretty easy. Tonight I have sold lots of food and now I have to entertain the audience. I am now walking over to a baby. He is very cute. I have a great joke to pull on him. I will run up, jump right over his seat and scare him. Ready, set, go! I ran up and scared him but right when he saw me he started crying loudly.I felt bad so bad. He was crying so loudly that the tightrope walkers on stage were balancing on a rope and got distracted by the loud crying. Lots fell and got badly injured. Soon I heard ambulances. The worst thing was it was all my fault.       Lots of people yelled at me because I ruined people on set had never yelled at me since I came here. I was was scared the most of my boss coming toward me. I new I was fired. One thing I noticed was the crowd was laughing as if it was part of the act. Once my boss came close the only two words he said was 'Thank you.' He said 'We made so much money that it doubled most of high paid shows, even though it wasn't part of the show it was still amazing.' What Harry just noticed was that the tightrope walkers were still on there feet and were in their ending pose. What a show!

But behind all that fun, many things happen. The circus is very busy. You have to set up for the show, you have to practice for the show, and do chores. Life in the circus is so busy and tough. This is the life in the circus...                   Long busy hours happen in the circus. But you can't just walk in a circus and be like, 'Oh, I want to be a trapeze artist'. You have to have some sort of talent. Like myself I have the talent to be very flexible. So I'm a acrobat. But also, you have to be focused, sometimes I can't do a trick and I fail.                   Sometimes in the circus you feel lonely. I know you have all the people traveling with you but, you are far away from your family. You also spend a lot of time away from home. A lot of the time, I miss my family, my home, and my belongings. It's very tough being in the circus.                    All together everything in the circus is fun. But it also can be very tough. So next time when you see circus perfromers, think about all the hard work they put into their talent. Many things happen in the circus.

You can't just say I want to become a circus performer, you have to train for it. For instance, if you want to do acrobats, you have to have the right body and you have to train for it. If you want to do juggling you have to just train for it. It seems so easy, but sometimes it seems as if you kind of risk your life. Like if your somersaulting off of a running horse, that seems like your risking your life, but that's what trainings for.             It also seems that the circus performers are more your family then your regular family. It seems like this because you are traveling so much and your always away from home. You really have to put your heart in it and concentrate because if you don't, then you might mess up and you don't want that to happen in front of all those people.             And of course you don't just go to school and train, you have to do chores too. You might have to feed the animals, groom the animals, help clean up after every show, or just help get ready for every show. And when your in the circus you usually work from sun up to sun down. So your going to be busy every hour of the day.               It also seems that if your in the circus traveling all the time, you might get a really good experience if your paying attention. It seems like this because you get to travel all around the world. You would probably get to travel to Japan, Russia, Ireland, or even Australia.              And it seems that being in a circus makes you famous because you are well known, and people are amazed by what you can do, and since they're so amazed they tell every one to go see the show. Then when the word gets around, people start to know your name and ask for autograghs. And thats why I think that your famous when your a circus performer.               And when your on tour and away from home. It seems as if you really have no place to call home because your always moving from one place to another. Your going to always be thinking about how your going to do on tonights show, or how everyone else is going to do that effects you.               I've always wondered if the circus performers ever missed their real home and family. I've wondered this because they usually call their circus performing friends family and home. But who knows they might not.              And now that I've talked about how hard it is to be a circus performer, would you want to be a circus performer? If you do, then what would you do, would you do juggling or trapeze? What would you do in the long hours of a circus life?               And like I've said, performing in a circus seems very fun, but it is very hard work. It is also a great experience too. So if your interested in going to a circus, then go to one and see the amazing things they've worked so hard on.

She wakes up in the morning and gets dressed. She dressed in normal khakis and a Nike shirt. She walked to the pie car to get some food.As Lila finished, she saw telling a worker to move the tent further right. The man seemed confused, he did`t seem   to like his job. After breakfast, she walked to the school house.            When she got to the schoolhouse she saw her friend typing up a report on a test at the computers. She smiled and waved. She quickly turned around, I guess because she had to finish the test. Lila walked to her desk and waited for class to begin. When class did begin, she had a good time. They took a test, though, which wasn`t   very fun. Finally it was time to leave. When she walked out it was warm and she wanted to play outside but she had to practice. Lila takes care of the animals.            Lila walks over to a leopard named Carter. She`s known him since kindergarten, when she started. Carter purrs as Lila puts the leash on him. They walk around the area were the tents are being set up and booths are being assembled. Carter was so big and strong at one point Lila rode on his back. Her mother saw her and laughed,   ' Carters getting big isn`t he.' she smiled. Lila just nodded.        Lila fed Bacon the elephant. She loved feeding Bacon. When she was little she got to name him. She had just ate breakfast so she named him her favorite food. When she got done feeding all the animals, and grooming the horses she took a break. It was really nice to relax. Sadly, though, she had to stop at 6:30 for dinner. Soon   her family was done because they have to eat fast. They have a show at 10:30 so they had to rush. By the time it was 10:00 Lila was ready to go. She wore a blue uniform that had shiny purple stripes.            The show was starting and Lila was hugging her leopard close. She was very,very anxious to go on stage, but   Carter made her feel fine. Finally it was show time. Lila and Carter ran up stage. Carter couldn`t stand it, but   Lila always made him wear a tutu. Carter jumped through fiery hoops. Lila spun and juggled and flipped and   hurdled through the air.           As the show spiraled on Carter snuggled and purred as he slep on Lila`s feet. Everyone walks back to the trailers for some reason Carter doesn`t want to go in his cage. He never does on show days. Carter and I both   walk to my trailer and we fall asleep. Carter loves it here at the circus and so do I. There is so much things to do   being here.            Sometimes I wonder what it will be like at other places then the circus. Carter doesn`t want to leave, neither   do I. I hope I can stay here forever.

Part 2. It was my second day and I was about to redo my acrobatic event. Then like magic the rope holding me snapped or got cut off once more. I was falling. Then POOF!

Then they  sat down to watch the act.        The first act was the acrobats they were jumping down   from the 10 store high ladder onto a net and it was funny   then a horse was walking up a ladder then went onto a tite   rope and then i cant believe this but the horse did not fall   but it almost did that was the best so far.

For a moment, she was confused. What am I doing here? she thought. Suddenly, the moments of the day before came rushing to her mind. She had been selected to perform in the Bellini Circus as an acrobat. She had been led to a trailer that she was to share with another acrobat, Betsy White. As if the thought had conjured her up, Betsy stood before her, calling  cheerfully,  'Time to get ready!'  The tall, freckled girl always seemed to have a smile. Angela quickly scrambled to change out of her pajamas. The shows were at night, so she didn't need her outfit yet.           Betsy showed her around the circus area after they went to the pie car for breakfast. At 9, they had school. Betsy enjoyed it thoroughly and made many friends, some of which came from different countries!           After school, Angela, Betsy, and their friends ate dinner and quickly changed into their outfits. Angela was exhilarated. She loved seeing the audience and feeling like they had come all the way just to see her! After the show, Angela changed out of her outfit. She crawled into bed and fell asleep immediately, she was so exhausted. She dreamed about the circus and the happy times she would  have.

He sprinted to the train staition. He ran on to the train and sat down.            He was scared when he sat down next to this guy with a gun in his pocket, so he moved by a girl with brown hair and blue eyes. The train started to go. The train was going 150 miles per hour. Before he new it they were at the Circus. Joe walked into the back of the Circus tent. He asked this guy if he could be in the Circus and the guy said'What skills do you have'. 'I can shoot out of a cannon' said Joe. 'You show me that' said the guy. They walked over by the cannon Joe asked the guy what his name is and he said 'Bob'.

But the first story tells you, what time you wake up and what time everything is. You wake up at 7:00 AM you wake up get dressed eat. 9:00 AM you go to school the school haves one room. 3:30 PM chores and practice feed you're pet and anything else. 6:30 PM time to eat, don't eat to much you have a show tonight. 10:30 PM the show is over and you wiped out you walk back to the trailer and see all the circus offices,concession stands, stables and trailers. In a couple days you will be somewhere else to perform. 12:00 AM you're in bed thinking about the end of you're tour. It will be nice to go back to you're home but you will miss performing. All of the practice you need for your next show will be tiring. You can't just go and join a circus out of no where and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. You need that skill in you, the right body type and you have to be able to be focused. You have to put you're heart into all of your work. It can't be sloppy. Did you know there are millions of people in the world who would like to be in a circus? Well there is! There is a bunch. I learned that being in a circus is a lot of work. ?       You need all of the makeup, practice, strength, flexibility, focus. You need a lot. You will need lots and lots of practice to become a performer for a circus. I learned a clown needs a lot of makeup and they need to be nice and they need to be funny. Circus Acrobats, need makeup, outfits, patience, focus, and most of all they need to put they're heart into their performance. A circus juggler needs skills too juggle all sorts of things. A tightrope walker needs balance practice focus and also put their best into it. The trainers have to train the animals right so they know what to do. The trainers need to make sure they train the animals so they don't get scared and run off and destroy the performance. The crew who makes all the tents,trailers,outfits , and all the other stuff they need to make sure they are in there place. and not some where they shouldn't.      Working in a circus is a ton of work as you see. You need the makeup, outfits, performance and the skills. When you're on a tour you really don't have a place to call 'home'.Sometimes you might think to you're self i miss my family, friends and house back home but on tour you're having fun. Working at a circus is long hours and weekends. When you work at a circus i bet its fun to perform and do all those fun stunts you do. I also learned that yeah the practices are long and hard but when all those people see how amazing the performance is they will wanna come and watch again, or maybe you will inspire them to try out working at a circus. The Performances are 10 whole shows a week yeah its a lot but its worth it. When you work at a circus you travel all over the world to like japan , florida , california, colorado and other states like that. well thats what i learned about the circus life.

After I practice, we go to the pie car once again for dinner, After dinner is when things settle down, I have time to play and have quality time with my family and then go to bed. Everyone seems to think that circus life is fun and high flying, well people who think that are wrong, circus life is really tough, for example, you have to have the right body,  talent and you have to be determined.       You cant go to the circus and expect to be a acrobat, lion tamer or stuff like that right off the bat, it takes lots of training to get to the point where you can actually perform in front of a live audience. If you want to be a good performer, you have to give up everything else and focus on the circus.        Although its a very tough and busy life for me and my family, it can also be very fun. When you are a performer you have the chance to travel the world, you meet lots of new people, and the people from the circus are like a family to me.        A downside to this life though, is that you don't really have a place to call your home. You are everywhere and your always thinking about the upcoming show. You work really hard for the circus and sometimes its not fun at all because you have to learn things that are hard for your body to do.

Well this story is about circus tricks and some circus performers that do those tricks.                Jake Flamer an acrobat who is in the circus has an amazing job. He Is from Australia. He is a tight rope walker and swings on the bars. He also has a team of 34 people.                      Jake Flamer, one of his performers in Italy did amazingly well. One of his flips went 8 feet high above the bars. On the tight rope he juggled 5 bowling pins while walking on the tight rope. Another one is he jumped off the tight rope onto the swinging bars. The crowd was amazed. That was one of his most amazing performances. I would like to see Jake flamer preform.                There are other jobs in the circus. The tiger act is another performance. One tiger act is walking the tiger. But first you have to get the leash on it. Then you can walk it. Bella Castini`s neighbors do that. They are professionals. They do that with tigers and leopards.                         There are also magic trick performers. Jenna Keorner is a magic trick performer. She puts people in a box and makes them disappear. She also puts people in a box and cuts them in half and puts them back together. That is another job in the circus.                                  Those are just some of the jobs in the circus. That is why I should go to the circus.

Like any other school they have computers, test, and report cards.       Many of the people in our school speak many different languages so that's why they come here. Some of the circus performers speak: French, Russian, and Italian. Next at 3:00 P.M. school ends and we have time for a quick break. We usually have fun. Then at 3:30 P.M. it's time for chores and practice. I have to feed, water, and groom the horses that we use in our horseback acts.       Dinnertime for my family is at 6:30 P.M.

I had never been to a circus. I was planning to go. But on the side of it, it said,  '$55.95 for each person or instead, make a poem about clowns, turn it in, and if you get an approval, you will win a free ticket to the circus.' There was no way I could get that money in time, I thought. Anyways, I only had $0.50 in my piggy bank. I made the right choice. I decided to make a poem.         During school, I was thinking about writing that poem. I wasn't paying attention to all the subjects my teacher had taught. As days and days passed on, I only had two days left until it was to late. At home, I finally picked up my pencil and started to write:                                                                                   Clowns                                                                         Victoria Kozuchi                                                Clowns are funny, Clowns can be colorful                                        Clowns can also come in various shapes and sizes                                   They make kids and babies laugh. They have big red noses.                             So what else can they do? They all have abilities just like me and you!               The next day, I turned it in. The manager liked it and approved it. I was so happy! I got two tickets for me and ....   I didn't have another person to go with. I thought to myself. Then, an answer came to me. On the following day when I was going to the grocery store, I found a girl who was staring at the same poster I saw. She seemed like she was from my school. I asked her if she was going to the circus. She said,'No, I don't have that kind of money.'I asked her if she wanted to come to the circus with me. She replyed,'Sure!'            It was the day of the circus. We didn't have front row seats, but we had second row seats. It was better than nothing. When the show started, the crowd was clapping and cheering. We seemed like we were both amazed at the juggling act and the circus acrobats. Soon horses came running up in the stage and they looked like bright, shiny unicorns. Lastly, a tightrope walker walked across the rope. It felt like he was going to fall, but he didn't. After the show, we met a clown. He made us both two heart shaped balloons. Caroline, the girl who came with me said,'Thank you very much.'and left. I'm sure I'll meet her at school.

I was standing backstage, watching Miko, who was juggling, while Justice was flipping through never-ending rings of fire. My palms got really sweaty and I felt queasy as the crowd applauded and Miko and Justice bowed, because now was my act. Sandra stood beside me and recognized my fear. She grabbed my hand and we walked into the ring together. The lights shone on me so bright, I felt like I could pass out. The clapping sounded like mocking in my head. I couldn't tell what everyone was chanting, but it sounded like, 'You can't do it! You can't do it!' over and over again. Suddenly the bar slowly descended down, and I knew it was time. Sandra and I looked at each other, she smiled, I almost burst into tears. It was time.     We simutaneously grabbed the bar and sat upon it. It suddenly rised up and we were about 100 feet above the ground. My throat closed. No net, no pillows, nothing. If I fell, I would die. Blood everywhere. The lights dimmed, and a big bright one shone on us. Glowsticks on. Fear on maximum. This was it.      My legs wrapped around the bar, and I slowly, one by one, let my hands off. I hung upside down for about a minute, then grabbed the bar once again, but this time I was in a tear drop shape. My legs swung off the bar. 'Don't look down, don't look down!' I thought to myself. After several flips, the lights shut off, not quite pitch black. The audience clapped as the bar descended. Once it lowered down low enough that we could touch the ground, we let go and the bar dissapeared up into darkness. As the crowd kept applauding, I leaned over and whispered to Sandra, 'Good thing they didn't say encore!'

I was only 3 but I loved the circus. My parents used to be in the circus but then they got married and gave up the circus. But whenever the circus comes to town My parents were in it. So when they got the offer to go in the moving circus the accepted it. I was little so it was easy for me to learn how to tame a elephant or to walk on a rope 50 feet in air with no harness.               My first show was amazing. I'll admit that I was a little scared. OK maybe a lot but I LOVED IT. That day I decided that I was never going to leave the circus. Now that I'm 12 I'm having second thoughts.              I woke up and had my breakfast. Today was Friday the 13. Every Friday the 13 we have cupcakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I chose a chocolate cupcake and started eating it.              I was tired of the circus. Moving every single day could get boring. As I sat in my favorite seat my mom joined me. This was my chance.            'Mom do you ever get bored of the circus?' I asked.             ' Sometimes. But I wait.' She replays.             ' Wait for what?'              ' I wait in till I get a great spot in the circus. I practice in till the manger notice how much better I got and gives me a new spot in the show. Maybe that's what you need.' She replays helping herself to a third cupcake.             ' How did' I say, my jaw hanging wide open.             ' How did I know? A mother knows everything.' And with that she leaves the pie car.             All day long I think about what my mom said. When I practice I try something new. Ins-tide of  juggling I ask one of the clowns if I can borrow their unicycles. They give it to me. I find a nice area with a soft landing. Then I start practicing.             Five weeks later when I'm on my unicycle the manger comes and talks me. He gives me a new place in the show.             ' The clowns say you're good. I hope they're right.'' And he walks away.                              That night at the show I lead the elephants out of their tents. On my unicycle. Blindfolded. I tame the elephants into doing tricks with nothing but my hand. It's nice not being able to see because sometimes the crowd mess you up. When I'm down with my act the crowd goes wild.             That night I don't feel like I hate the circus. I love it even more than ever. I realized that the circus isn't about tricks or clowns. It's about trying new things and loving it. For you it might be sports or a new food. For me it's the circus. Like my mom said you have to wait.

First my mom woke me up. Then I ate and we left for the circus.When we got there I bid farewell and told her to come to the show on Saturday.As she left I met a silly clown named Aldo and we quickly became friends.               While we were talking the ringmaster called for everyone to gather round and meet our newest    (drum roll please) PEANUT BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After he said that, he called me up.As I went up everyone cheered and clapped for me. Then he asked who would like to show me around and help me with any questions. Immediately Aldo raised his hand. The ringmaster said 'How about you Aldo.' Aldo came over and said  ' Come on, Let's go!'                 Day by day Aldo helped me around and introduced me to people.By the Saturday I had made many more friends.That night was the show tons and tons of people were there.Finally the acts began. First , all the clowns came out and did funny things like throwing pies at each other.But I didn't see parts because like everyone wanted peanuts. When I spotted Aldo he looked like he was having a good time.Then I heard a Familiar voice saying ' Peanut boy, over here!'I turned around and guess who I saw, MY MOM! I went over to her and gave her a hug and said 'I missed you' I told about my week  and Aldo. She said 'Sounds like fun'.                    When the show was over I Introduced my mom to Aldo. Then asked if I'm going to stay in the circus. I said 'Even though I had so much fun, I think I want to be with my family'.He said 'Okay'.                    Right as we were about to leave Aldo came after me with a big box. I asked him what it was he said it was a gift for me. I opened it and found a clown makeup kit and a bag of the mysterious marshmallow circus peanuts. I said goodbye and thanks and left.

For example what I have to do in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. After you read this I hope you will won't to see one of our shows some day.                       First, I I am very busy in the morning. At 7:00 A.M. I get dressed and go out to the pie car for breakfast. We have pancakes and bacon. It is delicious. After I eat we have to set up tents and lights for tonights show. 9:00 A.M. is schooltime. Then I walk to the schoolhouse. The schoolhouse is the same as every school they have computers, tests, and report cards. A lot of the people in the circus are from all around the world ,so many of my classmates speak different languages. When we travel around the world thats when we do geography lessons.                           Next, I have to do tons of jobs in the afternoon to get ready for the show tonight. At 3:00 P.M. school is out. After school I played with the clowns unicycles and juggling balss. It was really fun. 3:30 P.M. is chore time, so I start with the horses. I have to feed, water, and groom the horses. Then I have to start my act. I am leaping off a trampoline and landing on the horse's back. It takes a lot of balance and concentraction. Other kids practice juggling and acrobatics. The trainers are working with baby leopards, elephants,lions, and chimpanzees.                               Last, the end of the night is the best part. At 6:30 P.M. we go to the pie car to eat dinner. Circus performers do not eat much befor the show. The circus does ten shows a week, plus a manitee ( a afternoon show) on Wedensday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday. The show was really fun and everybody enjoyed it. I did my act and did it. It felt amazing! The show was over and everbody is so tired. We walk back to the trailor. In bed I thought when I growup will I still be in the circus?                                   In Conclusion, I hope I will see you some day performing in the circus.

If you ask me the circus is really cool.  The bad thing about being in the circus is that you never get to call a place home.  Also you never get to see your family unless they are in the circus with you.                                                             Life in the circus is hard work if you ask me.  I get to see many people which is fun though.  I get to be an acrobat with my parents.  People always ask me for my autograph.  It is amazing to have people ask you for your autograph because it means people really enjoy you.  I love all my fans, but i don't get to autograph everyone oft them because some times their parents think it's late and then they have to leave.  Other people leave because they don't want to wait in the really long lines.  That is what it is like to have all the fans go crazy for you.                                                                                                The disadvantage of being in the circus is that you never really have a place to call home.  I have a home in Mighigan but it is not very big compared to what i am used to.  It only has five bedrooms.  I have three and my parents have two.  One of my bedrooms is used for my bed and clothes from when i was little and not in the circus.  One of them is used for my circus awards.  I put them in there when we do come home but i usally don't have that much.  The other room is used for my circus clothes that don't fit me anymore.                                                                                                 The hard work I put into the circus is fantastic is what all my fans say.  I do miss my grandma and grandpa and all my other family alot though.  When i have shows in Mighigan they will come and see me.  That's why I love it when we have shows in Mighigan.  Also when we have shows in Virginia my aunt ans uncle come and watch because that is where they live.                                                                                                                                  When we are on our break i play with lego's.  One time I built a mansion because my fans know that i locve lego's and they bring me a bunch.  One time a little girl brought me ten boxes of different lego's.  When i get double of something besides lego's I donate them to a charity in Michigan.  When I do performances at local charities when I am in one state the kids go crazy.  Sometimes I got to an orphanage when I am close to one a do gymnastics in the air on a trampoline.                                                                      I have to live in a trailor which stinks.  The good thing is that they are huge.  I have my own bedroom with a queen size bed in it.  I don't have a closet though.  My parents get the closet.  I don't think that is very fare because I have more clothes then they do.                                                             In conclusion the circus life is pretty cool.  There are some ups.  There are also some downs.  An up is that it is really fun getting to go from state to state.  The down is that you barely ever get to see your family.

The circus life is actually pretty hard. There are many things that you are possibly unaware of in the circus business. Downsides are very common and so are upsides, but there can be more of either to different people though.             There are quite a few hardships for circus performers but I'm only going to tell you some of them. First off one of my most deal-able hardships is how tiring the show is. Our circus does 14 shows a week, one morning show and afternoon show every day! Another hardship is that I have to do almost all the cleaning and chores! But the worst part is I am the animal trainer, so I have to clean up after, groom, take care of, bath, and feed the animals! One of the most hardest hardships is that I cannot visit my family because of my very busy schedule and I cannot visit my friends either! So being a circus performer has a lot of downsides.             Circus performing isn't all bad though. It has its own upsides! Such as, getting to travel the world! I get to see many things around the world! Once I saw the Eiffel Tower, The Statue Of Liberty, and The White House! You also get to see the audience compliment you and see them get 'transported to another world'! I also get to learn new things and tricks as I rehearse and practice. And I do love seeing the children's happy faces once they go to our circus! We also get to eat food that is paid for by the circus. Even with many downsides the circus life is still pretty good!             Another thing I forgot to mention was the profits! I am also the 'treasurer' of the circus. I'm not even sure if circuses are even supposed to have one, but anyways I'm in charge of the profits. And that is hard work! I have to pay everyone depending on how many people paid and gave feedback. I also have to use the money and my FREE time to buy new equipment if we want new equipment or if we need to replace broken equipment. I also have to pay for accidents, candy, one-time-use kind of things, and souvenirs, but I don't have to pay the bills!   That's the owner's problem.             So in the end, circus life to me is exhausting, but it is still a pretty good life. So if I were to recommend being a circus performer I would say it depends on if you are a good acrobatic, but this job does pay a lot!

I'm a lion trainer so I  most likely have the hardest job. Here's a sneak peek on how life in the circus really is.          Living in the circus isn't always fun and games it takes hard work and lots of practice to be in the circus. You also still have to go to school so you have to study for test's and other things on top of practicing for the circus. Right after practice you have to eat dinner and go to bed you get lucky if you have time to play.           Living in the circus is also dangerous you have to be very careful at all times. If you have to deal with animals like me then you have to be very careful. Especially if your dealing with lions or bears like me.         The good side about living in the circus is that you get to do what you love and you're always around you're friends and people who care about you. You can play with the animals which is super fun.         That's how life really is in the circus dangerous, hard work, but it's worth it.

My father just taught me a new trick last night, but he said he taught it to me late and I have a show tonight. I'm really scared to do that trick. The trick is I have to do a back flip off a trampoline onto a horse. Although I love that red striped tent, I really don't want to break a bone in it.       It's a good thing my act is last in the show, so I can practice before I go on. The show starts at three so I have only two hours to practice.       It has been an hour and forty-five minutes I still cant do my trick. We have to get ready for the show, I'm so scared. I put on my costume. I'm watching everyone to their trick perfectly and I cant practice because I'm to nervous. It's my turn. I go out there, I get my stance ready. I say to myself I have to try. I go for it. I land it!

It's a very difficult job if you ask me. My parents own the circus and they are the leading acrobats. They said that when I turn 13 in two months i get to become an acrobat as well.            There are many responsibility to make our circus one of the top circuses in California. We always have to make sure that the tents,flyers,and other things are ready for the big opening night! My uncle Joe also is in our circus as well, he walks on the tightrope and is very good at it.            Circus life is very difficult if you already didn't know that. We get home schooled on the way because we are on the road a lot while we travel the world. We also don't get so much time to rest we get up at about 7:30 in the morning, have breakfast, my favorite is when my mom makes homemade pancakes, to about 8:00 at night and then we eat dinner. After dinner, we have to perform and that geos until about 10:15 usually.             I guess the circus life is in my jeans, and I'm very proud that it is. Circus life may be diffacult, but it always works out in the end because I have fun and that's all that matters.

Apparently everybody else was too.  Our boss told us that instead of performing at a regular show, we would be competing with other circuses.  The first place circus would be known all over the world.  Us people of Big Top Circus were excited.  Our boss also said that only one person would be annonced the best out of all the circuses.  They would be famous all over the world too.  Now we were really excited.  I wasn't really sure if I would get to be the best.  I knew my friend, Drew, should get it.  She was the best trapeze artist out of the whole circus.  The competition was on Saturday, August 21.  That was only a week from today.  I really needed to practice my acrobatics.         It was Wednesday, August 18.  Only two days left to practice.  I almost broke my ankle trying to land back down after doing my last acrobatic practice yesterday.  It was a good thing I didn't.  Then I wouldn't be able to participate in the competition.  I was doing a really cool routine high in the air with Drew.  I would spin and turn and twirl on a rope and then Drew would come down on her trapeze and get me.  I would fly in the air with Drew, let go of her and do a backflip, and then land clean on my feet.  It was a hard routine.         It was now the day of the competition.  I couldn't wait.  Our circus would be judged last.  We had to perform exellent to impress the judges.  It was finally for our circus to go on.  Drew's and I routine would be going last. We really had to impress the judges.  Maybe Drew would get to be the best performer.  If it wasn't me, it should be her.  It was now our turn.  I was nervous and so was Drew.  She was actually shaking.  I walked over to my rope and started spinning and turning.  Drew then came down on her trapeze and I grabbed her legs and flew with her.  Then I let go of her legs, did a backflip, and landed clean on my feet.          I hoped the routine looked great.  It was time to give out the awards.  So far we haven't been called and they were now going to announce who got first place....'And the circus who got first place is..... BIG TOP CIRCUS!'  I was so surprised I started crying a little bit.  Now they were going to announce the best performer.  'And the best performer is....ZOIE BAEZA!'  Now I really started crying.  I was now so shocked ans surprised that I got it.  I would be famous all around the world even if I died right now.  A week later we were already traveling all aroung the world and many people wanted my autograph at the same time.  The Big Top Circus was now a world wide circus, and so was I.

You have to be the one to hang on the bars and ropes. You are very afraid of hights, but you have to do it anyway. So you climb up on the ladder and get on the rope. After a few minutes people start to notice you are hanging on a rope. A few people walk by and clap for you and tell you to do a trick. You don't know what to do so you put one foot on the rope and the other in the air. Then you do the same thing with your arms. You balance for about 8 minutes with one foot and one arm in the air and one foot and arm on the rope. People clap and tell you to come back tomorrow. After that day was over you walk home and go to bed after a long day of hard work.   The next day you go to the circus to be an acrobat, but then your boss says you ar going to be a juggler instead. he told me he wanted me to learn to do everything so then I could do different things each day. So before people started showing up I practiced. I didn't notice for a few minutes but out of the corner of my eye two people were watching me practice. They started telling me to juggle bananas, so they gave me some and told me to try. I tried and I was actually really good at it. i could also do jumping jacks while I juggled.       After a couple of days I wsa getting tired of doing acrobat and juggling so I asked if I could try tightrope walking. My boss said of course. So i got up on the tightropoe and tried balancing. I could balance pretty well so i tried a trick. I did a flip and a back flip. People were so amazed. everyone was smiling and it made me smile.       The two days after it was Saturday. It was my day off. I spent the whole day practicing. I loved being at the circus. I couldn't wait till Monday so I made my own circus at my house. I made myself look like a clown. I juggled, did acrobats, and did tightrope walking.

I ate my cereal and got in the car. Sadly my parents were not in the car. I ran inside and dragged them into the car. We were on our way to the circus. I was so exited all I said to my parents was, 'are we there yet' about one thousand times. I finally got bored of saying that, so I just sat there quietly.                             Then in the horizon I saw a tent, at first I thought it was just some campers but as I got closer and closer I realized that we were finally here. I was so exited that I couldn't speak. we found a parking spot as quickly as we could. I jumped out of the car and ran inside. It was every thing I dreamed it would be but better. On one side there was the snack shop and on the other there were performers giving out signatures. i ran in the doors there they were our own reserved seats. Once I sat down the lights turned off.                              A small man came out he said,' welcome to the Circus Ole, we hope you have the best night of your lives.' As soon as he finished He turned taller and taller. Then something came out of the sky it was a mini plane, it was awesome. Then acrobats came fling out then landed on a trampoline were they started doing all of these cool moves. Out of no were these performers swinging on these glow in the dark ropes. The strangest thing happened, a elephant was riding on rollerskates.                              Next balloons started falling out of the sky and then got real quite. A mime was stacking chairs in an odd way then I couldn't believe it, he started climbing them. I new he was going to fall at the very top he started staking more and more, he was insane. At the very top he jumped! He was going to die but when he touched the ground it was water, it was impossible.                               Then he started raising from the water and started flying!

Oh how I dream of this happening.

The next day I saw on t.v. a wonderful thing coming to town, guess 'The Circus'I said happily. I asked my parents that if we could go and they said yes. I was bursting with joy, but that wasn't all they said Hector could join us to the circus. Then it got better he came over and I told him all we were going to do but, when he said'wait wait I still have to ask my parents if it was o.k.'he said to me. And that was when he left and I was sad that he did.                                                                                                                                                                                                    The next morning he came back and said 'I could go I could go' yes I had a feeling you could. That night was the best night of our lives we had the best time ever. And it doesn't all end there a man from the circus saw us preform when they asked for 2 volunteers and said you two were amazing out their how would you like to work part time here so of coarse to still see your family. So we talked to Hectors family and mine and what do you know they all said 'YES'.        The next performance was in Wyoming and that was out of state and a little bit far from Wisconsin. So we had our very own ride in a privet  jet, and my family and Hectors family got to come with us and see the performance. And until we grew up we were known as the 2 glued sticks because we always sticked together the whole way through and stuck up for each other.

A time to be amazed to think WOW how cool is that.   Now to the animales there is a zebra named Marty a lion named Alex and garafe   The lion does trapeze with the jagwar .   The garafe does tightrope with a hipo.The zebra  does afro circus.       The bear does the unicycles.   And the elefent juggles  clown balls and they put a red big ball on his nose.   Alex the lion is my favorite because he jumps through hoops and flips through hoops.

The circus that I am in is called 'The Best Circus On Earth' and we are performing in California. I have not been to California, even though I travel all over the world. The circus will be here all week so I get to perform 10 times! One show on weekdays, but Wednesday there are two shows and two shows on the weekends.       After I ate breakfast, I went to the school room. The school room is like any other regular school only, it travels with the circus. School is over at 3:00. We have 6 hours of school because we need to train. Besides performing, my favorite part of the day is the after school break. I usually play with the clowns and they teach me how to juggle. After my break, my friend and I feed the horses. Today, I am working on leaping onto horses, and then jumping off of it. My friends are working on juggling and acrobatics. Other acts are training their lions, elephants, and monkeys.       It is 6:30, dinner time is finally here. My family and I go to the pie car to eat, but we can't eat too much because of the show. Now it is time for the show! When it is time for my act,  I pull it off perfectly. I love seeing the crowd get excited and enjoy the show. The show is over at 10:30 and I am very tired. Even though I am tired, I can't wait for the next day so I can perform again.       Being a circus performer is lots of fun. I love being around all the circus members and I love to perform. I would be happy if I could return home to New York but as long as I can be around my family doing what I love I would be happy.

What was it i was day dreaming about ow ya what was i going to do for summer. But i fowned out i was grounded because my mom asked what happen to my grades well i said that i wasent paying attention on the test so i got an F on my test. But after one weak my mom said i was going to a circus. I was so supprised i even saw my friend Carlos. First thing we did was go jumping on the trampa lean doing back flips. Then we had to srech out our legs so that we can go tightrope walking well first few times i fell off then the 5th time i made it across! But at 8:00pm we had to go to our trailer and sleep but Carlos and I went to our tent to play. The next morning i went to the animal trailer with the animal trainer to get a baby lion to trian and it was not easy well i was running away because i was getting scared but when i was ready i went to the baby lion and peted it then i got to make it jump through. After a while we went to watch the man train a fully grown tiger. But after a while i got bored so i went horse back riding and we went on our first real performance it was a sucses but i had to go home so early because school was in 2 days so i had to go. But next summer i will go back and this time i will go and do the acrobats. NEXT SUMMER   Well i got focused in class because i new if i focused i could go for an extra weak instead because that weak was the acrobat lessons! So the moment of truth i will be learning how to be an acrobat! This time i brung a few of my friends so it wont only be me and Carlos this is gonna be the best summer ever. So first we had acrobat lessons then we went horse back rideing we also learned how to juggle. After we brung our parent to watch all of us perform we put all of our acts together and it was wonderful so when i grow up i want to be in the circus . So almost every summer i ask my mom and friends if all of us can go to circus camp. But my mom decided almost every winter,summer,and fall we are going to circus camp! So lets get back to the story so my mom said at school i have to get an B or higher or no camp and so the camp moved so we have to travel to New York! Maybe we can visit my uncle because he nose a lot about circus because hes bin in one his name was Billy the silly clown. I think hes still got some tricks up his sleeve. So this year im joining jim nastics so i can be flexible for the try out of being in a circus at our school. I new a lot so i can be the leader of the circus.

I am going to tell you about a typical day as being a performer in the circus.         6:30 A.M.- I wake up, get dreesed in normal day clothes, and go to the pie car for whole grain toast, bacon, and eggs. The show crews are setting up tents, lights, music,and the stage for tonight's show.         8:00 A.M.- School time. Since there are is no actual school around all of the kids go into a one-room schoolhouse that travels with the circus. Like normal schools we have computers, tests, and the worst, report cards. Most of my classmates don't speak English because the performers come from all over the world. As do our geography lessons.         2:00 P.M.- Finally, school is over. Time for a quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and other silly equipment. I also get to play with my Afghan Hound, Sparky. I'd like to join a tennis team, but we're never in one place in order to stay on a team.        3:00 P.M.- Chores and practice. I have to feed and groom all of the animals, except for the ones that the trainers are taming. Today my dad's girlfriend and I are practicing out tricks on the silk ropes. When we are done we have to do some extreme stretching.          6:30 P.M.- Dinnertime. My family and I go to the pie car to eat, but we don't eat much because we're performing in two hours. We do ten shows a week: one each weekday, plus a manitee on Friday, and three on the weekends.          8:30 P.M.- Show time. During the show the clowns's are first, second, and third. After, the clowns's first act come the acrobats, that's me. Next, the clowns again.Then, the tricksters, the random and dangerous tricks people go. Finally, everyone comes out and goes bananas.          9:00 P.M.- Bed time. I'm thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be nice to go back to our real home in Maryland. When I grow up, will I still be in the performing industry like my parents? Who knows? The circus is fun an all, but it is a tough life.

All of the clowns, acrobats, and trapeze artists are getting ready for the big show. I step out of bed and run through all of the big tents set up for the circus. I keep running until I bump into Dad. 'Hello sweatheart what are you up to,' he said in a nice voice. 'I want to help you groom the horses for the big show. Everything must be perfect,' I replied. 'I just did that. Why don't you go get some breakfast,' he said back. So I start to run and run again.                 I keep running until I make it to the pancake booth.

THE first thing I'm going to tell you about is acrobatics ,FOR EXAMPLE, acrobatics is when you jump from rope with plastic bar hanging from the bottom and they hang over a big net and swing to a another rope with a plastic bar hanging from the bottom.Also,in acrobatics the jump in a big net from a crazy height. Lastly, in acrobatic it helps learn balance.This concludes my essay about the circus acrobatics.                                                                                                                                                             THE second thing I'm going to tell you about is lion tamers,FOR EXAMPLE ,loin tamers get locked in a cage with a lion.Also lion tamer hit tigers with a whip and chair and say 'back beast back'.LASTLY being  a lion tamer is hard work you have to not let the tiger maul you to death for like a whole twenty minute.                                                                                                                                                                              THE last thing I'm going to tell you about is tightrope walker, FOR EXAMPLE, tight rope walkers walk on a very thin rope over a big net. Also some times there riding unicycle on the rope.lastly type rope walkers even run on ropes.                                                                                                                                                                                               and that concludes my essay about the circus                                                                                                                                                                        THE END                                                                                  ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.72012774020101,1.71253375199614,1.11625938250341

I have been a circus performer since I was ten years old. I had always wanted to be in a circus. Once my parents found out my talent for balancing on a tightrope, they knew that instant to sign me up to be a circus performer. My dream came true that very day.             When I started performing in the circus I was very shy and always nervous before a show. I didn't make any friends when I first started. When ever I practiced I would always be nervous and fall down. I don't know how many times I fell down, but I knew I fell down a lot. Next week I didn't make any friends, but I was falling off the tightrope less. I was feeling more confident.

One of them is tightrope walking. Tightrope walking takes a lot of balance and determination. You need to walk carefully and try not to fall a lot. But if you practice a lot and maintain a lot of balance, you wouldn't have to fall a lot. You'll still need determination.  Determination leads you to a better life or a better try to stay on balance.                         Another thing that happens is clowning around. Clowns try to annoy or scare spectators with getting in front of their faces or squirting whem with squirt guns or those prank flowers that shoot out water. You wouldn't have to have determination. You need annoyance. So it'll be a lot easier to clown around.                 The last thing that happens is shooting out of a cannon.You won't need annything but firepower. Firepower helps circus actors fly( or rocket) out of the cannon and probably blast through the tent. Rocketing out of cannons would let actors know how it feels to fly aimlessly in the air. It'll help them to not be scared of heights.

You have to spend a long time away from your home and practice really hard. But circus has some upsides too, like traveling around the world and meeting new people. One of the most exciting things is you learn new things along the way!       First, I wake up really early and get dressed. After I am dressed I go to the pie car for breakfast. And when I have gobbled down all of my food I go up to the trailor and practice my performance while the crewmen outside are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.       Next, it is school time. We have a one room schoolhouse travels with us. Our schoolhouse is like any school, it has computers, tests, and report cards. Many of my other classmates speak other languages because we circus performers are all over the world.       Then, when school is over it is time for a break. The clowns let me play with their equipment. I also play with my tiny animals; our trailer can not fit large animals.       Furthermore, it is dinnertime. We go to the pie car to eat, but we don't eat much because we are performing tonight. We do ten shows a week, so it is not all fun and games.       Finally, the show is over. I am so tired. I just want to plundge into bed. Two days from now, we will all set up in another town.       Last, I am in bed. I am homesick. I can't wait to the end of our touring season. It will be great to go back to my home. When I grow up I want to be a great circus performer. The circus life it fun, but it is a busy and tough life.

First of all, A circus performer puts time and effort in his/her practice. They have to practice all day and all night for every show. Even though they know how to do it by heart, They still need to practice because if they mess up then he gets booed off the stage and the circus will make less money and might fire him. They might even leave the circus because they messed up on their performance                      Now back to the life of a circus performer. A circus performer cannot just join the circus. They need to test him or her to see if they have special talents. They can't just join if they do one or two tricks. they have to be able to do many tricks not just one. He or she has to do at least 10 tricks so when the show comes and they do the same trick over and over the audience would be bored and leave. The circus performers have to wake up early to practice and eat pancackes and bacon at the pie cart.                      The pie cart is the place where all the circus performers eat. The little kids have to groom the horses. The adults have to practice on doing acrobatics and other stuff.

In fact I come from   ?long line of circus performers. Since I was born here, the circus trailer is kind of my home. Also, I've been working in the circus for three years as a magician, and I'm only eight years old. My normal day is I wake up, eat at the pie cart, go to school, and practice for tonight's show. I especially like school because since we travel around the world, our geography lessons really come to life. In practice, I practice mostly basic magic tricks such as taking a coin of an empty sleeve, but I sometimes get to do advanced magic. Then after the performance I feel super tired and I sleep. Today, is a big day for me, and I don't want to blow it. This is the first day I perform an advanced trick, the vanishing act, in front of a crowd. I am nervous, but also excited. 'Now its time for Cris, the Kid Magician!' says the announcer. My hearts thumps with excitement. I enter the stage do my routine. I take out my 'magic' smoke ball and throw it to the ground. I stood middle stage to make the crowd would see me if I just went left or right making it seem more magical when I vanish in front of the crowd, making them cheer to their heart's content. I re-enter the stage and say, 'Thank you, thank you everybody!' After my big achievement I celebrate with a great meal, too excited to sleep, despite the time.

I had just entered the circus. It was crowded with trapeze artists, clowns, people walking on stilts, and animal trainers with elephants, lions, and other animals. I walked into the stand to wait for the show to begin. Suddenly, it began. I was suprised to see many clowns juggling, tigers jumping through rings, and men walking on ropes. After it was over, I realized that I wanted to be part of the circus.           As I grew older, I still wanted to be part of the circus. I started training, but most of all I wanted to be an animal trainer. I had always loved animals, and I wanted to train them to do tricks. I also practiced juggling in case if Ididn't get the job. I went into the circus and talked to the manager of it, and I got the job! I was so happy and started to help with the animals. My favorite was an old tiger. I fed them treats when they did tricks correctly. Soon enough, they were ready to perform after a month of hard work. One night, I performed with my animals. It was fantastic. The crowd screamed when they saw the tiger jump through several hoops. The monkeys juggled tiny balls and fruits. After the show, I was exhausted.           A few weeks later, I had always remembered that night and always trained with the animals until the next show.

Since then, my parents kept teasing me that I was hiding money from them in my hair and that I let that clown steal it when hey could have used that money to buy something. next we went to the stunt show. There, I saw many stunts. Some of them were the tight rope walking, jumping from a trampoline onto a horse, somersaulting from a horse, and riding on a unicycle.

If you are going to be a person who rides in th circle with motor cycles have to go fast so you dont fall out of the motor cycle .Thats why being a performer is important.

But, airfare was too expensive, going around $400 - $1,100. For a few days, he searched online and newspapers to see what jobs could let him go around the world while working too to make some more money.                       Finding The Final Job                        On the next week, Vince found an ad that needed new, experienced circus performers that get to go to more than 150 cities in less than 9 months on plane. For the whole day, all he thought about was the phrase,'More than 150 cities in less than 9 months'.He didn't care about going on plane, having to do tricks, or maybe even getting hurt so he went to the circus manager and asked if he could be part of the circus crew.  After a little interview, the manager, Taj, congrated Vince, and told him he can go see the other people and the whole circus family. On that night, Vince got ready all of his clothes, belongings, and etc. and headed to an airport and met the circus crew there.       Vince's Schedule For The Circus                         While on the airplane, Taj came to Vince and gave him the everyday schedule which looked like this:       7:30 A.M.= Wake up + eat breakfast 8:45 A.M.= Feed, water, and etc. for animals 12:00 P.M.= Practice tricks and acts 2:00 P.M.= Lunchtime 3:40 P.M.= Relax/have some sleep 5:30 P.M.= Dinnertime 10:45 P.M.= Show's over       When Vince looked at the schedule, he was surprised how long the show was, but he was satisfied with it. Now, it was the first day he is going to be in circus with a big audience. Later, instead of being scared and having stage-frieght, he was happy and confident with doing this. Vince was even happier when he remembered his dream for doing this job was to get to go around the world, but also his crew treats him nicely like family. He guessed that maybe he could do both things at once (doing circus + traveling around the world).       After 3 Years In The Circus                      Now that Vince has turned 16 years old, has gotten used to the life of a circus performer, now made contact with a big circus family of his own, and also made more than $100,000, he have had some oportunities that some famous circus managers like Tej would give him a chance to show off his tricks and acts, but he declined them all because he already has his own circus family/team and his great manager Tej. Vince and his team has been going far with the circus road and most of the world has known them for almost a century, so they are almost famous worldwide. This isn't just the end.       At The End Of The Circus Life                     Now that Vince has turned 24, he still sometimes goes back and tells these past stories to relatives and visitors, but also he sometimes goes to the circus and play a show or two to let the 21st century know what he has done in the past. His team has gone and passed to other things because of family and business problems, but Tej is still with Vince to help, but they don't really do any circus shows anymore. Now they still have a good life and all, but in their souls, they still have some drops of circus life in there, and they will treasure that great moment until they perish.

In four hours is the show and I am determined to master that tightrope. four hours has passed and my act is up next not even having on butterfly in my stomach. Now, everyone is watching me, sweat going down my neck. I stepped onto the tightrope and walk steadily then the crowd gased at me doing a 360 spin and land perfectly safe. Then I amaze the crowd with tricks until I'm at the end of the tight rope. My heart  was happy when I heard the round of applause. The show is over. I'm walking to bed now, feeling wiped out and I collapsed in my bed resting for the next show tomorrow.

Then I flipped again and landed on the platform. As the crowd applauded me and the rest of the trapeze act we made our way backstage so the clowns could go on.          After the performance we went to the pie car to eat dinner. When we went to bed the circus tent seemed small as they packed it away. I thought that life was tiring at the circus but I also knew it could be worse.          For the next week, practice daily and perform at night was the schedule as well as school.Make sure you finish your homework and make sure you practice your flip over and over.Everybody was always so upbeat all the time, with the exception of the poop scoopers.          Every performance same thing, the introduction, next the lions and elephants, then the trapeze act, and finally the clowns. We do the same act for a year then change it over the summer.
