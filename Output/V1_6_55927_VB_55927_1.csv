People needed to get away from the war. People need gold. Good transportation makes it easier to transpot rescources.        The American Civil War was not something you wanted to be around so people in Ireland went to America for crops. The crops in Ireland had failed and people were dying of starvation. In America the crops were not dying so Irish people choose to go there.        In 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in California. The news spread all over the world. 'By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California'. That is how the California gold rush began.         Transportation in America had improved in the 1800s and made it easier to transport resources. Transportation got faster and so more people could get where they wanted to go. Those are reasons why people moved to America in the 1800s.

In the 1800s immigrants needed to work in factories, to farm, and to build new land, to invent things. Germans made up the largest group of immigrants and then came the Irish. The Irish were desperate because the crops were not doing so well. There was almost no food and more than 1 million people died. The population of Europe grew a lot. Many Europeans came to America to find work and jobs to not starve to death. Some even came to get more freedom and religious rights.             The second half of the 1800s was about the new transportation and how they were much eaiser for people and even their communication. The ability to travel somewhere without waiting not that long is great. They invented steamboats, and trains to transport people and goods. Also there was a rapid change in how information was being sent. Steam power made everything easier. This made news and ideas less expensive to be put out there. Even the relegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 was great for people to use to call and transport news to other people faster. This made the Untied states more popular.              The gold rush was a very popular thing in california. This man named John Sutter figured it out and told everyone he knew of. People immediately went to California as fast as they could and started to try to find gold. There were 325 people from China and everyone knew more will come the next.  Most of the people from China came to the gold rush in California because they were fleeing from conflicts or wars, or they didn't have enough money to get things. Some of the poor people could not get there because money loss or one of their family members are sick. They longed to go there, but could not. The Chinese were all about the gold rush. In 1851 2,716 people came from china, then in 1852 20,26 people came from China, and then by 1870 there were 63,000 people from China. It grew from then. After some time it lessened because some people figured the gold was running out. Then it was hard to find gold, but that was one of the most popular peroids in Califorina ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.38518688985844,2.49798728435519,1.33264114561295

There was a lot of new technology in America during the 1800s. This drove many people from Europe and Germany. The Irish were also a very large group of immagrants, 1.7 million people to be precise. This was because of crops in Ireland that were failing.       Growth in industry also grew and this drew many people to the US. But there was also other reasons for coming to America, like avoiding poverty and harsh weather.       But the main reason that people came to America was because of the California Gold Rush.

I know it was probably hard for you immigrants to leave your country and probably your family. In Ireland I heard that you came over to America because of crop failure. And you had no choice. You also had no choice of leaving your kids or not. Unfortuntly you had to leave your kids. Another big reason why people immigrated to America was because of wars, crop failure, money, business, and ETC.                  Did you know that in 1849 more than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California. There were also 325 men from China in that mix of 70,000 people. In the 1800's a lot of the people who immigrated to America was the Chinese. The reason why was because they didn't have enough rice to feed everyone because there was a flood there and it washed most of the rice away.             In a 50 year period of immigration 26 million people immigrated to America! The main reason why they came was because they wanted freedom. In 1849 the first train on a railroad track passed America and through it. That made transportation easier so immigrants can get to America faster. In Europe the immagrants could catch a train but the bad thing is it leads them right to a boat, and a boat would take them months to get to America.

I cannot I think it would be incredibly difficult and painstaking.  People moved to America for different reasons. People worked different jobs based on their old professions.  People helped make America get more people by improving technology and industry.       People wanted to move to America for different reasons such as jobs, freedom, opportunities, access to resources and hunger.  People needed jobs and food if their country was getting overpopulated.  People needed freedom because in some countries people wouldn't like you if you weren't a specific religion.        People worked jobs if it was regular labor, something that would make them rich or a job that was similar to their old job.  They would do this because they don't know much else about working in America.They might be a inventor and then invent things or a alchemist believing he could change different materials into gold,       People helped make America get its technology because in 50 years America went from 30,626 miles of railroad tracks to 240,293 miles of railroad tracks.  It also went from 20,471,000 tons of coal to 417,111,000 tons of coal.

All immigrants were needed to work to build and advance the world they moved to. Such jobs included working in the new factories, farming the land, constructing new buildings and homes, and to invent new things to help advance their culture and society. They're the ones who started what we live on today.      The countries who sent their people to the United States sent different numbers of people. The Germans made up the largest group of immigrants, with the Irish following. One-fourth of the population of Ireland gave up their country to go live in America. The reason they did this is because back in Ireland most crops had failed, especially the potato crop. That lead to a food shortage resulting to the deaths of more than 1 million people.     The European countries sent their people later in the 1800s. These countries includes Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. In Europe the population had doubled, making it harder to find work. This happened between the years of 1750-1850. The extra people living there needed food, a home, and a good income. That made the idea of moving to America seem fit.     After a few years, in America industry grew and even more immigrants arrived. They had created the first railroad in the United States in 1869. This made moving resources such silver and lumber much easier. There was also a change on how quick information from different areas of the U.S. traveled. The redesign of the printing press made it easier and possible to print as many inexpensive books and newspapers as wanted. It also made new ideas available to more people. The telegraph was created in 1844 and the telephone in 1876, helping news travel even faster.      The move of many immigrants lead to new inventions, new land, and a mixed culture. There were even more immigrants that came to America that came to escape from violance, harsh conditions at home, to get a job, or to just make a new life. The immigrants came for more freedoms, to even escape their old life. All the immigrants helped make what we call the United States today.

It is about stories about many certain events during the 1800s of  U.S. history.        One story is immigration which started on the 1800s the people who immigrated were not from U.S. many of the immigrants were German and Irish. They immigrated for many reasons on was food,looking for jobs,and most importantly a better place to live.On the later 1800s more people from European countries came to do the same thing.2 more reasons were money and a home to live in.Others came for a religious freedom their reasons were that they were mistreated and escape from war which made life harder.              On 1848 a discovery that would bring many people was found.On the property of a man John Sutter along the American River in California Gold was discovered the man wanted to keep it a secret so he could get all the Gold but the news spread all over America and reached to other parts of the world. On 1849 many travelers came to America and with that the California Gold Rush began.The most people who came were Chinese along with the famous Forty-Niners which were 325 people from China.Before Chinese knew about Gold they heard it from tales about Gold beyond the Pacific Ocean.They called California Gold Mountain with the fancy name it seemed to the Chinese that California was filled with unbelievable richness the news about Gold Mountain spread over many parts of China with this many people came with more people each year by 1870 the Chinese and the U.S. palyed a critical part on building the first transcontinental railroad.                    In conclusion,during the 1800s many people came to U.S. to get jobs,prevent starvation,get money,have a better place to live on,and to escape war to live on a land of freedom.

They became immagrants because they didn't like where they lived so they decided to move to America.In the 1800s there was alot of people who moved to America because there were things that drove them away like hitler with the jews,or there was something that pulled them like new technology.

They all had a reason to come to  America. Maybe it was to become wealthy or it was a opportunity. When that happens it is called a pull. A pull is a feature in life that attracts people. Like, in the 1800s they probably moved because they got a job,wanted wealth,had an opportunity, and many other reasons. One example is the immigrants they moved because they wanted to start a new life in the United States.                           Another reason was starvation in the 1800s. People in Ireland had a food shortage. Over 1 million people move from Ireland to America because the food shortage. Later, in other countries they move to America from Russia, Italy, Poland, and many other places around the world. They mostly came to America because they did not want to suffer from hunger and wanted to get a job. People who came to America  from Holland, Germany, Russia, and Poland came for religious freedom.By that time the population was over 26 million.                               This time there was change in America. This was the time when new inventions came. They made new transportation ways and a new printing press that printed newspapers and books. People started coming to America to travel faster to or to move long distances. There was a push at the time, people started moving to avoid violent attacks, farm loss, or high birth rates. This is when the immigrants came to start a new life in America.                                     My last reason is wealth. People came in the 1800s because of wealth. A man named John Sutter found gold but did not keep it a good secret. People started moving to America to find gold. Some thought this was an opportunity to have a job. This was a big pull for the population. Over 70,000 people came to America to find gold. This time was called the Gold Rush. But then the Chinese came to America looking for wealth. They thought they had a fortune waiting foe them on top of a hill. Other people came from China to flee from poverty and other conflicts. They were rebellions against the government, so what they did is was start to raise taxes. Later the farmers weren't able to pay taxes so they had to sell their land. Next during the gold rush more Chinese came so by the time of 1870 the population of the Chinese in the U.S was 63,000. So there is many reasons why the population has changed in the U.S. This was probably a great time of pushes and pulls in life.

More than 1 million people died of food shortages just in Ireland. Later more people came because they needed homes, food and jobs, while others wanted religious freedom. More than 26 million people immigrated to America! Another reason was transportation, a railroad was made and steamships sped them up when traveling over sea. Most European immigrants wanted to escape harsh treatment. Chinese people moved from China to get away from war and for one very big reason, the Gold Rush! They wanted to make fortunes then return rich to China. By 1870 more than 63,000 Chinese were in America, the Chinese were very big in making the first transcontinental railroad.

When they moved to America the year they moved there was 1800s. the people that moved to America could build all the things that can help them survive like homes and farms. In 1860 one-forth of the Irish came to America and they came here during the war. Later on the European countries had came to get jobs and shelter.              The second part of the 1800s was about the pushes and pulls. Some was easier for the immigrants then some times were hard for them. The pushes were the features that drove people away from there homes, and had a hard environment and wars. Then there are pulls that attracted people in life. The features had jobs, wealth, homes, and freedom. The reason the immigrants came to America was that so they can have freedom and get away from the harsh environment.              Then the last is when the Chinese came to America. They came to America to get the rivers after they found out there was gold in the rivers. There was about 325 men that came to America to get gold. Then ship after ship came and that is when the gold rush begun after all those ships came.Then the Britain's started to rebel against the government so they raised the taxes and some people had to sell there land, because they didn't have enough to pay.

In the 1800's the population of Europe also decreased because they were also driven out of their country from the harsh conditions.They also just wanted to have a life ,even if the didn't have a job, they only wanted to have any kind of food to survive without having to risk their life's in countries in war and with critical food conditions and many other rough obstacles that make life really do make life hard to be sustainable.        One population out of the many that came to the United States for a wealthier life is the Chinese.They came because they heard the word being spread all the way to China that there was an unbelievable amount of gold in the American river.They called this place ,Gam Saan, which means ''Gold Mountain''.The first ones to arrive were the group of 325 men which they called the ''Forty-Niners''.After this group of men many more Chinese people came in the next two years.          In total 26 million people immigrated to the United States, and that was only during a 50 year period.Whether they were driven from the rough conditions in their country or if they were just pulled by the rumors of the wealthiness of the United States,but they all traveled to this country beneficial reasons.The greatest amounts of people  arrived between the 1860's and 1910's.People still immigrate today in many different ways but they still escape from their home because of the harsh conditions and they still choose this country for the rumored peaceful country  which is the United States of America.

Immigration in the 1800's                           Immigration is a huge thing in the US today, yet most of it started as early as in the 1800's. The largest group of immigrants at this time were the Germans, according to Moving to America by Joy Hakim. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the next biggest group to have moved to America. Some other major groups that moved here were Russia, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and Hungary.               People migrated here for many reasons, and they were all either 'pushes' (came here because they didn't like their old country) or 'pulls' (came here because they were attracted to our country). Some 'pulls' include freedom, a chance to work, and an overall better life. Some 'pushes' are poverty in their old country, political problems, and being forced out of their jobs, homes, and families. One major pull was the gold rush in California in the 1850's. An example of a push is that Irish people moved here because there was a food shortage in Ireland, and they came here seeking a better life.                The diversity of people in the US changed our country. Many people had many new and different ideas, leading to some great inventions. Life in the US changed because of these immigrants, and for the immigrants, life became better.            ???

For example the first railroad crossed the United States. This made transportation much easier for lots of things, like, it would make a trip more shorter, people could move resources much easier. And in 1844 and 1876 the telegraph and telephone made news travel much easier.       The last, reason people wanted to move to America was because of  gold rush. Everybody wanted to be apart of the gold rush. For example the Chinese came just to try to find a fortune. But, that was not the only reason.

There was also an advancement in techonology. In this essay you will learn many things about this time.        In the 1800s and early 1900s many people moved to the US from other countries. In 1860 there were about six million people living in the US. In 1910, just fifty years, there were forty two million people living in the US. There were a lot of reasons for this. Some of them were 'pushed', meaning they were driven from their homes. This includes hunger, war, poverty, conflicts, and more. Other people were 'pulled', meaning they were attracted to the US. This includes jobs, wealth, opportunities, freedom, and more.        There were also big advancements in technology. Some of these include trains, steamships, cars, telegraph, phone, and more. With steamships it did not take months to get to the Americas. With a train travelers could travel much more quickly than they would on a horse. With the new telephone, news could travel to other cities much more quickly.        In the middle 1800s there was a 'Gold Rush'. A gold rush is when people head some where to mine gold there. In 1849, 70,000 Americans traveled to California, in look for some gold. With these people there were also Chinese, and soon more Chinese started to move to America. The reason why the Chinese were moving to America was that there was much conflict and poverty in some places in China.        That was my paper on the middle 1800s through the early 1900s. I hope you learned a lot about the advancements made in technology, immagrants, and the gold rush. I wish I was born then so I could experience all these changes!

With all of the brand new technology, there was plenty of things for the immagrants to do. Different groups of immagrants worked in factories, build farms, make land for the farms, and they had to invent new things for the future. The largest groups of immagrants were Irish and the smallest group of immagrants were German. Before the American Civil War, 1/4 of the whole population of Ireland moved to America. There were 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children that moved to America. Many more people kept on coming during and after the war. The Irish population moved to America is because their crop growth had failed. Mainly the potato crop. All of the Irish people that moved were very desperate for food. More than 1 million people in Ireland have died from not having or eating ANY food. In the later 1800's, a very large amount of peole from different Europeon countris ahve also moved to America such as: Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe's countries have doubled the population between 1750 to 1850. Every single one of these people needed food, homes, and jobs, but there wasn't enough for every that moved. Several people came to America to find jobs and to avoid hunger loss.               Another reason wy people moved to America was for freedom from their different religious. This included people from Holland and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Othes escaped their country because of wars that made their lives unpredicable. Over the years, in total of people that came to America were over 26 million people arrievd in the United States in a 50 year time period. Most of the newcomers didn't know a thing about America except that it was a free country with no dictator  or any follish laws. All that the immagrants wanted was a job and freedom and that's excatly what they got.               The main reason why some people moved to America was because of the state of California. The reason why so many people would wish to live ws all because of the.......GOLD! The first time when gold was discovered in 1848 along the American rier in California. The person ho found it was a man named John Sutter. He tried with all of his might to keep his discovery to himself, but people in San Fransisco found out about the gold. Then, in a quick of a flash, a large group of people came to the American River to search for gold. The gold discovery spread all throughout the country and to other parts of the world. By Janurary of 1849, 60 shipps and thousands of travelers were heading to California to go for the gold. And that's when the gold rush began. More than 70,000 hopeful travelers arrived in California in 1849. Among the 'Forty Niners' were 325 men from China. These men who joined the gold rush was just the beginning. The following year, 450 more men from China came to California. The population numbers were going off the charts! 2,716 people in 1851, and 20,026 people in 1852. By 1870, there were over 63,000 Chinese people in the United States. 77% of the population was in California. That is how America can get more people to move.

From Russians and Italians to the Chinese and Irish, huge populations of people have moved from their hometowns to the US in search of freedom, jobs, food, wealth, opportunities, and freedom to worship whomever they want. Some immigrants fled to America because there were wars, poverty, hunger, and other conflicts back where they lived, but the United States provided a safe environment for people to live and raise their children.            During the Gold Rush, many Chinese men came to the US in hope of striking it rich; although many did not end up finding gold. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed to the Golden State.            The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in the United States. America was building its first railroad that crossed the whole country. That meant it was easier to ship products and trade items as well as faster transportation. In order to build this long railroad, many people needed to be hired. So the immigrants to America were hired to help build this.            Germans made up the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s. The next largest group were the Irish who all fled Ireland because of their failing crop, the potato. The Irish kept coming to America during the war and after the war too because more than 1 million people had died of starvation in Ireland, and knew they could find food in the United States.

Some are in the end, worth it, others, not so much. I will tell you about three main ways, Moving to America, the Changes In America, and the Gold Rush. They are in order as time moves on, and tells several immigrants lives and why they did what they did.        When immigrants moved to America, it was worth it, because of all the new technology, jobs, etc. There were new farms, ships, good food, and everyday things we have today being invented. Lots of Irish came too. Eventually, war kept coming. Tons of countries came to America, to seek these reasons: to find work and to avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom. As time moved on transportation became better. It was easier to sent word out and to move goods. Wars and conflict still occured, but conditions were good in some places. Later on, gold was discovered, and lots of people went to California. Over the years, things evolved and came better.

The first idea why people came to America is because they could enjoy a place where any religion can be practiced.They could  say what they want thanks to the first amendment(freedom of speech).They could also enjoy free education so that they could have jobs to work and gain money for food and a house to live in.You can also have your own company without having permission from the king.But what attracted people the most was the equal opportunities andthe fact that they weren't ruled by a king but listened to by a president who has less powers than a king.This is why people wanted to come to America            The second idea is why the industrial revolution important, the first reason was because it made America one of the wealthiest and popular countries amongst immagrants, who were coming her to become the next J.P Morgan or John D. Rockefeller.Another reason is it gave us several new inventions (telegraph, telephone, light bulb, etc.).My third reason is you could buy lots of things for really cheap prices (example lettuce=5 cents (1 dollar in todays money).My fourth and final reason is they had several people who were friendly enough to people to spend some time after school/work to be with your friends and just enjoy themselvles.           My third and final idea is how did the past 200 years affect us today my first reason is we could invent celphones and be able to have one for (mininum)15$ with such great advances.My second reason is we have been able to make great things happen with our technological advances.My third reason is we were able to make stuff so much more affordable than it was before this revolution.My fourth and final reason is I can have access to GPS (Global Positioning System) which can help me find my way to some places that we don't where they are.This is why the past 200 years and how it affects us is one of my reasons.            As you can see, immagration has played a big part in the United States of Americas history.My 3 ideas why people came here, why the industrial revolution was important, and how the past 200 years have affected us today.

Another reason why I think is that farming didn't work out for the other countries. In this statement it is trying to say how Russia, Itlay, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary had too many people and didn't have enough food to other people. But also the samething with jobs, and homes. Finally I think since America had so much freedom many people were tired of being slaves and moved to America.

Well, I am going to write about that using three reasons. Why they came here, what they could do here, and the California gold rush.       Everyone that wanted a better life that was from Europe in the 1800's, came to America. Lots of people came here because of the economy, and much more. Some people came to America, because they were being treated not fairly. Others, needed jobs, so they could feed their family, and not starve. There were crop failures in many countries, like Ireland. They needed to have a better life, they might even have a chance to have freedom! Some people came so they could have religous freedom. This was mostly people from, Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia. Especially people from Germany. They were treated differently because of there different beliefs. There was lots of this in Europe. Lots of people came to escape wars in their home countries. Even though there were small wars in America, it was better than a war with a few countries. After 50 years, over 26 million immigrant had arrived in America, so they could get a better life.       Once people got to America, there were things that they could do to get a living. Even though they came for a better life, they still had to work to have it better. With all the new technology, they could do lots more. They could work in new factories, this could be very harmful to there lungs, and other stuff, but they would do it anyway. If there was anyway that they could have a better life, then they would do it. They could also, farm and grow their own crops, they could trade them. They could also have their own farm, and have their own cattle and other meat, and grains. They could even build on the land, anywhere they wanted, they still would have to pay the taxes and everything, but with their new jobs, they would be able to do that easier. Of course, that would either have to bring supplies, or buy it in America. Lastly, they could invent things with all the new technology. Of course, it is way different from what we have today, but back then, it was very very helpful. After they invented something, they could sell the invention, or even use it to make whatever it is used to make. That would be an easier way to get money.           In 1848, John Sutter had made a HUGE discovery. He tried to keep it a secret, but when you find gold in the river you have in your backyard, it might be hard too. After a year, hundreds of people were coming to California. They were coming in anyway possible. Overland, and even on ships! This was the start of the California gold rush! More than 70,000 people had came to California. Some of them, were even chinese men! These explorers were called 'Forty-Niners' (just like the football team). More Chinese men came each year. Most of the chinese people had come from Guangdong, an area on the west coast of China. They had come to eascape the poverty.  Lots of them came with a hope of finding a fortune. Every immigrant that had came to America was very happy.       That is a small exspository about the immigrants that moved to America. Ask your parents, if any of your family was an immigrant. Who know's, maybe one of them was.

Why is that? Why did so many people leave their beloved home country for one who barely has been discovered? I learned there are many reasons why people left there countries.           People from different countries who could invent or farm in the 1800's decided to set out to America. Since new technology was being designed, America needed a lot of help. All of this talk of freedom in America made it's way to Ireland witch had a huge population. Because of Ireland's huge population and crops failing, the Irish were starving, and many died. Also, many other European countries where not happy, but when they heard of America, 26 million immigrants packed there bags and rushed to a place where they hope will bring them freedom and peace.          Even in the 1850's immigrants kept coming to America. Because of transportation improvement, it was a lot easier for people to travel to America on boats and trains. It was also easy to find work, because America needed help being built. Because of pushes, like wars and high taxes, more and more people left there countries. Europe's population was decreasing, while Americas was increasing. Americas pulls also had an effect on why people moved to America. The talk of freedom of religion, and freedom in general really wowed the Jews, Greeks, Poles, Hungarians, and other immigrants. Freedom is something they have never known.           Gold! People discovered gold in California! The news spread quickly throughout the united states, and soon countries everywhere. More than 70,000 people all over the world grabbed there families and rushed to California in search of wealth. When the news struck China, 325 men were amazed at the thought of that gold. They packed up what they could and left there beloved country. But the country was not very easy to love now. Another reason why they wanted to leave is because of China's war and poverty.  Most of the Chinese came from its south coast. Year after year, more and more Chinese came to America. In 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in America!          The 1800's was a very important century for America. That's when other people from different countries realized what amazing opportunities lied in America. I know it would have been hard for me to leave my home country and travel into the blue. I bet a lot of people did not know what to expect. But I know they expect one thing; freedom. For freedom, I would give up a lot, just like everyone in the 1800's did on there journey to  freedom, or America.

With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. they where needed to work in factories, to farm, and build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all that. Then as the germans started to coming they started to make up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the irish where the largest immigrant group.        The seconed half of the 1800s was a time of great change in america. First, indestry grew, and many immigrents arrived on americas shores. Seconed, the first railroad crossed the United states in 1869, this meant that it became easier and easier to move resorces from the west to the east. Third, the invention of the telegraph in 1844, and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster. And, that was the time of the great change in america.        The gold rush had begun in the year of 1848. First, John Shutter found the gold along the american river in californa, then news finaly reached San francisco, and then it spread to the rest of the united states, and to outher parts of the world as well. Seconed,  more then 70,000 hopeful adveturers arrived in california in 1849, and among these 'Forty- niners' where 325 men from china.

Our teacher told us create a museum-like display on immigrants that have immigrated to America in the last 200 years. While I was researcing my topic, I found four sources that I would like to share with you.                      The first source I found was an excerp from A History of Us called ' Moving to America' by Joy Hakim. This excerp was about how people from different countries immigrated to America to find work, and to find religious freedom. The excerp talked about why the people left their homes in order to come to America and the challanges they faced in their countries.                 The second source I found  was an article named ' Changes in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for immigrants. This article talked about how new advances in technology favored Americans and other countries. It also talked about what reasons people came to America.                   The third source I found was an excerp from a book about Chinese immigrants that was called ' Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California.' This excerpt talked about how and how many Chinese people came to California to find gold. The excerp also talked about what was happening in China during that time and the reason the Chinese moved to America.                     The fourth and last source I found was a chart from the Bureau Of the Census titled ' American Population and Industrial Growth, 1860- 1910.' The chart showed the changes in population in the United States during that time frame.

So, I think many moved for protection and safety from the harsh enviorment. Also, many immigrants were going hungry and there was very little jobs like farming for them to do. Pretty much anyone who could build, invent, or farm came to America on ships. Also, I think immigrants came to America for its new technology, like the telephones and other equipment.       Back in Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia were often mistreated for there different beliefs in their home countries so, i think that alot of people from might have to America for there religous beliefs as well.       Not only do i think that immagrants came just for lifes sake life hunger, jobs, and protection, but i also think it was to get rich becuase in 1848 gold was discovered in the American River. So, as the news spread across the country more and more people started to come on ships to were they found gold in hopes that they would get rich.

Like the people who came from the eastern United States, the Chinese hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills. Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast. They were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. Farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. At the same time, Guangdong's population was growing quickly.

Some came for religious freedom so that they could follow their religion without getting in trouble.          During the 1800s many industries grew which caused more people to come.

People came to America in the 1800s to get away from their home land and for a better and new life.            In the 1800s many large groups of people came to America. Large groups of Irish men, women and children came to America, they came before, during, and after the American Civil War because in Ireland, they crops had failed. There was a food shortage and more than 1 million people died of starvation. People also immigrated to America from countries in Europe, the reason being a population growth. The extra people there needed food, homes and jobs, and here wasn't enough. Some people came from Russia to escape from prejudice and prosecution and others came from Europe to escape from hard conditions.            The people immigrating to America had many reasons for coming here and settling. One of these various reasons was the transportation. During this booming time of immigration, the railroad was completed and people were using it to travel. One more example of transportation was the steamship. This invention made it faster and easier to travel to America. Another reason people came to immigrated to America was for the opportunities. The print press made ideas and news move available to people, and the invention of the telephone made news travel faster. Also, when you came to America you had the right to religious freedom and this made people with hard lives want to come here even more.            A big reason people moved to America was for the gold. In 1848, gold was discovered and people (including immigrants) came to California in search of riches. Of these people were Chinese immigrants from Guangdong. They were fleeing from conflicts and poverty, because they were involved in two wars between china and Brittan. People wanted to go to California, strike it rich, and return proudly to China. Over all, the gold rush had played a big part in bringing Chinese to America.           Over all, the immigrants that came to America played a very large roll in what we call America. All of these American immigrants came to America to find a better life, and escape their homeland.

There are many reasons why people from all over the world have came.            The first, and most harsh reason they've came was because the were 'pushed'.  This means that they were forced out of their home land.  For example, the Irish were starving in there own land and came to America in hope to find a better living.  The Chinese came because their governors collected high taxes and farmers and the poor couldn't live in China anymore.  The Germans were forced out of their homes because of war.  All these people came to America in hope of finding a better life.           The second reason is a force called 'pull'.  This means that America has promised things that would attract immigrantts.  For example, many religious people came fore religious freedom.  Others came for just freedom.  Some, like the Chinese, came for the gold rush in California.  They wished to make a fortune there.  Some came in hope of better farming.  As you can see, many immigrants came because of America's great lands and rights.           How did the people get to America?  Well, in the 1850's the transportation to and in America became much easier.  The first rail road that crossed America was completed in 1869.  The trip from one place to another for people and goods were much easier.  Steamships were also invented for quick ocean immigrating.  News traveled fast in this land too.  Books and newspaper were being pressed.  Telegrams (1844) and telephones (1876) made news easy to spread.  The land of America was a great place for families and friends to connect with each other.           As you can see, the great people of the word all came to America in ope of finding something better.  There reasons of coming may be different but they all met at one place: the one and only one America.

Did you know that new technology in the 1800s was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and invent things. Immigrant did all of that!! In the Changes in America, Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved.           The Gold Rush was really interesting too. The Chinese hoped to find fortune waiting for them in the California hills. The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. And Guangdong's population was growing quickly. The area could'nt produce enough rice to feed its people, especially when floods often destroy the crops.            Where was gold discovered and when? Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River! The news spread to the rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world! They all headed for California.....The California gold rush has begun. The secret was revealed.              Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (1.7 million Irishes) They kept coming, while and after the war. Then, Starvation was a big problem in Ireland. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potatoe crop. There was a food shortage!! More then 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.

The biggest attraction of America was the gold in California. Millions of people came to California to mine gold. Others came so they could have rich farmland. A lot of people came to America because they had no other choice. Some countries had harsh conditions and wars. Sometimes there just wasn't enough food or land for all the people.            The Irish were the largest immigrant group to come to America. One fourth of the Irish population, which is 1.7 million, came to America because of food shortage.

A man named John Sutter discovered gold in 1948. It spread throughout the whole world. Thousands of people were headed for California. The people who were participating in the gold rush were called Forty-Niners because they came in 1849. 325 of them were Chinese men.

One-fourth (that is 1.7 million women, men, and children) of the Ireland population was in America, before the Civil War. In the late 1800s people from all over Europe. The reason for most of them coming to America was so they could find a job and avoid hunger. Some other people came for religious freedom and other came to escape war that made life unstable and unpredictable. For 50 years 25 million immigrants came to America.                  In 1869 the first railroad track to cross America was built. Which made it much more easier to transport resources over land. The new advances in technology like in 1844 the telegraph was invented and in 1876 the made the telephone which made more aware about the world. Steam powered ships were also invented in the 1800s. Another reason for immigrants coming to the U.S is because of the gold rush in 1848. Enough John Sutter tried to keep it a secret word got out and the Chinese came to the U.S. The approximate amount of people that came in 1849 was more than 70,000 hopeful adventurers.              The first wave of immigrants came from Gunangdong, Gunangdong is in the south part of China. They left because of conflicts and poverty. The 1800s were bad for Gunangdong they were involved with 2 wars, one with Britain, and the other with China their own country! Two other reasons are because there were endless village and family fights and also their government raised taxes. And farmers which could not pay the taxes had to sell their land, plus there was not enough rice to feed every one especially during floods. People felt hopeless, they called California Gam Saan, or 'Gold Mountains.'

In the 1800 working people who built, farmed, or invented came to America.  During and after the war many Irish men, women, and children came to America because their crops had failed.  Later in the 1800s people started to come from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary        In the second half of the 1800 great change happened, Industry grew and immigrants arrived on Americas shores.

People could build houses of their own and produce crops and livestock. All they had to do was get on a boat and sail to America. It was easy to raise a family and get a job. Trains were used to transport people across America and wherever they needed to go. But for some people, Religion is important so they cvame to America knowing they had the freedom to worship God. When countries were at war, people flooded the harbors trying to afford a boat to get to America. In all, there were about 26 Million immigrants that came to America.        A trip to America from Russia took months, getting to the harbor from wherethey lived and gathering theier belongings but once trains were itroduced to Europe, People could get to the station a lot faster to get into the United states.

Pulls are the features of America that attract people and make them want to come to America. Like Jobs, Freedom, Family, Beliefs, and other smaller things that made America a popular place.

People couldn't get enough of the gold that they found. 325 Chinese people came to America for the gold rush but the next year, 450 more came to California. Soon after 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United states for the gold rush!       Once the American Printing Press started with newspapers, there were 2600 every day in 1910.

I will tell you all three of those reasons. It is interesting on why these people moved from where ever they were to America.            Well first of all the Germans arrived at America. They were the largest single group of immigrants. Then it was the Irish.The Irish came because the Ireland crops failed especially the potato crops. There was a food shortage. Later in the 1800s people from other European countries started to arrive.Like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.Many of them came to America to find work and avoid hungry. And some came for religious freedom these people were mostly from Holland, and the Jews that were from Germany. Also the Poland, and the Russians. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S.A. over a 50 year time period.             The second reason why these people moved to America ia because they were either 'pushed' or 'pulled'. Push meaning people who drove them self away from home. And pull meaning that it attracted them to it. Like Russian Jews 'pushed them self to America because of prejudice and persecution. America 'pulled' the Europeans there because there was jobs and that meant money for food for there family.              The third reason is because of the gold rush. China heard about it and moved to America. They also moved there because too many people were moving to China and they did`t have a lot of rice crops  to feed all of the people in China.The continuous floods were`t very much help. So if they did not have enough food people would starve and die.

And just in time, they were needed to farm, work in factories, to build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did it all.        Germans were the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's, next to them it was the Irish. Before the Amnerican Civil War in the 1860's, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America .(1.7 million irsih men, woman, and cildren.) The Irish were desperate because the crops failed in Ireland. More than 1 million people died in Ireland from starvation.        In the later 1800's people started to come from other european countries. this includes Italy, Poland,Russia,sweden, denmark, and hungary. All the extra people needed homes, food, and jobs. Others came for religous freedom like people from holland and Jews. 26 million immigrants arrived to U.S over a 50 year period, in total. Most of the new people new very little about America except that its the land of freedom. But thats what they wanted freedom.        The second half of the 1800's was the time of great change in america. The industery grew and many more immigrants arrived along the shores.The first railroad that crossed through the united states was built in 1869 which made it easier to get around. Also in the 1800's, there was a rapid change in how quikly information traveled.        Gold was descovered in 1848 along the American river in California. Although Sutter tried to keep it a secret word got out and reached san francisco and 100's og people left there city to go tothe American river. More than 70,000 adventurers arrived at california in 1849. among them all 325 men were from china. In the middle of the 1800's, Guangdong was involved in two wars between china and britain.

Moving to America    During the 1800s,working people who could build,farm,or invent came to America in a ship after ship. With all the new tecnology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do.They worked in factories,to farm and build on the land, and to invent thinges. Immigrants did all that. Germans made up the largest signle group of immigrants inthe 1800s. Also next to the Germans, was the Irish which was the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1800s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. The Irish hsd failed their crops exspecially the potato crop. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Later in the 1800s, people started coming from other European countries to Amrica. This included Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden, and Hungary. In Europe the population was duobled between 1750 and 1850. The people needed food,homes, and jobs but there wasen't enough in Europe. The Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Others came just for freedom. They even came from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany,Poland, and Russia. There were 26 million immogrants that made it to the U.S.A. They just wanted freedom.       Source 2; Changes in America; The ''Pushes'' and ''Pulls'' for Immigrants     The second half of the 1800s was a great in America. The first railroad that crossed the U.S.A was in 1869. This was easier because there were more resorses like silver and lumber from the West to the East. This was true in Europe to. Taking a trip to America inthe earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make it faster. In the 1800s, there was a steam power printer press made expencive books and newspaper. The intervention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 was only for news to travel faster. The reasons they moved are because of the ''pushes'' and ''pulls''. Pushes are features of life that drive people from their homes. It include a harsh envirment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Other elements are rapid incease in the number of people in Europe. Pulls are features of life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth, opprotunities, accsess to resources, and perceived freedom. New European immigrants wanted to escape bad conditions in Europe. Russia Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in form of pogroms-orginized vilont attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles. Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants wanted a new life for them and their families in the U.S.A.       Source 3; Gold Rush, Chinses Move to California   In 1848, gold was discovered along the American River in California, which was found by a man named John Sutter. Sutter tried to keep it secret, but the word got out and reached San Francisco, then hundreds of people went to go find gold. The news spread to the U.S.A. In Jan. of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travelersheaded to CA. The Gold Rush had begun. 70,000 travelers arrived at CA. in 1849.

We all sat down and got ready for the test. The teacher said 'This test will not be graded but you have to try your best.' When billy heard these words he was so happy that it was not graded! 'We are trying out this new test and see how it helps you.' The teacher helped us login and get ready for the test.      When Billy started the test there was alot of words all over the screen.He also saw that the questions were not all bubbled but you had to type your own awnseres! Billy was very nervios.     He got very tired of reading everything to awnser the question and his head started to hert. He took a small break and went on with his test. after he got to a part of the test it said 'once you go any further you cant come back to check your awnsers, are you sure you want to move on.' or something like that. He thought he was fine and went on with the test. The same thing came up about 3 times and he went on.     during the end of  the test he was very tired. He has been working for about 2 hours. but then he went on to the very last question. He tought that he would just awnser this easy question and finally be done! but as soon as he went to the last question he was surprised on what he read.     He had to write about anything he wanted and he was glad about that but it had to be a couple of paragraphs and be neetly written. This whole time the class was very quiet so he could consentrate. He began to write his story which took him forever but he finally got done. He finally hit END TEST and raised his hand. He got done and went back to class.

They came to find freedom to practice their traditions religions and to escape harsh conditions such as famine prejudice and discrimination. Some people came here to find gold in California. That is why most Chinese immigrants came to America but they were mistreated and given the worst equipment available. And when they went to a spot that was open they would fill it so they would have nowhere to look for gold. Russian Jews left due to prejudice in Russia. They also because of pogroms or organized violent attacks against them. Irish immigrants left because of a huge failure of the potato plant and this caused a wide-spread famine. Italians suffered from farming losses due to decreasing prices. They also had too many people and not enough space, in other words people were having too many babies. When they came they changed technology and industry too. When they got here they helped build they Transcontinental Railroad which was a railroad system that spanned across the entire country. Most of the workers where Chinese but some were Irish, African American, and even American. Sometimes the Chinese would get into these baskets full of dynamite and be carried up with some matches. They did this to blow through mountains. When they found a hole in the mountain they would stick dynamite in it light it and then at the perfect push the basket away from the explosions so they would not be harmed.

We will talk about this later. Have you ever thought about the reasons people moved to the United States? Well know you will because you're reading this.       So the Gold Rush was a part in history along the American River. One man struck gold in the river, soon the word spread and people from everywhere started to come for the Gold. People also moved to the USA because their crops were dying or they heard about jobs and magnificent opprotunities that they desperatly needed in the USA. Another reason of the rapid moving to the USA is because people's countries were being attacked.        The United States population started to expand because of all the people coming for the wonderful opprotunities. According to the graph in the article the number of people in the USA in 1860 was 31,513,000 and by 1910 the population grew to 92,407,000! When so many people started to come they had to improve on maintaining so many people. They had made the first railroad that crossed the United States in 1869.        So that's the imformation on some of the reasons people came to America. If your parents weren't born in the USA you should ask them why they moved and how they felt about moving.

They moved because of jobs here, Gold, and also povety starvation in there counrty.Today i will explain these reasons.       In 1848, gold was found along the Columbia River. This drove many Chinese to Amerca. This put a new sauce in the stirring pot.At this time jobs were not found in many places. IN America, we had em. Everyone knew that and this drove many people to america to raise their families.Poverty and Starvation was a key factor to people coming to America. in the 1860s beforre the Civil war, 1.7 Irishmen,women, and chilldren came to USA.

America was the land of the free, so if at any point in time life gets to hard, move to America. Germans and Irish made up the two largest groups of immigrants in the 1800s. When modern conveniences like trains and telephones were invented, people became more aware of the world around them. The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, CA, led to many 'Forty-Niners' from China hoping to strike rich. All of these inventions or discoveries helped America grow.                   During the 1800s, people who could build, farm, or invent came to America. These people were called immigrants, they had move to America from another country. These immigrants were needed to work in the factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Many different kinds of immigrants came to America however Germans were the largest single group of immigrants. Ireland was second, 1/4 of their entire population came to America, that's 1.7 million people. Another large group of people were Jews coming from Germany, Poland, and Russia. From 1860 to 1910 over 26 million people came to America to find freedom and work.                    As transportation improved many immigrants arrived on America's shores. The first railroad across the United States was built. This meant that it became easier to move to America. Also it became easier to print many inexpensive books and newspapers, now news traveled faster. Immigrants usually moved because of a push or a pull. Pushes are features of life that drive people away from their homes, such as war, poverty, and harsh environment. Pulls were the attractions like jobs and freedoms. Immigrants hoped to make new life for themselves and their families.                    When John Sutter found gold in his mill he tried to keep it a secret. Not long after word got out to San Francisco, a people poured in by the thousands, all wanting to strike rich. This is how so many Chinese immigrated to America. They had heard about the gold and came to strike rich. Some however we also fleeing from conflicts and poverty. The people who could not afford to sail to America felt hopeless as they listened to tales of gold in California, gold they could not get. In the span of 21 years there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States. America had used the Chinese as workers for the first transcontinental railroad. The Chinese came to America because of both pushes and pulls.                    Over all there have been many different people immigrating to America. All of them in different time-set with different reasons. The Germans with pushes, the Europeans and the Chinese with pushes and pulls. America is definitely the great melting pot of the other countries.

People were searching for better lives from where they were first living.  Because of how the other contries were declining, people came to Amereica to start over.             Immigrants from Europe were the first to come.  They were made up of people from Germeny, Ierland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.  Population increased in Europe so people were getting shortage of jobs and food.  Because of this, immigrants moved to America to get these things.  Also, people got religious freedom.  More and more people kept coming to America.             Later on, industry grew so even more people came.  Steam ships were made so people could get to America faster. Also, the invention of steam trains alowed people to get across America faster.  The printing press got redesigned to make more books and newspapers.  News spread faster and so did trasportation. More people left their homes to get better lives in America.             Immigrants from China started coming when they heard about the gold rush.  Americans migrated west and found gold mines to get rich.  Chinese immigrants wanted to get their family out of poverty because taxes raised and there were food losses in China.  So, the Chinese came to America in a hurry!  America got filled with the Chinese mining the gold.              America got filled with immigrants from all over the world!  In 1806, there were 31,513,000 people in it.  By 1910, there were92,407,000 people in it!  41,998,932 of the people weren't born in America.

The reason why the people moved was because some of them needed jobs. Some of the people began to move because of the floods they had. People also moved because of the civil war and the politics. The people that moved were probly shocked and terrified of moving to America because it'd be hard to adapt to. Before the American Civil War in the 1860's, 1/4 of the whole population  came to America. 1.7 million Irish men, women and children kept coming, during and after the war.

Most people move because they can't find a job in their country, or they don't have food. But there are other reasons that people migrate.                  Immigration is when people turn into immigrants,  Immigrants are people that moved from one country from another. Immigration has been going on for hundreds of years and people still migrate from other country's. Immigration was good in the 1800s because it helped with the transcontinental railroad. The railroad went from 30,626 miles to 240,263 miles.                           It also helped the coal production, they went from 20,471,000 tons to 417,111,000 tons that's a big improvement. Most of the immigration happened when the gold rush hit in California. During the gold rush thousands of Chinese people went to California. The first year about 325 Chinese people came to the U.S then 450 more then the numbers got big. 2,716 Chinese came in 1851 20,026 came in 1852 and by 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the U.S. Over 70,00 people arrived in California in 1849.                  It helped a lot of building industries and other business. A lot of the people left because they didn't have any money or their crops failed and they needed new land.

Some reasons are gold, jobs, war,disease, etc.       Many Chinese came in search of gold during the California gold rush of 1849.Some people who came were called the Forty-Niners. The gold was discovered by John Sutter in 1848.He wanted to keep it a secret, but word got around and soon everyone was there.This affected our country majorly because about 63,000 Chinese migrated from China to North America. The Chinese called the gold rush gold mountain and they heard many stories of how rich California is.       Millions of people came to America to invent,farm, or build.Hundreds of ships came full of people.Factories were spreading all over the place and they were in need of workers and then the immigrants came just in time.Most of the people were German.The Irish were the second largest group to come to North America during this time period.1.7 Million Irish men, women, and children.They were coming before, during, and after The Civil War.They were desperate because their crops were failing, especially their potatoes.There was a food shortage for a while and over 1,000,000 people died of starvation.Later in the 1800s more people started to arrive.This includes Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark,Sweden, and Hungary.Many of them came for work and to avoid starvation.About 26,000,000 immigrants arrived in North America over just 50 years!       The later 1800s transportation was improving.The United States had their first Continental Railroad.

You have to get used to everything over there. The things you have to get used to over there are the people, language, and the food. Moving to a new country is difficult.

By the way over in other countries the money is different there than it is here in America. So you might have to find a job that will pay you in the money that their country uses.         The food is way different there its not like here in America where you can get burgers and pizza. You have to eat foods that you never even know existed. Some people might like them but I'm sure you wont like them. If you go to a restaurant you wont even know how to order off the menu.

'Pushes' are those features in life that drive people from thier homes, these include a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, poverty, and bad economy.

They also came over here to find gold because of a man named John Stutter. He tried to keep it a secret, but he couldn't. Then the word spread out, and everyone in California knew. Then the word  got to San Francisco. Then everyone started coming from everywhere.

Many different cultures and religions have rooted themselves in the United States. With out the immigration boom in the 1800s we might not have the country we have today.       In the beginning of the 1800s, many German and Irish immigrants came to the U.S. in search of jobs and land. Before the civil war, 1.7 million Irish immigrants entered the United States. Irish crops had failed causing the Irish immigration. The population of Europe doubled  during this time period leaving many homeless and starving. Jews came to America hoping to find religious freedom. By the end of a 50 year time span, 26 million people had arrived in America.       By the second half of the 1800s, there was a great change in industry and transportation. The first railroad that crossed America was completed in 1869. This made it easier to move lumber and silver from coast to coast. A trip to the U.S. would have normally taken months but new steam ships could move much faster. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and the phone in 1867 made news travel much faster.       Gold was found in the American River in 1848 by a man named John Sutter. The news spread rapidly across the United States and the rest of the world as well. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousand of over land travelers were headed to California. Among the '49ers were 325 men from China. The first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, a place on China's south coast. The government in China raised taxes and farmers who could not pay for their land had to sell their farms. At the time, the population was also growing rapidly. So the Chinese hoped to find their fortune in the California hills.       Millions of men and women worked very hard and made it to America. If they could do that imagine what we can do now. Culture is very important in America and always will be.

If you do you might know this is called your herritage. Its called immigration. If you know anything about immigration you should know it means leaving a place to move to another. In the early 1800s is were immigration was big in the U.S.A people left there home countries due to a reason called push factors. Sometimes people would leave their home countries alos due to pull factors here in America.       In 1860 Ireland was ahaving a famine in food. the wrost was on that caused them not to have enough potatos or any type of food. Famously known as the Potato famine. Over that corse of time more than 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children had immigrated to America so that they could get a job and have food on their table ounlike the million left back at their home country that had died starving. Another reason people left their home countries were based on pull factors. These included most of the countries in the European area.       Some left for religous beliefs and some left for some of the same reasons the Irish people did. Some left for jobs as well when they left for jobs our industrial production sky roketed. With more people coming to get jobs we could produce more products than ever. Over the years of 1860-1910 coal and railroad prouctions went up in numers of 396,370,000 (coal in tons) and 200,667 (railroad tracks in miles.)This helped build our economy.       Also the gold rush played a major part in immigration. It was known as a major pull factor. Most people that immigrated because the cause of the gold rush were just excited for the chance to strike it rich most people didn't find anything but, they found it still a thrill to be part of the excitment. Overall Immigration helped this country a lot. Even though most people may have been made fun of for their heritage and culture it playe a major part in our lives toady. It helped us grow industrally and fiancially.  Just think if immigrants from Italy didn't come here we wouldn't have pizza!

An other reason they moved was because of poor crops and farming. The Irish had lack of potato growth and other plants. They wern't the only ones that had lack of crops. They soon had a shortage on food and recorses.                Other places went to America for jobs like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweeden, and Hungary. They also went for homes and a new life and to restart. Or just to be more Happy.                 One other reason that gave us mor immagrents was the Gold Rush. So many Chinese came over to the USA  just for the Gold Rush. By Janurary of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of outlanders came. The California Gold Rush has begun.The next year thousands of Chinese came from Eastern USA. This raised our population.                  These are some of the reasons why so many Immagrents came to the USA. Hope you like my summary for immagration.

Our nation is made up of many immagrants from all around the globe like Asia, Mexico, Europe, and much more, with hopes and dreams of living a better life for their families. Most of the immagrants do succeed their dreams and live better lives. One thing is not a lot of people do not understand why they come here.       Reasons Why People come to America         In America we offer jobs to people in need.  We have homeless shelters that help some families that don't have homes and live on the street. There are soup kitchens that feed the ones that are truly in need of it.  Freedom of expression.  People rule their lives how thehy want to. Our schools offer better learning (depends on the teacher, student, and sometimes state)             Back then racism was a big thing but now it is one thing that a lot of people are against. Since there is no rasicm most people don't have to worry about a thing. In America there are hard workers of many races Black, White , Latino, and Asian. Altough there still is a couple of racist people in this world manny people try not to mind about it.             America is a wonderful place where people can share their ideas and not be critisized by their race, religeon, or anything like that. In 1860 the American population was 31,513,000 and now we have way more thatn you can imagine, millions and millions of people live here.            I for one and all am greatful that my family decided to leave Mexico and come to the U.S ( United States) where I was born and raised. It gave my family work so we have a better life; no wonder they call America, 'the land of opertunities'.

Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrants group. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage.

America was one of the more successful places during this time, because many of the other economies in other countries were very low. America was one of the free countries at this time, so for that reason people living in places with little freedom found it a great opportunity to go there. Immigrants escaped their harsh conditions in their home countries. Others came for religious freedom and to escape wars.              One reason why they left was, because the industry grew greatly. Transportation improved; therefore, people found that a good reason to come. With advanced transportation people found it easier to travel places they needed to go to.

There was needed work to do in all of the factories, which with the help of immigrants helped factories grow. They were used to help farm and build land for everyone coming there. Lastly, they helped invent many new things that we use in the modern day world.               The immigrants helped a lot during the 1800s.

That's really brave of them! Many of the people who moved from their home lands came for many reasons.   These people came from all around the world, like Russia, China, and other European countries.          Some people wanted better lives for their family. Others just wanted gold! But the main reason was to have a better life. These people might have had hard times in their home, like people criticizing their religion, not enough jobs, lack of food, and bad farming land. But when these people moved to America, their lives changed. They had better jobs, farming land, and homes.        When I said that people came to America for gold, I was telling the truth! A man had struck gold in California, and word got around. The Chinese were having some bad luck like government problems, family feuds, and raised taxes. They felt hopeless until they heard about the gold. Gradually, more and more of the Chinese moved to America, hoping to have good fortune.        As you can see, many people have moved to America. And it's still happening! These people have found a better life in our country. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty proud of that.

Many people came and the builders built a railroad for the rest of the people who wanted to come didn't have to go on a ship. The came just in time. Because of all the new technoogy, they could stay busy. The people were needed in factories, to farm, build on land,and to invent things. There was a deal that if they did that then they could stay so the immigrants did just that.             Germans had the most single group of  immigrants come from a different country in the 1800's. The Irish were the second highest immgration group. 1.7 million, one fourth, kids, men, and women came to America from Ireland before the Civil War in the 1860's. More people came during and after the war. The Irish came because they were running out of food due to the shortage of the crops that pretty much failed to support food for the people. More than one million people died in Ireland because of starvation.              In the later 1800's, people started coming from other countrys in Europe such as Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweeden, and Hungary. The population of the country Europe, doubled between 1750 and 1850. All the extra people needed food, a house, and a job for all of them and they needed one of each.

America was offering so much more than their home towns and cities. Like religious freedom, jobs so they could provide for their family, getting away from the wars, and there just happened to be a food shortage at the time. How lucky were they? So taking everyone to America was a small price to pay for all the benefits it would supply. So when word had gotten around about all the advantages everybody was on their way to America!   Germans made up the biggest single group of immigrants in the eighteen hundreds. Second largest single immigrant group was the Irish. Just before the ACW (American Civil War) in the eighteen sixties, twenty-five percent of Ireland's population ventured to America. That was one point seven million Irish men, women, and children. They continued to come after and during the war. The Irish were needy because all of their crops were failing, especially the potato plant. Since the crops were failing, a food shortage was established. More than one million people died of starvation.   Later on, in the eighteen hundreds people started coming from other European countries that had few people that had ever traveled to America. The countries were Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The amount of people had doubled in Italy between seventeen-fifty and eighteen-fifty. All of the extra people were in need of food, work, and homes. There just wasn't any jobs available and frankly, no food. The homes were all taken so that meant that many Europeans came to America to avoid starvation.   Many came for the religious freedom that was given in America. Not many countries had that, usually the rulers religion (if had one) was the only belief you were allowed to practice. In America, you choose your religion (if any) and get to do what ever you want with it. These included people from Holland, and Jews who arrived from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Jews were often bullied and down talked to for what their religion was.   In all, around twenty-six million immigrants traveled to the United States of America over a fifty year period of time. Most new travelers knew little to none information on America, except that it meant being free. That's exactly what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.

The Transportation had succeed. The first railroad ever  had crossed the United States was complete in 1869. People may travel on these trains too. This was true in Europe too. Travelers now could get on a train that would take them straight to a boat. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships will make trip even faster. These advances in transportation made it more possible for more people to travel more easily.       In the 1800s, there were also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. Steam power and the redesign of the printing made it possible to  print many in expensive books and newspapers. This made news and ideas available to more people. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.           People became more aware of the world around them and with ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever before. The reasons they moved are often characterized as 'pushes' and 'pulls.' Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes. These include a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Many of these push elements were made  worse by rapid increase in the number of people in Europe. Pulls are those features of life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth,opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.           Many of the European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution , in the form of pogroms ___organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from  high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. The tradition of leaving of family land to first-born male often left younger siblings landless. Hungarians, Greeks, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States.            During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship after ship. Just in time! With all new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do.They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and invent things. Immigrants did all that.

Why did more immigrants move to the U.S. in the 1800's well, today I am going to show you why. First, let me give you a quick summary before we start I will first tell you about the California gold rush and all the fertile farming land in the U.S., then I will go on to the bad crops in Ireland, and the reason poverty destroyed Europe's population. Now lets get started on this exciting topic!              First, the reason why everyone came to California. the reason is simple, GOLD RUSH. more than 70,000 'forty-niners' came to the U.S. to get rich on gold. Unfortunately, many people died while trying to make a fortune. then after all the gold was gone they didn't have enough money to get back home (plus the land was good for growing crops) so they set up homesteads all across the country and claimed their land.              Next, why did almost everyone leave Ireland? Well, the land in Ireland wasn't doing so well and all the crops died. Thus, causing a chain reaction of poverty, hunger, and disease all throughout Ireland. then they heard that the U.S. had so much land that they each could have a farm the size of a small country. So they took the next boat to make their fortune.              Finally, the reason why almost all of Europe's population left. The reason why almost everyone lest from Europe was that the population at least doubled and so that led to poverty and hunger. they also left because the weather was very harsh and cold.

They had come to America because of different reasons such as poverty. Other reasons include war or the lack of freedom. Some of the main reasons why people moved to America is a new chance at life, changes in the industry, and the gold rush.       Back in the 1800's, some places like Ireland could not grow enough food to support its population. Because of that, many people moved to Amercia to have a better life. Other people in Europe needed food, homes, and jobs so they moved to America so they would not have to starve and could find jobs. People also came for religious freedom so they could follow their beliefs without being mistreated.       Some changes in the industry allowed more people to settle in America. They had better transportation and could travel to America faster. Railroads also allowed some material such as silver to be moved quicker. A change in the printing press allowed more copies of newspapers so news and ideas spread much more quickly. The invention of telegraph and telephone increased the spread of news too.       When gold was discovered in California, the news spread quickly and people went there to find some gold. Some of these people were the Chinese who came to escape poverty and high taxes. Population was growing and rice could not be grown quick enough with the floods destroying crops. The Chinese came to California to make fortune and return to China with gold. Eventually, thousands of Chinese people were in California and helped build the first transcontinental railroad.    Some of the reasons why people from across the world came to America was to get a new chance at life, changes in industry, and the gold rush. These people moved because of their problems back in their country. When they moved to America, they wanted to get jobs, freedom, and wealth.

In the 1800s and 1900s, many people migrated from other countries to America. Many came during the Gold Rush in California to find gold. Others came to seek freedom from their own countries. Some main reasons why people came to America in the 1800s is because of their home country difficulties, America's freedom and oppurtunites, and jobs and money.        Many people left their birth country because of the difficulties they had. For example, the Irish left their country because of their potato crop failure, which caused millions of people to die. Another example includes when the Chinese in Guangdong left to find gold in California. In Guangdong, there were many fights and rebellions, high taxes, and overpopulation with food shortages because farmers had to sell their land due to the taxes. Also, Southern Italians left because of their tradition that the family's land goes to the firstborn male, leaving the other children landless.       In addition to that, people came for freedom and oppurtunities. They wanted to start a new life in America. For example, Jews left to get away from prejudice and persecution. Other people came to escape wars. People from Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came for religious freedom, because in European countries people mistreated them for their religion. Source #1 also stated: 'Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.'       Lastly, people also came for new jobs and money. The overpopulation in Europe caused people to become homeless, hungry, and poor. These people came to America to get a job and avoid being hungry. The Chinese came for gold, fortune, and prosperity when they returned home. Because of all these people from other countries, industry grew greatly, allowing more and more jobs to be filled and taken. Advances that America developed, such as transportation with the railroad and trains, steam power, the telegraph, and the telephone, also attracted people.        America was a land of refuge, freedom, and money to these immigrants. Many people came to escape harsh conditions in their home countries, while others came for more oppurtunities and a new life. Still, many others came for jobs and fortune. Without these advantages that America had in the past, it probably may have never become the land that we know of today.

The reasons people left were because of pushes 'features that drove people from their homes' in their homeland, and pulls 'features of life that attract people' in America.

The largest number of immigrants from a particular country came from Germany where the Jewish people were because they were mistreated because of religion. Next was 1.7 million Irish who left out of sheer panic and desperation after their potato crops failed, leaving them with food shortages that killed over a million Irish people. Southern Italy had their crop prices lowered which meant there wasn't enough food or money for people, especially considering that fact that they had a very high birth rate. Organized violent attacks or pogroms were what the Russian Jews faced as a form of predjudice. Also, because the population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850, there weren't enough jobs, food, or homes for all of them. Many European countries experienced pulls like poverty, the cruelenviroment, and war. It wasn't just Europe, because a place in China called Guangdong experienced pushes like a growing population, poverty, high taxes, war, rebellions, and food shortages. As shown in the paragraph, there were many hardships, or pushes that drove Europeans and Asians out of their countries so they could go to America, where there were glorious pulls alluring them.

This was because there was the push and pull. One reason why people moved to the United States were because their country is having hardship at that time. Another reason is that people came because there was a attraction. The final reason why people immigrated to the United States was because of the Gold Rush. These resulted as America grew in population by the ten millions.                    People moved to the United States because their own country was suffering from hardships. Ireland was suffering from shortage of food and starvation. Therefore, many people in Ireland moved to the United States where they hoped to have a better life. People like the Jews also came for their religious freedom or just freedom. Russian Jews escaped the hard conditions and came to America to have religious freedom. Other people like the Chinese moved to the United States so they could escape war in China, the raise in taxes, natural disasters, and shortage of food. Since other people's country was not good enough they came to the United States to have a better life.                   People also came to the United States because of its attractions. At the time,1860 to 1910, America was advancing in technology. For example, America made the first railroad tracks and the telephone. They also made printing newspaper and books inexpensive. America also had freedom that many other countries do not have. Therefore, people came to the United States for wealth, jobs, resources, and freedom.               Like the Chinese, people moved to the United States for the Gold Rush. In California, large amounts of gold was discovered and people from all around the world came and hoped they could find enough gold to be worth it coming. They hoped to get rich and return to where they came from wealthy. As a result, the population in California grew for more than 10,000 people. This is why people came to the United States in the Gold Rush.                  Lots of people came to the United States because of either the push or the pull. One reason is that they are suffering from hardship in their country and hope to get a better live. They also came because of all the attractions in America. Finally, they came because of the California Gold Rush.

They would either suffer religious or political problems. The imigrants didnt realy want to come here but it was better than staying at thier own country. Many of the imigrants were European and others were Russian, German, and Pollan. Also Africans, Mexicans, and Asians.                         Even though they came to escape troubles, some faced even more. Africans were slaves because of their skin color until the civil war ended. Some Europeans were not allowed because of  the illnesses they had. Other European couldnt find homes or jobs because of their skin color or luanguage. It was also hard for immigrants because they had no freinds or family to expect. They also had to find foods they were used to. Plus they had to change religions and customs. Lastly they had to get youst to the geography.                            At one point amerians decided that imigrants had to stop comming into america.

We are going to be recognizing the stories of those who immigrated to the United States over the 200 years. During the1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship after ship. With all the new technology I the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent thing. In later time 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America The population of the Europe double up to 1,750.             The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. In the1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. The first rail road that crossed the United State was completed in 1869. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in1876 only made news travel faster. Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes. Pulls are those features of life that attract people. Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. The tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings.              Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. By January of 1849, 60 ship and thousand of overland travelers were headed for California. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849. Amoung these 'Forty Niners' were 325 men from china. Like the people who came from the eastern Unitied States, the chinese hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills. There also many against the government raised taxes.

Another reason why people moved to America is beacuse America was the only country to have railroads and steam powered boats. So once people started to find out about about transportation, people wanted to move to America.

Before the American Civil Wars, about one-fourth of the population of Ireland moved to America. they even kept coming after the war and during the war.

Later, others from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary arrived to escape various problems. Some of them came for freedom and riches. They wanted a new chance in life.                     How did they arrive? Many immigrants arrived as new transportation technology came in. The new steamships could make the trip much faster. Trains connected the world. The printing press made more newspapers, and people had more news and ideas available. The telegrah and telephone made news travel even faster.                     Why did these people come? Many people came to America for the chance of freedom. Others wanted to escape the violence and poverty of their home country. Many Chinese came because of the Gold Rush in 1849, and America's population grew even more. Other people also came for hope of discovering gold.

You hear news about a gold rush in America and you consider going. Would you stay in your hometown, or would you leave to maybe become rich?

America was the only place to go.   people are coming to America and doubling our population               One fourth of Ireland came to America before the civil war. The Irish were desperate because crops failed and the potato crisis was taking place. More than one million Irish died of starvation in Irelandsoon people started coming from Europe because they were in deep poverty. They needed homes, jobs, and food. there wasn't enough of those things to have so many people living there. People also came from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia for religious freedom. 26 million immigrants came too America in a 50 year period.               Transportation in America improved. The railroad that crossed the united states was finished and that made travel easier and easier over the years. In Europe there was a train that would take you to a steam boat, making travel to America ten times faster. Technology quickened and made inventing easier. By then the press made many newspapers and books faster. The telephone was invented and now everyone could transport information around the state. People from around the world came to America after hearing the great possibilities we had to opportunities opened and more people came.                Gold was discovered in 1848 by a man named John Sutter. By January of 1849 thousands of travelers came to seek fortune. Among 70,000 hopefuls 325 were Chinese. Most of the Chinese came from Guangzhou. The Chinese government raised taxes and life became hard on the Chinese. Some of the population left the harsh laws and traveled to California hoping to seek fortune. The 325 Chinese who came to America were just the start. The next year 450 more Chinese came to America hopping to seek their dreams.       People are coming to America and doubling our population.

They came because of the pushes and pulls, and The Gold Rush.          Their are many pushes and pulls for immigrants. A push is a feature that drives people from their homes. A pull is a feature that attracts people. One push was that Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and poverty. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians moved. All of these immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families.           Another reason why immigrants left to America was because of the Gold Rush. Gold was first discovered in 1848 on the property of a man by the name of John Shutter. He tried to keep the discovery a secret, but soon everybody herd the news all the way from San Fransisco. It later spread acroos the rest of the United States and even other parts of the world. In January of 1849, the Gold Rush had begun. More than 70 thousand adventurers arrived in 1869. Of these adventurers, 325 were Chineese migrants.  Most of the Chineese came here because they were fleeing conflicts and poverty.

There are many reasons and you are gonna learn about them in this essay. One reason is because of things happening in their country. Others include freedom, land, etc.        During the 1800s, many immigrants came to America because of their special abilities such as building, farming, or inventing. It is also known as pushes or pulls. It means that you come here either from harsh conditions or for freedom. Most immigrants came to America to escape the harsh conditions of their own country. Germans came here for religious freedom.You will find that the immigrants also came here for specific reasons.                                                 Another half of people wanted to come for change in life. Many wanted to come for the land, jobs, wealth, and freedom. Others came to start a new beginning. Many immigrants suffered from there country. One of the last reasons why immigrants came to America was because of a fascinating discovery.         The Gold Rush attracted many people to come to San Francisco. Gold was discovered there along the American River. These mostly caught  the Chinese. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. They called California Gam Saan meaning 'Gold Mountain.' 325 Chinese joined in and greatly increased each year. It increased from 325 to 63,000!        As you can see, there are many reasons why immigrants came to the United States. Most came for wealth while others came for freedom. No matter what they came for, it helped shape the United State as it is today.

The railroad made transporting things easier to move heavy things like wood from the west to the east. People learned more about the world around them because of the railroads. The railroads were a 'pull' for others to come to America.       In the year 1848 gold was discovered near a river, it was on the land of a man named John Sutter.

One of the reasons and the the most significant was hard times in their own country. Other reasons were the gold rush in California and the technology advancement in the U. S.  Another is choice of religion. People had different reasons and they also came from many different places.                 In Ireland 1.7 million people or a forth of their population immigrated to America. They were having food shortages due to failing crops on farms. 1,000,000 died of starvation but others left before they came to the same fate. A different problem arose in Europe. Their population had grown enormously and there was no longer space to accommodate all the people. So then some of the population came over to the U.S. Other people came so they could have the freedom of religion like many Jews.               Other people came because there was something they wanted in America. One example is the Chinese and the California gold rush. They were living in struggle and in America they would have an opportunity to be rich. 63,000 Chinese were in America by 1870 and 77% were in California.

Ireland and Germany were two places that had a lot of their population come to America. People also came from all over Europe and China.

The 1800's was a significant time for America. During the early 1800's many immigrants came over to America. It was either for farmland, building space or all of the new technology in America. The German had the most immigrants that came to America but the second most was the Irish. One fourth of Irish immigrants cam to America! That was 1.7 million Irish people. People from Ireland came over for the crops because there potato crop was not growing for some reason. Later many European countries were coming to America. All this people needed homes, jobs and food to eat! Many European countries also came over to America for religious freedom. Jews were mistreated a lot in Germany, so that's why most Germans came over to America.       Many people would 'push' and 'pull' to America. 'Push' meaning they would get closer to liking America and its traits and 'Pull' meaning they would start to dislike America for reasons. Many people started to come to America because of the new transportation. Trains and boats were very new for people from other countries so they wanted to be part of something new. Many immigrants from European countries wanted to get out of hard and violent life. Russian Jews would get attacked and get killed a lot because of there beliefs. Some Italians would move to America because of the farming losses and high birth rates. A tradition they had was the first born male would commonly leave the siblings landless and homeless.       Gold was found in 1848 which attracted a high amount of Chinese immigrants. The 'Forty Niners' came to America because of the high poverty and floods which would destroy there crops. Tales and stories would keep making the Chinese coming because of the 'riches' and 'wealth' the gold had to offer. 325 Chinese immigrants were in the gold rush in 1849.

Many of the first emigrants were Germans. Although Germans were the most common in early America , you would still see a variety of other ethnic races such as Irish, Russians, and the Swedish. One reason some people came was for religious freedom, such as the Jews. Some would come only for wealth , such as the Chinese.     Some major advancements began to form such as the newspaper, telegraph,and steam ships. Newspaper was important to the citizens because they helped spread the news quicker than by mouth. Telegraph was also important because it helped news travel half-way across the country!Steam ships were also extremely important because it made travel easier.     For the people who emigrated , it was considered an amazing chance at a new life. Although people came for different reasons they all had one goal in mind:Freedom.

People also went there because they were short on food and supplies and so moved  to the United States.People who could build farms or invent went to America in a ship and another and another and then there were all this new technology in the 1800s, there were a lot for the newcomers to do.

One other thing is that the 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then suddenly they  came in great numbers:2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852.By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States, and they had played a critical part in building the first transcontinental railroad.

I will be doing it in sources from the story like source #1 #2 #3 and.   Let's begin with source #1. In the 1800's people who farm or invent came to America in ships. They were their just in time. All the new technology in America needed help . They needed people to work in farms and factories, also to invent new things. Of course the immigrants can do that!All through the half of the 1800's 26 million immigrants came to America. This included Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden, and also the Hungary.     On with section #2! In section 2 it states how in the other half of the 1800's America was completed! That meant, it would be a lot easier to move silver and lumber from west to east.In Europe also it was true. Travelers would be able to get on a train that would take them to directly to a boat. It was amazing how this worked. Also right before 1800 ended, people could get news quickly and rapidly. Steam power and printing press made it easier to get newspapers out faster. Everyone loved  the thought of that.          In section 3 , it talks about the ''California Gold Rush.'' Well, gold was discovered in 1848 on the property of a man names John Sutter. Eventually the word got out. Everyone wanted gold. It was such a rush that people from china heard about it!More than 70,000 adventures arrived in California. Among these people, 325 Chinese men came to California hills hoping to find their fortunes and other things. Over the years more and more people came. Most of the Chinese immigrants came from this place called Guangdong. Everyday in Guangdong,the population grew... a lot! This area could not produce enough rice to eat. Especially when these big floods destroyed all of these crops.All those citizens of china felt hopeless. They always listened to tells about California. They called it the gold mountain. It seemed it was a land of fortunes and richness. All of them loved it. Each year the chinese joined the gold rush in bigger groups. In the last group it was big! The last group had 63,000 people.

Immigrants are when other people from another country move to a different country.Immigrants move to a different country because some don't have things that other country have like food, homes, and jobs.      Immigrants who can built and farm came to America just in time. They were needed to work in new factories,to farm and work on the land; to invent things. The Germans and the Irish were the largest immigrant groups. The immigrants kept on coming before and after the war. The European immigrants wanted to get away from the harsh condition in Europe.Since the immigrants have been coming to America the population has gone up since 1860 to 1910.       The Chinese immigrants came from Guangzhou, an area on China's south coast. they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.The Chinese government raised up the taxes and farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sale there land. Guangzhou population grew quickly. The area couldn't produce enough food to feed the people.      The Europeans trip took months to get to America but if they would have took the steamships it could have gone shorter.They had a tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless.the immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families.

One-fourth of Ireland came to America, because many of their crops were failing. One million people died of hunger. These aren't the only people that fled to America. Other people, such as the Jews left for freedom. Most Europeans left to find work and to prevent hunger, like the people from Ireland. Most of them left for freedom and a chance to twork.       The reason they move can be judged by something called pulls and pushes. A pull is when something attracts people to leave their home.this can be caused by jobs, wealth, easily acessed resoursces, freedom and opportunities. A push is when it drives you from your home, when you have to leave. Examples of this is something like harsh enviorment, wars, and other conflicts.         When immagrants came to America their transportation improved. They built a railroad track and finished it in 1869. The railroad tracks made transportation easier and quicker. It also made it easier to transport objects like silver and lumber from West to East. The second half of the 1800s changed America a lot. The trains could transport Europeans to boats, so they can travel to America. The trip to just get to the boats would take months. This makes transportation more easier for them.         The Gold Rush was a very big event in time. A lot of people moved to America for the gold that had been discovered. Their was a large number of the Chinese immagranting to California.

Since the transportation improved with railroads and steamships it was then easier and faster for more people to travel at a time. Also they were now able to move resources like silver and lumber.       When gold was discovered in 1848 among the American  River in California on the property of man named, John Sutter. He tried to keep it a secret but soon the news spread on different parts of the world. By 1849 the California gold rush had begun, ships and people from everywhere were traveling to California. More then 70,000 people traveled there. Many Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast. They were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. The Chinese government had raised their taxes. Farmers had to sell their land, the area could not produce enough rice to feed their people.

Immigrants also did it because they had heard it was a place with freedom. When the ships were taking people to America they took inventors, farmers and anyone who could build first. Later in the 1800s different European countries came looking for food, homes,and jobs. Twenty-six million immigrants docked in the United States and most of them new very little about the place they have just came to but they did know there was freedom!

January 1849 sixty ships headed straight for the American River! People then called them the Forty-Niners. Many people listened to all the tells of gold being near the Pacific Ocean. They began to call California the Gold Mountain! Three hundred and twenty-five Chinese men joined the Gold Rush in 1849 had just begun their search for gold.

Gold was found in 1849 alon the river, in California. Lots of fravelers were going to go to Cilifornia. The gold rush is about to get started.

They needed to have new jobs and beable to build new land and work in factories. They also needed to invent things. The Germans were the first ones to make a single group of immagrations. The second largest group were Ireland. The American Civil war in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whoe population of Ireland came to America.       Later on, people started coming from Europian countries. Also people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and Hungary. Europe's population increased between 1750 and 1850. Those extra people needed food, shelter, and jobs. Europians came to America to avoid hunger and to find jobs.       Others came for religious freedom. Those people included from Holland, and Jews from Germany, Poland, and also Russia. Others came because of the war that was happening. That made life unstable and unpredictable.       A total of 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. A lot of newcomers knew very little about America. Except that was land of freedom. That's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.       The second half of the 1800s was a great time for a change in America. The Industry grew into many immagrants and arrived on America's shores. The transportation was improved. The first ever railroad was completed in 1869. These railroads were used for traveling from place to place.

In the old days people had a hard time living because they did not have any food to eat. People from China wanted to go to the United States because there was gold that was being found and they wanted to the gold to feed there family. Families wanted to go to live in the United States because they thought it was a better place for their children. That is why people moved to the United States.             First, the reason why most people came to the United States was because there was gold found along the America River in California. The gold was on John Stutter's property he tried to keep it a secret but then everyone heard about the gold. Then after the word spread thousands of overland and ships all headed to California. Lots of people came from China and they kept coming for years. There were lots of people in California after they heard about the gold that is why most of they people came to the United States.             Second, the other reason why people came to the United States because they heard that they were offering jobs. Right before the American Civil War one-fourth of Ireland came to America. Then people from other countries that haven't sent a lot of people to America started going to America. Even people from other religions came to America like Jews and many more.There was about 26 million immigrants that arrived to the United States. That is my second reason why people come and moved to the United States.             Third, the last reason why people moved to the United States is that it was easier for they to get there. In 1869 the first railroad that crossed the United States was build. People thought it was a much easier way to get to the United States so they started coming. The train was much faster that the ships because it would take them months and if they went be train it would take them days. That is my last reason why people moved to the United States.             Finally, those are my reasons why people moved to the United States. I hope i have given you ideas why people have moved to America. In the 1800's it was a hard time for people because they had to work just so they could feed their family. It was hard for people because they had to leave everything behind all their friends and some of their family members. Those are all my ideas why people had moved to the United States.

Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. Farmers who were unable to pay their taxes and had to sell their land.

Sometimes your family has to move for different reasons, some that are very important some that are not. But everyone moves, you move to a different state, your moving out of your parnets house, you got a diverce. All kinds of reason you would but not in the past there was only 2 or 3 reasons why.          For one, peolpe would move because there family is in a different state and they wanna see them and be with them. Back then it was hard being away from your family. How would you like to wake every morning wishing your parnets were there. Sometimes a parnet could have just deid and you have to move to live with your grandma because you can't live by yourself.         Another reason, just lost your job and you can't find a new one. If you had to, you would have to move to a new country to find a job you can do to feed your family. It was hard trying to feed, bath, and dress kids because of the money they got, which was not enough sometimes. Kids went days without eating or takes baths. Sometimes they had to wear the same clothes for at least a week.           But, what if both happened to you? You lost a mom or dad and you lost your job on the same day. Plus, having three to four kids, man that would ruin your life. You have sruggle with money, food, and bills. I would have hated living in the old days they sound rough.          In concluison, I believe they move because they sruggle with life. Somepeople might not agree thats fine. But, somepeople may never know what went on back then. Somebody may have had a uncle or grandpa who lived back then so they can find out. The world may never know.

And just in time! With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all that.                     Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.) They kept coming, during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.                      In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs-and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.

People from other countries have moved to America could be because they didn't have enough money, or they wanted to start all over again in a new country. But here are some good reasons. People could want new jobs in America, they could also want to live with their other family members like their cousins which they rarely get to see. People also move to America is because maybe they don't like where they live. People also move is because maybe the houses in the area are cheep.

Many immigrants are migrating, from people from Germany to China. They are moving to the Americas to escape trouble and to live a better life where they will have jobs and food to keep their families healthy.  The immigrants are moving to America, because they have fled government issues, poverty, economical troubles, religious freedom, and many other reasons.        Many people migrated to America to find jobs and to avoid starvation. In the 1800s, the two most largest group of immigrants were the Germans and the Irish. Many came to America, because they were desperate. Their crops had failed which meant starvation, and more than 1 million people had died because of the lack of food. Then, in the later 1800s, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark,Sweden, and even Hungary had sent people to America, because of not being able to have a job, own a house, or even pay for food. Others, such as the Jewish from Holland, Poland, and Germany came for religious freedom. They were often mistreated because of their beliefs. The people who had jobs and could pay for houses and food came to America because of war which made life dangerous for them. Despite the hardships they might of had to go through to get to America, it was worth it to them, because in the end they had their freedom and they had a better life with jobs and without poverty.          In the later  1800s, great changes took place in the Americas, such as growth of industry and improved transportation. Railroads had been complete in 1869 to make transportation of materials easier, and many people could travel faster. They had also developed ships that moved by steam which made the ship go at a faster rate. The printing press had also been improved to make a more numerous amount of daily newspaper. In 1844 the telegraph and telephone had been invented which made news travel quicker. These were things that pulled in the immigrants to America. Many people also wanted to escape the harsh condition and farming losses.The luxuries and opportunities of jobs and new inventions attracted them to come to America and start a better life.

These people include the Irish, the Italian, the Jews, the Chinese, Germans, Russians, and others as well. Some reasons could possibly be for food, religious freedom, gold, and more. People emigrated to the United states and were able to replant their roots for a very long time.            One large group of people that came to America for generally the same reason are the Jews. They were strongly hated for their religion and prejudice led to many violent fights. To escape the harsh cruelty of their own neighbors, many decided to leave and go to America where no one would judge them based upon their religion.            Another group of people that came around the same time for the same reason were the Chinese people. When they heard about the gold rush, they believed that California was a place where they could get rich and get a lot of money.  Each year, they each gained more and more in number for they strongly believed that riches awaited them.            Most other groups of people came mainly because their was not enough food or money to support their family. The countries that these people came from are: Denmark, Poland, Russia, Holland, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and a few more European Countries.

Many had no choice but to leave their homeland where as some immigrated for the new experiences. But with plenty to do in America, life was always busy.                 There were few with no choice but to leave the land that they knew most. The reasons for their immigration vary, but some were very serious. The reasons they may have had was harsh environments, wars and other conflicts, poverty, or starvation running through out the country. One example of starvation is Ireland who had one-fourth of their population move to America because the Irish were desperate for food. And because of the food shortage, that made them more desperate to survive. So, they were forced to drag themselves over to America.                 However, there were some that came for new experiences. Some experiences include jobs, perceived freedoms, opportunities, access to resources, and wealth. One example of wealth is when the Chinese came to America to find gold and get rich during the period of the gold rush. This made the drive for gold harder as everyone continued to look for it and as time went by, it began to run out.                 In conclusion, the people who immigrated in the 1800's to the 1900's to America came for many reasons. Whether the reason occurred in Ireland or China, they all had a reason to come.

Or maybe they didn't like that job but they couldn't find anymore so they came to America to search for a job.

People that left their home must've been hard because they had to move away from their friends and family.But they had to leave either because they needed a job, to eat , or just to get away from their home they didn't like.                                                                                                           Europeans came to America to work and avoid hunger. The Irish were desperate to come because the crops in Ireland failed and more than one million people died because of hunger. Holland and Jews came for religious freedom because they were mistreated for their belifs.In China they had to go to America for the gold they found and there was 63,000 chinese there. Sourthen Italians suffered from high birth  rates and farming due to lower prices.                                                                                                    On their way to America, instead of going on ships they went on trains because it was faster. Industy grew and many immigrants arrived in America. Since they had trains now the ships wouldnt be full. A trip on the ship would take month but on train it was faster. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possable to print newspaper and books so they could spred the word of going on the train then taking you to an advanced boat that is faster.                                                                                                          The people that went to America from diffrent contries had to leave everything behind, some people might come back like the chinese, but the others like the Irish, Jews, and Europeans will not come back because they need a new home and job better than the one they had at their contrey. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles,Portuguese, and Armenians also moved to America. The population of America was growing year by year. For example in 1860 there was 31,513,000 immigrants, then on 1910 there was 92,407,000 immigrants. Most of the new comers knew a little about America but they went there for freedaom and a chance to work.

In the following paragraphs I'm going to discuss with you why they moved for the following reasons are; good farmland, freedom, and the Gold Rush.              First, I'm going to explain to you why they migrated to the US is  because of good farmland. The people that live in Ireland were desperate because all the crops being grown had failed especially the potato crops. There was a food storage.More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland due to the crops not growing. Many people migrated to the United States not only the Irish also the European.  They went to the United States to find work and avoid hunger.              Now, I'm going to tell you about people migrating to the United States for freedom. Many people migrated to obtain religious freedom this included people from Holland, and Jews. ThnHollan and the Jews came from Germany, Poland, and Russia,the Jews were mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Other people migrated to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over 50 years ago. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was known Sas the land of freedom. That's they wanted freedom and a chance to work.            Finally, many people migrated from Chinese to America because of the Gold Rush. Gold was discovered in 1848along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John SuStereo. More than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California in 1849,  among all these people 325 were men from China. The Chinese were hoping for fortune waiting for them in the California Hills.thebexciting news about the Gold Mountain spread the roughy China, and many people wanted to join the Gold Rush.            In conclusion, these are the three important reasons why the immigrants moved to America for the following reasons good farmland, freedom, and the Gold Rush.

And it so happened to be found on the property of a man named John Sutter. Instead of telling the whole world, what did he decide to do with his discovery? He decided to keep it a secret. Despite his attempts to do so, word of the find soon reached San Francisco. Hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. They werent the only ones who were interested though. The news had spread throughout the rest of the country and to the rest of the world. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. The gold rush had just begun.         Now a days most children and even most adults seem to believe that the only reason that people scurried to the American river was simply for what the name of the activity implies. To get gold-and get rich. But thats not all true.         Millions of immigrants had begun to head out for the American River in the 1800's. Saying immigrants, I dont mean just people from the same country, I mean people who had traveled acrossed the world just to get to America. But like I said earlier, these immigrants haddent come simply for gold, they had come for a better life. This is because most immigrants had once lived in an environment that they could not withstand, so that they were pushed to coming to America hoping that there was a better future for themselves and their families lying ahead fro them.

Some of the reasons were because they were forced out of their homes. Some chose to leave for fortune. This article will review these various reasons for immigration.          Some people left for work in America. People who could build, farm, or invent came to America. They were just in time, too. There was lots of technology in the 1800s, so there was plenty of things to do. People worked in factories, farmed, built on land, and invented things. Germans immigrated the most to America. The Irish were next in line, with almost 1/4 of Ireland immigrating to America. This all before the Civil War! Even when the war started, they kept coming in search for good areas for farming. In Ireland, crops were failing. other countries immigrated to America, too. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary were just some of the countries. Some of these people showed up for religious reasons. Jewish people were common here, because the countries they came from mistreated Jews for their beliefs.

In the 1800's many people from around the world traveled to AAmerica in search of food, freedom, a job, and just a good place to live. Germans were the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's.The  Next biggest band of immigrants were the Irish! The Irish came to America because in Ireland there crops were failing, especially thew potato crops everybody in Ireland was starving and about 1 million people died in Ireland so the Irish came to AAmerica. When the Irish arrived there were 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. But they all didn't come at once. in the late 1800's people from other European countries started to make there journey to America! In a 50 year period of time about 26 million immigrants arrived i the U.S.!!!                 Some people left there home countries to seek a better life, abetter job, and escape poverty! Others left for religious freedom like the Jews from Germany. Most people left home because of war and starvation... People came from around the globe to see and live in America because we had invented the railroad and that was the fastest way to get from place to place! People also came because the news spread fast with the invention of the telephone and the telegraph, people got the news quickly! Steam powered  boats were also invented making it nnot such a long ride to the U.S.! Also the redesign of the printing press made newspapers a lot more popular.                GOLD RUSH!!!! That was one of the main reason people were coming to the U.S.! Because of all the gold in california. Soon the Chinese heard about it and they went all out on California! 77% of China's previous population was in California!! People from around the world came to get a share of gold for themselves. By 1870 63,000 chinese were in California... And Thats how and why immigrants came to th United States of America!!

We should all be happy that we did not live during the 1800s while immigration to America was happening.             The millions of people who lived in other countries such as China, there is all kinds of things going on at this time in this countries. In China there was poverty and conflict going on between China and Britain. A war was getting ready to break out.          Many people tried to flee to Europe. These countries were Russia, Poland. Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Hungary. There was not enough room in Europe to hold all of these people. So they had to go some where but they could not stay in Europe. Between the years 1750 and 1850 Europe's population increased so much in 100 years that it was not even funny.            In the entire world there is about 1.1 billion people on Earth! Imagine 26 million of those people coming to the United States.  1.7 million people were Irish men, women and children.  There was two types of immigration they were known as 'pushes and pulls'. A push is known as something that causes people to leave their home because of a war, harsh environment and poverty. A pull is known as something that drove someone away from their home because of attraction.             Thousands of people were drove away from their home because of pushes or something that made them leave their home such as poverty. Thousand of people maybe even millions were driven from their homes because of a pull or an attraction An attraction that occurred in the 1800s was known as the California Gold Rush. Many people traveled all the way from China to California to mine gold. These people were hopping that they would get rich off of all of this 'gold' that they would be finding most people never found any gold.               During the late 1800s the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. With the invention of the telephone news would spread more quickly than word of mouth and it would definitely spread more quickly than a newspaper article.               Between the two years 1860 and 1910 the population of America increased so much. This the number of people who lived in cities in 1860 was 6,216,518 people and in 1910 there was 41,998,932 people living and working in cities.             Over the course of 50 years (1860-1910) the United States increased its population by a couple of thousand people. Imagine how much the United States has increased its population over the course of 200 years. This is the number of people in 1860 who were born outside of the United States 4,096,753 people and in 1910 there was 13,344,545 people who were born outside of the United States.

Europeans came to America to Find Jobs and Avoid hunger. People need homes and places to live.                    The Americas hit Gold and wanted to be in the gold rush in 1848. People wanted to move to California. Other people wanted to move to start new lives with there families. People hoped to find fortune in California.

During the 1800s, there were a lot of big advances which drove the immigrants to America. For example the advances in technology, the building of the railroad, and the wars of other countries which lured the immigrants to come to America.             When you have just made an accomplishment in technology, then you would obviously want to show the world about it to gain fame and fortune right? Well, that is exactly what our country did! When they invented the telegraph, and the telephone, the news spread everywhere especially the poor families longing for a job while they were in America. The invention of the telephone gave hope to those jobless citizens to ge up and ask for jobs. When the people got jobs, more and more people came to get money for their families, and to not just sit at home like a couch potatoe.           Ahh, the railroad. Without this spectacular device, we would not be able to got to long distance places on land without running out of gas. In the 1800s, this inovation encouraged immigrants in countries who had war to escape as a refugee to come to America. At this time, many new things were happening, and the railroad was one of the biggest things. However, there was something that the inventors needed to make their railroad come true. What was it you may ask? Well, it was the people! The nifty people were needed to help construct the railroad. When this news spread, the immigrants at Russia, and other places that had war in their country came rushing to come and apply for the job of building the railroad. The railroad was not the only thing that urged people to come to America, because there was one thing that was far more encouraging.           The thing that was far more encouraging, was the wonderful gold! When James Marshall discovered gold, and somehow the word spread that their was this wonderful thing, many immigrants especially the Chinese, rushed in to get rich quick. Many immigrants however were very smart to not mine for gold, but to sell the equipment. This made them much richer than the gold miners.         Overall, the people who came to America accomplished their goal of escaping from their country, coming to America, and getting a job.

Over the 3 years this went on every year more people from Cina came to find gold just like eveybody else. it was so big that over 60 ships and thousands on overland travlers came to california and this is when the gold rush began.

Working people who could build, inventors, and farmer came to America in ship after ship. Just in time too! With all the new technology, there was plenty for them to do in the 1800's. The imiegrants where needed to work in factories, to farm, build on land, and invent things, and they did just that.       To begin, the immigrants came from all over the place. The Germans made up the largest group of imigrants back in the 1800's. Next to the Germans, the Irish where the largest immigrant group. In the later 1800's, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included the people from Russia, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled, between the 1750's and the 1850's. All those extra people needed food, homes, jobs...and there just didnt seem to be enough of them in Europe. So, they came here to find work and to avoid hunger. Others came for religios reasons, includin the people from Holland, the Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and from Russia. The Jews, by the way, where often mistreated for their beliefs in their home country. Others, came to America to escape from the wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total, some 26 million immigrants came to the United States of America over a fifty year time period. That's 26 MILLION! Crazy, huh?! America was a land of freedom, and thats what the immigrants wanted, freedom and a chance to work.       Then came changes in America. There were pushes and pulls for the immigrants. In the second half of the 1800's, it was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many more immigrants arrived on the American shores. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869.

Some for freedom, others because the things that were waiting for them back at home were unbearable.  Even some came for the mere reason that there might be gold and riches at the end of their journey.  Everyone had a different story, everyone had a different reason, but they all came came together in the end in America.         There were many different people, and many different reasons people immigrate.  One reason people would immigrate is the fact that they wanted religious freedom.  For example, people from Holland and Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia all came because there at home lives were unbearable.  Another reason people might immigrate to America is because they have to.  For example, in Ireland, the irish were desperate.  There crop had failed, and there was a extreme shortage of food.  More than one million people died of starvation.  So for the Irish, all they wanted was a place where they could eat.         Usually, there was two kinds of immigration.  They were called the push and pull factors.  A push factor is a factor that forces you to leave your home land. One example of a push factor is a lack of resources they have at there home land.  For example, in Ireland, there crop failed and everyone was starving for food.  This is an example of a push factor.  The other kind of immigration, a pull factor, is a little bit different.  A pull factor is when a person sees something appealing in another place and decides to immigrate because of it.  An example of pull factor is gold, a job, of freedom.  For example, the Jews wanted freedom, and they knew America had it.  That is why they immigrated.     Everyone has there own choices and beliefs.  That is why immigration if different for everyone.           One very big pull factor in history was the California Gold Rush.  This is when John Sutter in 1848 found gold on his property in California.  Word got around about the discovery, and people got excited.  Thousands of immigrants moved to California in search of finding some of this highly coveted gold.  Many Chinese arrived also.  The taxes were going up where they lived, and they were hoping to find some money.  There dream was to find a ton of gold, and come home with a pile load of riches.  Also, another reason the Chinese arrived was because the people in China did not have enough rice to feed its people, especially when the floods destroyed the crops.           As you can see, every person has a different reason for immigrating.  Some for freedom, others for money, and some just to escape the hardships of everyday life.  Some didn't even have a choice.  This is what makes immigration so unique.  Not two people are the same.  Between push and pull factors, and larger reasons to immigrate, like the California Gold Rush, between 1860 and 1910,  it went from 31,513,000 people living in the United States to 92,407,000 people.  Also, in 1860 4,096,753 people were born out of state and in 1910, 13,344,545 people were born out of state.  This was all because the immigration of our people.

Several different reasons were the reason for this sudden movment to America, which, as you'll soon find out, included jobs, poverty, and Communist country refugees. I think it was, and still is, a great idea to still go to America, because it is the land of the free. If you can't make it in your own country, come try it in America!            Over the years, many people have been coming to America. During rough econimical times, such as Europe (in 1750-1850), several people moved to America in search of jobs. Europe, however, was not the only country part of the 'Move to America' boat, afterall. These countries whom joined Europe included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.            Then, years later, people came to America in order to gain independence, and escape their communist countries strong grip on their people. These refugees included those from Europe, and areas around them, during the late 1930-40's. This was a time of War, pain, and sufferage in Europe. This was the time of World War II. Concentration camps, and large genocides occurred to Jewish (and several others) people at this period of time. Several lucky (mostly Jewish) Europeans were quick enough to escape to America, the land of the free. In fact, so many people did this, that the America had to prevent Jewish Europeans to enter America anymore.           Another large group of people whom set their ways off to America were the Irish (during the 1800's). Crop faliure and overall poverty left the people extremely poor, hungry, and desperate. Potato crops were the biggest faliure, and source of this jolt of poverty. The Irish were so desperate, they still to America before, during, and after the Civil War. This just shows you how large America is of a safe-haven to the needy, and desperate people of the world.          The point driven here is quite clear, and respectable. America, over the years, has become a place, and symbol, of honor, pride, and freedom. People whom need the 'safety blanket' of America can very well do so (besides North Korea), and they do. The driven attitude of the American 'way'  drives people to come here for freedom, and independance, possibly unlike their own country. If I wanted freedom, and were living in a different country, I'd move to America.

Some books are about when the indians first lived there and created their own small territory. But a few years passed and other enimies conqured them. A few resources talk about the 1800s when America satrted developing new technology like phones or railroads. Many book s tell about why people wanted to come to america for a reason like to trade or            When America became popular it was when the gold Rush in 1849 happened. Many people from all over the world came to the gold rush just to get gold. Some decided they dont want to go back to their homeland and decided to make their settlement in America. News about the gold rush was being spread all over the place. Over a million people came to travel to America for a specific reason.

They went through a lot.Like these struggles.           First it was almost everyone leaving their home.They had to leave home because of all the wars. Take a look at the Jews they got mistreated for their beliefs. The same with Holland i mean that's not fair.Some other people just left to escape wars.That's scary having to escape. You might not even escape with your life.           Some of them had 'push and pulls'.A pull is when people come when they are attracted to something. Like people may go to Disney land for the amazing rides. A push is a feature in life that drives you away from home.Like if your home gets destroyed by an earthquake.You would have to leave home. In these cases it would be because  of war or other conflicts.           Some people were leaving home  because of war.All the Jews and  Irish were heading to Europe.Some of the others were leaving because they had no freedom or rights. In their home town or state.some were looking for jobs and homes. while others were looking for  safety.           This is one of the victory but it is combined with a loss.The loss is that Chinese government raised taxes. So,farmers that couldn't pay the taxes  had to sell their land.So instead of suffering they listened to tales of gold past the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese wanted to go there and collect so much wealth and  make fortunes so they could  return to china proudly. This is where the victory comes in. At the beginning not a lot of Chinese joined the gold rush in California,( at first). But then it grew and grew until 77% of Chinese was California. That would be so cool to leave all of your misery behind and get rich. I would do that an go back to china and say ha we don't have to pay taxes for you any more:)           In conclusion i say that even though the transition had its ups and downs.I think that it had more ups than downs.They had there victory at most points.Like when the Jews were mistreated but they still came out on top because they moved to Europe.

But, not all the immigrants came to America because of war. Others came to find gold! Like the Chinese did. Some even came for a new life, to start over or look for a job.        Immigrants came from all around the world. Looking for jobs, food, and homes. This is why we have so many different cultures in our country, and if we didn't have the different cultures. The U.S wouldn't be like it is now.

As I did more research i found many reasons why people moved to America.              As i was starting, the first thing I saw was new technology was being made, there was plenty of new jobs, there were empty spots in factories, they needed farmers,and they needed new inventions. Germans were a big part of the immigration 'group', next to the Germans, the Irish was one of the largest groups. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America! That's 1.7 million men, women, and children! But guess what, they kept coming, during and after the war! The Irish were desperate for a new place to live things in Ireland weren't as good as you would think. For Ireland more than 1 million people died from starvation.       In the later 1800s, people started coming from all over the European countries. They had not sent many people to America before.For example Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All of those extra people needed homes,food, and jobs. There just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger. In total there was 26 million immigrants that arrived in the U.S.A. over a 50 year period!       The second half of the 1800s, was a great time of change. The transportation improved, the first railroad had been put up, industry grew, and many immigrants arrived. As the transportation improved that meant easier ways to cross over to America. In the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. Steam power and redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. This made news and ideas available to people all over! In 1844 the invention of the telegraph and telephone in 1860 made it even easier for news to travel.       In 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter came a new wave of people. John tried to keep it a secret but it didn't last long. That was the start of the Gold Rush. By January 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. It had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California. Among these 'Forty-Niners were 325 men from China. Most of the first wave was Chinese men coming from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast. They were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.       The American population and Industrial growth from 1860-1910 was booming! The number of people in 1860 was almost 32 million! You wouldn't believe it but in 1910 it was past 90 million! Everything had grown, people in cities, people born outside of the U.S., coal production, railroad tracks, and the number of newspapers! That is the history of the United States.

Well the answer is that through out the 1800s to the 1910s people around the world started to have, well problems.         It first started, when the Irish were running low on food supplies and didn't have nowhere to go, but that's when one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America( Is about 1.7 million men, women and children.).The food that Irish were running low was potato crop.Not only that,but Europeans in the later 1800s came to America because they needed food, jobs and homes. And it seemed that there wouldn't enough at Europe.So they came to America.            Hold on to your horses, because I am just at the beginning, there a whole lot more of people about to came to America because through out the 1750 to 1850, people came from Holland, others from Germany who were Jews  as well as in Poland and Russia.    Jews came to America because they were mistreated for there beliefs in there home countries.Others came to America to escape wars and the unstable, unpredictable life.But that isn't the only reason why so many people came, some wanted freedom and a job.So in total about 26 million immigrates arrived in the United States in the past 50 year period.            Okay, let's move forward to the second half of the 1800s.Now in this year transportation was made faster as well as the printing press was made. So with the transportation improved many people came to America. As for the printing press, it made ideas spread faster. In 1844-1876  the telegraph and telephone  were invented and only made the news travel faster.            The final pull was the California gold rush, more than 70,000 adventurers came to America in the 1849, to get the gold. Now here is how most Chinese came, in there home country the taxes were raising and many people were saling there homes.Chinese were also running low on rice which was there main food supplies.Guess how many Chinese's came to California they heard about the gold? Let's see about 86,487 Chinese came though out 1849 to 1870. Chinese found hope in California and went there to look for jobs and of course gold. Today there are 77% of them in California.               To sum it all up, most people around the world came to America for millions of reasons not just one but many, but the point is that over half of  people that came to America was because they needed help and America give it to them.So be grateful that you live in a wonderful life in,United States of America.

Many came for reasons and many left there home countries for many reasons. The biggest group of immagrants in America are from Germany. Next to the Germans are the Irish. 1/4 of the entire population of Ireland came to America. They kept on coming, even during the world war. One of the main reasons of people leaving Ireland is because of the crops failing. Many other countries came to America such as Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.                    Another reason for people coming is that the industry was growing in America. Another reason is because people wanted to escape the harsh conditions in Europe. Many jews wanted to escape from being persecuted. They also came to get jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.                   Another reason for people coming to america is the gold.  Lots of gold miners came from all over the world, but mostly from China. Most of the chinese came from Guandong. They were fleeting from conflict and poverty. There was also alot of rebellions against the government.                   The population almost tripled over 50 years. The number of people in cities grew tremendously. The number of people born outside of the united states tripled. An enormous amount of coal was produced.

I am going to discuss the reasons why people immigrated to the U.S.        The reasons why immigrants came are called pushes and pulls. Some pulls are that became much faster and easier. They could catch a train that would take them to a boat. Older ships would have taken a while but new steamships are much faster. More pulls are jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom. A main push factor was harsh conditions and conflict. Jews left to avoid persecution Italians left due to farming to farming loss. All if them were trying to find a better life in America.         A lot of people came to the U.S. for the gold rush. More and more people came to California every day. They were all hoping to find a fortune waiting for them. Many Chinese people were trying to get away from the country because of war and poverty. It was also a good time to leave because they might find a fortune in America. many Chinese people helped build the transcontinental railroad because they couldn't find any gold. many Chinese immigrated to try to find wonderful riches.        As you can see immigrating wasn't easy for most people. Immigrants immigrated because of a push or a pull. the California gold rush was a big factor on Chinese immigration. I think immigration is a good thing because it has given our country many different cultures.

By Paul Gerald                          Why would some Irish or German person from the 1800s want to come to America? At first mostly Germans where the immigrants. Then the Irish were next in the first source it states that there were 1.7 million Irish in America!Most of the Irish came over because the potato plants were failing so the farmers could not supply enough food for the people.Later people started to come from Europe mostly for religious freedom.                   Immigrants had  'push's' and 'pulls' to come to America. People in China came over to get out of the war and rebellions to the  government. Irish for hardship over crop failure.But there were 'pulls' to America to.Some came over for freedom, gold, fortune, and jobs. The gold rush of 1849 made lots of chines come over, religious freedom made the Europeans come over,the Irish just came over to escape hunger.

Well, immigration was important back then and they came for particular reasons. Some were forcing them to leave while others attracted them to the free country.        First, things pushed people from their home country. Wars were going on and there was not enough food for the growing population. Also, jobs were scarce in Europe so people couldn't pay for their house or food.        Second, America attracted many people. We found gold in California, so many Chinese immigrants immigrated here to find great fortune. There were new advances in technology, such as steam engines. Trains provides cargo transportation and could hold many people, too.        To conclude, America was home of many immigrants during that time. They were either attracted to this country or forced out of theirs. Bye.

First, over 26 million people came to America over a 50 year period! So many types for ethnicity groups came from places like Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Russia, Denmark, Sweaden, and Hungary. Alot of Jewish people came to get away from the Nazis, they where forced out of their homelands for Russia,Germany,and Holland. Many people came for getting jobs in the new factories and to get away from starvation. They also came to get way from the wars that where happening in the 1800's. Alot of people who could invent,farm, and build came to America. One fourth of Ireland had come to America 1.7 million Irish people!                        Next, the industries had grown and the first railroad that spread across the whole U.S. had been built. The railroad made trips and moving alot easier.  The telophone had mad it so much easier to communicate with eachother. More immigrants where comming. Everyone started to be updated on what was going on in the world. Southern Italians had to leave because of high birth rates and older siblings got the land and left the younger ones with nothing, they had to find something to do. Europe was having major hardships and Russian Jews had to leave Russia.                                    Thrid, many Chinese people came for the news of the Gold Rush in Califronia. News spread everywhere. By January 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travelers came to California. More than 70,000 explores came to CA. About 325 Chinese men worked with the forty-niners.Some Chinese men had to come because of rebellions,poverty, disagrements. Guangdog population was growing and they did not have enough rice to feed the entire population. Taxes where raised and farmers had to sell land. So many people had come to see the great gold rush.

People immigrated from all over the world to come to the US. They didn't just come for the goods though, they came because they were pushed out of their countries by bad people or unfair rules.         In the article moving to America it talks about how people came because they were inventors or farmers and they weren't thriving in Europe. When the immigrants came the Germans and the Irish were the biggest population of European immigrants in the US and they came because of failed crops. Other European immigrants came because they needed to find work and needed to support their families. Even though many people came for work or for food, one big reason why Europeans came was for religious freedom. Many Jews came because they were treated unfairly and in America it was the opposite.        Another article talks about how many immigrants came because they were pulled in by all the goods in America or because they were pushed away by the bad of their Country. One pull for people that made them come to America was the transportation. Immigrants could travel by train to get to America which was a faster and easier way to get to America. However there were many things that pushed people away from the places that they lived in. One big push was farming losses due to lower prices and people left with no land to farm on.        Finally one big part of immigrant history was the gold rush. The Gold Rush was when a person found gold in the river by his property. John Sutter was the man to first discover this gold and as much as he tried to keep it a secret it got out. When the news spread of gold in America people fled their homes and came to America in search of gold. Millions of people came to America but only a third of the people that were lucky enough to find gold. Many of the immigrants who came during the gold rush weren't just European they were also Chinese. Some of the Chinese didn't come for the gold they came to get away from poverty in their country.   Immigrants came to America for many reasons, some in search of fortune,other wanting freedom, and some just for the benefits. America was flourishing with people in the time of the Gold Rush and when people came just as a way for freedom. The immigrants that came to America made it what it is today.

As each person migrated, Americas population would increase, and the country where that person was coming from would decrease. Although this isn't a bad thing, because some people came for a good reason, or a bad reason. So, let me tell you all about a couple of people that migrated from one country to another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  During the 1860s, some people from Ireland, and German people started coming to America, because of the Civil War. So one-fourth(1.7 million) of sweet old Ireland, and Germany people came over here to America.Since the Civil War happened, food, or crops that the Ireland people made were ruined, so one million people died of starvation.  Well anyways even some Jews came for religious freedom. Over 26 million people came here over a 50 year period.Thats sort of amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Changes, also Pushes, and Pulls                                                                                                On the 1800 days, many American people helped make a change of transportation. Now many of us can travel by: train, ships, and many others. Since they have made these transportation ways, many people that don't live here in America actually can have a chance o come here. Well those were some changes that happened, so now let me tell you about pushes, and pulls. Pushes are when you can drive away people, and Pulls are people that attract you t words them. For example, Russian Jews were trying to escape their country, because some people are being prejudice. So those were pulls and pushes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Gold Rush                                                                                                                                        One day, during the 1848ths, a man went down by a river and he ended up finding lots of gold. So on that day, he decided not to tell anyone that he found gold. Then soon enough people found out that there was a gold rush, so to get to the point, 325 chinese people migrated  to America to look for the gold. The other reason why they came here was, because the chinese government raised taxes, so that was mostly why they came to America.

In this explanatory article you will learn the reasons why most people from other countries including China,Germany, Ireland and etc came to America.                        A big reason that it occured to migrate in the year 1848 was because of the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush first started when it was uncovered along the American River in California. It was located on the property of a man named John Shutter who at once was trying to keep the unmarkable find a secret. But unfortunetly word spread to first at San Francisco, the capital of California, then to the entire country of the United States. But it didn't stop there next it arrived  at the entire world. When people finaly believed that there was actually gold, in 1849 there was 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers who came to claim their gold.                           Also a reason for all this imigrating was the introducing of improved transportation. It was the first way to travel faster and easier than by going by foot, on an animal, or with any type of carriage, welcome railroads. This creation was first put into action in the year 1869. Having the ability to move resources like silver and lumber from the East and West it could work just the same as with people. Now if anyone or family had been longing to explore the world around themselves that would normally take months, it seemed just like a waste of time but with the railroads you deduce that amount of time. Also a reason was that nearly everyone wanted to try out the railroads to see how they worked or even if they did.                       Another great reason for migrating was any oppertunites a human could get. Such as jobs or land, but it could have also been  an unfortunate goverment change. During the 1800's working people who could build, farm, or invent were welcomed to America with job oppertunites avalible. Many Europeans left to get jobs because of all the extra imigrants arriving in Europe there just wasn't enough to go around. The other two were land and goverment changes . Imigrants came because land from where they traveled from wasn't good or was not able to grow the crops nessecery to keep from starvation. Ireland was one of the these victims and in China the people had to start selling land because the chinese goverment was raising taxes. If the other chinese could not afford they had to sacrifice the land.

They would come to get jobs, start a new life, or just to get a better home. Immigrants came before, during, and after the wars because that's were they thought they were going to be safe and away from danger.       Ship after ship people that could build, farm, or invent came to America. They were sent to work in new factories, to farm, to build on the land, and to invent things. They had come at just the right time considering that's when all the technology came out. Germans were most of the immigrants but close behind was Ireland with 1.7 Irish men, women, and children. Even though there was a war going on the Irish and German still found their way to America. The Irish were desperate to come to America because all of their crops had died, especially the potato crop. There was a food storage yet more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Later, there were immigrants coming from places like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary which caused Europe's population to double between 1750 and 1850. All those people needed food, homes, and jobs to avoid death. Others had come for religious freedom.        In the second half of the 1800s (50 years) there had been 26 million immigrants that arrived in the United States. There was a big change in America because industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's surface. Transportation had improved over the years. Before the immigrants walked to get to America but there was a railroad and it first crossed the United States and was completed in 1869. That means it got easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. The good part was that not was it only able to take items around but it could take people places too. A trip was easier and shorter to take a trip anywhere. There was also a fast and important way of how information travels. Somethings that made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers was steam power and the redesign of the printing press. Many European immigrants wanted to escape the harshness in Europe. The Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution.       Along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter, gold was discovered in 1848. Even though he tried to keep the gold a secret, word got out and into San Fransisco so many people from San Fransisco ended up at America River. Then news ended up spreading out to the whole world. 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California in January of 1849. That's when the California gold rush had finally begun. In 1849, more than 70,000 gold diggers arrived in California. Of those there were 325 men from China in these 'Forty-Niners'. More Chinese came year after year hoping to find fortune in the California fields. The Chinese moved here because they needed the money. The exciting news about Gold Mountain had spread around China so many people had wanted to join the gold rush but couldn't because there wasn't enough space. People in the gold rush felt hopeless because they weren't finding anything fast, but soon they did. They called California Gam Saan or 'Gold Mountain'. To them it seemed like a land of unbelievable richness but to us its a home. They longed to go there, make their fortunes, and finally return home, proudly to China.       Well now we both know more about the gold rush, how immigration started, and why the U.S has so many people here. The gold rush is part of the reason why so many Chinese are here and the immigration is why there are people of different raise here in America.

People from all over the world came to California to get their hands on some gold. This was when a lot of people started to come to America because they discovered that there was gold here. People looked in Nevada also since it is so close to California.               It was a risky move to come to America because the journey long. It got a lot of people sick. Some people didn't make it to America because they died on their way here.               That was why people decided to come to America.There was gold, there was freedom, there was better jobs.

The Irish people started to move because the food Sources were going down quickly. Most of the crops had stopped growing which meant they would starve. The crop that was growing the most amount was the potato crop. The top reason they moved was because the food was decreasing, and that meant no food or plant sources.

For example when I was in 1st grade I moved from L. A. to porterville and It was not easy with all the snow on the mouantains. My second reason  I think is most inportant thing is when I went to school I didn't have any friends until I meet my classroom. The thing I loved about the school, Burton elemantary was the play ground equipment it was fun. But the best thing I liked about that school was my teacher she was always nice she gave me candy ever day.       I know that going to new schools can be hard but I really had a good time there. But when I went home from school I used to go home and hug my parents and tell them all the things I did today. But im  still a little sad about leaving my old school lomita magnet that school was really fun they had computer for everyone there own computer. sometimes I wish I were back at the school cause my teacher Mr. smith would always have treasure hunts baking i remember we toasted bread and put stick prestelz in it so it looked like a porcupine that is edable. But my favriote was when we made hot dogs look like octopuses they tasted like  hot dog but we made the eyes and mouth with ketchup and musard.       Some of my favriote things about being here in porterville is a got a funny teacher lots of friends that I play football with and sometimes we play other fun things to. Here I got a teacher who likes the 49ers and the giants I like the giants but I also like the Raiders. I like this school JMA cause they have a good libary equipment to go and play outside and they have teachers outside that take care of you if you get hurt. My favriote thing about being at this school is patriot day were everone goes outside to play some people watch movies do chess color all types of things to do. But I still do miss my cousins friends and schools from over there.       The most inportant things I miss about L.A. is all the carnival and all the fun fairs that you can do to be entertained. But the most thing that I miss is my cosins we always play tag or ride on our bike which is fun to play. I also miss my best friend that lived across from me his name was Jake we always used to play with water ballons or a football. I remember I had to leave alot of inportant things behin as well cause we didn't have enough room to in the uhaul to take it so I had to leave my bike that I always used with my cousins behind, but about a 2 months later I got a new one it was really shiny and every one liked it even my dogs. I really didn't belive my dog liked it I thought she and he where just happy to see me back from a long trip from here to L.A. I was also glad to be home I gave both of them an extra long belly rup they loved it and I was glad to be home.       But now I'm really happy to be here even though I still miss L.A. and hope to visit soon. The thing that I like about Porterville is that it is a little peaceful town with almost anything happening expect like a few months ago a robber was caught the police returned all the items and Jewlery back to the owners and the robber is still in jail until today. I would really like it if all of my cousins came over to visit and have a party. I reall do wish I was back in L.A. with my old friends.

Germans created the largest singled group of  Immigrants in the 1800s. The Irish were the largest Immigrant group. Before Americas civil war in 1860, one-fourth of the whole population, Ireland came to America. they had to keep coming for during and after the war. Some people moved there to avoid hunger and to work.                                                                                                                                                                             Others had come for freedom and this only included people from Holland, &amp; Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. the Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. some came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. that's why most of the people from all around the world came to America. can u believe being in that kind of world?

And that's why people migrated.

When the immigrants came to America there was new technology in the 1800s so there was plenty of things the immigrants could do.But before the civil war in 1860 almost one-fourth of the whole population from Ireland came to America.That was 1.7 million Irish people!More and more were coming before and after the civil war because the Irish were desperate because the crop in Ireland failed to grow.Also there was a food shortage so more than 1 million people died of starvation and they had no choice but to move over here in America.          In the second part of the 1800s was a time of a new start  in America.

Such as the Europeans. The europeans doubled in population between 1750-1850 in their country, so they didnt have enough food to provide for everyone. That being said, many of them embarked on the long journey to America. Here in America we had more than enough food at that time and plenty of jobs. So, they came here and settled.             Another reason why thousands of peoplefrom many different countries immigrated to America was because of the harsh times with war, poverty, and food shortages. Some of those countries were:Germany, Ireland, and Holland. They were suffering from over populations, not enough crops for their amount of people, and wars that were unpredictable.             The last reason is that thousands upon thousands of Chinese imigrated to Califorina in 1848 because the Gold Rush began. Gold was discovered by John Sutter on the American River in California. Word spread to San Francisco and hundreds of people left the city on a quest for gold. Most of the first crowd of people who came were Chinese. They left from China to escape from conflicts and poverty. This gold changed everything for the Chinese, giving them money for food and crops.

He wanted it to be a seceret but once people heard about the gold and that they might become rich they started flocking to California.  They knew that not everyone that went there would find gold.  They also knew that there was a high possibility that themselves wouldn't find gold.  People looked and searched by Sutter's mill to find gold, but most people didnt.  They were very lucky if they would have found gold.  The people either found flakes of gold or nuggets.  Nuggets are a big pieces of gold that many people hoped to find.

Many immigrants came from other places that were much far away and they had to learn how to speak the new language and fit in.       The immigrants were also different from the people in America for example there many different cultures and traditions. And that is also a reason that they to America to worship or praise the god they believe in without being persecuted for it.

A lot of people believed in the California Gold Rush. Everyone kept on immigrating into the United States.       First, one of the reasons people were immigrating to the U.S. was because they were hoping to find homes to live in. If you immigrated from another country, would you move there for the homes that they have? I know I would. That is exactly one of the reasons immigrants move to the U.S. or move to any other country.       Secondly, another reason they moved to America is to find better jobs. They might not have the same jobs in another country. Maybe that is why our population keeps growing, and growing. People move here for the better. They know whether or not to move somewhere else facing the biggest difficulties in a moving life.       Lastly, they moved here for freedom. Why? Well, if you lived in another country and you saw how much freedom the U.S. has, wouldn't you like to move here, become a citizen, and finally accomplish your dreams? I would!

This made people more aware of the world around them and the ability to move long distances people could come more easily.  That's the reason they moved because of the push and pulls.  The push was the feature that push the immigrants from there homeland. These included harsh environment and wars.  The pulls are what made them want to move to America. These included wealth opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.  They all wanted to come to America.               Gold was another reason people came.  It was discovered in 1848 in California.  A man by the name of John Stutter found gold but wanted to keep it a secret.  The secret spread fast and to many parts of the world. By 49 ships and ships full of hope full immigrants came to California looking   to become wealthy.  Most of the immigrants came from China fleeing from conflicts and poverty.  the Chinese government raised taxes and farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell there land.  At the same time, there population grew but they couldn't grow enough crops then people heard about  the gold rush and so they decided to migrate to America.  Theses are the many reason people migrated over to America.

There were other things that drove people away from their home and took them to ours. They are called Pushes and Pulls. Pushes drive people away, Pulls drive people in. Examples of Pushes would be the crops in other countries failing to grow causing starvation. And people running low on money and losing their home.   And Pulls would be that our country is the country of freedom and people want to be free. It caused people to come from many different countries.            Another reason would be the Gold rush in the 1800's caused many people to come from all sorts of countries to come to americain hopes of striking gold, and becoming rich. They all hoped to find a gold mine and keep it to them selves to get their old gold.

Chinese started coming year after year. They came to find gold and because the government of China raised the the taxes. Farmers who were unable to pay there taxes had to sell there land,so they left and came to America. The next year came and even more Chinese people came to America.

Immigrants didn't just come to America just to come, they came here from good and bad reasons. Not everybody came to get a job and live more freely. They came for opportunities.       People came to America to find work and avoid hunger. Other people came to have more religious freedom. Later over 50 years 26 million immigrants came to America. When people came to America they believed that they would have a happy life and not have any problems that they have experiences with their home countries.        It wasn't a hard decision to move to America because their country showed some pushes and America showed a lot of pulls. Their countries pushes may have included: political reasons, harsh environment, wars, and even poverty. In America the immigrants would have a chance to start a new life and instead of being poor they could become very wealthy and successful. Some of the pulls that America had included: jobs, wealth, opportunities, available to get resources, and freedom. Many Europeans left because they wanted to escape harsh conditions. Russian Jews wanted to escape prejudice and persecution.       In 1848, a man named John Sutter found a mine of gold. He tried keeping it a secret, but it soon reached all over the world. By 1849 many people came to California in search for gold. This became known as the California Gold Rush. People started coming into California and hoping to find gold and become rich. Most people that came at first were the Chinese. They were also escaping from poverty. During the war Guangdong's population grew and farmers could not provide enough rice for everyone. During the gold rush the Chinese played a critical role during the period of time. They built the first transcontinental railroad. By 1910 California's population rose up to 41,998,932 and 13,344,545 were immigrants.

America in the 1800s was one of the most immigrated to country in the world! During this time period about 26 million people came to America. However, almost all of them came for different reasons. With everyone coming there must of been something to do! Immigrants did almost everything during the 1800s. This time period is very important to our history and could be important to our future.                    In the 1800s, millions of people came to the U.S. Many people came from different country to run away from things or to come for a better life. The German people made up the biggest group of immigrants. Most Germans left to get away from the war in Europe and just to live easier. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the biggest group. Overall, 1/4 of all of Ireland's population left to come to America! That was 1.7 million people in just the 1800s! The Irish people were desperate to survive. Their potato crop had failed as well as most of their other food. Other people came to have religious freedom. A lot of Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came to escape the terrible treatment of their home countries. All these people came for a reason and needed a place to work and live, what did they do when they got there?                    In the 1800s, 26 million people came to work and live. What exactly did they do? Most of them didn't have an education, so they became the builders and farmers. But some of them did have an education, so they became the inventors, politicians, and teachers. Another group of workers became miners and went as fast as they could to the California Gold Rush. A lot of these miners came from China, especially Guangdong. A lot of the Chinese people came to avoid war and poverty. Guangdong was involved in 2 wars between China and Britain, as well as many rebellions against the government and endless debt and taxes.This exciting news about gold spread though China like wildfire in a dry prairie. By 1870, over 63,000 Chinese people were in the U.S. Even though they could be found through out the country 77% of them were found in California. 70,000 people came from all over the world to California to try to strike it rich.                 In conclusion, many, many, people immigrated to the United States. Some came for jobs, others for freedom, but they all came with the idea of having a better life, and think about it if they didn't come our past, present, and future would never be the same.

People came from Europe, China, Germany, and many more places across the world. The immigrants came looking for freedom, jobs, homes, and food. The immigrants came just in time for the jobs because with the advancement in technology there as plenty for them to do. Before the civil war in the 1860's more than one fourth of Ireland's population had came to America. The reason for all of the Irish coming to America was that there was a food shortage in Ireland, and more than 1 million people had died because of starvation. Later on in the 1800's people started coming from other European countries such as Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and also Hungary. The reason for this is because the population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850, and all those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs. Others came for America's religious freedom.In total more than 26 million immigrants had came to America in over 50 years.           In 1869 the first railroad that crossed the whole U.S. was completed, and this meant that it was easier for people to travel from the east to the west. This also meant that immigrants could catch a train to America and get here alot faster than before. In the 1800's people became more aware of the world around them and the ability to travel long distancs faster than ever before.           In 1849 gold was discovered along the American River in California , on the land of a man  name John Sutter, Sutter tryed to keep the discovery a secret, but the word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundreds of people set off to the American River.The news spread allover America and to other parts of the world quickly. By January of 1849, 60 ships were headed for California. More thn 70,000 immigrants arrived in California in 1849. Among these immigrants 325 of them were Chinese men. More and more people from China came every year.

At the time, people believed that the United States was a land of freedom and technology. There were many jobs that needed to be done, such as farming, claiming land, and working in factories. As a result, many ships sailed to America in hopes of starting a new life.          During the middle 1800s, there was a crop failure in Ireland. The citizens faced a period of hardship and starvation. More than one million people perished. The Irish became desperated for a new life, so one-fourth of the population immigrated to America. The Irish people became one of the largest immigrant groups in the United States.           In 1849, gold was found in California! It was the start of the Gold Rush. This was the chance for the Chinese people to start a new wealthier life in America. They were escaping poverty, wars, and taxes in China. Furthermore, floods often destroyed crops, and there were not enough rice to feed the citizens. The Chinese people migrated to California, and played an important part in constructing the transcontinental railroad.           In the late 1800s, people from Europe started to sail to the U.S. The population in Europe had doubled in the last hundred years, so more citizens needed to find work and food. Also, others immigrated for religious freedom. One group, known as the Jews, left to escape persecution and prejudice. In additon, the Italians had to leave their country because they could only leave land to the first-born son in the family. It caused many younger siblings to be homeless.

The people that arrived to America came just in time because there was plenty to do since there was all new technology. The Germans were the largest group to come to America in the 1800's the second largest group to come to America was the Irish.

Based on my research Germans made up the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s in the area that they invaded was full of inventors and farmers.Then the Germans and the Irish were the largest group of immigrants.Right before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one of the fourth of the whole population of Ireland cam to America. they kept coming, after and during the war between the two sides.The Irish were optical because in Ireland crops had died mostly potato crops, but still many of their crops had failed.There was a food storage and more than 1 million people died of starvation because of all the crops failing.             In the very late 1800s, people started to come from other European countries and states that had not sent many people to America before to invent or farm.This included Russia, Italy, Portland, Denmark, Sweden, and finally Hungary.The population of Europe has gone higher than ever between 1750 and 1850.All those left over people needed food, homes, and jobs.There just didn't seem to be enough of the immigrants in that part of Europe.Many Europeans came to America to find work,. to avoid hunger, and have a better place to stay and call home for the rest of their lives.             Others came for freedom in their culture and religion because in many countries they all are the same religion so others are not welcome.These included people from many other states and countries to for example people from Holland, and Jewish people came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.Jewish people were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.Still others came to escape wars that made life hard and unpredictable.             In conclusion, some about 26 million immigrants made it to the United States over 50 years ago. Think about that 26 million that is a very huge number of people.Most of the new people knew very little about American except that it was a land of freedom.That's what they wanted freedom, a home, and a chance to work.

Some people did this to leave bad situations in their home country. Others did this to experiences the wonder of America. In this paper you will learn more about these immigrants.             There were pushes to make people want to come to America. Pushes are things in life that drive you away from home. Pushes included, but are not limited to, harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. I think that these things would make me want to find freedom.             Pulls also caused people to want to come to America. Pulls were things like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom. The California Gold Rush is an example of a pull. People from other places that may have had okay lives just left the only place they knew to travel to an unknown world because they might hit the jackpot. I think this is kind of rediculous because they didn't know if they would find anything, and most of the time nobody did.             I think there were some good reasons and some bad reasons people immigrated. I think the good reasons were things like freedom and to escape a war. I think the most ridiculous thing that people moved here was becuase of the California Gold Rush.

The Immigrants had to do a lot of things to become an American citizen, like test, disease checks, and the bad thing about that is if you failed the disease check or other tests you will be sent back to wherever you came from.            When the Immigrants were settled in America, the last thing they needed to do was find a great place to live. This falls into the 'push' and the 'pull' because some countries, cities, or towns would try to 'pull' people to that location. The 'push' makes people not want to live there anymore, so it kind of pushes people out of that area. This is the struggles Immigrants had to go through coming to America.

One of the reasons the population increased is the California gold rush. The Chinese came to America for the California gold rush; drastically increasing the population of America over the next few years. Another reason immigrants came to America is the wars and other things happening in their homeland. Some people in Russia came to America because the population of Russia had doubled between 1750 and 1850, so they needed shelter, food, and jobs.        When immigrants came to America the resources and railroad tracks and stuff became significantly larger. take this 4 example: coal production in tons increased by over 300 million tons between 1860 and 1910. the miles of railroad tacks increased by over 210 thousand miles between those time periods when the immigrants started pouring into America.

They may have many reasons as to why they had moved or fled from their country. But sometimes, we might not know all of them.            If you didn't already know, Germans had made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. The Germans were the largest. But, the Irish were second in line. They had moved to America because of crop failure. They had had food shortage and their potato crop just didn't work because of the war. More than 1 million people died because of this shortage. Some people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Holland, and Germany, came to the United States. Many Europeans came to find work and avoid danger. Some of them came for religious freedom. Then , some moved because their life was just unstable and unpredictable. By the end, more than about 26 million people were immigrants in the U.S.             Many people were afraid of things. As to why they left their country for America. Most of them mainly Europeans. Some Europeans moved just to escape the harsh conditions. Others wanted no more of the prejudice and persecution. Or, people just moved to get away from high birth rates. Or, maybe their loss of farm land. Immigrants wanted to make a new life and start fresh with their families. So, they moved to the United States.              Lastly, some people may have just fled because of conflicts and poverty. That's what they call a 'push'. A 'push' is a feature in which a family or families are forced to move or leave because of a condition they cant solve or be around. Such as war, harsh environment, conflict, and poverty. Immigration has just gone so far that 77% of the Chinese moved to California. At first, it was only a few. About 325 in 1849. Then 450 more. As soon as you know it , in 1851 there were 2,716 of them gone. 20,026 in 1852. And by 1870, the 77% of them were now in America. That was 63,000 people right there. They all moved because of a gold rush. The Chinese got excited. They wanted all of that gold. So, they willingly moved from their country.             As you can see, many people leave or flee for many reasons. It can be either their choice, or, the government. Maybe, just maybe, they might find a way for immigrants to get back what they had lost or given up. Some of them just chose to leave like for the gold rush.That's what they call a 'pull'. leaving because you wanted that something in a different country. Or, they left because they had to. Like war. That's what they call a 'push'. You'll never know until you really truly know.

Many people didn't have homes or money. So they moved to the United States to see if they would get a better life and they did . Now they have a home and money to eat and buy things.        Third reason is the gold rush . Everyone one from different places was looking for gold . Back then the gold rush was very important to everyone .

First,the school wants us kids to stay hethly and active.The school could also  use another activity to.But when Mr .Campbell  said that 'there would be alot of the teenagers would  hang out around there.Even some kids wanting to play on the baseball field will not be able to play on case of the teenagers.The  teenagers would stay there late nights and make Loud noises and hopped and holler that  we won and good game boys lets meet aging Thursday. '                        Next, Dr . Seaed thought about it for a while and he said 'This would be a really good thing for the kids to stay healthy and active.We would be considered doing are jobs as good principals.'When the kids grades doped they would pull them back up or they wouldn't be allowed to play baseball with all the other students.And it would be a real good game to play with the gym teachers when they cant think or make up any other games.It will be a really great game to stay active and is a really good game to help the the kids stay active.             Finally, Dr . Seaed came up with a conclusion for all the problems. He said a group of people can only stay at the baseball  field  two hours .they can't enter the field after seven pm .And will only be allowed on the field if your with a couch or gym teacher detaining the week and can only enter the filed if tour 15 or older without a adult .and is not allowed to to make alot of loud noises.             remembering my notes i began to think .this should help solve all peoples problems .i hope y'all enjoy the new baseball Felied.have a good time.

Imagine yourself moving from England, all the way across the Atlantic sea to America.  Many people moved to America like the 1.7 million Irish, Germans, Jews,Hungarians,Greeks,Poles,Portuguese,Armenians,and Chinese.  Now isn't that a lot of people!  Many people came for different reasons, but I think the top three most important reasons are:Religious Beliefs, Business, and building, farming, and inventing!         First of all, and probably the most important to lots of families around the world is religion.  Many of the Jews from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia.  Jews were not treated very good at all for their religious beliefs.  Many of the Jews also were threatened and even attacked.  Many other races also moved to the US because of their religious beliefs, they wanted to be their own.  They could start up a new religion or something like that.                                                                                                                                                            The second reason for people to make this cross-country journey is because of business opportunities.  In a new country there are many new things for business, for example if there was a woody forest then you would invent something to take down the trees.  You will make money of this too. The definition of business is actually to make money off of something that you sell.  As you can see doing this would be a great idea.       Last but not least, building, farming, and inventing play a major role in the life of many Americans including many other immigrants that came to this country over time.  Many people depend on there cattle over the years to make the farmers money, and keep a roof over their heads.All in all Farming, inventing, and building is a major role in peoples lives.       Ultimately, it makes more sense then anything else to move to America.

Immigrants came from Ireland to gain more food and the Jews came for religious freedom. Food had gone scarce in Europe, and Italians suffered from farming.Everyone all over the world had come to escape their tragedies at home and begin a new life in America.            There was improvement from the start as railroads crossed America, which made much easier to travel long distances and move heavy loads. The speed of steam power made it easy to move news quickly and all over the country. mining was much easier with new technology. In about 1850 the Gold rush began in California, when John Sutter discovered gold on his property. Everyone heard and around 70,000 people flocked to get rich in 1849.Especially Chinese flocked from their homes with no food and a great amount of hope to strike it rich.           In a very short amount of time America grew from undiscovered to a new home to millions of immigrants about.

Imgration was good but also bad. there are many reasons for that and some are better then others.             More people come and keep coming and it is understable because America is a great place to live. In source #4 it says 'number of people in U.S. in 1860 is 31,513,000 people in 1910 92,407,000 people. This how much the U.S. has grown and grown in over 70 years. It has caused America to become so populated. Source #1 says 'In total some 26 milllion immigrstes arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. If the population keeps growing it might cause problems. Immigrants like it here in the U.S. and just keep coming.            The gold rush is what got a lot of immigrants to cometo california. Source #3 states that 'More than 70,000 adventurers arrived in california in 1849'. this would help people get money and give Califirnia more population. Also in source #3 it says 77% of Chinese in the U.S. were in California. You would have seen a lot of chinese in california due to the gold rush. Finding gold would b a great experience to have.             Transportation is a great thing to have avalible. Source 32 says that 'the first railroaad that crossed the U.S. was completeed in 1864'. This made it very easy to travel and is very important to have. Also source #3 says 'These advanced in transportation made it possible for more people to travel more easily'.

One of the reasons in Ireland was because they had a food shortage so many people had to move or they would most likely die of hunger. Another cause would be that in European countries they were having job issues beacause the population just kept on rising.         America was a place where you could be free to choose your own religeon, and make your on choices so it was one of the most desireable places to move. The gold rush was also another key factor. Many Chinese men moved to America hoping to find their fortune. Advancing technology probablly sealed the deal for those who were thinking about movig to America.

This discovery led to many people all over the world to come to California for gold and many other reasons. An example is how Europeans, Russians, Chinese, and many other races came to California for a better life.         There are many things that caused people from around the world to come to California. An example is that when the population in Europe doubled they needed more houses, food, and jobs for more people, but they didn't have enough.  This may have caused them to move to California to avoid hunger and many other factors. These aren't all the reasons why people came to California though.          Some people came to America because they wanted religious freedom. Jews, people from Holland, Poland, and Russia. The Chinese came for a variety of reasons like the fact that the Chinese government raised taxes and that there was not enough produce of rice to feed the people so they came to California for more food not high priced taxes. They also came to California because they wanted to join the gold rush.            Transportation also took part of why people went to California. There were railroads which made easier to transport. Also telegraph and telephone made it easier to communicate. Europeans wanted to leave harsh conditions in Europe which is why they wanted to leave.

In Ireland things were not that good. Their crops had failed to grow ,especially the potato crops. Many people died because of a food shortage. Therefore people went to America to save themselves from starvation. Next I will tell you why the Chinese came to California in America during the Gold rush. In China their crops were also getting ruined. They were not producing enough rice so people were starving,but mostly their crops would get flooded. When they heard about people finding gold in California they also went in hope to find gold.

In the following paragraphs I am going to be writing about the Moving to America, Changes in America, Gold Rush, and about American Population and Industries.         First, I am going to be writing about why people moved to America. People moved to America because there  was new technology that was invented and because they were escaping hunger. Many people came because of religious freedom. These included people who came from Holland, and the Hebrews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. All together, about 26 million immigrants came to the United States over 50 periods.         Second, I am going to be writing about the Changes in America. In the 1800s was a time of great changes in America.Industries  in America grew and many immigrants came to America. The way of transportation improved. The first railrode that went across the United States was build in 1869. They invented telegraphs in 1844 and telephones in 1876. Lots of people came to America because their was a problem in their country or because they were attracted to something that is called the 'pushes and pulls'.          Third, I am going to write about the Gold Rush and how the Chinese moved to California. Gold was found in 1848 along the American river in California on property of a man named John Sutter. He tried to keep it a secret ,but soon the news reached San Francisco. many people left their homes and went to the American River. Many people came from Chine to California in search for gold. People who came from Guangdong came to America because of the problems in Guangdong. People told stories about a place called  'Gam Saan' or the  'Gold Mountain'. It is a place beyond the Pacific Ocean.          Fourth, I am going to be writing about the American population and industrial growth. In 1860, there were 31,513,000 people in the United States and in the 1910,  the population increased to 92,407,000. In 1860, 6,216,518 people lived in cities and in 1910, 41,998,932 people lived in the cities. In 1860,  4,096,753 people were born outside the U.S and in 1910,  13,344,545 were born outside the U.S. In 1860,  20,471,000 coal was produced in tons and in 1910,  417,111,000 coal was produced in tons. In 1860,  30,626 miles of railrode tracks were build and in 1910,  240,293 miles of railrode tracks were build. In 1860,  387 were daily newspers and in 1910,  there wer 2,600 newspapers.            To conclude, this is essay about Immigration Explanitory. In this essay I included Moving to America, Changes in America, Gold Rush, and American population and industries. I hope you learned something about history.

Some reasons are push or pulls. Some people were pushed out of there home cause war or different reasons. And some people were pulled out of there house to immigrant to the U.S for: Gold, money, jobs, ETC. Most of the U.S had a lot of new inventions from the immigrants. The immigrants came mostly from Europe and Holland.              The immigrants worked mostly on farms and factories. A lot helped build the railroads that were put in the U.S. If immigrants didn't come we probably wouldn't have as much technology that we do have today. Another reason is freedom. In certain places you had a certain religion and a certain way of life. In the U.S you can chose a certain religion and a way of life you want to live not just what your country wants.             In conclusion Thousands of immigrants immigrated to the U.S. For many different reasons freedom, gold, jobs, forced. I think the U.S is a great place!!!

Lots of people were needed to  work in factories.         Germans came and  into America in the 1800s. Than the Irish were the biggest immigrant group. Before the Civil War in 1860s, 25%  of the Ireland came to America. 1.7 million who were mens, womens, and also childrens. People kept coming and coming after the war. There were shorts of food. 1 million or more people died of starvation. Later on in the 1800s, people came from diffrent places from diffrent countries. This also involves with Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and of course, Hungary.           Some people came for freedom. These involve people from Holand, and of course Jews. Who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. If you total all of it, 26 million immigrants came to the United States. Most of newcomers didn't know about the freedom stuff, but some people knew about it and came for it.          People got very aware of the new transportations, and because its easier to travel or make better connection.           Do you know what the push and pull is? The push is the features in life that pushes people out of their homes. The pull is features that affects life. Such as wealth, jobs, and of course freedom. Lots of European immigrants hoped to get away from bad things in Euope. Russian Jews wanted to escape ffrom prejudice. Leaving families and land is a tradition to the first-born male usually left younger siblings landless.          The Chinese gold rush. Many Chinese people came and tryed to look for gold in California. 70,000 travelers came to California in search for gold in 1849. Among these were 325 chinese people.            Chinese people came in search of gold for wealth. Chinese people sometimes failed on growing crops because of floods.  Almost half of the first wave came from Guangdong. Guangdong had two wars in the 1800s. 325 people in 1849 wasn't the end. It seem that the next year there were 450 people or more Chinese came to CAlifornia. Than  in 1851 there were 2,716, in 1852 there were 20,026. When it came in 1870 there were about 63,000 that were Chinese.

In Europe 200 years ago,people were traveling to a different country. People got killed because they were different. Now we are doing a display on 200 years ago.So hope to see u at the display.                             My display has a lot of people in America and Europe..I pick those two places because that is where most people go to. In Europe 200 years ago like 300 persons traveled to America. Then some African Americans said hi to the new people and like they were white and others were black the new whit people just killed them. Is that fair to just say and get killed because you are black and they are white???? NO!!!!!! So come and see the good display.                                      My teacher was very happy of my done work. I was happy of my work too. Then my teacher read it to the class and they got it was great. Then we all went to get ready for the display we have to do of our stories. After we finished we cleaned and went to our houses. That was the best display ever.                                     I think that the ones how were killed was unfair. Just because ones who where killed were black that happened. Those white person should be fair and not just kill because they are black and they are white that is not the way to treat people. I feel bad for those who got killed unfairly which now you can't do that. So be fair like it is now in theses days.                        Now today people don't move a lot to different places. Also today nobody gets killed unfairly like 200 years ago. My teacher was glad of my work and so was i and i wont to do another of this essays.So thanks if u went to see the display and hope to do another essay like this.

Some people came for work and some came for peace and to solve all their problems in their hometown. Even due to this the population grew so much from 1860 to 1910! Let's look at more reasons why immigrants came to America.            Different people came from different countries such as Poland, Germany, Sweden, Hungary, Denmark, Russia, and Holland. All these people wanted a job, religious freedom or to solve their problems. This increased the population because so many immigrants came to America.               When their was lots of things to do in America, like build, farm, or invent came to do all these things. There was new technology their already for them to work with! But they didn't just come for work. They also came for religious freedom. The Jews were mistreated due to their beliefs in their home countries. Many people didn't just come to solve their problems. They were attracted by what America provided for them. Gold! Gold was found in the American River on the property of a man named John Sutter. The news spread to the rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world too. 70,000 hopeful adventurers came. More people came and the population grew due to the Gold Rush.          There are the main two reasons immigrants came to America. One was to find a job and get religious freedom. Another was to get gold in California. All these reasons led to so many people coming to America and increasing the industrial growth and population. All these people came to find hope in America, so that is huge!

When the immigrants came to America they came just in time because there was a lot of technology. So when they first came there was plenty to do.The Germans and the Irish formed large groups of immigrants who also wanted to go to America. 1.7 million Irish came to America.The reason they came to America was because their crops were failing.Many Irish died because of starvation.Some people came for food but some came religious freedom.              In the mids 1800s there was great change in America.There were more ways to transport and people could move around more easily.Also there were easier ways to pass on important information because they used printing press.They invented the telegraph and the telephone which made it even easier to pass on information.Europeans,Russian Jews,Southern Italians and more people from diffrent contries also came to the United States for a better life.             There were other amazing discoveries along the way.It was when gold was discovered that more than 70,000 people arrived in California.The gold was dicovered in 1848 along the American River in California on a property of a man named John Sutter.The word spread really fast and that was when the gold rush began.By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travelers arrived to California and headed to San Fransico.              Among the people were 325 men from China.More Chinese came the next year and the next. The Chinese hoped to find gold in the California hills.Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong in China's south coast.During the1800s Guangdong had two wars between China and Britain. The economy was hard during those times especially for China since their taxes were raising. People could not afford to pay them and had to sell their land.The Chinese who stayed in China wanted to go to California or as they called it ''the Gold Mountain''                Many people migrated to California searching for a better life.Many Chinese migrated from China to California searching for gold.At the end there were about 63,000 Chinese in the United States.The Chinese have a critical part in building the first railroad.In total there are 31,513,000 living in the United States.

( Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.) Still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Most of the newcomers knew very little aout America except that it was land of freedom and chance to work.That's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.                      The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. A trip to one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. A trip to america in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advances in transportation made it possible for more people to travel more easily. travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. steam power and redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. It also made news and ideas available to more people. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1867 only made news travel faster.The new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of progroms organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. The tradition of leaving family land to the first -born male often left younger siblings landless. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States.                     Gold was discovered in 1884 along the American River California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. More than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California in 1849. Among these ' Forty Niners' were 325 men from china. More chinese came next year, and the next. Most of the first wave of chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area in China's South Coast. They were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britian.

During those past years there were many immigrants that came from all over the world. In this article I will inform you more about immigrants.      In America, immigrants were needed in the 1800s. Immigrants were needed to invent things, work in factories, and to farm a land. In the 1800s, the Germans were the largest group of immigrants. The Irish were the second largest; in the 1860s, 1.7 million Irish people left during the Civil War. Nearly 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. After the Irish came the Europeans, they migrated to find work and to avoid hunger. Some immigrants migrated for religious freedom such as: the people from Holland, Jews from Germany, Immigrants from Poland, and Russia. The total of immigrants that came to America is 26 million for 50 years. They migrated for freedom, and a chance to work.       Many Immigrants had 'pushes' and 'pulls' when they migrated. In the 1800s, America changed a lot. Many industries grew because of the migration, the transportation was much better than it used to be. Going from one place to another is way easier for many people. Now people who traveled would ride a train to get to a boat. Earlier times it would take many days, but now it's faster.The news and ideas were able to travel faster due to the invention of the telegraph in 1844 and also the telephone in 1876. Immigrants moved because of their 'pushes' and 'pulls'. Pushes are the things in life that make you have to move such as: wars, and not a very good community. Pulls are things that people want to do or access like: wealth, jobs, and freedom. Immigrants that had migrated to start a new life.         In America, in the 1848 gold was discovered in California, in an American River. John Sutter tried to keep gold a secret, but the rumor made it's way to San Francisco, many people took off to find it. 60 ships and many people found out, because the rumor spread all over the country. That was when the California gold rush had taken its start.   In 1849, 325 of the 'Forty-Niners' were men from China, they kept coming year after year. The first couple of Chinese immigrants were from Guangdong, China. They left because of many conflicts and the war in the 1800s between China and Britain. During that time Guangdong's population was growing quickly. The immigrants called California Gam Saan, or 'Gold Mountain'. The Chinese really wanted to stay on the unbelievable land of richness, but they went back to China. 77% of the Chinese immigrants were found in California.     Now you know more about the migration of immigrants.Still today, there are many people migrating from everywhere.

Well, there was a time in life when there was harsh situations in other countries. Some of the situations were so bad that one-fourth of Ireland's population headed towards the US, that's 1.7 MILLION!!! Sadly, more than 1 million people died from starvation. Though, that is just a small portion of the real amount; the full amount of people that came migrating to America is 26 million, isn't that crazy? They all came ship after ship, making the population grow bigger and bigger.         Each and every one of them wanted to come for different reasons. The Europeans came because their population doubled in 1750-1850, and they didn't have enough food, homes, or even jobs for them so most of them came to America to escape hunger. They also left to get away from the bad conditions in their land. Others people from Holland, and the Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came for religious freedom and they were mostly mistreated for what they believed in their home countries. The Chinese came because they thought California had a 'Gold Mountain' which they thought was land of unbeleivable riches.

It was a very good time immigrate too because of the technology and the need for new workers to fill jobs.  Immigrants from all over the world moved for different and sometimes horrible reasons.       Some immigrants were German, Irish, Russians, and Italians immigrated in large masses for their own purposes.  Some wanted to escape war like some Chinese.  Others wanted new jobs and a better life like Some Europeans.  The Irish moved to America for survival because at the time crops in Ireland failed and there was famine.  Later in the 1800's the Gold Rush started and Chinese started flocking to America for a chance at wealthiness and a new life.  As more and more Chinese gathered in California they were also employed not only as miners, but railroad builders as well.  These major immigrations from around the world changed United States history.       As the United States grows from these immigrations so is history.  These mass migrations for many unspeakable reasons has helped the United States.  The immigrations were hard for the immigrants so we should remember them.

The journey is long and hard and they have to adapt to many different things. Some of the things they will have to adapt to are new culture, new currency, and a new language.These changes can affect the lives of the immigrants who come over from other countries.                 The immigrants will have to adapt to many things including the culture and rights of the people in America. The reasons why this is hard for them is because in their home country their culture and rights may be completely different than here. Because of this immigrants who move here from other countries may have a hard time adjusting to their life here. Another reason is that they might not be able to defend themselves if they get into legal trouble because they might not know their rights in court and in the community.                 They will also have to adapt to the change in currency. If they don't understand the American money system they wont have the ability to purchase or sell items. Another reason is that they might be cheated of their money because they wont know how to count their money properly. Immigrants also have to adapt to the change in the spoken language after they immigrate to a new country.                 The new language in their new life may effect them drastically the reason is that if they cant speak the written language they will not be able to make new friends or communicate with other people around you. Because of this many of the immigrants may not do well in school or other activities that include the English language.                    Because of all these hardships immigrants from all over may have trouble in many things which may leave them unable to do many things such as excel in school, or buy and sell products often, or defend themselves in court.

Unlike,the germans other people were mad that many people did not celebrate there culture or that they didn't celebrate it so they immigrated many people like farmworkers,homeowners and more but that all changed when the germans became the largest immigration group that many cultures followed the reason why they followed is because the germans briefly the germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's.The irish was happy but then there was a food shortage.More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.But before that the irish were desparate because in Ireland crops had failed,especially the potato crop.

As you might know moving from Europe and Asia and maybe even Africa to America was a very hard and long journey. It took months on end and the ship was usually very crowded. The people on the ships had no where to bathe so it would often smell very horrendous. So, why  would anyone take such a horrible and long journey?       Most immigrants needed work so if they knew how to farm, build, or invent things then what better way to find work than go to America? There was tons of things and employment you could find in America what with all the new technology. It was easier to travel thanks to the invention of trains and railroads. There where also many opportunities you had. The options were it seemed endless. But there are many more reasons people traveled to the United States.       Other immigrants came for religious freedom. Most of those people included Jews who were from Germany, people the were from Holland, Russia, and Poland. The Jews the came from Germany were frequently badly treated for their beliefs. The people wanted religious freedom and in America they had it. So, many people came that way. But don't be fooled there are many more reasons that people traveled to America.       Much more people came because they were driven from their homes. Other countries had no freedom and were treated tragically. Then others were under a dictatorship. That is why many had to get away secretly. The 'pushes,' or things that drove people away from their home were often very tragic and brutal. If it wasn't a person causing the trouble then it might have been caused by horrible environment. Another cause may be wars or conflicts and some poverty. The majority of the immigrant came from Ireland because of the potato famine.       America had many attractions in which were very tempting. They had knew technology that other countries didn't have. There were many employment openings too. There was freedom that tons of countries did not have at all. The amusement parks were very tempting as well. There was party in the USA, but in other countries not so much.       In conclusion, the United States was a wonderful country. There was food, and employment and EVERYTHING. Tons of people got wealthy. And in the end the trip to America would soon be just a faint unpleasant memory. Can you now see why America was so awesome?

Many people from Europe migrated to the United States for a better life. Some because they couldnt practce there religions  others because of the harsh envirment but most of all because in the U.S they can be free, free to do anything.               Comming to America was a hard choice to make. But its all worth it at the end.Many people from Europe migrated to the U.S For Many reasons. One reason is because they couldnt practice there religon in there homeland. (Ireland) so they decided to come here. Another reason why they came here was because they had such a harsh envirment where they lived. Once they came they where free to do anything and they lived happily. No one could tell them what they could do and what they couldn't.               When the migrated they came for a better life, here in the U.S. for better jobs, money, etc. they could have done anything. The envirment wasn't harsh like were they lived. It wasn't a bad harvest if they plantrd something because the soil was rich. They came for jobs like as lumber(chop wood) As you can see there were endless oppertunities here in the U.S back then and thats why people came here alot.               When the chinese came they discovered gold! In the year 1848 the population grew even more! More and more people started comming for money! When they came (chinese) started building rairoads etc. Once they found out about gold the population grew more. And people became more desspret for the gold. Everyone wanted at least a little. They were so desspret they finshed all the gold!              So if you lived at any time back then witch one would it be? Would you look for gold? Or would you stay in your homeland? Even though you chose any of these its not as easy as you think, you know. These people suffered lots of times and when they got here, they had to start from the begging to earn everything back.Money, get a job,etc. So when they came here it was tough.

Immagration is the transfer from one country to another.That is how so many people have gotten to this amazing country.          First of all, tons of countries sent people to America in the 1800s. 'During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship after ship.' In the beginning, 'Germans made up the largest single group of immagrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immagrant group. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before.'           In Imaggration there is many reasons people immagrate. Such as the Irish and there famine or the Jews in Germany for freedom of religion. 'Many of the new European immagrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Working people [also] came to America [to] build, farm, [and] invent.The Irish were desperate because in Ireland cropshade failed, especially the potato crop.' Believe it or not, over 1 million people died in Ireland due to starvation.' Advances in technology also pulled immagrants from their homes and placed them in America. The California gold rush pulled many many Chinese men from China and placed them in the U.S.A.           So know you know some facts about immagration.

Then soon later on the rumor spread to the rest of the U.S. By January of 1849, 60 ships and travelers were headed for California. That is when the California Gold Rush had started.           Over than 70,000 travelers arrived in California in 1849. Along with this was the 'Forty-Niners' 325 men from China. After that more and more Chinese came the next year, and the next year. Like the other travelers the Chinese were also hopeful of finding there riches too.           Most of the Chinese migrants came from Guangdong. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was involved with two wars between Britain and China.  With that the population of the Guangdong was increasing quickly.           Soon the people became hopeless of the thought of finding the riches they long for. They soon called it the Gam Slaan. To them it felt like a dream that would never happen. Like a long lost Fairy Tale. But they would not give up. In 1849 for the 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush it was just the beginning. It then came to 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852.

All the crops were dying, mostly the potato crop. More than a million people had died from starvation.      In the late 1800's many other Europeans started to come to America.

There was not enough over in Europe so, they came to America.      Some had came for religious freedom. Most were Jewish people. The Jews were treated badly in their country. But, some were also trying to escape wars.      In the second half of the 1800's many new Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions over in Europe. The Russian Jews left because of prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. People from south Italy suffered from high birth rates and farming losses caused by lower prices.      The Chinese headed to America looking for gold. Word had spread that a man had found gold on his property in California. That started the Gold Rush. But, the Chinese were also escaping from conflicts and poverty. In the middle of the 1800's China was involved in two wars against Britain. The population in China was also quickly growing. There was not enough food to feed the people.

Why did these people come? What caused them to abandon their homeland and travel for miles to come here? Ever since the 1800's,  immigrants have come to America because of 'pushes' and 'pulls.' 'Pushes' are generally bad things that force immigrants out of their country, such as food shortages. 'Pulls' are usually things that attract immigrants and make them want to come. Many times these things are related; if something bad happens in one's homeland, they want to get away and from in search of something better. These people thought of America as a land of freedom.            The majority of the people who came to America came because of 'pushes' that led them to abandon their homeland. Over 1.7 million Irish came to the U.S., desperate to leave their country because famine and losses of crops and lives. That's about one fourth of the total population of Ireland. Jews from Russia, Germany, Poland, and other countries left because of prejudice and persecution in the form of organized violent attacks. Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices and traditions. Also, the Chinese came because of conflicts, feuds, poverty, and high taxes. Many of these poor foreigners could not survive the harsh conditions of their homeland.            Though many of these people came to America because of 'pushes,' some came because 'pulls.' Chinese immigrants came to California after hearing wonderful tales about gold found in the mountains near San Fransisco. They thought they could make their fortunes in Gam Saan, or Gold Mountains, and them returned to China with much wealth. The Jews not only came to America to escape their country, but also to gain religious freedom. In general, many people from Europe, Asia, and other places came from freedom, homes, and the ability to get a job.                Different ethnic groups from various parts of the world came to America because of 'pushes' and 'pulls.' Some 'pushes' were food shortages, religious discrimination, poverty, and loss of jobs. Examples of 'pulls' were the right to gain freedom and the ability to get good jobs. This is why our country is now composed of strains from many different parts of the world, and why California is such a cosmopolitan state. America is and will always be known as the land of freedom.

A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamship could make the trip much faster.Travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a Boat.  These advances in transportation could made it possible for more people to travel more easily.             During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship.With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do.  They were needed to work in factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things.  Immigrants did all that.                In 1848, Gold was discovered alng the American River in California.  On the property of a man named John Sutter.  Although shutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, The word of the discovery soon reached San Francisco, and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River.

These people from the other countries came to America because they wanted to avoid hunger and find work. Some people also came to America for religious freedoms and to escape from wars that could make unstable and unpredictable. Many people from Ireland died from starvation and those who survived needed food, homes, and jobs. the whole population of Ireland came to America before the American Civil War in the 1860s to survive. America has in a total of 26 millions of immigrants from other countries over 50 year period. What people wanted the most is to find freedom and a chance to work.             Many immigrants arrived on America's when transportation improved which meant that it can became more easy to move resources from West to East. Some people wanted to go to America in a faster way because without transportation, immigrants have go to America in a harder way and that's why transportations are invented. People around the world became more likely aware of the world with the ability to move long distances easily. In transportation, the reason they moved more that ever before is known for 'pushes' and ' pulls'. Because of the pushes and the pulls, many Europeans wanted to escape from harsh conditions in Europe. Most of the immigrants wished to make a new life for their families in the United States.             The other reason why people came to America is because of the beginning of the gold rush in California. 325 people from China came to America among the 'Forty Niners' and after the next year, many Chinese people came just like the people from the eastern United States and the Chinese wished to fond as much fortunes waiting for them in the California hills. All of these Chinese immigrants came from Guangdong, a south coast from China. The reason they came here in California is that to run away from conflicts and poverty. many of years later, the Chinese government became rich enough to feed its people but, other people felt very hopeless after they listened to the tales beyond the Pacific Ocean. many people who longed to go there returned their fortunes proudly to China.             All the immigrants from around the world came to America for many reasonable reasons because some wanted to have a chance to work somewhere, some wanted to have freedom, others wanted to escape from dangerous wars, and others wanted to seek for gold. Immigrants also came to America to visit sonce some other countries are worse than you think. People sometimes visit their families or their friends. Today in America, there are more than 700,000 people from other countries are now living in the United Stated of America. That is all the reasons of why people came to America.

They didn't know much about America, but they knew it was a land of freedom, and that is what they wanted, freedom and a chance to work.        People from Germany made up the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s. After the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. One-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.        In the later 1800s, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Other people from Germany, Poland, and Russia came to America for religious freedom, but still others came to escape wars that made life unstable, difficult, and unpredictable.

Usually, a trip to America would take months, but with new steamships the trip was made faster. This made it a lot easier for immigrants to come to America.

One of the main reason was for the Gold Rush in California. When John Sutter realized he had gold on his land. He tried to keep it a secret, but soon many parts of San Fransisco learned about it. Many Chinese moved to America at this time. One main reason was to find gold and go back to their country proud. For other Chinese it was escaping the war between China and Britain.          Some people came from Europe. Many people such as the Jewish left for America because of prejudices in Europe. Other reasons were traditions. In Southern Italy the of letting the older child have all the land left the younger kids without anything. Some people just wanted to restart their lives in America. Others didn't like the way they were treated.          For others it was for food and business. One-fourth of the Irish population came because their most important crop, the potato, was failing. Other came because America is known as 'The Land of the Free.' They also wanted to invent items such as the telegraph and telephone.          No matter where they came from everyone was important to America. The Chinese helped a lot in the construction of the trans continental railroad.

Moving to America was indeed harsh and difficult, but despite that, people had their own important reasons for still immigrating.            Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Europe's population doubled between 1750 and 1850. Due to this, there were not enough food, homes, and jobs for all those extra people. To avoid starvation and not finding a job, many decided to immigrate to America. They wanted a chance to work.            Russian Jews traveled to America to escape the harsh prejudice and persecution of religious beliefs. Prejudice and persecution were in the form of progroms?, planned violent attacks. They wanted religious freedom in America.            One of the most well known reasons for coming to America was the gold rush. When gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, news of this discovery reached San Francisco. Upon hearing this, seventy thousand people came to California in search of a fortune. However, few were successful while many others has not yet found a slight piece of gold.

America needed people to work in factories and to farm. Germans made up the most immigrants. The second largest group was the Irish.  Irish settlers came here because of a food shortage in their country that killed over 1 million people. They were desperate for work and food. The Germans and the Irish were not the only immigrants. People came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Religious freedoms were a big part of why Holland, and the Jews came to America. Over a fifty year period twenty-six million immigrants came for a new and improved life in the Americas.                 As time past and the population grew, so did the industries. More opportunities were offered and so were inventions. Such as the telegraph, which was invented in 1844 which made news travel faster. News wasn't the only thing traveling fast, the train became the fastest way to travel.             Three hundred twenty-five hopeful Chinese men came to California in 1849 to find a fortune waiting for them in the California Hills. The next year 450 more Chinese men came to join the gold rush. By 1870, there were at least 63,000 Chinese people in the United States. Seventy- Seven percent of them were in California. Many people came from china to join the gold rush.    In only fifty years our nations population tripled, and so did the industries. That's how fast a country can change.          The United States is made up of all different nationalities, religions, and cultures. Back in the 1800's our country was formed by Irish, German, Italian, Russians, and Swendens.

I the 1800's,immigrant's from all over came to the U.S.,especially Europe.Germany,Hugary,Greek,Portugal, and Italy had the most people come to America for a new change.Near the beggining of the 20th century,the population of the United States was already booming at 31,513,000 proving that in the past 50 years that many immigrants immigrated to the U.S. Therefore, that says that America is a well-considered country to immigrate to.

Well I can connect to this story because I lived somewhere else, and I moved here.I know that this story Is about people from other places, moving to other states. I think this story is very realistic.                First, this paragraph is talking about people from the 1800s working, building. and ect. First of all, immigrants did lots of things. What the immigrants did was that the built ships after ships to over to America, they built land, and invented lots of things. The reason why people moved to America, its because they had to be aware of the world around them, and people had been pushed out of their homes . Next, there is this word, 'pull', and it attracted people. It included jobs, wealth, and access to resource.Lots of European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Eu     ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.09670930683023,1.0974465920678,1.52664784602631

I will be writing about all the pushes and pulls that immigrants had, about American population and Industrial growth, and about the gold rush. This article will teach you a lot about the immigrants that moved here to America.       This paragraph is about pushes and pulls. Pushes were things that drove people away from places. Examples of pushes are harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Pulls were the things that drove people to places. Example of pulls are jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. That is what a push and pull is.       This paragraph is about American population and Industrial growth. The number of people in 1860 was 31,513,000, but in 1910, the population was 92,407,000. The number of people who lived in cities in 1860 was 6,216,518, but in 1910, the population in cities was 41,998,932. The number of people born outside the state in 1860 was 4,096,753, but in 1910, the number of people born outside the state was 13,344,545. The number of coal production in tons in 1860 was 20,471,000, but in 1910, the number of coal production was 417,111,000. The miles of railroad tracks in 1860 was 30,626, but in 1910, the miles of railroad tracks was 240,293. The number of daily newspapers in 1860 was 387, but in 1910, the number of daily newspapers was 2,600. That was the American Population and Industrial growth in 1860-1910.       This paragraph is about the gold rush. Gold was discovered along the American river in 1848 by John Shutter. The people that traveled to America were called the Forty-Niners and there were 70,000 of them by 1849, 325 of them were Chinese. The next year there were 450 Chinese in California. Soon enough, 77% of them were in California. That is what the gold rush was.       That was my article about immigrants. I know now that immigrants were important to American history. I hope you learned as much as I did.

The pictures and articles told me things. One of the things it said was: The trip to America was long and not always easy, in the 1800's lots of people uprooted and moved to America.     Frist, lots of people came to America in the 1800's because they could find jobs really easy. Working people who could farm, build, or invent came to America to have the American dream. With all the tehnlogy in the 1800's there was a lot of things they could do. They could work on a farm, or work in the new factories. The immigrants could also build on land and invent new and crazy things!     Next, immigrants were comeing from all over to come to America. Germans and the Irish made up most of the immigrants. Later in the 1800's, people from Europe started comeing to America. Between 1750 and 1850 the population in Europe doubled. So some of the immigrants from Europe came to find work and avoid hunger. Others came for relious rights and freedom.     Finaly, the second half of the 1800's was a time of change in America. The industry got very big and the frist railroad across America was built! This meant it work be a lot easier for people to travel and to move recources like lumber and silver. Travel also became a lot easier in Europe. Travelers could now catch a train that would bring them to a boat. With new steamships it made it alot faster to get to America, where in the older days it would have taken months!     Looking back at all my information that I have worked on, I am happy that so many people would come to America. Without all the immigrants that came to America in the 1800's a lot of the people I know today most likely wouldn't be here. I am so happy I got to learn a little more bout the American history.

Good reasons and bad.                            One of the reasons why Holland and Jews from Germany moved to America is because they wanted religious freedom. The Jews weren't treated right and many of them had to escape from Germany to get to America. Also Irish people wanted to get to America because there crops had failed. More than one million Irish people died.                             Another reason people had moved to America is because there industry grew and transportation grew. The first railroad that crossed the United States was made making it easier to move resources plus people. Also the invention of the telegraph was made making it easier to get news out.                          A lot of people moved to America to get rich. How you ask, because people found gold. More than 70,000 people had  arrived in America at the time. Most of the migrants were Chinese, they were fleeing from conflicts in proverty. Their goverment had raised taxes and farmers were unable to pay their taxes and had to sell their land. After that the Chines had started to go to America.

They travel to America despite of the difficult, tired, and long journey to have more better life. They wanted to have more freedom, opportunities, jobs and wealth. Also, some of them just wanted to avoid against the harsh environment, war and other conflicts.                            Before the American Civil War in 1860s, 1/4of whole population of Ireland people moved to America, and the whole population was 1.7million people. They were kept coming before, during, and after the Civil War. Although the difficult journey, immigrants arrived at America, and they just wanted to avoid the harsh environment. This makes immigrants have a better life.                   In 1848, the gold was founded on the American river in California, on the property of the man named John Sutter. The gold rush has begun. During the gold rush, there were 325 Chinese who joined Gold rush. Then in 1851, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Suddenly the population of Chinese became bigger and bigger and it became 63000 in 1870. Like these people, some of the immigrants wanted to have fun and they wanted to join the Gold Rush.                   People became more aware of the world around them and with ability to move lonf distance easily, they move more and more than ever. Like these, people wanted more wealth more improved transportation.

There were loads of new technology and many jobs so people could be employed and earn money for their family. Some people came because of famine, some came to America because of unemployment, and others came to America to be free of religious prosecution.

This happened because many immagrants moved to America. Immagrants came to the US for many reasons. The main reasons were to escape there homeland, to gain weallth, and to be free.       People wanted to escape their homeland for different reasons, depending on where they lived. In Ireland, there was starvation and crop failure. This caused a lot of Irsh immagrents to move to America. Southern Itilians had extremely high birth rates, causing overpopulation. Russian Jews wanted to escape the vilent attcks caused by their beliefs. All of these examples of escaping bad things from peoples homelands play a part in immigrants coming to America, and the growth of the USA itself.       However, many people came to America for different reasons, such as gaining wealth. The chinese came to America because they heard about the gold rush. In fact, by 1870, there 63,000 Chinese hopefuls in the US, all trying to find some gold. Even though Chinese were all around America, 77% were in California- the hottest spot for gold mining. In fact, the Chinese were only a part of it. in 1849 alone, over 70,000 hopefuls came to America in search for wealth. This time of wealth oppurtunity only shows some of the examples that immagrants took to be rich by coming to America.       The final reason that immmagrants came to America, was because of freedom. Nobody knew a lot about america, they just knew it was free, and that was all anybody really wanted. America allowed religious freedom, which attracted many Jews who were disrespected and outcasted by their religious beliefs. It also attracted Europeans who did not like the tradition of leaving all the land for the eldest son. Freedom was probably the main reason for so many immagrants coming to America.

They moved because there were many problems or exciting thing happening. People who had jobs moved to America just in time. Some people moved for another reason. Thjey moved because at one point, they were struggling because they didn't have much food for evrybody that lived in the same town. During the gold rush time, people from CHina came because they wanted the gold.                When people moved to America, they moved because they had trouble living in the place they were living in. One reason is because the birth rate was very high at the momenti n Southern Italy so there weren't enough food for everyone to eat. Some poeple from Europe wanted to move because they wanrted to escape the hardship in Europe. Of course Russian Jews wanted to escape prejudice and persicution there because there were violent attacks.                During the Gold Rush time, many people moved to America. Many Chinese came from Guangdong. People were fleeing from the conflict and poverty. Guangdong was involved in 2 wars in history. They also moved to America because they raised the taxes in China so people had to sell their land so after they sold the land, thy didn't have homes. So, they  started mining gold with the Americans.            Moving to America in the 1800s was a good idea for the people back then. The people thought America was a good place to live and work becauise they had all of the good technology. With all of the people there farming and builging, there were enough houses and food for everyone. When John Sutter discovered gold, many people moved in. Today, America is the best place to live.

According to 'The History of U.S.', by Joy Hakim, before the American Civil war Over one fourth of Ireland's population immagrated to U.S. This was due to food shortage from failure of crops in Ireland which led to many daths from starvation.

But most just wanted to be free.               life changed for immigrants in good and bad ways. For insistence they were free and had food!

There are many reasons why people have moved from their country to Amrica. People migrated from all around the world. A reason is religious rights. Some groups that was included is Germany Poland, and Russia. Many of the Jews were mistreated because of their beliefs.             People also miagrated to America because of the Gold Rush.  The Gold Rush was discovered by a man named John Sutter. It was discovered near the American River. There were thousands of travelers that were going to California. There were also 60 ships sailing. Many Chinese miagrated to California to find gold during a war between China and Britain. Most of the Chinese miagrated from Guandong. There were thousands of Chinese miagrated to California. In 1870, there 63,000 Chinese in the United States.              Another reason why people have miagrated is because of the failing crops and finding a job. In Ireland, the crops were failing, especially the potato crop. There were more than 1 million poeple died because of starvation. One fourth of the whole population in Ireland came to America. There were 1.7 millon Irish men, woman, and kids. Many Europeans came to America because they needed food, homes, and jobs.               As you can see, there are many of reasons why people have moved to America. This isn't all the reasons why, there are tons of other reasons too it.

Some people also moved cause word had spread about a gold rush!          During the 1800's, working people who could build or invent useful things moved to America. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the world! Before the American civil war in the 1860's 25% of the population of Ireland came to the U.S (that's 1.7 million people)           Later in the 1800's' people started coming from other European countries. (this includes: Russia, Italy,Poland, and many more)         What pulled people the most was the fact that there are more opportunists and chances in the U.S. There was also the fact that that you had freedom of choice religion and speech! There was also the pushes like, Wars, poverty , and more.             Lastly is that a man by the name of John Sutter found the discovery of gold in a river by his house (What a lucky duck!) He wanted his discovery of gold to be secret but it leaked to many other parts of the U.S and world! More than 70000 hopeful miners came to California in 1849 (hens the name ' forty-Niners' ') By 1870 there were 63000 Chinese in America, and they played a critical part in building the first transcontinental...... RAILROAD! Although they could be found in many parts in the U.S , 77% of them were in California.

Even today there are immigrants traveling to different countries, just not as many. In the 1800 they came in ships and worked. They came not just to work but because of all the wars, religious reasons, and because of how harsh they were treated. Germans and Irish people were the largest groups of immigrants to come to America. Ireland came because their agriculture wasn't to good and people were dying of hunger. Europeans came as well, they came because they had a shortage of varies things. They came because they too hardly had food, no place to live, and had no places to work. The Jews also came for the same reasons but it was mainly because of religious reasons. All in all over 26 million immigrants came to the United states.           Immigrants had very hard times which was the main reason why they began to migrate, but they also came because the California gold rush had taken play. The Chinese had a greater population of immigrants that came to California. They had a war between Britain and the Chinese administration raised prices. They had floods and weren't able to grow rice without them getting ruined. This happened at the time when the gold rush happened so a lot of the Chinese had chances to go. Most of the immigrants stayed in America but the people from China didn't; they went and got gold and went back to their home towns.Chinese weren't the only people who attended the gold rush, but 77% of them were in California.           Have you ever thought of how hard life is when you have to move? These immigrants had a hard time because they had to learn a new language, get used to the life style, and didn't even know a thing about how America was ran. They had to learn the laws of America which seemed different to them. It probably didn't effect the immigrants back in time but in the present times it is really hard. The laws are not the same at different countries which means you will have to learn and follow the laws. Now in days the Government is harder about the laws so it is important that you learn or the police will get on you. All those people from different countries weren't really pressured about the law but it was still recommended to know right from wrong.The laws isn't the only thing that matters but maybe they had friends and were so comfortable living how the normally do. That could be a problem. They had to be strong and arrive at America if they wanted food, homes, and all those important stuff needed to live.They went through a lot just to live in America.

In the early 1800's  in the U.S there was a lot of  jobs like build, farm, or invent that had to be filled. During that time Germans and Irish people came to the U.S to do these jobs. The Germans were the biggest group of immigrants at that time. There needed to be farmers and factory workers and there wasn't enough people. Then one fourth of the population of Ireland came to the U.S. They didn't really want to work they wanted to get away from Ireland because their crops failed and people were starving. They wanted to get a new place fast because one million people died of starvation.             Later on people from Europe came to the United States.They came for work and they wanted to avoid hunger. Other came for the religious freedom and to be at peace. After everyone came there was a total of twenty-six million immigrants in America. Even though they knew hardly anything about America, they wanted to be in the land of the free.            The United  States was really evolving. They had improved the transportation by build a railroad that stretched across America. This meant that it would be easier to transport cargo like silver and lumber. This also made it easier for people to travel. If people wanted to get to America it would no be as hard as it was before. You can ride a train to a dock and then catch a boat there. People finally realized traveling has become much easier. News would also travel faster because the telephone was invented.            The people in Europe wanted to go to America to escape the harsh conditions in their environment. The Russian Jews left to escape from Prejudice and violent attacks. Italians had a mass birth rate and did bad in farming because of the lower prices. The people who had tradition of the first born got to have the land wanted to go to America hoping to get a better life.            The California gold rush really got the migration going again. People from all over the world came for fortune. It was discovered in 1848 om the property of John Sutter. When it was found it did not take long before it was around the world. More than sixty boat loads of people came hoping for gold. There was more than seventy thousand immigrants in the state of California. There was 325 Chinese men who came the following year.            The Chinese men kept on coming every year until there was more than sixty-three thousand Chinese men. Even though there was no more gold they still wanted to do something. Then they contributed a great deal in the making of the first transcontinental rail road.

Wars were still being fought in Europe, Asia, and India. These carried over to America, and many wars were started by the Indians, against the Colonizers. Many things brought people to America, many things forced them to America. There were a whole lot of new jobs, with factories being built and other things needing to be built, many people could live easily. Some people earned a lot of money, but some people barely scraped by.          A major group that came to America was the Irish and Germans. The Irish were coming to the Americas because of the food crisis in Ireland. Too many people were losing their crops, and too many people went hungry because of this. People came from Germany for the same reasons as many others, and to be able to believe freely. Within the later 1800's many different people came from other countries. Because of a rising population in Europe, many people left to escape starvation. They had many houses to build and many other things to do, since so much land was still wild. In total, 26 million immigrants moved to the United States, just over a 50 year period! Not too many people knew anything of the land except that it was free, which is what everyone wanted to be.           In the late 1800's, many things changed in America. The Industry was on the rise and more immigrants started arriving each day. Things like transportation improved, and the first railroad across the whole of the United States was completed. Things also improved for people wanting to move to America. Steam Power was making it easier for people to go farther in a shorter time. The redesign of the printing press made it possible to print inexpensive books and newspapers. With the inventions of the telegraph and telephone, news traveled even faster around the world. The problems still faced Europe though, many immigrants still left due to war, prejudice, and starvation.         Gold was first discovered in California, 1848. It was discovered along the American River by John Stutter. Stutter tried to keep it a secret, but people soon found out. People arrived from everywhere, even people who hadn't gone yet to America left now. More than 70,000 people arrived in California in 1849. These people were called the 49'ers. Not too many people did get a fortune out of it, whoever did though, got lucky. The Chinese made up a large portion of the miners. These men came mostly from Guangdong, an area in South-West China. They escaped from a war, high taxes, and hunger. Soon enough, 77% of the Chinese in America were in California.         America was a much different place in 1800 than it is now. Now, there isn't a hunger crisis anywhere in Europe or America. Still, people still migrate to the United States hoping for a better life than where they came from. Many of these immigrants come from Mexico and other nearby countries. The United States is still known as a country of freedom for everyone.

Irish were desperate because the crops were failingof and there was a major food shortatage. It lead to more than 1 million poeple died of starvation. In the later 1800s many other poeple from European countries started coming from countires like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. This caused the Europe population to double between 1750 and 1850.

They should make a secret place were they can fill the whole intire town in and then they will all be safe then there will be no worries. If something bad really happens they should may have wepons. Why cant they make a shelter for homeless people or people who just need food and clothes they have a place to live but they just dont havefood or clothes.

They came by boat, which usually took about a couple of months. It was a long journey, and sometimes people didn't make the long journey. There are also hardshiups outside the ship.

His parents are going to visit him a few months later, and he hopes to find gold before that.          The first thing Shawn has a problem with is that he does not know the language in this state.

He wanders around, hearing this wierd language, trying to find a place to stay in. He finds a place called the California Gold Inn and goes up to the custodian.

In the next two paragraphs, it will explain how and why the immigrants went to the U.S., and also what they'd hope to get and what made the U.S. such a place where they would want to go to.   There are many reasons why the immigrants went to the U.S., which is often described as the 'push' for the immigrants. First of all, in their homes, they might have some wars or conflicts going on, and maybe they just want to live a good life and not to be involved with those conflicts, so they move to the U.S. Secondly, the people might also have many poor homes and live in poverty, and they are hungry and lonely and die. They might not have farmland to grow crops for food or maybe the crops are destroyed by natural disasters like those floods in Guangdong. Then they realize that in the U.S., many good hopes are waiting for them, so they migrate. Another example is that the people at their homelands are persecuted and harmed, such as the Jews. Many hope for religious freedom, and as now, in the U.S., we have a lot of freedom. Lastly, some immigrants may have debts or taxes to pay to their leaders. Some farmers are poor, so they can't pay the high taxes. Therefore, they have to sell their land to the leaders and live in poverty, but when they hear about the U.S., they get high hopes and migrate there. Many causes of migration to the U.S. is, apparently, caused by the hopes of a much better life full of riches, joy, and peace.   The reasons for the immigrants to come to the U.S. and why the U.S. would be a place for them to go is known as the 'pulls' for the immigrants.

In the 1860's a pluthora of Irish people came to America.There were 1.7 million Irish people who came there were children men women.Mostly they all came because there country had a war well the civil war and there crops had failed.They were desperate because  the potato crop failed too.There was less food because of that so basically they were in bad shape.More than a million people had died because of that,the food shortage.It was a disaster.So thats why they decided to come over to America.

In 1860 a large part of Ireland came to America which made the population in Ireland go really low. The Irish kept coming during and after the war. The iris had a reason of coming to America. Not just becaus of simple attractions the Irish came to America because in Ireland the crops failed badly and more than 1million people starve and die. So that is another big population Ireland lost.        In the 1800's many people who liked to build, farm ,and invent came to  America and when they came to America the farmers, inventors,and builders liked america because there were many more tools to build,farm,and invent so Imigrants like America better than there homeland.

The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.
