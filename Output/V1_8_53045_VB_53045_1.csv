The Inca also left behind clues such as portraits that displayed their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and way of life. Lastly, the Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces so looters couldn't easily get to them. These discoveries that have been made of the Inca are important.

The Puebloans learned how to make pottery and weapons by using their skills in basketmaking. The Puebloans also invented kivas. Kivas were underground chambers that were ceremonial rooms. This was similar to a church and helped Puebloans gather and make places to weave baskets. These discoveries that have been made of the Puebloans are important.            Discoveries that have been made by the Plavlopetri are important because without these discoveries, nobody would know about how a sunken city may have submerged. Archaeologists have discovered that the Plavlopetri had created over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. This suggested that the town had been used by an elite and raised the status of the settlement. Also, the settlement might have been sank by sea level changes, ground subsidence; earthquakes or a tsunami. These discoveries that have been made by the Plavlopetri are important.            These discoveries that have been made about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Plavlopetri are important. These discoveries have helped archaeologists make assumptions of the lives of these three cultures.

It's simple, we learn things by either kept records, passed down stories, or in older cases, archeological discoveries.  Archeologists go to many ancient civilization settlements and make new discoveries almost everyday.  While some discoveries seem boring and not important, archeological discoveries are one of the main things that shapes the way we see the past and how we are now in the present.  These discoveries have given us information about a few specific civilizations, the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.  Foundings on these ancient civilizations are some of the very things that have created the way man-kind is today.         Many artifacts found in ancient civilizations show records; perhaps of stories or just some sort of writing.  For example, the Inca had no alphabet or form of writing, but they kept track of their livestock and made a calendar all using different colored string called quipus (Ancient Inca). The development of today's language could have very well started with strings the way that the Inca did.  Records about the Inca were also kept by the Spanish, who came to the empire in 1532; they wrote about the Inca in their language and much was learned about the Inca from just that.  To justify what was learned by the spanish cam from artifacts found such as pottery and textiles (Ancient Inca).  These artifacts could very well also show the development of tools and art throughout history and how we are today.        Discoveries about civilization can also effect how we and why we build houses and buildings the way we do today.  The Puebloans were ancient settlers in Mesa Verde, and were well know as skilled craftsmen and basket makers.  The Puebloans made certain types of houses called pithouses.  These houses have support beams and a fire pit with an air deflector (Mesa Verde).  In today's world we have kept a similar method of having good support and fireplaces and chimneys in our houses.  These pithouses later evolved into Kivas, these were very similar but a better design.  Both of these houses had a symbolic hole in the ground called a sipapu, that represented a passage to the underworld (Mesa Verde).       Much like how the symbolic passage to the underworld for the Puebloans, Archeological discoveries can explain myths and legends that we learn about in today's world.  For example, the discovery of the Pavlopetri perfectly explains the legend of the under water city Atlantis.  The Palvlopetri is a sunken settlement off the coast of Greece.  This settlement is likely to be one of the oldest sunken cities their is, with ceramics dating back to the stone age.  We have all heard the stories about a mythical Atlantis and this discovery explains why those stories came to be, just like many archeological discoveries guide us to how today's world is.

We also wouldn't have some of the modern architecture because some of the buildings we have today are based off of the buildings they had.       The Inca were a very large empire. They rivaled the the expanse of ancient Rome. Some of the clues that the Inca left behind are a big 'window' to their lives. Stories were also passed down by the Europeans who took over the empire. The Spaniards were not very fluent in the Inca language so they may not have been very accurate with their stories of Inca history. Artifacts left behind are something else that give us some history. Pottery made of stone, silver, and gold lasted hundreds of years buried under ground; some were even found in graves for the dead to use in afterlife. Inca textiles and clothing also shockingly lasted just as long. Ancient cloth usually gets ruined by dampness, but these survived in the dry deserts of Peru or the cold Andes mountains.       About 1,400 yeas ago, Mesa Verde was chosen to be home for a group of native American peoples called the Puebloans or 'the ancient ones'.  For over 700 years they flourished in this area, building elaborate stone communities in the cannon walls. The Puebloans were known as basket-makers. Beginning as nomads they started to lead a more settled life. they replaced hunting with farming, and lived in small one room houses called pit-houses. Thel later began to build houses above ground out of poles and adobe. The baskets that they made show a decline in quality stating that the widespread use in pottery means less attention to the craft.       In the waters of Southern Grese a sunken settlement is thought to be the inspiration of the myth Atlantis. This site straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. the findings surpassed all expectations; there were buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures as well as thousands of shards from pottery. Then after exploration there were 9,000 more square meters of new buildings. Marine geologists have no idea why the city could have sunk: earthquake, tsunami, or just a rise in sea level. It is the firs sunken city discovered in Grece that predates the tale of Atlantis.

Other Inca sites    have been disturbed by looters that took anything of value. Looted sites don't offer much to archeologists.   Another important civilization was the Puebloans. They lived in   Mesa Verde , they lived there for 700 years building elaborate stone communities. They were skilled at making baskets and pottery. They farmed instead of hunting and gathering, and lived in small villages. They used alot of sand stone shaped into rectangular bricks. They deserted Mesa Verde by about 1300 AD.

Three main civilazations were the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri civilations. Many things have been dicovered. I will now explain the civilations grew into the world we have today.         I will first begin stating facts about the Inca civilation. The Incas had no form of alphabet, and they loft no writings for the future. The Incas used colored strings as a calendar for their life stock proportions. Many grave sites were left for the dead to use in the afterlife. The Incas lived in the Andes moutains, which could be a problem for archeologists, because dampness could ruin the artifacts.         Next I will tell you about  the Puebloans. The Puebloans lived in Pithouses, which had some of the first chimeneys. They also had many forms of weapndry, like spears, bows, arrows. Also, many Puebloans lived in Kivas. Kivas were homes built with the overhangin of cliffs. This civilaszation used many natural resorces like: forests, soil animals, ect.         Last, but not least the Pavlopetri civilazation. This civilazation, was found sunken is Grease. Archeologists found that there were many courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structres. Also they discovered thousands of shards of pottery. The Pavlopetri was the real life insparation for Atlantis.

They had no writing system or education like we do today. They some left clues for scientists to discover. The clues left behind form their religion, art and architecture, government, agriculture, transportation, and ways of life. We know some stories from writings by the Europeans. Spanish soilders and priests also described the Inca in letters and diaries. The rest of our knowledge comes from artifacts discovered. These treasures have led to the facts we know about Incas.       Another group of people we know about are Puebloans. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were skilled in craft making. They were forming a more settled life style. Farming replaced hunting and gathering. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages. By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonary. Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. They migrated out of Mesa Verda due to drought and crop failure. The Pueblo people of today are descendants of the smart and strong Ancestral Puebloans.       A team of geologists have found an under sea city in Greede called Peloponnese. They had found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. Their investagations also revealed over 9000 square meters of new buildings. They still haven't figured out why the settlement sank. The team says, 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. Less than 1 percent pf the world's ocean floors have been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'       If it wasn't for these teams for discovering and testing out these lost places we would know nothing about. Anicient civilization is very interesting.

It talks about the systems the past had. They did not leave any form of history to study. 'The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock.' The first Europeans were so amazed that the Inca could  run a large empire using strings to keep records. Today no one knows what the knots meant. 'Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history...'        The reason we know some of the old stories, because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. 'The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worwshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult. High-alltitude archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountain for study. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern edical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived.'       Section #2 says that the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. There were people that lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, as settled agriculture began .        'Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880's, archeolagists have sought to understand these people's lives.' 'Fires built in summer were mainly for cooking.In winter, when the alcove rooms were damp and uncomfordable, fires probably burned throughout the village. Smoke-blackened walls and ceilings are reminders of biting cold these people lived with for several months each year.       Section #3 is about exploring the underwater worlds.

They have also given us the ability to know how they looked and what they wore because they were found in the mountains, and there it's very cold so it has perserved many thing for us to study.

They all made great inventions and this is how we can learn where our inventions today came from. In these next paragraphs you will learn how we learned so much about these ancient Civilazations even though they did not even have a written language!                 The First topic I will be talking about is how we learned so much about the ancient Inca. The Inca didn't even have a written language or any archives for historians to study from. How we know that the Inca lived for hundreds of years in South America. By finding ancient clues about their religon and everyday life. Some stuff we learned by stories getting passed down from generation to generation.  Also there were pictures that the spaniards could predict ver y well what they meant. Unfoutunatley the Inca empire vanished in 1532 because the spaiards killed the Inca king. Now it is very hard to trave what happened after words.                      The Second topic I will be taling about is how we learned so much about the Puebloans. About 1,400 years ago in the four corners region a group of people started living on the Mesa Verde. which means the green table in spanish. They lived in Pithouses from about 550 A.D. to 750 A.D. Later they invented the Kiva. Kiva is a Hopi word for cermonial room. This was like our Churches.                   The last topic I will be talking about is the Pavlopetri. These people are the people that are said to have known the most about the lost city of Atlantis which in its story sank under the sea long ago and has explorers looking for it ever since. These people consist of Anglo-Greek team of geologists and archelogists. There is some evidence is that they found ceramics that date back to the stone age and alos there investigations have explored over 9000 square meters of new buildings. Elias Spondylis said 'It is significant beause as a submerged site it was never reoccupied,' this man co-directed the survey as the head of Greece's underwater antiquities department.

The studies in the article at the right talk about archaelogists have found there house and dead bodies that are still in good shape and also about how the lost greek city isnt lost but is found.             The Inca had no formal alaphabet when they wrote or no system of writing. They made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender date to keep the livestock. The spaniards didnt speak the inca language well, they may not have understood there discriptions making them un-accurate. The rest of our knowlege comes from acient Inca artifacts left behind in the civilizations. There bodies have been said to be found in good shape, and the archaeologists revealed information about how they lived.             The Puebolans first settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages bulit on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They were basketmakers and their population multiplied because they were to prosperous. In about A.D. 750 they started to begin buliding houses above ground with walls make of poles and mud. Ancestrial Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. This was because of drought and crop failure.               Finally, the Pavloperti were located in the acient city of greece. The sunken settlements dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heros and in term size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. This is the oldest submerged town. The site which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor southern the Peolponnese, is believed to have been comsumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It is the first time a sunken city has been founded in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken conitent of Atlantis.

Well try living in a agricultural town where there is no power, no cars, and no elctricity. The archeologists and historians are working hard to figure out the ancient Inca tribe of Peru. What these scientists already know is that the inca doesent have an alphebet system. They also don't have any archives for historians to use.       Understanding the Inca is kind of like a mystery. There lives on earth are nearly impossible to know of because there are hardly have any records. They survived nearly one hundred years on there own and ruled over the south american empire. With that one hundred year domaine came religon, art, agruculture, goverment, transportation, and a new way of life.       As some of you may know, the Inca people were very creative people. Most of the antiques left behind are old artifacts, and objects mostly made out of items like gold silver, and stone. These very rare artifacts were mostly found inside anceint Inca buildings, and inside of the dead poeple grave to carry with them to the past life to play with.       The archeologists work effortlessly each day to find out more and more about the Inca tribe. The archeologists keep careful notes, and take photographs of every thing they see and write down the exact same spot they found it. They learn as much as possible so they can be able to understand the Inca tribe. They also Read  ancient drawings and try to see if that is how the inca communicated.       Finally, the most inportant thing about the Incas is what happened to it. In fifteen thirty two the spaniards mudered the last Inca king, and took over his empire. This is why the incas are so hard to trace. The area where they lived had long been inhabited by many different people. And the Inca tribe will be no more.       In conclusion, There are many different cultures and cities that once lived in the ancient world, but by far the Incas are the most unique. The are also the hardest to record because they couldnt read or write. There culture and art surpases all others who came before and after. the Incas left behind a great legacy.

It teaches us about what the people before us did, and maybe, we can learn just a little from them. I've learned a lot from my research, and I hope you do too!            The discovery of the Inca people wasn't very surprising, but it was very important. We know about their past because of the weather, believe it or not. Peru's dry coast or the cool mountains of the Andes preserved any artifacts that were left behind for archaeologists to find, and Spanish people passed down information of the Inca people's oral past. Nobody can really rely on it, though because the Spaniards did not speak the language of the Inca. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by looters, though. All in all, despite some setbacks, the Inca sites was a fantastic discovery.            The Mesa Verde National Park preserves amazing, ancient information that happens to be quiet important. The Puebloans lived in tiny pithouses that were clustered into towns, and they relied on farming. From what any clues that were left behind tell us, the Puebloan people were formerly nomadic, and they were looking for a more settled lifestyle. The Puebloans were important to history because they made numerous weapons that seemed to be very useful. Do you know anything about the Puebloans?            Last, but certainly not the least, the Pavlopetri people were, in my opinion, the most interesting. In Greece, a submerged city was found by Pavlopetri people. Without them, this sunken Greece city wouldn't have be found when it was. I always thought sunken cities were just a myth. Maybe Atlantis could be real!            All in all, the findings of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri people have been an amazing discovery. It's just one more thing to add to the history book. Finally, answers were found.

Instead they use colored strings and knots to communicate and keep records. Today nobody truly knows about what these quipus, colorful strings and knots, mean. Even though we don't know what the quipus means, we do know other interesting information about the Inca. We know things like religion, art, agriculture, government , transportation and way of life. We know some of the information we know from the Europeans who had written down stories in letters and diaries of what the Inca were like, when the Europeans first arrived in the 1532. Historians had to be careful when reading these letters and diaries because the Europeans did not speak the Inca language and may have misunderstood what the Inca had said. Other knowledge about the history of the Inca comes from artifacts, and other objects that they left behind. Most of the Inca textiles were preserved int eh dry deserts on the Peru coast or in the cold Andes mountains. Some of the Inca sites were ruined by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that they might think is valuable. Looted sites do not tell archaeologists very much, because non-looted sites give the best idea about the life of the Inca, because nobody has moved or touched anything. This is also why when archaeologists study sites they photograph and write down the exact position in which they find artifacts. Artifacts from the Europeans shoe that the Inca fell in 1532 when the Spaniards murdered the Inca king and took over the empire. Other artifacts that were found are harder to trace to the Inca because after the Inca had fallen to the Spaniards many different peoples had lived in the same area as them. Archaeologists do know that the Inca lived high places like the Andes mountains and the Inca even worshiped some mountains peaks. The Inca were also buried in high places such as, cliff faces, caves, and mountain tops. Because the Inca liked to live in high elevated areas, this actually helped archaeologists because looters cannot easily get to the sites and also because the mountains like a big freezer. Any body that was found was in good shape that they could use modern medical scanning ans equipment to learn how the person had died, and how they lived daily. This also made the archaeologists jobs more difficult because archaeologists would have to carry all their equipment up to the site before they could start to work, also anything they found would have to be carried down the mountain so it could be studied closer.       Ancestral Puebloans   Close to 1,400 years ago, people that were living in the Four Corners region moved to Mesa Verde. For about 700 they lived and flourished here. They built stone communities in canyon walls and beneath overhanging cliffs.Which is now preserved in Mesa Verde National Park. Archaeologists have called people who lived in these communities Anasazi, which is Navajo word for 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies' and are now called Ancestral Puebloans. A Puebloan is a Spanish word for village dwellers. These people were also known as the basketmakers because of their skill and craft for basket making. They aslo had skill for making pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. They farmed, hunted, and gathered as a way to get food for their families. They lived in pithouses that clustered into small villages that were usually built on mesa tops and in cliff recesses. In 750 A.D. the Basketmakers started to build houses above ground. These houses were agianst each other in long, curving rows. They usually had one or two pithouses in front of their actual house. By 1000 A.D. the Mesa Verde people had advanced to stone masonry. Walls on buildings were thick, double-coursed, rose two or three stories high and joined into units of fifty rooms and sometimes more. These walls are regarded as the finest ever built by the Mesa Verde. During this time, pottery also changed. It changed from smiple designs and gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming was big during this time as well. Farming accounted for more of their deit than ever before and much of the mesa-top land was cleared for farming. Baskets declined in quality, possibly because the use of pottery was higher that meant less interest in baskets at the time. In about 1200 A.D. the people of the Mesa Verde moved back onto/into cliffs alcoves that homes the ancestors many centuries before. The structures of the cloff dwellers are evidence of a society that over centures gained many skills and traditions and passed them through the generations. By the Classic Period the population reached several thousand.  This is also whent he accomplishmants of the Mesa Verde had among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.   In the beginning the basic material for construction was sandstone. They shaped the sandstone into rectangular blocks, the size of a loaf of bread. In between the blocks were a mixture of maud and water. They stacked these block on top of each other, and aside each other to make rooms. These rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, there was room for about two or three people. In the upper levels the generally stored crops. The underground rooms were ceremonial chambers, and eventually front rooms. Their roofs created open courtyards where daily routines took place. In the summer, they built fires to cook. In the winter,  fired burned throughout the village. Smoke from the fires blackened walls and ceilings.   Around 1300 A.D., Mesa Verde was deserted. Theories why they moved were: migration,  drought and crop failures, land and resources were depleted, and social and political problems took place. When the cliff dwellers left they traveled south into Arizona and New Mexico.       Lost Greek City   The lost Greek city is located of the waters of southern Greece and known as the oldest submerged town int eh world. This sunken settlement dates back to 5,000 years ago and consumed by the water around 1000 BC. It has artifacts dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC. The lost Greek city lays on 30,000 aquare meters of ocean floor. The shifting sands and the settlement's encosure in a protected bay help to save most buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, pottery and religious structures from being destroyed. Many think that this cite sank because of sea level changes, earthquakes, or tsunami.

Not much is known about the Inca's, but we do have some clues about their art, religion, architecture, government, transportation, and way of life. An example of this would be the Inca way of keeping records by tying knots in colorful string. This is a very advanced way of keeping track of things for such an ancient civilization. Another clue we have about the way these people lived and how they built things out of stone, pottery, gold or silver. Scientists have also found remains of clothing that have survived remarkably well because they were preserved in the deserts of Peru, or in the high altitude of the Andes mountains. After the Spaniards murdered the king in 1532, the Inca's became more hard to trace. Even though the Inca's lived a long time ago, they were still very advanced for their time, and we can learn a lot from the, about how humans developed strategy and learned to make life easier for themselves.       The Puebloans are known epically for their talents in basket making. They were nomadic but over time started to settle and farm. The Puebloans were very skilled and learned to make pottery and the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting. Their populations multiplied quickly, and they learned to make houses and walls out of poles and mud. The Puebloans however never left any written records of their life, it is epically hard for scientists to learn about why they moved around so much. The Puebloans were also good at building, such as their famous Kivas, which were used for religious purposes and rituals. The Puebloans were extremely advanced in their building techniques and we can learn so much about how they came up with ways to improve life for themselves.       As you can see, it is very important for us to learn about how people lived in ancient times, and how humans developed over times.

Many people, such as the Inca's, used things called quipus to record their way of life. Now, this may have been alright then, but now, we can't read their quipus and archiologists have to rely on the artifacts that had been left and well preserved so that we can understand how they lived. Many places all over the world have lots of artifacts that have been preserved in ice, water, and even the dry deserts.       Archiologists have found artifacts all over the world from Greece, to South America. In Greece, in the past 40 years someone has found a lost city sunken off their southern waters. This city is home to remains dating from 2800 BC to 1200 BC. The whole city covers 30,000 square meters of ocean floor! Its crazy that archiologists can tell all these things simply from the way the artifacts have been preserved.       Another place that archiologists have found artifacts was in Mesa Verde. In Mesa Verde archiologists have found little houses called pithouses that the Puebloans used to live in. These, like the lost city, have been preserved by the desert. Along with the pithouses and remains of the city, archiologists have found weapons, pottery, baskets, gold and silver, buildings, and even bodies!

They were a great importance because we can learn all the ways they were able to stay together as a civilization.       The Incas were a very great empire that lasted for about a hundred years. For that time most civilizations did not last that long or joined another people. The Incas though, did not leave writing for historians to research. This makes it difficult for us to know much about certain events that happened to them. Because of the way they did things, like living in mountains, their bodies get preserved and sometimes we find them and can find out what happened to them. We also found out information about the Puebloans at Mesa Verde National Park.       The Puebloans were an ancient people that were settled in North America but then later moved to another part of the world. These people seemed to be a farming people which took much of their time instead of gathering and farming like most ancient people.These people also were able to make the bow and arrow which shows there great minds and intelligence. They would use nature to their advantage, too, by building their houses on the tops of cliffs. Though people don't know why the Puebloans left, scientist have theories that they tried to find new opportunities elsewhere.       The last ancient city, or civilization I will talk about is the lost city of Atlantis. Most people would think that this is a myth but scientist now have new light on the subject. A team of Anglo-Greek archaeologists have found some sunken settlements that have proved an underwater civilization. The city is believed to have been consumed around 1000 B.C. All there buildings, streets, and religious buildings are show under water which can tell us today how we could build certain things to help our cities. This also gives scientist an idea of how waters affect the land.       These discoveries give a very great importance. They give us information on how we could or shouldn't do things to help us. They also give scientist a pretty could idea of how the Earth can change and how humans have evolved over the past years.

It is quite challenging for archaeologists because sometimes there isn't another person alive who knows the languages of these people or there isn't a language for these people. So how do you suppose archaeologists figure this out? There are a couple of way that they do this. The ways aren't always simple but they are very effective.            In the ancient Inca civilization, there area couple of ways to figure out how they lived.  One way is by these colorful knots they left called quipus. Archaeologists have yet to figure out what they mean so this part is a bit of a puzzle to the archaeologists. Art is another way to figure out how they lived. The Inca were very big on forming portraits on religion, art, agriculture, architecture, government , and how they lived. Also, the Inca told stories among themselves and in 1532, Europeans came and wrote down the stories. Unfortunately, the Europeans didn't speak their language very well so not all the stories were correct. The final way archaeologists found out about the ancient Inca was artifacts. Artifacts made from stone, pottery, gold and silver have been found.            The Puebloans were another ancient group that archaeologists have a had a bit of trouble finding out. They were easier to figure out than others. The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde, or the green table, which was in the Four Corners area. They also didn't write any records so its hard to figure out how they lived. Archaeologists have found ancient Puebloans' kiva. A kiva is a ceremonial room that they used to use as churches. They were places to gather and also places for weaving. Archaeologists have also found that ancient Puebloans lived under overhanging cliffs. These had an advantage for every season. Studies show that today's Pueblo people may be descendants of the ancient Puebloans.             In conclusion, archaeologists have a very hard job, but they all do it fairly well. They use all their resources and usually figure out the puzzle. Even if they have one little clue, they are still able to figure it out.

We have to learn about history because there is so much interesting stuff we could learn about. Not only that, but we can learn about some mistake our ancestors made. It`s important to learn this because maybe it could be your ancestor who ruled the temple or city. if these people didn`t exist there wouldn`t be days, weeks, months, or years. We might maybe not even have technology at this time.                                We got our knowledge from the incas. that knowledge comes from ''artifacts, or  objects that they left behind...' The stories are posibly may not be true because the spaniards did not speak the inca language well. They might not have accurate descriptions. Their stories were passed from generation to generation and that helped the archeologists alot. The first ancestral pueblanos were the ones who settled in Mesa Verde. They were known as basketmakersfor their skill at the craft. They built their houyses the same way the Incas did. Their history was also passed from generation to generation. These people lived in the cliff dwellings for almost 100 years.                This is why we have to learn about history. We have so many traditions and knowledges and thanks all to our ancestors. they have made us many useful things like calenders, crafts and so many more stuff.

The first Europians to meet the inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archoelogists have found many ancient quipis but today no one knows what the knots mean. Passing on the stories was an important way to peserve a community's history. Historian have to be careful when they interpret these account.the spaniards did not speak the inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so thier descriptions might not be accurate. Some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history.                            The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found. As many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, silver. Materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.                      Some treasure were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archeologists very muvh. Sites are reported to archeologists, who can dig them up carefully. They provide the  best idea of all about life in peru before and during Inca rule. Archeologists  who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and phtograph any artifcats they find, and note the exact position in which they find them, and they need to learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence. An Archeologists can compare what they learn from the artifacts and sites with the spaniards account of the Inca. Archeology confrims historical  records. The most important things to learn about the civilizations are where it came from and what happened to it. The fall of Inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The orgins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived had long been inhabited by different peoples. Archeologists have to be careful to make sure  exactly which people built which site.                       An Archeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discovered more about the Inca's predeccessors. Photography can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they canoot see from the ground. The Inca lived high in the andes and may eve have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried n caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites , because looters cannot easily get to them, but it also makes job of the archeologist more diffucult . high altitude archeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical sacnning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived                       In the future archeologist will use more techniques in the worl to discover more about the Incas predeccessors.

These discoveries were made for our benefit. One reason why these discoveries were important was so we can learn more about our past history. Another reason is so we can learn more about the past and how things have advanced since these ancient civilizations. My last reason why I think these discoveries are important is because we can learn how to make our society better so we do not become like these ancient civilizations and die out.                My first reason why I think these discoveries were important is because we can learn more about our past history. We can learn about their way of live like how they lived, what they did, etc. So this way we can have more knowledge about the past and learn form it. And if more discoveries are made about these civilizations, then we as people will have endless and more knowledge about the Inca, the Puebloans, and Pavlopetri civilizations.                My second reason why I think these civilizations are important discoveries is so we can learn from our past and how we advanced since then. We can learn about how things have changed and how we advanced since these civilizations died out. We can learn about how inventions during that time period have been improved and how we use these inventions now. We can also learn about their inventions that we do not use today and see if there is a way to make that invention better and see if there is a way we can use it today in our society.               My last and final reason why I think these discoveries are important finds is so we can learn how we can make our society better than the Incas, the Pueoblans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations, so we do not die out like their society. We can learn from their mistakes and make sure that our society do not make the same mistakes and die out like theirs. For example, if they make a bad choice and that is the reason why they died out, then we have to be smart and not make the same choice as they did. Lastly we can build off of their bad choices and mistakes so our society can grew and not die out like theirs.               In conclusion, the discoveries made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations were important finds. I think these discoveries were made so we can benefit from them.

Do you picture a Native American setting, or do you think of some indigenous tribe? Today I will be writing about some ancient civilizations and how they are important to today's life. I will specifically be writing about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.        The Inca are a very intelligent race. They have been credited with creating a system of counting by tying knots on a string, growing crops on terraced mountains, and building roads in the sides of mountains. They left behind many clues of their legacy, and archaeologists have been studying them for a long time. Some of these discoveries include descriptions of the Inca by European soldiers and priests, Inca pottery and gold, clothing, and building structures. This is very important because we discovered a whole new way of life: a whole new government, transportation, art and many other things. This could influence how we think, and how the human race slowly became more civilized with the ideas of great people.        The Puebloans are known as great architects who built ingenious buildings on top of mesas. They lived by farming and hunting, as many Native American tribes did, and recorded their history through drawings. The discovery of these people are very important because it introduced new ideas of how to live. We learned how they built their homes, and the meanings of their pottery. We still have much to learn about them, like why the left Mesa Verde, but we have learned so much from what they left. They also showed us that living in a rough terrain is definitely possible.                                    Probably one of the most advanced civilizations known to man is the Pavlopetri. Although the sunken city of Atlantis was most likely a myth, a discovery of an underwater city could prove that this is true. The Pavlopetri have been discovered to be very intelligent in their architechture. They built many buildings, streets, and religious structures. This shows that they had their own way of life. I think it is a very important discovery because it could prove several myths true. I also think it could lead to new things being discovered like a different way of life or new ideas that have been buried under the water for centuries.          All of these discoveries are very important. They show patterns of how their life could slightly influence how we live our life. It is amazing to see the different ideas and ways of life are all connected if we look at it the right way. Thank you for taking the time to read my paper.

The Inca have helped us out in a lot of ways. They were the artistic type of civilization that struck rich with its makeings. The reason we know this is from all the looters that have raided there tombs and have found art work that should go to the after life.

Puebloans are a civilazation of movement and like to make change in day to day life. We have found out that they use to live in a type of house call pithouses. A pithouse is a really small house it consits of a 'living rom sunk a few feet in the ground.Four corner timbers supported the roof, and had a firepit an air deflector .' They used these types of houses becuase they were easy to pack up and go when it was time to. We also know that they loved to develop new creations or make an upgrade to an old. When they made a Kiva it took the same old idea of the pithouse but remodeled it to make it fumction better than the old one did. We have found this out through the types of writing that they have left behind. We also can tell 'they lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years.' After that they moved south to Arizona And some to New Mexico settling among their kind who where already there.           We also know about the loss city of Atlantis that is on the bottom of the ocean floor.

Studying these clues some archaeologistt are able to piece together some of Inca life.Some old stories are told about the IInca, by Europeans who arrived in their empire in 1532 and described them in their diaries and lettters.       most of our knowledge  about the inca come from artifacts, or objects that they have left behind. In many ancient civilizations the Inca artifacts might be objects that are made from stone, pottery, gold, or even silver. Even though they have been buried for hundreds of years some of these magnifacent artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in graves of the dead for them to use in their after life.       Some ancient textiles and clothing have also been found and havbe survived remarkably well. Some materials like cloth were usually destroyed by dampness, but these items were preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coast or the cold mountains of the andes.But sadly some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. they will take anything that is valuable.Most of the treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today.       The fall of the Inca is easy to date back because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and then soon after toook over the empire. The origons of the Inca however are much more difficult to trace because the area where they live had long been inhabited by many different people.They lived high in the Andes and may have even worshiped some mountain peaks.Many of their sites are in remote , high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces. But ths has helped preserve the sites , because loooters can't easily get to them.       The high mountains are vey cold, so cold that they act as a giant freezer. Bodies are found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn how the people died. the bodies also reveal information about how they lived.                Long ago about 1,400 yaers ago Europeans explored North America. A group of people lived there in the Four Corners religon chose Mesa Verde for their home. For over 700 years they and their decendants live and flourished here,eventually building building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D 12000s, in the span of a gereration or two, they left their homes and moved away.       Mesa Verde national park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture.Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'. We now calll them the Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descendants.       The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are also known as 'Basketmakers' for their skill at crafts.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithousees clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. they learned to make pottery and acquired th bow and arrow, a more efficient wepon for hunting than the altatl , a sper thrower.       About A.D. 750 they began building houses above gorund, with up right wallls made of poles and mud. They built the houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or evn two in front. From here on these people are known as puebloans, a spanish word meaning 'village dwellers'. 1000 A.D the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Walls of thick , doubled-coursed stone often rose twoor three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. Pottery also changed , form simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before, and much mesa-to land was cleared for agriculture.       A.D 12000, another major population shift saw people begin to move back to the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Why did they move ? we dont really now why. Perhaps it was for defence; perhaps it was a religious or psychological reasons.Or whatever the reason or reasons, it gave rise to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is mot famous.       When the clifff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there .       .    The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the most enduring myths- the fable of Atlantis- have been brought to light beneath the waters off southern Greece. this site, which strattles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Pel0oponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C. What they found surpassed all expectations.       Thanks to the shifting of sand and the settlement's enclousure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world. A world of buildings , court yards,main streets , rock-cut ombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.       Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank.Theories include sea level changes , ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.

We need to knwo whether they were a real ancient civilization or just a myth.                Some archaeologists who study special places find many different things such as the things that belonged to Inca civilization who's remains and artifacts were found in Peru. Form some of the artifacts the scientist have found, they have concluded that that the Inca had no formal alphabet or any system or writing. Scientists were amazed when they had found out that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Some of they Inca textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well concidering all the time that has passed and all the weather that has probably erode it a bit. From just the Inca we have learned so much in how people used to live back in that time.                 Another civilization that has helped us understand more anout the past is the Puebloans. The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') on 550 A.D. They lived in pithouses from 550 A.D to about 750 A.D. By 1000 A.D they had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between 1000 A.D and 1300 the population had reached several thousands, that helped us understand that they had reproduced pretty quickly making it into a pretty big civilization. Using nature to their advantage they had built the dwellings in the sides of clifts. This shows us that they we pretty advanced in intellegence. Puebloans were pretty advance as a civilization also helping us more in understanding the life of the past.                   One more civilization that helped us understand the past are the Pavlopetri. The investigations that the archaeologists have made is that there are over 9,000 square meters of new buildings but what really surprised them was  hte discovery of a possible megaron, a monumental  structure with a rectangular hall, which suggests that the town had been used by an eite. Scientist have yet to discover why  the settlement had sank  but it might be one of the oldest dating back 5,000 years. They were even more advanced in architecture that than the other civilizations.                    In all many people believe that new discoveries are important for people to study.

The things that we know about the Inca people comes from oral history, or stories passed down through generation to generation. Passing down stories was important to the Inca people because it was a way to preserve a community's of history.       The way we know about some of the stories of the Inca people is because the stories were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The people who visit were Spainish soldiers and priests. They explained the Inca people by writing letters and by diaries.       The people who study things have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The spainish soldiers did not speak the Inca language as well as the Inca people did. The spainish soldiers may not know what the Inca people were saying, but they understood wht the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accrurate.

The Inca never had an official alphebet or system of writing at all. They left nothing for modern historians to study or read. So that means they really did not have documents either. They left nothing!        Ancient Inca did have a calendar though. They made knots in various colored strings called quipus. That was used as a calendar and also to keep track of their livestock. Many historians and Archaeologists have found quipus but they can not seem to find out what they mean.        The Inca left many clues that can open up a window to their religion.

The acient Inca of Peru had no form of writing system so they had left no files or documents for historians to discover so they kinda had to go on about with the idea of how things happened. It was like a puzzle with no picture but they still put together the pieces. The Inca made knots in colored string called quipus, to record the calander days and to keep cout of the livestock. We have found many acient quipus but people today do not know what the knots mean. The europeans that met the Inca were very shocked that they coold keep a huge civilazations running on knots in string! Understanding acient Inca is like solving a mystery.        The civilization for nearly 100 years ruled a South American empire. Clues left behind by the Inca show us about their government, transportation, and way of life. By studing all of this we can piece together the way of like by the Inca. some of what we know comes from the oral history, or stories passed from generations. Passing on the Inca's stories, preserving the communitys history. Some of the old stories were written down by the Europeans. The Europeans arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They mostly described the Inca in letters and diaries.       Historians have to be carful when the interpret the language because the Spaniards didnt speak the Inca language well. So some of them may have not understood what the Inca were telling them. So they might not all be accurate. Some of the Inca's stories were rather ledgends then history. The other things we know comes from artifacts that the Inca left behind. Most of the things that we have found are made from pottery, stone, gold or silver. Those types of materials last a long time even if they have been buried for a long time. Some artifacts are dug up in the ruins of buildings and others are found burried in the graves of the dead to use in the afterlife.        Some of the Inca textiles like clothing also survive well. Materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but they have been preserved in the dry deserts on Puru's coasts or the cold mountians of the Andes. Some sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some of the treasures were taken long ago but some of them still get taken today and if there is a site that people have looted on are not a very good searching spot for historians and if there is a site that hasnt been searched the historians get to it as fast as they can and search it slow and carefully.        Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and photograph artifacts they find. They also note the exact position they find them in. they try to learn about every single piece and they try tolearn as much as they can. They can compare what they learned from the artifacts and sites with the account with the spainardas and Inca. Sometimes they confirm historical mysteries.

Kivas were used for many different things most likely but we can never be sure of what exactly they were used for.            these things are very important because now we know part of what it was like living back then, and how its comparable to todays society and how we live. also now, we can uncover more legends and stories and see those to come.

The first europeans to meet them were suprised on how they can keep a empire so big with just a bunch of colored strings.       Some of what archaeologists know comes from stories passed on from generations.The rest of what they know comes from things they left behind like art, archetecture and way of life.They also know many things because of what the Inca people wrote down.Based on all of these clues on how the Inca people lived archaeologists study them and can  piece together details on their way of life.       The first Ancestral Pueblans settled in Mesa Verde.They lived in small little tents called pithouses.They were usally built on mesa tops or cliffs.In Mesa Verde they learned how to make pottery and weapons such as bow and arrows, and spears.They were also known for their skills to make baskets.   Around 750 A.D they had advanced alot more on how they would builed thier hoses.Their houses were now built above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud.By 1,000 A.D they advanced even more.Pottry went from simple designs on dull gray back grounds to black drawings on a white background.

The Lost City of Atlantis was their such a city or is it just a myth?                The Incas never had no writing system instead they use colered strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. Their whole empire ran on these quipus ( colored strings). Archaeologists have found so of these quipus andthe still do not know what they mean or how they used them.It should be really interesting how the mangeged to controll their empire off of these colorful strigs               The Mesa Verde lived in pithouses. These pithouse were very strudy, their roofs was a float area. Their houses were in the shape of a table. They lived in these houses for about 200 years. Farming replaced huanting in the year 550 A.D. They were very skilled in crafting. The Incas were also know as basketmakers.When they moved near cliffs there they learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. they used these bows and arrows for a more efficient haunting weapon than the spear. In around 750 A.D the Incas began to build house above the ground. These houses were made of poles and mud.                Many people are on the hunt of finding the Lost City of Atlantis, but no one till this day knows for a fact that their really was a city call Atlantis.

That is at least 1,200 years earlier than they had originally had thuoght. It was over than 9,000 square feet. Marine geologists are still trying to find why it sunk in the frist place.

The Inca city in the mountains was an idea that probably took years to build. This discovery is also good to the advancement of history because it shows the way the Americas were before Europeans came.                      Mesa Verde national park also helps science and history. It helps history by showing us a picture of what a common pit-house looked like and describes to us the name and a idea of what their weapons were. It also helps science by showing us a machine built for people being allowed to breathe in their climate. This may have led to the advancement of today's modern heaters an air conditioners.                      In lost Greek city we get the idea that most myths might be just rumors. By using modern technology the divers were able to find Greek ruins under the water. The divers helped history by giving us an idea how cities can 'sink'.

The people were really old they was in the world at times like 200 A.D now that is a long time. See they had a whole thing of unpolished gold on their properties that were called gold mines tha they got removed from here home bribery and force that  was crazy some died from dieases and some survived. They caught dieases like nuemona cause of there thin clothes and they were walking in the snow. So i actully see how they felt. So they had to find better places to go their houses was gone and everything I felt very sorry for them. The one that tried to resitce and get killed it was sad cause they were fighting for what were theirs. But now indians are everywhere cause this is a very very free wide and long world they cant be told to move unless a reason. But anyone whom never been their or own anyhing cant go and say move now cause the indians have a right in law to do what they fell to them.

Archeologist got more fasinated by these myths they were hearing about, they got courious and wanted to discover if these myths were real or not. Archeoligist have learned things by reading books about Ancient Incas, Ansetral Pueblanos, and Atlantis City.                  First I an going to talk about Ancient Inca's lost civilization. The Ancient Inca's were from Peru. Archeologist have been trying to look for Ancient Inca history. The Inca did no leave behind any archives for historians to study on.  Archeologist have found may ancient quipus. Quipus are knots in colored strings to record the calender to keep a count of livestocks. Quipus have many knots on them but no one know what those knots mean. The Inca did not have any formal alphabet or system of writing system. Without anyone knowing what these knots mean the Ancient Inca's history remains a mystery. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looter. The treasure hunters or looters took anything valuable that they found. Now archeologist have nothing they can study on all they can do is look for clues and take pictuers to look for things they can find or discover.                  Next I am going to talk about Ancestral Pueblanos lost civilization. Archeologist have called these people Anaszi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or' ancient enemies.' We now call them Ancestral Pueblanos. The Pueblanos lived in pithousees that they built them selves. Ancesteral Pueblanos also lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. The material they used to built their dwellings are sand stone that they shaped in to rectangular blocks the size of a lof of bread. The motar between the blocks was mix of mud and water. Roos averaged about 6 feet by 8 feet, space enough for two or three persons. Isolated rooms in the rear and on the upper levels were generally used for storing crops. The kiva roofs created open courtyard where many daily routines took place. When the Pueblanos left Mesa Verde they travled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling amoung their kin who were already there.                  Last I am going to talk about Atlantis the   lost civilization. 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr jon Henderson, associate professer or underwater archaeologist of the University of  Nottingham. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meaters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It was discoverd by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago , it was this year that marine archaeologist, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. What they found surpassed all expectations. thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's encloseure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. They also found thousands of shards of pottery the pottery might of been stone, silver, or gold. Atlantis was occupied some 5,000 years ago. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploring going.                           This was a very interesting report on lost civilizations. With the the help of archeologist and new technology theses lost civilizations are know. They are known by people that had no idea that these civilizations even existed. One of the lost civilizations that I thought was the most interesting is Atlantis.  I would recomend to people to research about  Atlantis City. I thought that Atlantis City was a facinated place to research on.

The discoveries made from the Incas were very incredible. The Incas left many clues behind that form an amazing portrait of their art, religion, architecture, transportation, government, and their way of life. Archaeologists studied all these clues left behind and were able to put them all together and see how the Inca lived. Also, by finding bodies they found out how they died. From the clues they found, they know now many information about the Inca life.            In Mesa Verde, Pluebloans lived there for about 700 years and settled there in A.D. 550. Pluebloans lived in pithouses which were a few feet underground. As the population multiplied, they built more pithouses. Pithouses included many things inside. For example, it had air deflector, storage bins, or living room. I think pithouses are the reason on why we have houses today. Their architecture influenced us to making better, bigger, and stronger houses. Ancestral Puebloans accomplishments were ranked among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.            I believe the discovery of Atlantis was the most important one of them all. Atlantis is located beneath the waters off southern Greece. There were many myths of Atlantis, but nobody knew exactly if it existed or not. Thanks to the archaeologists and marine geologists they were able to prove that Atlantis did exist. It wasn't until this past few years that we were able to survey some of the ruins.

Without these, we wouldn't know the where's, when's, why's, and how's of our ancestors.      To begin with, the Inca made knots in colored strings, quipus, to keep count of livestock, and to record the calendar. Quipus could be one of the components to our now a day calendar.

The Inca had run a huge empire without hardly any alphetic system of writing or even speaking. The ancestral Puebloans had lived in Mesa Verde for over 700 years. Thats a long time!

In the article Ancient Inca, by Beth Gruber it talks about the Ancient Inca, and how they can run huge empires and how they lived throughout those empires.                  In the Incas way of life they had to run huge empires and watch after everyone. The civilization that ruled for nearly a hundred years in South American. They have left behind clues like amazing portraits of religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their ways of life. Archaeologists can put together the Incas way of life from these tiny pieces of evidence's.               Another great civilization was the Puebloans who lived in 550 A.D. In the article Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, by Roy Anderson it talks about how they lived and the economy. They settled in Mesa Verde, they were known as basket makers for their skill at crafting. They replaced hunting with farming. They lived in pit-houses clusted into small villages, usually built on mesa tops and sometimes on cliffs. They learned how to make pottery and bow and arrow a better hunting weapon. In time their population multiplied. In  750 A.D they started to build homes above ground.                  In about 1000 A.D they had advanced from pole and adobe construction to skillful stone masonry, they were three stories high. They joined together for about 50 rooms. By 1100 and 1300 A.D the population reached several thousand. By 1200 A.D they lived on cliff alcoves. Then they reached to cliff dwellings it was most famous. Cowboys reported them in about the 1880s. Puebloans lived on them for about less than a hundred years.             Both the Incas and the Puebloans were both very intelligent for their time period. They were both good in running empires and farming and crafting. They were personally the smartest of them all. They both made a change to their economy.

Their culture was different than us. Also the way they died out or just left is interesting. Lastly, their lifestyle with what they did everyday.     It's always interesting when someone's culture is very different than what we do. The Inca's had string to keep records, their clothing was very different, and the god or gods they believed in. For the Puebloans their culture interests us because we do not know why they migrated even though there are seven theories. The Pavlopetri culture is interesting since they lived in one area for more than 700 years which turned into elaborate stone communities.     Depending on what happened to them it can interesting to know. The Inca's left in a sad way but it also interests people cause you think of how someone can kill a entire civilization. For the Puebloan's they just left then centuries later they came back. The Pavlopetri for reason that we don't know is under water in really good condition and we don't know what happened to the people in it even though there are artifacts. But we do find out information about other civilizations telling us that this is what happened to them.     I would be interesting if one day we could go back in time and see what ancient civilizations did or might of done in their everyday life. Inca's everyday life might of been worshipping, gathering or hunting food, making types of art and other things. For the Puebloans I think almost everything is the same except they lived in cave dwellings unlike the Inca's who live in the mountains mostly. Pavlopetri had a whole different thing since they lived in a planned town. Even though we don't know much about them I can infer that they lived a fun,most of the time relaxed life without having to do to much depending on the jobs they had. The artifacts are important since they can tell us those things.    Those are the three things that make discoveries about the Inca's, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri so important. Their culture was different from ours. Also the way they died out or just left for no reason. The last one is what they basically did everyday with their lifes.

Today, we try to solve the mysteries of who lived on this Earth before us. There is no main reason for our obsession with the past other than utter curiosity. It is human nature to want to know where we have come from and to find connections between now and previous societies. Perhaps it is necessary to know what has already happened so we can change the outcome if the same circumstances occur.                         Three major ancient civilizations that connect us to our past are the Incas, from what is now Mexico, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Because of our natural curiosity to know what came before us, archeologists have dug up and studied these ancient civilizations and have used artifacts, items found in the ruins of past civilizations, to piece together the mystery of who they were, what they did, and how they ended. From the Incas, we learned that they kept track of live-stalk, citizens, and calenders with knotted strings called quipus. We also have journals and records from the invading Europeans that explain the invasion then downfall of the Empire.                 Another lost settlement that we have recently discovered and studied is a civilization found underwater off the coast of present-day Greece. There, divers found ceramics almost as old as the stone age and other interesting artifacts to help us learn about the mysterious city. Their downfall is extremely self evident as the entire city is now submerged underwater.                 We can learn many things from these past civilizations. For example, with the clues archeologists have found, we now know how the civilizations were destroyed. The Incans were attacked by Spanish and other Europeans who wanted power and were just greedy for land. On the other hand, The city that used to be in Greece wasn't invaded but ruined due to the climate and geography. Because it was so close to the ocean, the waves engulfed the entire city and has hidden it under the sea for over 5,000 years.                 It is important that we know what happened that ruined these ancient civilizations so it wont be repeated. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, 'learn from other people's mistakes for you wont live long enough to make them all yourself.' This holds very true to how we should live our lives today. As we have learned from the ancient Incas, it is necessary to have military protection to keep greedy power craving societies away. Also, we have learned by example to never build a society near the ocean because unlike placement of our homes, the weather is uncontrollable. As help from past civilizations guides us and the curiosity to know our origins drives us forward, our society will always be interested in studying and piecing together the mysteries of the life that came before us. However, we must be careful about not dwelling on the past because what has happened is over and cannot be changed. We must use the knowledge gathered from previous events to lead us into greater things in the future.

Its important to keep imformation about ancient people because this way we can see what they did in the past. For example, from their artifacts we can see that they would make them themselves and from something that would last a long time. We can also predict the way of their lives. To find an artifact is very important because it tells us a little about some of the things they would make. Its also very important to keep record of the ancient civilization because we can learn many things from them. For example the calendar, with out their ways of telling the diferent times of the year we would have the calendar right now.

One of the three most popular is Ancient Inca, Ancient Puebloans, and the lost Greek City that inspired Atlantis. Each one of these discoveries of these civilizations help dramatically throughout world history.                     First of all, the discovery of Ancient India was very important to Historians for a lot of important reasons. One reason is that  they had a early  number systems using only knots on a rope, this was called a quipus, it also kept a calender. Another good reason is how the Incas lived, which was very interesting. They were very religious people and did many cerenomies, traditions, etc. But this isn't the only civilization that was very important throughout our history.               Secondly, the Ancient Puebloans were also a very sacred, ancient civilization. By the time of 1000 A.D. they were masters in stone masonry. They built villages out of many rooms, with kivas built inside. The Puebloans also built cliff dwellings but no one fore sure understands the peoples lives. All they know is that it takes great skill to build such buildings without modern technology. The end of them was most likely crop failures or intensive depletion of resources. Many known things are a mytrh about them, similar to the historical lost city of Greece.               Lastly, the lost city of Greece inspired many people to come up with the story of Atlantis. Since it is so difficult to explore a lot of fables have sprung up, but recently due to the increase of digital technolgy archaeologists are now able to survey the ruins.

Learning from ancient civilizations is important because we don't want to make the same mistakes that they did. Making those same mistakes could lead up to us falling like the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri did. We can also learn from there mistakes and not go to war with people that we have no idea how weak or how powerful they are.

Our next discovered civilization is the mesa verde national park. They were northern europeans that thrived about 1,400 years ago. There time of flurishment lasted about 700 years . Then in the late 1,200s the population got so big they hadto span to othe rparts of land . They were excelent hunters and gatherers and mostly lived in pithouses wich were small dirt houses that were partialy encane in dirt wich gave them good insalaton and protection from weathering.

The Inca made knots in coloredstrings called quipus to record the calender to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus, but today no one knows what the knots mean. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and artitecture, argiculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life.         Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Archaelogists who study these sites keep careful records. They write them down and photograph any artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. They need to learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence.        Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record. Amoung the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it. The fall of Inca is eay to date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. Archaelogists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about the Inca's predecessors. About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verda for their home.   Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated 'the ancient ones' as 'ancient enemies.'          Between A.D. 1100 and 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. It mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. The stone walls of the large peublos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde, with their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. Using nature to advantage, Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread.

The bodies that scientists find also reveal information about how they lived.The Puebloans flourished for more than 700 years and built elaborate communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. The Puebloans population multiplied. They built houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pit house or two in the front. Baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery and less attention to craft. Also, scientists have found buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures in the Pavlopetri. The seabed was a replete with thousands of shards of pottery.

First off, the Inca were important because they started recording things like the calendar to keep track of their livestock.  They did this by using quipus which are knots in colored strings. Also they are important because the artifacts and things they left behind when they died help us to learn about what civilizaton was like in Peru.  Archaeologists record everything they find and compare it with the stories that the Spaniards tell to see if they match up so they can record it for us to learn about our history.  Then there is the Puebloans.What's important about them is they started to replace hunting with farming and they also started to make pottery.Another thing that's significant about tham is that since they started to farm they started clearing land for agriculture and a new way of life.  The structures they built are evidence of how civilization started to evolve.  Then there is the Pavlopteri, which is one of the oldest submerged town in the world.  This sunken town is unique because of how it was discovered that it was a very planned out town.  The shifting sands and water preserved everything down there better than they had hoped and they found a world of structures!

When scienctists found the Inca's homes they found how the government, transportation, and the way of life worked. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from stories passed down from generation to generation. When we found the first lost town of Inca, they were written down byt Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The rest of our knowlegde comes from artifacts.   About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate  stone communities. The first Ancestral Puebloan settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. They are known as basketmakers for their skill of craft. They lived in pithouses with a sipapu, a hole for passage to the underworld.   Divers explore the sunken settlement of the Pavlopetri. It dates some 5,00 years ago. The town is found in Southern Greece today.

The civilizations of the Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and Ancient Greece, were some of the most important contributors.  They left behind clues that tell the story of how they lived, their culture, traditions passed down from generation to generation, their government and politics, the practice of their religion, the beauty of their art, and the planning of their architecture.  Studying these clues lead to a gateway of understanding for how our culture and way of life developed over hundreds and thousands of years.           The Ancient Inca            The Ancient Inca ruled a Southern American empire during the years of 1438 to 1532.  Since the Inca had not created an alphabet or a writing system, there were no written records to inform archaeologists on life of the Inca.  The only records we have are quipus, which the Incas tied knots into a various assortment of different colored strings that kept records.  However, the significance and what they symbolize are unknown to archaeologists.  We must rely on the comparison of ancient artifacts with the historical records of Spaniard's to find evidence of their daily lifestyle and routine.  Although, there is another way to discover this.  The tradition of passing down stories by mouth from generation to generation is another method.  These methods can have flaws though.  Stories are warped over time and can become a false version of the original.  Also, many of the stories of the Inca people were not history or facts, but  it was legends and fables.            The artifacts and corpses of the Inca people may also provide clues.  The position, location, and age all give necessary evidence to discover their meaning to archaeologists.  However, looters and changes over time can tamper with the accuracy of the artifacts.  The archaeologists will collect whatever information they can from the site.  Mountainside sites in particular can harbor a lot of information.  The extreme cold preserve the bodies in the frozen ground.  These specimens can then be X-ray to discover the life they led and cause of death.  But to get to the site is difficult.  Expert mountaineers can reach these high-altitudes with all of the needed gear and return the body to be examined.           The Ancestral Puebloans            The Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde finally stopped their lives of being a nomad, and settled around A.D. 550.  Their former lives of hunting with atlatl and gather transformed to the tradition of farming.  Villages were built and the land on mesa tops were cleared for agriculture.  The new area inspired innovation in their tools, creativity, and architecture.  The Ancestral Puebloans were avid basket makers.  They also created unique pottery and more efficient weapons.  The earliest houses were called Pithouses, which later became Kivas.  These Pithouse were clustered into villages, and communities were formed.  By the year A.D. 750, the population of the Ancestral Puebloans had multipled massively.           The City of Atlantis            The infamous city of Atlantis was rumored to have sunken in the waters off of Southern Greece.  Underwater archaeologists have found it in excellent condition.  The 'Lost City' is more than 5,000 years old, and one of the oldest sunken sites ever.  With the aid of new digital technology, they will be able to explore it.

With all of the oral history, or the storeies passed down from generation to generation. Can be somewhat true but we only know that from which it comes from. The stories passing down brought us to preserve the history of the community's history. When historians are carefully studying the accounts, the historians have to stay very careful on the way they interpret of judge something. Any misunderstanding would change the discovery made.             The way that the Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde shows us the way that they adaptive to their living. 'They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft,' says Source #1, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Pueboloans and Their World. During A.D. 750, they began building their homes against one another and above ground. Which gave them the name 'village dwellers'. On the time A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. Many historians have a prediction on why the Village Dwellers desereted their home. Some people say it was crop failures, saw drought, social and political problems. What ever it was, they left amazing artifacts for scientists to study.         With the discoveries of the Inca, the Pueboloans, and the Pavlopetri. The discovery has inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis -. Marine geologists have yet to piece together the facts of the sunken boat. Many theories left... but none prove yet wrong. Sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going,' said Sakellariou. 'Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'         Therefore, the discoveries about the Inca, the Pueboloans, and the Pavlopetri are important because it shows us the way people lived and survived before us. With all the architeture left for us to investigate we can use these ways for our own being as well.

They teach us what happened in the world. My favorite article was the one about Atlantis, I thought thye were talking about the Little Mermaid. I loved the article because it told us about the past.what was intersesting to me was the struggles the arc haeologist went through to find this stuff that fascinate us all.The struggles with climbing mountains and looters destroying evidence and trying all their hardest to find out the truth and how people in the past lived.      What i found intersesting is how the simpliest things can destroy artifacts. Like for instance water, looters &amp; the weather. The water can dampen cloth or jouranals written on paper.  Looters can burn or sell the treasure. Weather can hurt the homes where our ancesors livedand the evidence. The colorful knots they found on the strings will be really cool  to figure out what they meant or if it was a way of counting animals or something.     You see, all these things are really cool to know. Wouldnt you want to know how your ancestors lived and wouldnt the people in the future want to know how we lived? Well it'll be much easier with the technology and different types of recording now and days. But they dint have that back then all they had were they're eyes and memories. So we got to do it the old fashioned way and find out about them.

The submerged settlement is the oldest in the world. we in progress have found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.

Some ancient civilizations that scientists have been studying are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. The artifacts are great discoveries that are very important.                Finding the artifacts of the Inca was hard for the Archeologists to do. The Inca lived mostly in the Andes Mountains, and were frozen into them. Archeologist had to dig their way into the ice and climb on the Andes just to find the artifacts. They could have lost their lives doing this, and it took a lot of time and effort. The scientist discovered a many thing when they were climbing the mountians. Some of the things they discovered were that the Inca had no formal aphabet, they made knots in colored strings as a calendar, some of the objects they made were mad from stone, pttery, gold, or silver, and Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532. We know and learn everything from the artifacts, so the discoveries that the archeologists find are very important.                We have also learned about a lot about the Puebloans from discoveries. Some of things we have learned is how they built their cities, and their population between 1100A.D. and 1300A.D. These are some of the discoveries from the artifacts they found.                The Pavolptri are also very interesting to learn about now that we have discovered things about them. One thing that we have learned is the theories of how the settlement sank. The marine geologists think it sank because of the sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. Another thing we have learned is where the city was. It was near Neapolis. We really can find interesting discoveries.                The artifacts are great discoveries that are very important. I am really glad that we found so much information on the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavolptri. Now that we have more technology I hope we can find more discoveries and learn more.

What they ate, how they communicated, or what life was like in general? You might think that these questions are impossible to answer because nobody from the past is alive to tell us what life was like back then. That is not true. An archaeologist could probably answer these questions. Archaeologist, find and interpret information from the past, they study our past life. They travel, dig and search to find old remains. With these remains, such as old clothing, artifacts, and other things they find valuable information and with this information they discover things about the past that no one ever knew about, which in this story was information about the Inca, Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.            Information about the Inca, Puebloans and the Pavlopetri is so important to us because in some cases it teaches us how they communicated or what language they spoke in their day of life. In source 1 we learn that the Inca lived in Peru and they didn't have a formal alphabet or system of writing. So if they didn't use an alphabet or didn't use writing to communicate, what did they use? Archeologist found that the Inca used 'quipus' to keep track of days and to keep track of their livestock. Quipus is simply the knotting of colored string. So before our time where we have, electronics and paper and pencil to communicate, you now know that people used to use knots to communicate. One may not think that this information is important but it shows us how our world is changing.       Although this was the past, it really could affect the way an individual might act. Knowing that life wasn't always easy and and everything was always there we now know that people in the past communicated in many different ways.

The Incas               The Incas date back to the time frame of 1438 to around 1532. They were known to have ruled a southern American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. Historians know some of the olden stories because of the writings of the Europeans. They had left behind journals and letters. As in many ancient civilizations Inca artifacts might be of object made from stone, pottery, gold, and even silver. Some artifacts are buried with their owner to be with them in the afterlife. The fall of the Incas was easy to date because the Spaniards murdered the Incan king in 1532 and took the Incan empire.               The Puebloans           The first Peubloans date all the way to A.D. 550. They were known for making baskets and for their skills of crafting. They lived in pithouses that were clustered into small villages usually that were built on mesa tops. When it was about 750 A.D. they began to make their houses above ground. During the Classic period (1100 A.D. and 1300 A.D.) the population reached several thousand.   Cliff Dwellers were first reported by a cowboy during the 1800's. They left no written records, yet for all the silence these structured speak with a certain eloquence.               The Pavlopetris                The Pavlopetris city was lost under the waters off of southern Greece enduring myths know as the lost city of Atlantis. The sunken settlements dates back about 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. Dr. Jon Henderson says 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' He then stated ' It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece.'The site which straddles around 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor is believed to have been swallowed up by the sea some time around the date of 1000 BC.

We find ourselves intruiged to know more about the wonderful civilizations that lived before us so we strive to find little things that connect the puzzle. All of these little things add up to one big thing. That big thing is the lost citie's secrets that people have been awaiting for years. We can find these secrets through curiosity, wonder, and amazment.            The lost city of Inca is a very fascinating place to discover. The Incans had no formal writing system or alphabet. They kept track of livestock and calendars on knotted colorful strings they caled quipus. On the quipus, there are symbols, but because there is no alphabet we know of, we cannot understand what is written on them. There is little left for historians to discover about the Incas. One contribution to this problem is looters. Looters are people who hunt for treasure that may be valuable to them. The only problem with looters other than it is wrong to steal is that they are taking away pieces to a puzzle that we are struggling to understand. Some of the things that we know about the Incas come from stories that we have heard from the spaniards through letters. We have to be cautious though when interpreting these letters because they cannot speak the language well so they may not actually be telling what is written. The other part of what we know comes from objects they left behind. They left textiles and clothing which was mostly preserved becuase of the hot weather, they left bodies on the mountain tops which are frozen becauase of the weather and we are able to bring the bodies down and study them using advanced technology which helps tell us when they died and what happened to them. Though we may not know much, the Inca's way of life is an extraordinary mystery just waiting to be discovered.            Another city waiting to be discovered would be the Puebloans. About 1400 years ago, a civilization of Puebloans flourished for abut 700 years.

The Incas had no alphebet or system of writing. This makes it hard for historians to learn and study. Art, architecture, religion, argriculture, government, transportation, and way of life still lives on. This has helped them learn about the Incas who have been gone for almost a hundred years. Old stories were also written down by the Spaniards and Europeans. Ancient Peru's textiles and cloting did survive the rain and sun. Archeologists did learn that the Spaniards did kill of the Incas.       Mesa Verde national park  is by the four corners of New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. These people were the Anasazi, which is translates into 'the ancient ones' from the still thriving Navaho heritige. Puebloans were the first to settle in Mesa Verde.

The small hole in the floor is a sipapu, or symbolic entrance to the underworld. For the Puebloans may have used kivas fro healing rites or to pray fro rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop, so a kiva is mostly a church.

Another thing that source #1 says is that the fall of the Inca was in 1532, when the spaniards murdered the Inca king and took over the empire.       Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago in the four corners region, Source #2, tells us that they lived there for over 700 years. It also says that they built 'elaborate stone communitys... in canyon walls.' Puebloans were very good at pottery, and used a bowrow for hunting, rather then throwing a spear. The people lived in Mese Verde until about A.D. 1200, when many people moved back into the cliffs. It is unknown why they moved there.

The Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, have all had different tools and adaptions. By unlocking the secrets and history behind the artifacts, we can fully understand our past. Let's begin.             The Inca were an advanced group who tied colorful strings together called quipus that recorded time and events. If we can find out what these events are, it might lead us to discovering new things about our world. If we can find out more about our world, our lives could be better and more advanced.            Discoveries made in the Puebloan section of research included kiva and cliff hangers. This helps us find out that they would have had to have special tools and advanced math knowledge to know how to not let it cave in.

In today knots were hard to understand. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into colored things the ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.Clues ledt behind byt he Inca form an amazing portrait and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologits and others an piece together details of Inca life.Some of Inca we know come from oral history, stories passed to generation to us. Passing stories was an importna way to preseve a community's history. The reat of their knowledge of the Inca comes from the sited where artifacts are found.As in pottery. stone, gold, and silver. Some of Inca's textiles and clothing are here as well. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts ans sites with the Spaniard's accounts of Inca.The Inca lived high in the andes and may have their own things in life.       The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde it is green in Spanish. They are known as Basketmakers for their haed working and skills.They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlalt, a spear throwner.Between A.D. 1110 and A.D. 1300, during the classic period the population may have reached serveral thousand. It was important to them.The stone wall of large villages are finest ever bulit in mesa verde. Baskets are a mexian tradition to make baskets and collect items for other people.       Lost greek city that have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. A diver explores the sunken settlement the water off southern Greece. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the most myth's the fable of atlantis have brought to light form beneath the waters off southern Greece. There is no now doubt that is the oldest submerged town in the world. We found ceramics dating back to the end of th stone age, which suggest that the settlement was occupied some years ago.More than any other underwater site so far its the greatest to see.

You might find a rare artifact from long ago or maybe even a lost city. If we didn't make new discoveries we wouldn't be as advanced as we are now in this day and age. In the next paragraph I will explain why I believe discoveries about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important.       The Inca, who hail from Peru used colored strings tied into knots to keep track of   things.They didn't have an alphabet to write so you may wonder how we know so much about them. There were many things left behind by the Inca which included artwork representing their religion, transportation, government, way of life, and many more things. We know more because of stories passed down from ancestors, generation after generation. It's important the we know how they lived, why they died out, what they were like so archaeologists go to where they inhabited and take notes/pictures of anything they see.   Another group of people called the Puebloans inhabited Mesa Verde which is now   a national park. These people were also known as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'. The Puebloans advanced in many ways when they came to their new found home, an example would be that they made bow and arrows instead of having spear throwers. This invention made hunting easier for them. They were also getting into farming, this made them hunt less because they spent more time in the feilds.       The last group of people I'm going to mention are the Pavlopetri. Long ago their   city sank. This city was in ancient Greece, not the ancient Greece we all know of but even longer ago than that. Recent discoveries with hi-tech underwater equiptment made it possible for archaeologists to dive down and see what life was like there. Although we have no idea why it sank, we have many theories.       The art, the architecture, the way they lived is something we can use now so we   don't make mistakes that they may have made. If I do say so myself, I find this interesting. Honestly, where would we be today without learning this, without making discoveries? Probably living in caves wearing animal fur to cover us up.

They contributed culture, language, and acrchutechture into our modern day society.                               The Inca had no official language or alphabet but they used methods of knotting strings called quipus to record the calender and to keep count of livestock. The Inca had left clues of religion, art, agriculture, government and transportation. How do we know about the Inca? We know most of what we learn about them from stories or legends being passed down. Some of the stories we know of today come from the Spaniards who did not speak the Inca language but described what they saw. Some artifacts we know of come from the ruins of buildings and graves of the dead. The Inca had lived in the Andes mountains where it was difficult to reach. From what the Inca had done in their civilazation, has contributed to the future. They lived in the mountains, later on, other uses for protection has been used. Language has devolped differntly, art has evolved, transportation and our calender may had follewed a pattern of the Inca as well. Therfore, Inca society has influenced modern day as well.                   The Publoans had influenced society as well but in different ways. The Puebloans lived in pithouses from A.D 550 to A.D 750. Agriculture then began for their civilization. The mesa-top was suitable for farming. They were known for bascket making  and their skill for that craft. From beind nomadic they began to have a more settled life style. They farmed, hunted and gathered. They created weaponds such as the bow and arrow, and for more accuracy the atlatl, a spear thrower. Later on, their population multiplied. They have contributed alot to society by having agriculture, hunting and weapondry. Inconclusion their life style had been used later on as well, people created more advanced weaponds, farming and crafts.                   The lost city is more seen as a lovely scenery to live in. There were courthouses, gardens, courtyards, main streets, shards of pottery and religious sculptures were discovered. Marine geologists are still trying to determine why this city sank. Theories want to show that it sank due to earthquakes, or a tsunami. The site stretches 30,000 square meters above the ocean ground. The sight was founded only forty years ago by a British oceanographer. Therfore, the Lost city had contriuted architecture, landscaping, and crafts to society.                   In conclusion, the three civilizations of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavopetri have influenced the modern day culture of farming, architecture, and crafts.

Well I have, and that is why I       am typing this report so I can tell you all about it.       To begin with, I would like to tell you about the ancient       Inca of Peru. Surprising, they did not have a formal alphabet or       system of writing. Instead they made knots in colored strings to       record the calendar and to keep count of their livestock. The       first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed at their system of        quipus. How did they run such a large empire with just strings to       keep records. No one today even knows what the knots mean.       Since we have little record about the Inca most of what we       know comes from stories that were passed from generation to       generation. We only know some stories though because the       Europeans who arrived in the empire described the Inca in       diaries and letters. The rest of our knowledge comes from       artifacts and other things they may have left behind such as       pottery, gold, silver, or clothing.       Secondly, I would like to explain to you the history of the       ancient Puebloans. Mesa Verde National Park has a great       reminder of the culture. These ancient people have been called       the Anasazi or 'the ancient ones', Puebloans or 'village       dwellers', or Cliff Dwellers. They are also known as       Basketmakers because they have a skill for crafting. Agriculture       began to replace hunting and gathering and they lived in small       villages and sometimes in cliff recesses.  Also Pithouses       became very popular buildings and their population multiplied.       These people were excellent at building, they were very crafty,       and they were skillful.       Lastly, I would like to inform you about the Lost Greek       city. The secrets of this lost city may have inspired one of the       world's most enduring myths.  The fable of Atlantis has been       brought to light beneath the waters off southern Greece. It has       been explored by many archaeologist and marine geologists.  It       dates back to 5,000 years. It is thought to believe that is is the       oldest submerged town in the world and it was there long before       the classical Greece.

First, the discovery of the Inca civilization was important because it helped us learn about their history and preserve it.It also tells us or explains how life was back then for these people and what they did during the time of 1438-1532.Not only does it provide us with information on their way of life, it gives us a way to preserve it through stories and even maybe art.Although getting the information was a hard task, it was well worth it.            Second, the discovery of the Puebloans was important because it tells us about their culture and what they did about 1,400 years ago. It gives us insights on what they did to flourish here and their techniques on surviving.We also learn how they built their houses and what they used for their crafting.From these information, we can probably even use some of their ideas to help us invent or come up with other things that'll help us in life.            Lastly, the ancient city of the Mycenaean city was an important discovery because it helped us with many things.It gave us something very big to discover and learn about the under water city that was once a settlement.With the discovery of it, we made new technology for underwater discovery and learned about how the city probably sank.We also learned what they built and what they used in crafting pots,buildings,statues and many more.Most importantly, we learned how they lived and what they probably did during the time before the city sank.

The Inca have done a good job with conserving their artifacts by chosing what type of material they used. If they wanted something to last a long time , they chose rock material like gold, stone, etc. They also used some knot technology. This helped them predict the weather for their crops and their harvest. As they lived in the high mountain area , they also had to adapt to the extremely cold temperatures that were handed to them in their daily lives. This  meant that they had to kill animals with fur and skin them to use their fur as a  , what we call today , sweater. The high mountain areas also helped them by adapting to lthe liow amount of oxygen that was presented into their everyday life.                 The puebloans also built many good homes as well. They built their homes underground about 4 feet below the surface. This meant that less heat could enter in the hot sunny days in mid-August. But when the heat went away in the winter they use the fire-pit as warmth. Although this was a smart idea, it also had its bad times. In august   this would be to cook their meals. When winter came, smoke filled the village and left some habitants walls on their homes charcoal black.                  The sunken city also has a great impact in our lives today. It shows us that although we can live by the sea , it can be unpredictable for us to know when the city will submerge underwater.

It would be nice if we could establish their skill of crafting because they aquired the bow and arrow. Their civilization discovery is also important because we can learn, but improve, their architectural ways. The Puebloans were great architects. They had great buildings that we could use now. This discovery was also important because we could use nature at our advantage like they did. If we used nature better we might be able to get more out of it.             The Palvopetri discovery was important because it was the oldest submerged town in the world. There were older sunken sites but none were so pre-planned. It was also important because of its uniqueness. In terms of size and wealth it was extremely unique. It is also important because it was most likely to be considered a a planned civilization.

Although it may not be easy to find, these ancient cities have more information than we can see.                                    First, much of what we know about the people of these ancient cities had been found in simple pieces of clay, stone, or even rocks. For example, the Incas people left some pieces of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. They also found these items in the graves.  This might tell us that they used those items daily, so they possibly made their homes out of them. Also, finding those items in the graves could mean they believed in an afterlives. For another example, the Puebloans were found to have houses of stone, discovered with ruins of stacked stone. Also, some baskets that were found reveal that because they did not use pottery, they did not pay much attention to craft. There are so many things found in only a piece of stone sometimes.

For example, the Puebloans were the first cliff dwellers, but we know this because the cowboys told stories of them to the people. For another example, archeologists often check with the Spaniards for what they know about the Incas from their ancestors, possibly by telling stories or myths. Also, the Lost city has always been known as 'Atlantis', and this was a story that has never been confirmed until recently. Stories and myths play a large part in unlocking the past of ancient civilizations.               Finally, sometimes geography helps us learn more of the cities we know little about. For example, the waters surrounding the lost city in Greece have helped to move the sand and reveal artifacts. For the Inca, the cold mountain tops and cliffs have prevented the looters from taking and ruining history to be discovered and preserving the information for archaeologists. geography plays a large part in our history that is being discovered.               Lastly, it is all because of these many things that we know where we come from and how we have learned to adapt and grow. Without the information we have learned from ancient cities such as the Puebloans, the Inca, and the Lost City, we would not understand why things are the way they are today. We cannot learn anything more without the help of our past relatives.

The Incas had been defeated by the Romans in 1532. We would be able to figure out the Romans battle strategy and plans. we would be able to use there battle formations in our own wars. Not to mention that the Romans took over most of Europe at one point.       Wouldn't you be interested  in learning the past about your country. learn what your ancestors did back in the day. You would know the Incas lived in the same places as monks. That the Puebloans fled mesa Verde to be with there own kin. Or how about a lost Greek city that has been submerged underwater for more than 5,000 years!       Now think about our economy, Global Warming. back then , they did not have to worry. they did not make carbon footprint. No, they did everything the old fashion way. By hand, not by robots and machines. People are just getting lazier in the years.       older civilizations will always be important to us. we will not always succeed  but we will learn from our mistakes. we can leave a message so others wont make the same mistakes.

The Ancient Inca have been found in Peru, Ancestral Puebloans have been found, and most excitingly a new sighting of the lost city of Atlantis was found off the coast of Greece. Recently archeaologists have may discoveries of these sightings.                 First off there are the Inca found in Peru. An ancinet sighting has been found in Peru but archeaologists are having trouble learnign about their way of life.The Inca did not keep any records in a form of alphabet or writing system but only knots and colorful string. Archeaologists know that these were used to record crop growing. There is knowone that we know of that can translate these knotted strings. Other ways we know about the Inca is from some of the stories passed downfrom older generations. Some of these stories were also written down by Europeans who had arrived. Sadly, some of these stories were rather legends than history. Another problem archeaologists face is that this sighting, as well as many others, have been looted long before. The ancient Inca still lay as a mystery in our hands.                 A group known as the Ancestral Puebloans lived in North America before Europens had showed up. They lived in the Mesa Verde for over 700 years. This group was known as 'Basketmakers' for their skill and and weaving. They were once nomads but soon became farmers and begn to settle. They lived in houses called pithouses. They aslo have found out about bows and arrows which quickly replaced throwing spears. After their population grew they began to make mud houses with walls above ground. Even later after that theyu began to make stone buildings up to two or three stories high. The Peubloans later moved back to the cliffsides. knowone knows the reason for sure about why they made this move.                 The last source is about the Greek city which is most commonly known as 'Atlantis'. Atlantis has been mentioned many times in different books, but recently archaeologists have found an underwater settlement that has most likely been identified as Atlantis. This settlement dates back about 5,000 years ago. Divers have found buildings, courtyards, sidewalks, and religious structures. There are many different theories anout why the city sank but the most agreed on theory is that a sea level chango occured or ground subsidence. It was also predated about the same time Plato wrote his book about Atlantis.                  These three sightings bring up interesting and important event changes in our modern day archeaologists lives. This has been a great find and can reveal old myths and legends from the past. I think the significant finding of Atlantis is the most interesting find of the three.

Well the Ancient Inca, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, and the Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets are all mysterious in their own ways. they are all different in their own ways and yet equally interesting. In the following paragraphs I will give information of all sites and answer some educational questions.      The Ancient Inca of Peru, had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They also didn't leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots with colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of live stock. Since now one knows how to read the yarn patterns that they used, we don't really know exactly what they mean. Understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery. The rest of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind. Yet some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. Some of the Inca's lived high in the Andes where looters couldn't reach. Which was goof for the historians.      About 1,400 years ago, before Europeand explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.

Clues left behind by the Inca have told us all we know about there way of life. Artifacts and clues are the most reliable sourses but stories that have been passed down from generation to generation have been somewhat of a help.     The Mesa verde people lived about 1,400 years ago in North America. Some lived in little hut things that they made and some were cliff dwellers that lived in the cliffs and hills. They had fire in the summer that was mainly for cooking and in winter it helped them through the harsh cold weather.      Archaeologists have discovered some lost ruines of a city lived in long ago. The city is located in Neapolis, Greese. They found lost artifacts like ceramic pots, walls of buildings, and other things like that. They still dont know for sure what happened to the city to make in sink but their theorys are that sea levels changed and earthquakes or tsunami's may have accured. This find inspired Atlanis. Atlantis is a myth in which there is a sunkin city called Atlantis. Atlantis is a myth but its a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.

But it also made the work of the studiers more chalenging because they had to climb very high mountains, dig thourgh a cave in order to find a villiage, or a village might be on a mountain side.                   So i already told you about why the inca are so important and what they found that can unravel some of there past and there empire. No i'm going to tell you about the achient puebloans. Now before farming they were big time nomads and if you don't know what they are nomads are people who would hunt and gather vegies or fruit and once they basicly cleaned the place out or untill the end of the season they would get the heck out of dodge. Now you might think why would they do that right? well like i originally said they didn't know how to farm to regrow the stuff that they cleared. But once there was faming the nomadic way became absolite. And that's what happened to the Puebloans they began to farm and they stopped in Mesa Verde (spanish for Green Table).   so anyways the Puebloans lived in Pithouses which wee hand built Just like any other shelters exept if your a hermit and lived in some cave or a tree but anyways the pithouses would include a living room, a fire pit, an antechamber to store stuff in, and a sipapu a passage to the underworld. oh and also Puebloan means 'Village Dwellers'. But by 1000 A.D. the Puebloans had swiched to stone building and they built huge homes with so 50 rooms.                     Now the peple around 1200 A.D. made a move to the cliffs of mesa verde The reason they made this move nobody knows but we do have a few possiblities they could of moved for deffense reasons or maybe because of religous reasons but what ever the reason or maybe there is a few elements in the mix but regardless there was a rise to the cliff dewlers and they became the most famous. The first people to spot the dewlings were local coyboys when they were hiking (that's just what i'm guessing'. Studiers of the people have sought to find out why they lived this way. the cliff dwllers built there homes over the side of a hanging cliff what they normally built with was sandstone that they shapped in to about the size of a loaf of bread. There were underground Kivas which were basicly churches. and rooms about 6 feet by 8feet which would probely be enough for two to three people. the cliff dewlers only lived in there homes for about a hundred years by 1300 A.D. Mesa Verde was desserted many think it's because either droughts or they used up all of there resources ffor food and materila to build with.                  Alright so i had a very very long explanation about the people of Mesa Verde now the next people there not an achient people but there a modern greek Srchaeologist and Marine Geologist. but they Studied they Achient place of atlantis and they found out some awesome things like that it was the oldest submerged town. and they found mainstreets, buildings, and othe things. read more about them in a Wikipedia Article or something.

Knowing the difference between ancinet civilizations are important. Characteristics of civilizations vary depending on where they live. Its important to have a general idea on how they lived at the location they were found. You can tell a lot about a civilization just by the region they live in.       Its also important to know a little bit about every civilization so you can compare and contrast others. Such as how mountain civilizations vary from mountains from one country to mountains from another. This way you can tell if those two groups were similar or even the same.       Another important thing is to know where it came from and what happened to it. Knowing what happened to a dead civilization would make it much easier to find the remains of a city or remains of the people themselves. Discoveries like that could tell archaeologists all about them, without having to do very much.       The last great reason to know about these civilizations is artifacts. It is very important to know what these ancient civilizations made, and how they influenced the production of materials today. Such as how the Puebloans weaved baskets and how they made their houses out of stone. These ideas had to come from somewhere. The regions in which they lived may still look similar to how they did back then, just because their ideas and beliefs have been passed down.

In the second source it says ' another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Why did they make this move? We don't know.' That is a prime example of us discovering ancient stuff but we still don't know what happened or from the example why they did something. Another reason why I know that we don't know everything about our discoveries is in the 3rd source it says that 'Less than 1% of the world's oceans floors have ever been surveyed.' Again there is another example of us not knowing about one of our discoveries. Why I think that us discovering these is important even though we haven't completly discovered what happened it is a start and where there is a start there has to be an end just like what happened to these civilizations, which give us the knowledge that there is more than we think there might be, and more things that we will probably discover in our lifetime.

In this article im going to be telling you exactly why they are, Using these three sources: Source #1 'Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past,' Source #2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' and finally Source #3 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets.'            Archaeologists learned alot about the history of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, by finding artifacts and historic sights. In Source #1 'Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets oth the Past,' There were some examples on why finding and learning these things are so important. Without knowing these things we wouldnt know how the way of life was back then, and how much weve changed since then, we have something to compare us to. In the passage it says, 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life.'            In Source #2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' there were examples on why finding artifacts, and history about the tribes are important also. In the passage it talks about how Puebloans florished in there village as basket makers, and hunters. We wouldnt have known that if archaeologist had'nt of studied them, and found artifacts. 'Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1800s, archaeologists have sought to understand these people's lives.' Wiht that said even if you arent an archaeologist you can still help of give information you found to help.            Source #3 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets,'  Is a great source for examples on this subject. With most if not all of this civalization under water, it is quite hard to learn, and see to find different artifacts to tell the world about. In the pasage it talks about how without this we wouldnt have very much prrof to back up the myth Atlantis which very much of the world has been going on about for years. here is an example from the passage, ' The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' Thats a big discovery if you ask me.            All of this said, The discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are all very important to students, techers, and even the world.

Although some of it was hard to get because they did not leave any artifacts to cover in the empire, but the scientist saw the mountians as giant freezers and they saw that the bodies and anyother facts or clues that were there were perfectly stored. They said that the bodies that were stored there were so well intact and so well kept that they just could scan them and find out how they died and how they lived in the empire. And I think the discoveries were very important because now we can see that there way of life was alot different than ours. As in the scientists found knots tied in string and they discovered that the knots kept up with their livestock and they were also used as a calander. so the discoveries show us how much their society differs from ours in the 20th century.

Making discoveries about civilizations helps us understand how and when things happened a long time ago. Because of these discoveries archaeologists found safer ways to get to them, how to excavate the places, and better awareness of dangerous climates.       An example of finding safer ways to get to a spot where there is artifacts is in source one 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks Secrets of the Past', there is a spot where the Incas could have been buried but it was up in a cave on a mountain and the archaeologist found a safe way to get there. Also there is more technology that is forming that is helping archaeologist get places and find them. Another example is in source three, 'Lost Ancient Greek City that may have inspired Atlantis myth give up secrets' where the city is underwater and archaeologists have to use a submarine to get to it or they have to use scuba gear.       Archaeologists also are more aware of dangerous climates where the spot where they are finding their artifacts are.

They also did not leave any archives for historians study, and no one today knows what their knots mean, and without understanding what they mean the Ancient Inca is a like solving a mystery.               The Puebloans were a tribe that settled in Mesa Verde they were very good basketmakers and were known very well because of their skill. They were really good at hunting also and farming.They were very talented people they knew how to make pottery and also how to make bows and arrows. The houses they lived in were called Pithouses, these houses featured a living room and also had a air deflector and storage bins or they might of had pits.               The Pavlopetri is an underwater town and is one of the oldest towns on earth the dating is about 2800 to 1200 BC, it is a very unique and old town. it is about 30,000   square meters on the oceans floor. The secrets of a lost city have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths, the fable of Atlantis it has been brought to light from under the ocean of southern Greece.               I think the author chose these because they are different and are also very interesting. They also have to use historians for all of them to figure out what they are and other things.

We now know that they also were civilized about 3,000 years ago, and know they had roads and everything like we do except in a different part of the world and they did not use cars they used horses and carrages.

They could also find some peoples ancestors so that they could know if they had indian blood or atleast know who their ancestors were and where they're at now.

The discovery of this finding was to unravel clues and to see if it is really true and it is true so that also shows how important it is. This city was located in Greece and as we all know Greece was famous back then so that's why these city's like this one is so important to find so that people can find clues about how life was back then. It does show how the tectonic plates move because tsunamis happen when plates touch each other and the plates did move because the earth was once a big piece of land and now its split up so that does tell you some information.           This discovery is a big leap for science and for scientists because not only have they found this city but they might fin more and more around that area because of the movement of the continents. Scientists are more than likely working on this major project to find out more information about how it because submerged and how it is at the bottom of the ocean today. Some people do not think that this is important to us because it was a long time ago and its been down there for a long time but in my opinion it is important because one day where we live might be under water and scientists will research it and find out where it went.               The discovery might find some old tools and things that they used back then and maybe see what they did with these things. Being one of the oldest city in the world makes it an amazing find and makes it maybe a new tourist destination that people might want to go to and that people would enjoy very very much. The people in Greece are really happy that they found this little city that used to be a big place to come and now it is under water so the people do think it is important to find out what is really down there.

Ancient Inca:  Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past   The Inca was a tribe who inspite having a weird way of running government and economics they survived.  Their artifacts that were left, had barely been damaged due to their environment.  This helps us learn how our environment has a great effect on us.  The Spaniards came and wrote about them.  These newcomers to this land they have never seen before was odd, because they could not understand the Inca.  These two types of people were different from eachother and on two different levels in technology.  Stories about the Inca were passed down from generation to generation.  The stories lived on and on, even after the loss.  The Inca were took over by the Spaniards.  The Spaniards killed their king.  We now know how we have advanced from doing things like that.  Killing enisent tribes would now be thought of as 'not right'.  This shows how we have changed to more civil people.       Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World   Before the Europeans came their were different people living here than we have today.  They were called Ancestral Puebloans.  They are knowns as Basketmakers.  This is different from how it is today, because we mostly have machines do all the work.  They lived on mesa tops. They have pithouses, it was a house that sunk in the ground and was almost like our houses today.  The houses evolved to kivas.  That shows how much change is happening and how it is forming to today.  They later started building them above ground just like most people today.  Their population was increasing and they were evolving in technology as well.  They went from pole-and-adobe construction to stone masonry.  The population was getting out of hand so some people were moving back to the place that sheilded their ancestors.  Researches may use this information to help deal with problems of today like immigration and other problems that may cause population issues.  Then drasticly almost all of the Ancestral Puebloans moved back to the place where their ancestors lived.  Soon the place was deserted and almost no Ancestral Puebloans lived at the place they left.  Researchers could not find the information about why they had left that place.  They guessed maybe it was resource, social, political problems, or maybe they look for new opportunity.  We could use this information to stop things like this from happening in the future.  Information like this could help with this if something like this ever happened again.

By Clay Martin       Over the years, archaeologists have made several amazing discoveries about our world from the past. Some of these discoveries, for example, are the discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations. We can learn and discover many things about ourselves and these people from the artifacts we find in their homes. These civilizations are obviously very important. In my opinion, the reason that they are most important is that they can teach us about both ourselves and them.       The Inca are one of these amazing civilizations. Through artifacts, we have learned that they used colored strings called quipus to record things. We have learned that they were defeated by the Europeans in 1532. We have learned that they had one of the largest empires ever. All of these facts were discovered because of artifacts.       The Puebloans are another great civilization. They lived in Pithouses. They invented the bow and arrow. They were known as the basketmakers. We have learned all these facts because of artifacts.       A third civilization in this group is the Pavlopetri. Archaeologists have discovered that they lived in Atlantis. They've discovered that Atlantis is the oldest planned town ever. They've been able to come up with theories of how Atlantis was destroyed, such as sea level changes, an earthquake, or a tsunami. Again, these discoveries came from artifacts.       There is a lesson to be learned from these artifacts and discoveries. Although these civilizations were amazing, they all have one thing in common: they made mistakes. They weren't perfect. There isn't, never has been, and never will be a perfect civilization. But if we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us, we will be able to become more perfect. There is only one way for us to become more perfect: if people work together and honor and respect one another.

The Inca made knots in colored string to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Today no one knows what the knots mean. A lot of the knowledge comes from the artifacts left behind, and from the sites in which the artifacts were found. Archeologists found stone, pottery, gold, and silver. They also found Ince textiles and clothing. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. The Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may have even worshipped some mountain peeks.   Source #2.   About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They used bow and arrow for hunting.   Source #3.   The sunken settlement dates back some 5000 years ago. The site is believed to be consumed by the ocean.       Part 2.

For example, the house they use too live in and what they did in the past. A lot of things have been found and have been discovered. Many of these things date back before Christ. That makes you wonder what did the worship? They worshiped some mountain peeks. A lot of there cities were up on high places. Where they began to make record of what they did, how they lived, and, the calendar.                 These records where kept on knots and strings. Many of theses records where called quips. Many archeologist do not know what theses knots mean. Some clues where left behind. When some Europeans come they have to be careful when they translate the stories because the didn't speak there language well. Scene they didn't speak there language the stories might not be correct.                   In Mesa Verde they are known for there skill and at the craft. There were farming places, hunting, and, gathering. They learned to live in pit-houses and clustered into small villages. They learned how to make pottery, bow and arrows and efficient weapons for hunting and a spear thrower. In those pit-houses they had a fire pit, an air deflector, and, there was passages under ground to the underworld. They later became known as the Kivas.                   Then there population multiplied then around A.D. 750 they  were beginning to build houses above ground. Then they advanced from pole and adobe to construction and skilful stone masonry. There where cliff dwellers. When local cowboys first reported them the archeologist where pussled in understanding how these people lived. There was no record left of this so there knowledge is a little uncertain. In the season during summer they mainly used the fire place for food. During the winter they lit those fires through out the village they were so cold and damp, uncomfortable and the smoke blacken the walls.In the change of those seasons it was very hard to keep things cool in the summer and keep things warm in the winter with out blacken roofs or fire and ashes every where.                       When the city of Atlantis was found the myths weren't myths anymore they became reality. there have been story's about the lost city in fairy tales with the little mermaid and her father. They are just TV shows every one saw they thought it couldn't be true. Meany people, children seen how beautiful it looked in the TV they wondered if it was real or just imaginary. Parents say ,'oh, That's not real its just to make the kids believe in magic.' They where wrong some explorers found Atlantis beneath the waters off southern Greece.They soon find that it dates back to 5,000 years ago.                     'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr. Jon Henderson. This meant that the myth is now not a myth more than a ledgeden. It date to 2800 to1200BC before Christ there are older sunken cites but none had towns like this one which made it unique.  It went from  30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. They believe that it was consumed around 1000BC. They found it interesting that it Had buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and, religious structures. It was replete with thousands of shared of pottery. These buildings of 9000 square miles took them by surprise this was represented a moment of the past. They still wonder why they sunk this magnificent structure. It has so many beautiful artifacts. This is the first time that a sunken city has been found in ancient Greece. A famos filiosefer said ,' Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.'

I mean they didn't have any tutorial classes about life or inventions and stuff like that! We have parents and internet although the internet mostly always lies, but still we have resources and they didn't. If our ancestors had not came up with any of their inventions I probably wouldn't be typing this article on the computer because without their head-start its like racing that fast kid at your school and you eating a bag of chips before that race. What if they never made crafts then that would mean you have to take your grandma everywhere you go. You are probably thinking oh WOW big difference who cares if we didn't use their ideas ,we would still have everything we have right now, that may be so but everyone says life goes by fast then that means without our ancestor's ideas you would waste basically your whole entire life but a head-start would only waste half of it.

Does'nt finding out about the past make you excited. Well i am going to tell your why first of all finding out about new things is exciting.                 First ,Archeologist are people who study things from the past. Archeologist have found many things to help them learn about the past. before and archeologist can look for things to discover they come up with good questions like for instance, what did people do to communicate with each other , how did their clothes look like, what kind of langage did they speak, did they write and if they did how did their writting look like. then the Archeologist can go out and find things that will make them find the answers to their questions.                In source two it  I read on how the first Ancestral Puenloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D.550. They were really known for theri skill and craft because archeologist found pottery and  bow and arrows. It also says on how the Puenloans lived in pithouses.                The Incas were ancient people of Peru. Archeologist found that Incas had no way of writting ,alphabet. They did not leave any records for us to find but they did leave kots in colored strings that they used to record the calender. Some of the history that we know about the Incas come's from oral stories passed from, generation to generation.                Even myths have gotton these Archeologist to work, like the myth of the sunken city of Atlantis. Archeologist have gone underwater and to try to find remains of this city. they belive that the city has been underwater since 1000 BC.                       These are some of the things that are important. It is really amazing of some of the things you can find out just by some little things that you find . These people left many clues for us and it is very nice to explor and think of what you just might discover.

There are many reasons why they are important. Let me explain.           First of all, without these discoveries we would know nothing about the ancient civilizations. With the discovery of the cities we now know the every day lives of these people. We learned what kind of clothing the Incas wore and how they kept records. With the Puebloans we learned that they lived in pithouses. Archeologists also know now what structures Pavelopetri people used. Yet no one could have known that without the discoveries of these cities.            These findings are also important because of the artifacts. According to section 3 archeologists now know when the lost city of Atlantis was enveloped by the sea. All thanks to the artifacts. Also the artifacts connect us to their way of life. Without them no one could know what the Incas wore, or where the Puebloans gathers. Artifacts also are priceless. If they aren't found they could be lost forever.              As one can see, the discovery of these ancient cities are very important. Without them archeologists would not anything about these cities and their history.

During the civilization of the inca from (1438-1532) and they left behind their religon, their art, government, and many other interesting important thing that make an impact on the world today. There were European and Spanish soldier that wrote down about the incans lives in letters to people and in their own diaries, when they arrived in 1532. They incans left behind many things that seemed important to them like stone, pottery, silver, and gold. They have also buried eachother to preseve themselves and they left behind clothing and things, usaully clothes would fade away from the damp but they are in the desert so it is dry. The spanish killed an incan king in 1532 and they took over the place and marked the area for spain. They do not know exactly where because there werent that much artifacts. Some of the incans left there artifacts in caves or very high mountains and cliffs and stuff this helped the preservations because it was very hard to find beacuse they probably knew that if they lived in somewhere very hard to acces the looters could not find the riches so easily. They found bodies of the incans not fully decomposed bodies because the temperature of the andes mountains was very low so when they found the bodies and they wanted to scan them they would have an easier time identifitying them because there was a little bit of flesh still on there body enough to identify them. They could also scan them from how they died maybe they died from old age maybe they got murdered by a sword you can find out from todays technology. The bodies can also be scanned from how they lived in the time they were alive in the caves or one of the pyramid or towers. The incans had an amazing legacy in their lives they left behind many riches and artifacts most of them we probably have never will discover or maybe some of it got looted we may never know fully about the incans and the way they lived but we do know some of the things from the incans. There are many empires for us to discover that the incans left behind maybe one day i will explore all of the riches that the incans have and how amazing this civilization lost in the sand and closed in on caves in the andes mountians.

To start off the Inca.They were from Peru and which they had no formal alphabet of system of writing.The way you would know the date is if you spoke thier language and knew what the different colors in the knots meant.That was a way to tell stories too.Life remained there from 1438-1532.The way you would be able to know about the civilzation from thousands of years ago was because clues were left by the Inca portraits of thier religion,art,agiculture,government,and ways of life.      Next up the Pueblons.About 1,400 years ago long before the Europeans explored North America a group of people living in the Four Corners claimed this as thier home.They stayed there for more than 700 years.But in the late A.D 1,200 they moved.Pueblons were called Anasazis which translated to 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'.They are now called Ancestral Pueblons reflecting thier modern descendants.      Last but not least Pavlopetri.The marine geologistists or Anglo-Greek team or archaeologists.They explored the sunken settlement of Atlantis whick sunk about 5,000 years ago.It was known as the most submerged town in the world.The dates went from 2,800-1,200 BC long before the glory days.

All people are diffrent and many had so many cultures, many ways of writting, and their styles. Also how they lived. Some examples are the Inca's, the civilization from Mesa Verde, and the lost city of Atlantis. They have all many diffrent ways of being but just small things help archaeologist. They are very simple but very difficult to study. They have to find many research to study their ancient civilization.         One example will be the civilization of Ancient Inca. The way for archeaologist to find all this is to research the place were it was located. The way they know is by the old history and by the way some artifacts are. For example, Incas had a very strange way of writing. Their old writing system is very dificult thet not even today they can figure it out. Their civilization is unique because they lived high up in the Andes Mountains. There it is very cold so some corpse indicate how they lived. For example, they can infer what they wore or how they adapted to that climate. Archaeologist can find the way they lived by clues of where they are from.        Also archaeologist that research the civilization from Mesa Verde can infer the way they lived and how they constructed homes. They can study their way of being by the way some homes were built. Also how some places were built for religious purposes. Archeaologist can also find new things about them by how some wepons were built. Their civilization was also unique because it became very popular in a short time. They can find many things from studying their artifacts and archeitechture.        Some other reasons will be studying how it disapeared. For example the lost city of Atlantis. That civilization was also very popular but sadly it went underwater. There are many myhts about that city. Although it is 30,000 square meters deep in water people can still infer things about Atlantis. Archeaologist also have to study the location and how it might have disapeared. There are myhts about a tsunami, earthquake and other things that might have happened for atlantis to disapear. Archeoalogist still have to research the lost city of Atlantis.         In conclusion, archeaologist find new things by their location, artifacts, and some inventions. They all have to research many new things. Also explore the land and figure out  how they adapted to that climate. There might be myths aabout every civilization but there can only be one fact.

With these proofs we can know more about who we are and where do we originate from. Also we can get more knowelegde of  how did ancient civilaztions live or where. And finally we can better understand the physical and chemical properties of our own bodies.             Starting off with what I said erlier about the curiousity humans have to their origins, to cease that curiousity we can use the ruins and the ancient arifacts and the fossils to figure out where we come from and how the human kind came to be. Not to mention we can also use these ancient discoveries to make great meusseums.                  As I mentioned erlier in the essay these discoveries can help us better understand where they lived and how. Like with the Incas we know that the ran the whole civilization with colored strings. Scientist are still trying to find out how but are sure that this is one of the most extraordinary ways of running a civilization.                 And last but not least they can help us better comprehend the way our body works. Like when the spaniards came to the new world and came with new various new viruses to the indians the viruses killed most of the indians this helped us by telling us that wenever we are exposed to a new virus or bacteria that our body doesn`t recognize we get very sick but with the right treatment we can be nursed back to health.                These reasons are why studying fossils and ancient artifacts is a huge benefit to cociety. In conclusion fossils should be furthered analysed for greater benefits.

Some of the artifacts found, that Incas used, was a string colored calendar, called quipus. They were used to keep control of their livestock and records. To this day, know one really knows what the colored strings mean, orhow they work. Incas made almost everything out of silver,gold, stone, or pottery, which made things last longer. Some artifacts are found buried for the dead, so it can be used in the afterlife.

Now as archeologists take a closer look inside the lives of these people, we could learn more about these people than we ever imagined we would.        First, the archaeologists climbed high up into the Rocky Mountains so that they could explore the ruins of the Inca. They found that to keep records they tied complex knots, no one know exactly what they mean though. They also found old cups, bowls and other stone or metal objects like jewelry. These findings help one to try and understand how these items were made and what they might have been used for. They also discovered bodies that are so well preserved that they could use modern medicine to figure out how that individual died.        Then, archeologists traveled to Mesa Verde, the ancient city in which the Puebloans used to exist. They found odd huts, called a pit house. These houses where supported by four corner timbers and had a fire pit with an air deflector. The people then graduated to adobe house, which were stronger. Their pottery also changed, instead of having dull gray pots, they used elaborated black and white drawings.          The archeologists then went to Greece, just off the coast to explore the sunken settlement of the Pavlopetri. It is said that the civilization sunk about five thousand years ago and no one is absolutely sure how it can to be under water. While there, archeologists explore a world of buildings, from courtyards to tombs. This city was covered in shards of broken pottery. This civilization is a wonderful mystery that no one is quite sure about, but if we keep searching we might find an even bigger surprise.        Exploring ancient civilizations like the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlovian is important because it teaches one about the history of these amazingly smart people.

The findings from the Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, give archaeologists an idea of their lives and culture.  The discoveries also show how far in relation we are with our past brethren.  Archaeological findings are doors that lead us into the past.       One civilization was the Incas.  The Incas were natives to Peru, and lived high up in the Andes Mountains.  The artifacts found have allowed us to see the Incas culture.  We learned that they worshiped many gods, practiced blood sacrifices, and had a craving in poetry.  Archaeologists have learned another civilization through the mere discoveries of artifacts.  The Incas however, are considered a lost civilization.  There demise  is apparent through the findings of a hand full of Spanish records.  The Spaniards over all led to the ending of the once great civilization.  This shows the the finally to the the Incas.       The Pavlopetri's town is what must have inspired the myth of Atlantis.  The town is submerged in the waters off the coast of southern Greece.  The city is still intact, as if it was built underwater, and artifacts still remain.  This shows how real life events can be transformed into a well known myth.  There are many theories that surround how this city came to be underwater.  The main theory seems to be that the change in water levels is what lead to the town's condition.  The Pavlopetri were a distant group that inspired the myth of Atlantis.      The Puebloans were a group of native Americans who lived in the Four Corners Region.  The civilization created well designed stone communities in which they could keep cool within their houses.  This shows the innovation within the past humans.   The Puebloan had a huge change within their lifestyle. They went from nomadic to living in small villages.   This shows the major change.       The findings from archaologists help us lead into the past.  The Incas, the Pavlopetris, and the Puebloans all consist of this group.  The inovation of our past can easily compare with the technology of today.  We can better understand the pats through the discovery of acient artifacts.

Without many of these discoveries the life we live in today would be extremely different.              Even though the Incas did not have a formal writing system or alphabet they still found different ways to live there life. They made different colored knots called quipus which recorded the calender to count all for the livestock. Archaeologist found this amazing that the huge empire the Incas lived in was organized by these color strings. Still to this day nobody has figured out what these knots mean. Many other objects where left behind such as, amazing portraits of there religion, art, arcarchitecture, agriculture, government, transportation and also their was of life. There are many different ways to find out about history but one way historians found out about the Incas history is from oral history which is stories passed down for generation to generation. The Incas story and history is an amazing thing to learn about but, they aren't the only group of people that lived around that time.             The ancient Puebloans of Mesa Verde lived 1,400 years ago before Europeans explored North America. Mesa Verde the home of the Puebloans means 'green table' in SSpanish. In 550 A.D the Puebloans where known as Basket makers because the where skilled at a variety of different crafts. This amazingly interesting group of people lived in a home called pit houses these homes featured a living room which sunk a few feet into the ground. In 750 A.D they began to build houses above ground  that had upright walls which where made of poles and mud. The Puebloans built the houses one against another in long and curving rows. They had many different skills that not everybody had.          Beneath the waters of Greece there lays a sunken settlement that inspired the fable Atlantis. Anglo a Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists known as Pavlopetri explored this settlement back 5000 years ago. The most interesting fact about this settlement is that it was a planned city filled with buildings,courtyards and streets. Not too long ago many archaeologist where finally able to explored this sunken settlement.       In conclusion, the Incas, Puebloans and the Pavlopetris had many different skills but without archaeologists finding these amazing objects our world wouldn't be the same today.

Nowadays you don't have to worry about survival that much. But back then for the ancient Inca they had to do things different ways then we do. For instance, their calendars aren't on paper, their calendars are strings that are called quipus to record the count of livestock. Some Inca textiles have been preserved over many years because the Inca lived in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts and the cold mountains of the Andes. Bu some artifacts have been taken by treasure hunters many years ago. Some treasure are still out there for archaeologists to find.Archaeologists are good at keeping records of what they find and where they can find something. Archaeologists have more of a job than just finding artifacts, but they also have to get as much evidence as they cand to get information from the artifact. They lived in houses called pithouses that later evolved into kivas. A kiva is a Hopi word for ceremonial room-- here underground cahmber comparable to later churches. Many people have also discovered the Lost Greek City. They find many artifacts that were covered by the ocean floor. Some of the settlements they found date back to 5,000 years ago. One of the sites they found is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor next to the southern Peloponnese. They also found artifacts that dated bacl to the stone ages.

One thing in common between them was they had troubles. The Inca were killed off by the Spanirds, the Puebloans ran their resources dry, and the Pavlopetri's community sank to the bottom of the ocean.There are many things we can do to prevent that from happening to us.              The Inca were attacked and killed off by the Spaniards. The passage states that the last Incan ruler was killed in 1532 by the Spaniards. In order to prevent an attack everyone needs to be prepared. The Incans left behind a lot of art and architecture, religion, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. One thing they did not leave behind were a lot of weapons.              The Puebloans used up all of the resources in the area where they were living. The passage states that they had to go to New Mexico and Arizona. They accumulated many skills and traditions, but were not conservative enough with their resources. To prevent this happening to us we need to be more conservative with our natural resources. Just planting one tree for every tree that we cut down prevents the same thing from happening to us.              The Pavlopetri's community sunk to the bottom of the ocean. People belive this was because the sea level changed, there was an earthquake, or there was a tsunami. The way to reduce the risk of an earthquake is to be careful when building a city on a fault line. The way to reduce the risk of a tsunami is to keep cities a fair distance from water. The way to reduce the risk of the water level changing is to kepp buildings near water higher up.              If we do all these things we will reduce the risk of ending up like the Inca, the Puebloans, or the Pavlopetri. These things are not very hard and can save many lives. Many People die of hunger every day. any people also die of drowning every day. Even more people die of natural disasters of all kinds every day though.

There were three different civilizations all in different part of the globe. The Inca in the Andes mountains of Peru. The Greeks in the underwater city of Atlantis.  Each very diverse.           The city of Atlantis has been a myth for as long as time has existed but with new technology they have discovered it is real. Dr Jon Henderson says 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in history.' The underwater town reveals that it was a world of tombs, buildings, courtyards, religious buildings and shards of pottery. The town also has a megaron which it was run by an elite which raised the status of the town. The town was never reoccupied so everything is untouched as if life was frozen in time preserving everything as it was thousands of years ago.       The Inca were another fascinating civilization. Located in the Andes mountains the Inca were able to preserve many of their artifacts because of the desert and the high mountain ranges of the Andes. The Spaniards eventually conquered the Inca and put out the civilization.       In conclusion their are many fascinating lost civilizations.

The Inca's history may of been confusing but it still teaches us what they did back then. Like how they used special strings to tie knots in called quipus to keep track of different things. The Spanish sent soldiers and missionaries over to study them and teach them about christianity. They wrote diaries about what they did and tried to interpret what they said in their language. Now when archaeologists try to go to the sites where are buried they have to be careful of which one they go to because some of them are robbed by looters and other people. There are still many sites that are left unharmed like the ones in the moutains where most of the bodies are well preserved and looters can't get to.        There was another civilization that is gone now but excisted. The archaeologists call them the Anasazi whis is translated from a Navajo term meaning the ancient ones. Now we just call them the Ancentral Puebloans. The first ones lived in a placed called Mesa Verde around A.D. 550. They were famous for their backetry. They were very nomadic before settling at a city they started farming more and hunting less. They also learned to make pottery and made the bow and arrow which was a better hunting tool than their atlatl or spear thrower. In two hundred years they started making their houses above ground instead under ground. These houses were usually made out of sticks and mud. Later they stopped using this method and started using masonry. They made connected houses out of stone with over 50 rooms and 3 stories. When the cowboys told some people that there were houses in the cliffs archaeologists tried to seek the answers about their lifestyles there. When they were building their houses they started using nature to their advantage and built houses in overhaning cliffs.         Finding a city underwater can be unusual but the one that can be linked to the Atlantis myth is an awesome discovery. A team of archaeologists and marine geologists started exploring the old city. One of them said that this was the oldest city ever to be sunken because the remains that date back to 2800 BC to 1200 BC. This is before the days of the famous Greece we know about. This finding finds the possible history of the Mycenaes people. The geologists haven't yet discovered why this city sank but they think it is because of a tsunami.         This is why I think that these findings are important for the world's history so we can learn more about these ancient civilization and what went on there. This also helps us learn more about the real stories behind the myths and less about the stories they tell us.

People lived in very simple house structures. Well, they were considered simple unless you were from the Inca's who had very complex structures. In Mesa Verde, adobe and mud, was used to create houses and other needed buildings. From there they went from using pole-and-adobe construction to building something somewhat similar to those of the Incas.

Mesa Verde National Park reminds us a lot about this culture. The first ancestral puebloans settled at Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithoises clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.        By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Pottery also changed, from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background.

The artifacts discovered at Inca sites are vital towards finding out the truth of our history. The resources the Incas had at their disposal, such as gold and silver, tells us how they viewed precious metals. The abundance of the metals in Inca society made them less valuable almost, and that viewpoint changes the way historians portray ancient Inca.            The Ancestral Pueblo-ans, who lived in Mesa Verde about 1,400 years ago, originally were nomads, but settled down along canyon walls for about seven centuries. Archaeologists know they flourished, due to the way the soil and ground around the abandoned homes is. The Pueblo-ans show historians how people lived, worked, and died in North America in a portion of the Four Corners.            The Pueblo-ans also resided on cliffs, and soon became known as cliff dwellers. Their advanced masonry told historians that there were some advancements in their society that we did not know were there at all. The remains of both of the Pueblo-ans dwellings exhibit their way for life, the resources they used, how they used those resources, advantages to their territory, and disadvantages to their homes.            Once the lost Greek city of Pavlopetri was found off the coast of southern Greece, archaeologists were all over it, claiming it to be the largest planned submerged city to be discovered so far. The artifacts found on this huge, sunken site are important for our search for the truth. It not only raises more questions on the myth of Atlantis, but it also answers a few too. Archaeologists have been able to date Pavlopetri back to around the time Plato described Atlantis, and the architecture and advancement in buildings and artifacts fits in almost perfectly with Plato's observations of the fabled Atlantis. Some wonder if Pavlopetri is actually the sunken city Plato was referring to, and if it is, what happened? Once again, our natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge takes over and we must know what actually went down at that time in history.           Human beings have a natural hunger for knowledge, and knowing how things happened, why they happened, when the happened, and who they happened to in the past has lead the way for our brains and instincts to find the answers. the discoveries made in the ruins of ancient Inca, the remains of an abandoned civilization in Mesa Verde, and the subterranean mystery in southern Greece all contribute to our understanding of the past and, in some ways, our future.

These civilizations have left clues that have led historians and archeologists to piece together the lifestyles of these three ancient societies.             The ancient Incas had no formal writing system which made it quite difficult for archeologists to study.  Still, archeologists  were able to learn about their culture through the artifacts found such as textiles and clothing that have survived for the long lengths of time. To learn as much information as they do, they need to keep careful records.  To learn more information,  archeologists can compare with other scientists and come up with an explanation.  It is important for scientists to study the history of this civilization so our society can learn from it and not repeat it.            Discoveries from the first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde make it possible to improve our society's skill and craftsmanship.    Archeologists have learned much about their tools and livelihood.  Production factories can make improvements of these tools and therefore advance in technology.             The secrets of the lost city of Atlantis has allowed scientists to research the field of natural disaster and Earth's movement. The myths of the city have sparked archeologist's interest and now they have been able to research the sunken settlement and find that it was once possibly a lively city.  This extraordinary myth has been able to keep underwater exploration going and has given archeologists the opportunity to survey the rest of the ocean floor.           The findings of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have been so important as to exploring the old civilizations and improving new ones.  Archeologists have reasearched artifacts, structures, and stories that allow us citizens to think of our daily lives and work to advance in society.

Through many researches, there are still following discoveries of the past that give a huge impact to the present of today. Like for example, three discoveries that were important was the lifestyle of the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. During their time, there were truely remarkable artifacts that were created and unknown items that some scientists just cannot seem to figure out. In other words, as many people seeked more into the facts they soon discovered a whole lot more to it.   In Source #1, the first lifespan that effected our present today was the civilizations of the Incas. During the Inca past time, it was very much important to learn more about their survival skills. One reason is because the Incas lived in a type of climate that was atleast below room temperature and that there was not that much food on the mountains. Another interesting fact on why they were so important is the way the Incas had left behind several pottery made out of silver or gold. Not only did their artifacts gave the humans something to learn more about, but it got more humans involved in the Inca's past.   Then in Source #2, a second civilization that effected the present was the Puebloans. For example, the Puebloans brought a lot of change to our land by creating beautiful baskets as they were mostly known as Basketmakers. Even though they were skilled craft makers, they would usually farm instead of hunting or gathering like most other culturals did. Mostly the real interesting thing they did was build small houses called kivas. Soon their culture impacted greatly on us, but not like the Pavlopetri have.   At last, a final group that influenced out time period is still the Pavlopetri. The Pavlopetri were a group of researchers that wanted to be more fascinated with the lost city of Atlantis. In other words, Atlantis was a city that sunk under the ocean which was told by legend. From that point, people believed that Atlantis could have been a city as more clues were found when some divers found left behind pottery or other artifacts. Next thing, people start commenting about how Atlantis was either sunked by an earthquake or tsunami. Soon, there was not enough facts to prove that Atlantis was real, but it still remains a legend.   After detailing every fact, it is to now on know there were some very important discoveries that not many people get in to. While people out in the world are just minding their own thing, they do not stop and realize how interesting it would be to know what theses discoveries were. As time goes by, more people will soon see the beauty of what the past could be as they listen to hear the most various stories they have ever heard in their life. So the discoveries that involved the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are just as much important than ignoring the looks of it all. Without these discoveries, there would not be as much for the world to talk about.

This caused for a lot of accidents and mistakes since no one could communicate with each other.            Because they had no system of writing or alphabet the people really did not know the things that surrounded them. They saw the world around them but never knew what they were, this made the people always curious of everything they saw and that is why they tried everything around them.             In addition they had no language which made it difficult to communicate with their freinds or family. Imagine how mad and frustrated you would be trying to talk to your parents or best friends and they couldn't understand what you were trying to say. I know i would get really mad.

Another ancient historic event was in Mesa Verde which for the past 700 years they flourished here and built stone comminuties in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls and then later in the generation they moved away.

Throughout history there have been unknown civilizations that haven't been found yet. That is why lost civilizations are an important key in figuring out about our past. They have helped us figure out how and where these people lived, how they kept historical records,and what type of advances they had during their time period.          One important discovery about the lost civilization of the Inca,Puebloans,and Pavlopetir was where and how they lived. These civilization helped archaeologist find out what types of locations they lived in and how they adapted to the environments. For instance, the Inca lived in the high Andes, the Puebloans lived pueblos(villages) in the dester or cliffs, while the Pavlopetir live near southern Greece. These civilizations would have not been found if people had not left any evidence of historical references.          The second wave of discovery from the three civilization were historical records. Without these artifacts, archaeologist would not be able of find bigger discoveries within the civilization. For example the Spaniards that had vistied the Inca wrote down what they seen or heard in their time with the Inca.As for the Puebloans, they had knotted stings that held record keeping, and or certain events, while the Pavlopetir had ruins that held artifacts that helped prove their new advancements during that time period.           Another important discovery about these civilization was that they had an advancement in technology. For example the Inca used materials that would last for a long time, up untill today. While the Inca had lasting materials, the Puebloans had a new advancement in their way of living, such as creating new homes that would be away from danger. Although they all have an amazing advancement, the pavlopetir civilization had a great advancement in their city.           although lost civilizations may be boring, they can tell us about their way of living, historical events, or maybe even their new way of making daily lives better.

We learned many thing about the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetris by observing everything we find at the sites their town/ cities were at.       In the Incas sites, they did not have any formal alphabet or writing system. 'Some of what we know about the Incas comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation.' Most of the Inca stories were just mythes or legends rather than history. Still, the historians had to be cafeful when they interpret these accounts because the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. 'The rest of our knowledge of the Incas comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found.' Their artifacts were made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Archaeologists use some advanced techniques to discover more about the Incas. 'You'll see how aerial photography can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they cannot see from the ground.' Looters cannot reach some of the sites because they are in high, remote places which helps preserve the sites. That only makes it harder for the archaeologist to his/her job of find information or more artifacts for reseaches. Inca was a great discovory, but there may have been a few bumpy path that led to its discovery.       A group of people, Puebloans,but archeologists call them Anasazi, who lived on North America about 1,400 years ago before Europeans explored it about. They first settled ther about A.D. 550. They were known for their skills of basket making so they were called Basketmakers. They began to make houses with straight walls made out of poles and mud, but instead of in cliff recesses, the house were above ground. ' From here on, these people are know as Puebloans, a spanish worn meaning 'village dwellers'.'They started to advance instead of making pole and adobe construction; they started to do skillful masonry which were walls of thivk, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high. The population reached up to several thousand during the Classic Period which was between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300. ' Baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to craft.' People began to move back in to the cliffs for some unknown reason. Many archeologists thought maybe it was for defense or a religious or psychological reasons. The structures in the cliffs sre evidence of a society that accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. 'By the Classic Period (A.D. 1100 to A.D. 1300), Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America. The findings of the Puebloans was a amazing discovery.       'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths  - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' An Anglo-greek team of archaeologists and amrine geologists explored Pavlopetri, the suken settlement that dated back some 5,000 years ago.The 30,000 square meters site is believed to have been swallowed by the sea around 1,000 BC. It was discovered by the Britian first, in 2009 the marine archaeologists were able to reach to site, but wuth the help of technology. ''We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1.200 years earlier than originally thought,'' Marine geologists still do not know what the cause was that sank the settlement to the ocean floor. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going,'. Atlantis was the most greatest discovers because it keeped the underwater exploration going and it proved one of the myth about Atlantis true.       All of these discoveries were amazing with the Puebloans and why they went back into there cliff and the Incas and the Pavlopetri and why their city sank. These are all good question, but they are not answered yet because the marine geologist and archaeologists still have not figured them out and are pondering just like we are.

Since they had no formal alphabet or system of writing they had created the quipus in which had the records of calenders and even livestock.

An archaeolgists  job is very hard that means you have to study a lot and have to carry all their stuff that they pack to head out and discrover about our great ancient civilzations that make our world history.

Mesa Verde long ago more than 700 years a group of europeans explored this spectacular park  the people who lived their were know as the basketmakers for the skill in craft they also built the pithouse it is made of mud and sticks it has a living room that sunk a few feet in the ground.

Each piece of evidence fitting into the puzzle. Their discoveries have led them to theories about the civilizations that thrived thousands of years before them.          Each artifact has helped archeologists figure out partly what was happening during those years in our history. Some quipus that were found have led them to think that the knotted string was used for counting something, perhaps livestock,or was used as a calendar. Some artifacts were oral, such as stories and legends that were passed down from generation to generation.Some stories were passed down by being written.They were written down by the Europeans who arrivedin the empire in 1532. Things like that can suggest that the Inca were friends with Europeans.          Archeologists have found some of the early Puebloans' pithouses, their homes. They were known as great basketmakers. Maybe that skill got them making their own homes out of straw. As they learned to make pottery, and learned about the bow and arrow, they made a better weapon for hunting. As the Puebloans learned to build, they started making their homes from poles that stood upright and mud. Later on, some stone homes were found suggesting that the were advancing in technology. It also shows that they were constantly finding something better to make their homes out of.          The lost city of atlantis has been found. Since it was found beneath the waters of southern Greece, archeologists have inferred that the city, when still up, was near southern Greece. The sunken civilization dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. Their are some remains that date from 2800 to 1200 BC. Archeologists have also found that some ceramics date back to the end of the stone age. It suggests that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago. The lost city of Atlantis is definitely one of the most interesting underwater ruins yet.            Of all the artifacts and ruins mentioned in the text above, the lost city of Atlantis is a favorite for archeologists.

We are grateful for many of the ancient civilizations that have provided us with advice on many different topics but especially on survival. A few of those civilizations such as the Inca, Pueblo and the Pavlopetri, have left many important artifacts from their time behind. These artifacts were very important had have helped or modern society to this day.           For example, The Inca discovered way to survive in the wilderness of modern-day Peru by using nature's materials. They used the quipus ( a string with many knots in it) as a tool to pass messages, record livestock and create a calendar. The quipus was very efficient because they had a very big empire and had to control everyone in it. there was only one capitol and one king but many Incas held a big part in their way of life. They had a very big messenger system that was soon developed using quipus. They used this system to pass quick messages from one end of the empire to the next especially if it was a decree from the king. This system has now led to what we used to call the Pony Express which was postal mail and served exactly like the quipus. This then led to email and text messages that wee use today. If this discovery was made the mail would have taken a long to time be made and now we know the origin of this idea.             Another civilization called the Pueblo were also very important. Their way of living centered on hunting and gathering but they soon started to farm. They had made weapons such as the bow and arrow and spear that have been improved over the years. We don't use weapons like those anymore but in the past wars, they were highly appreciated by soldiers. The were mainly known for their homes, though. Their houses were built of red clay and structured in an organized way. they lived in villages or on cliffs. These architectural structures were beautiful to look at and provided archaeologists with information about the way Pueblos lived. We sometimes build our homes with the same or kind of the material they had. The structure of their homes were so complex that we use the same ones sometimes for own. The Pueblos showed us architecture the nature shows it to us.             The last civilization is a mystery, the underwater civilization of Atlantis. The Pavlopetri found pottery and architectural structures of what seemed like a community that was built underwater. Even though not a lot of information has been found about Atlantis, the sudden discovery of an underwater city build curiosity which keeps up underwater exploration. Through this, we might not find anything about Atlantis but we might know more about the deep blue sea. As we try to keep searching, we have known more things about the sea than we have known before.               All of these ancient civilizations and many more have provided us with history of the past. We have learned from that history and continue to learn, so the many discoveries that were found about each civilization are very important and we should be proud of the archaeologists that use their time to dig up the past and learn from it.

By studying ancient artifacts, archaeologists have discovered signs of ancient civilizations. Three major discoveries by paleontologists are the Incas, Puebloans, and the lost Greek city.             The Inca civilization lasted from 1438-1532. The Incas lived in Peru and had no formal alphabet or writing system. The only way we reason we know of their existence is through artifacts and oral history. Archaeologists can piece together details of Inca life by  studying the Inca artifacts left behind. The Inca civilization isn't the only civilization historians know about.            The ancient Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago. They were formerly nomadic, but they began a settled life. Their old hunting and gathering ways were replaced by farming. They lived for more than 700 years in Mesa Verde.  They are known for their skill at the craft of basket making. For an unknown reason, they migrated to cliff alcoves.            Beneath the waters off southern Greece, divers discovered a sunken settlement. The settlement dates back about 5,000 years ago in Homer's heroes time. According to Dr. Jon Henderson, this is the oldest submerged town in the world. The site is 30,000 square meters large, and it is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Many theories of how the city sunk include sea level changes, tsunami, and ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes.             Archaeologists have discovered many artifacts of Earth's past, but there are still numerous more things to be found. For example, less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. The Incas, Puebloans, and the lost Greek city are only a few discoveries in the large Earth.

They didn't really care if future historians and archaelogists found their ruins. What mattered to them was the state of the empire, and what they could do to benefit it.

There are lots of differant objects that the archaeologists such as textiles, pottery, gold, and silver. The Incas were one of the three tribes were talked about in the passage.             The Incas were a Peruvian Empire that ruled for almost one hundred years. Archaeologists have found many differant artifacts on Incan land. one artifact that was found was pieces of string with knots in them. the only thing that archaeologists cant tell about these is that the were most likely to have been used for keeping track of the quantity of things like crops. This would have been important for daily incan life. Another tribe talked about in the article were the Puebloans.             The Puebloans were a group of people who lived in Mesa Verde. They were farmers who lived in small homes known as Pithouses. A major population shift showed that some of the Puebloans beganm to move back to the cliff alcoves. archaeologist dont know the reason for this move. the only thing that they can say for sure is that it had a large impact on the life of the Puebloans.The lat tribe talked about were the Pavlopetri.

There would be no history. We would have no way of life. I think that the discoveries of our ancestors/Native American tribes is important because, it teaches us about what people did before cell phones or any electronics, it gives Americans a history or a past, and it also teach us lessons.           First reason i think the discoveries of our native american or ancestors way of living is important is because, it shows us what people did before cell phones or any electronics. The native Americans didnt have calculators or a phone to see how much they had farmed or shot this week they had to record it somehow on 'strings.' Still today no one knows how to read these 'strings'. The strings back  then were called ''Quipus''. The strings they used were very colorful. Also they were filled with knots that no one knows what for though. Uncovering what these Quipus really mean is an ancient incan mystery.       The second reason i think that this is important is, because it gives americans history or a past. Americans need a history to build on. our ancestors are like the backbone of the U.S.. If there were no ancestors, there would be no backbone, no way of life, or anything. Our past is one of the things we can fall back on when everything else is gone. we were known for the Cherokee who were strong warriors. There would be no sence or intimidation in our wars now if it wasnt for them. There would be no spirit or patriotism in wars today. There would be no support for our troops. We would have no style in how we fight our wars.       The third reason i think its important is because it teaches us lessons. They messed up a few times and we can learn from that. People learn from other peoples mistakes. That can teach us a lesson in dily life too.The ancestors were verry spiritual, we could be as enthusiastic as them. they were also good with making supplies with what they had. we could learn alot.

When they discover all materials and objects of that place they go back to tell others just so that other people are able to know.                 The discoveries in Inca was so important because it helps people understand what life had been like for the people who lived there. Many wanted to find out what the people in Inca talked because everything was in a knot. Then, they went to discover many things such as civilization and different types of artifacts they had. Many learned about how life was like dealing with the environment people lived in Inca.                Most of the information they give in Pueblo-ans is about the ancestor time for many people. They give information about the tasks that the people in Puebloans did just to make it through life. Many of the are learning so must information about the past which many have discovered. They find many objects that they think are interesting and record it just so they could bring it back to show off their discover. Then that makes many people want to then go out to discover about that place like everyone else have. It also gives off information that people could learn more about Puebloan and how they lived to survive.               In Pavlopetri is mostly about the findings of myths that people believed in at this time. They gave a myth that was called the lost world,so many archaeologist wanted to go out and discover this to see if it was true. Many of them found so must important information on the things they had found underground. It gave most people an idea of how people lived back when they all were alive. They found new findings that could be worth something in this generation and new buildings that we may not believed was here.

It gives us background information on the things we should know about many different places. Having many people like archaeologist could help us learn more about all types of places because that's how they spend mostly of there time doing. Not only that many of those archaeologist could become famous for the findings they have and not only that they give us artifacts that we are able to learn a lot more from.

Archaeologists have been studying how Inca and Puebloans have been discovered from different clues left behind and different kinds of research.  Inca left clues about their art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Puebloans have been famous for their skill at the craft, they were known as Basketmakers.           Ancient Inca used quipus to record calendars to keep a count of livestock.  The world know some stories about Inca from the passing of stories from generation to generation and also because of the old stories written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.  Inca artifacts have been discovered from the ruins of buildings and others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.  Inca textiles and clothing have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.  The Inca sites were disturbed by looters or treasure hunter, who take anything that might be valuable.          Puebloans were also called Anasazi also known as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'.  Like most civilizations, hunting and gathering were their main livelihood until it got replaced with farming.  Puebloans lived in pit houses that were usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. Pithouses didn't last long until A.D. 750 that evolved into kivas.  Puebloans use of baskets declined because of the widespread use of pottery.  A major population shift was when the people began to move back into the cliff alcoves.  Kivas were used for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop.  Mesa Verde was deserted due to drought and crop failures.  Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.          Archaeologists studied these ancient civilizations not only for the enjoyment, but for the history of it.  Today we the people would know nothing about our the past life of how people lived without all this technology and advancement.

The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri have been very beneficial towards how to we have certain objects. The Inca had used different ways to keep track of the days and livestock like quipus (colored string). There has also their records has to us about their enviroment they were in during that time. They do this through stones, pottery, and other artifacts. The Ancestral Puebloans were specially known for their crafting skill. They made pithouses and the bow and arrow which was more advanced than the weapon before it the atlatl. They started to evolve and using stone instead of sticks. The Pavlopetri is known as the most planned town that was sunken to the bottom of the sea. There are other places that are older but not as planned as this.

We learned of the type of clothing they wore, what food they ate, and where they lived. Using the knowledge we can figure out what was the lifestyle of the Inca was liek before the Spanish invaded.  Most of what we knwo about the Inca we had learned from spanish accounts as the Inca had no written language and kept track of all their data using colored strings alled quipis.

The spainish were not highly interested in the mexicans culture and mainly just killed them off for their riches.    The ancient civilizations were, however, very interesting. They had made giant temples -for worshipping and giving sacrifices- that were made from perfectly square blocks. The tools theywould have needed for this were not have thought to have been made untill much later. They also had the first recordkeeping system of theirtime time, called the quipus, which used strings for recording.       They were masters of pottery and aiculture. The had made irrigation systems, that were ALSO very advanced. They left behind many artifacts that had been preserved by the damp soil. From these artifacts we have learned that they also had lots of plates bowls and gold. Yes gold.    Now you see that they were very advanced for there time.

The question is: are these artifacts going to be put together and fit to be studied?        In an article from the 'National Geographic', they explaint the Inca and where they lived. Also, in the article, they explain how artifacts can find inscriptions that aren't accurate or find cloth that is destroyed by dampness. Remember these artifacts have been there since possible 1000 years ago, probably longer than that.        Another example is from an article be 'National Parks', the article explains that there were a group of people called 'Puebloans'. These people settled in Mesa Verde, Spanish for green table.

The ancient empire of the Incas ruled for almost one-hundred years, but was then overthrown by the Spaniards. The origin of the Incas is completely unknown. Along with where they came from, their daily lifestyles are also not known well. What we know the most about is their stories, tools, and how they were overthrown. When archaeologists found the remains of an ancient Inca civilization, some new things were learned. They had worshiped some of the mountain peaks around them and they found what is called a quipus. It was used to keep track of days and many other things.           An ancient people known as Ancestral Puebloans inhabited an area called Mesa Verde. They had lived there for more than seven-hundred years then left everything they had and moved somewhere else. Where and why they moved is still unknown to archaeologists, but because they left all of their belongings behind, they could still learn about how they lived. They were mostly farmers but they would also hunt. The main weapon they used was the bow and arrow, which was more efficient than the atlatl, a spear thrower. The first lived in dug-out houses but then eventually moved to the cliffs. They only lived in cliffs for about one-hundred years before they disappeared. The only reason that archaeologists think that these people left is because there was a drought at about the same time.            In southern Greece, archaeologists found a sunken settlement that dates back about five-thousand years. It is the oldest submerged town in the world. How this settlement sank is still not known but  it is assumed that it is because of either sea level changes, ground subsidence or both. This settlement is thought to be the one that inspired the Atlantis myth. Not all of it has been searched yet, but entire buildings and courtyards have been discovered.            All of these discoveries are important to history. They give us insight to many ancient civilizations. We learn about the past about the people before us and where some of the myths and legends may have come from.

It's important to find many old things about ancent histories. It's exciting too to find out what hey really mean, and it isn't always easy finding out what they mean.The ancient Inca is about the alphabet of writing. They created a different way of writing and letters than we do today. That's how the alphabet became started in our world. The Inca made knots in colored strings and they were called quipus. They recored calanders to keep the counts of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed they could use strings to keep a calander of livestocks or records. Arechaeologists found the quipus. Which are the calanders they kept. No one today can read the colorful strings, so it's hard to find out what they meant back in the long ago past.       Most people don't know about the civilization back then, but that's what scientists and arcaeologists do. They discover where it came from and what it means. 1438-1532 ruled a South American empire that rivaled the ancient Rome. Clues were left behing by Inca froma portriat fromtheir living. The had a portrait from thier religion, art, and especially argicultutre. They were great at argicultutre back then. They kept their livestock well and had plenty of food from farms. By studying all these clues arcaeologists can put together details of the Inca lifestyles.       Some of what people know came from histories form the Inca. That was passed on from generations. Passing on these stories was important to have the community's history. We know some of the old stories from the Europeans. They written them down to be shared in the future. They also described the Inca in their diaries, and letters. Legends also tell what happened in the civilzation.The rest of the knowledge of  Inca came from artifacts that most likley may not be as true as the real stories from thier past.       The arceaologists also found out ways from their past by finding graves and their bodies to test to see what mgiht of lived back then. And what kind of clothing they wore. Some of their clothing has survived damanging weather. They still have peices of textile left that has also survived many things. More than just drawings has survived form the civilization.       Some Inca sites have been bothered by treasure hunters. They take anything they see that could be cherished for a long time, or something that is very strongly rich in their life. Arcaeologists protect them from finding something the might need to find out more about the Inca past. They carefully dig them up with out riping or tearing it. Whatever they find would be worth so much. They find anything form the past and report it to scientists who study on it and make a very well inference on whatis was or what it was used for.       The Inca lived in high mountains in the Andes. In fact, they may have worshiped the mountain peaks. The Andes mounains makes it harder on the arcaaeologists because it's such a highelevation sometmes they need to use oxogeyn for finding out about their past.       Puebloans are important to our history too. They first setteled down in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550 years ago. They are know to make baskets, that is thier skill of craft. They replaced hunting for farming and gathering. They lived in Pithouses which are small houses they would call them, but it looked more like a tipee. Pithouses sunk in to the gournd,a nd they had a living room and a small kithchen for cooking and eating food.They aslo learned how to make pottery and make bowls and arrows for hunting including spears too.       Their popoullation muliplied after A.D. 750. Then they began buliding housese above ground, with walls mad of poles and mud. The made many houses rowing against each other and going down curving along the road. They soon had stone walls as their protection of their house. They also made pottery out of stone.       These people all had an interesting past that scientists and arcaeologists had discovered. Some not yet. They take whatever they find and make it into a reasonable explenation on the civilitzation. The past they found out about has a lot more to it than this, but they will keep making new discoveries for the agriculture, livestock, farming, living, social, and religious views from these old civilizations.

Researchers have searched near and far for these answers and now they have the answers.       Despite the fact that the Incans were generally less integent than us modern day humans, they had complex and amazing ways of doing things. They yse a quipus, which were colored knots made into a calender to keep track of livestock. But researchers don't know what the knots were for. Cool right?       Puebloans of Mesa Verde went from pithouses to caves. Why? Archaeologists think it's something that is pychological and might have to do with conditions of the elements and weather.

All ancient civilizations that, believe it or not, have shaped our world to this day. As we keep discovering artifacts and information about these civilizations, we are able to further understand how they have effected are lives and why they are no longer with us.   To start off, the Inca tribe was a civilization for nearly a hundred years (1438-1532) that ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expansion of ancient Rome. Today we have been able to find artifacts, items that these people have left behind, to piece together a grand picture of the Inca religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. We can also thank the art of story telling for what we know today about this civilization. Stories passed down from generation to generation were an important way to preserve history back then. 'We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.' A quote from Beth Bruber's Acient Inca: Archaeology unlocks the Secrets of the Past. Bruber also states that 'the most importnat things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.' The fall of the Inca tribe was due to the Spaniards murdering the last Inca king in 1532 and taking over the empire. To find out the origin of the Inca, archaeologists use some of the most advanced technigues in the world. Using aerial photography can help them see things such as patterns in ancient monuments,that they cannot see from the ground. This is also a good technique becuase the Inca lived high up in the Andes mountains, making the job of a archarologist much more difficult. From the Inca civilization we are even able to see bodies and learn about how these people lived, and how they died.   Now moving on to the Puebloans. About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the Four Corners  region chose Mesa Verde as their home. For over 700 years these people flourished here, eventually building elaborate communities, but then in the late A.D 1200s, generations left and moved away. Today Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. From the first being known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft to the ancestral Puebloans being kniown as cliff dwellers, as that is where they lived. Through drout and crop failures,socail and political probllems, the people simply wanted to look for new opportunities elssewhere. Today we still do not know the exact story of these people, but 'whatever may have happened,some of today's Pueblo people,andmaybe other tribes, aredescendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.' a quote from Roy Anderson's Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World.    Finally the Lost Greek city. Could this be the city that may have unspired the Atlantis myth? Beneath the water off sourthern Greece there is a site of sunken settlement covering 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. only this year were marine archaeologists able to properly ssurvey the ruins with digital technology. it revealed a wrold of buildings, courtyeards,main streets, rock-cut tombs,and religious stuctures. These artifacts opened up a whole other world of exploration. We could now see this once prospering city come to life again. Marine geologists have yet to work out why this settlement sank. ''It is signifact because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied.'' said elias spondylis, co-directer of the surveyand head of Greece'sunderwater antiquities department. Although there is much more to be found under the water this represents a frozen moment of the past.   Overall, all three of these civilizations that once propered as we do today are very important as each and everyday we are able to extend our knowledge with knew artifacts and information. should we be questioning our fate? what will happen to our mondern world civilization? Is it already crumbling beneath our feet?

All of the items found is history. Archeologists examine these and see what they were used for, what religion they practiced, how their government worked, what clothes they wore, and what foods they ate.

They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on Mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. These were fairly prosperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud.

Through discoveries ranging from ceramic pots to sunken cities, we have obtained the knowledge needed to describe these groups.       The Inca had no formal alphabet or writing systems, so how do we know what we know? They left behind clues. Portraits were left behind by the Inca showed of their religion, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Oral stories have also been passed down from generation to generation, preserving a community's culture.   Stories written by early Europeans have also been found. Inca textile and clothing survived remarkably as well, thanks to the Peru's dry deserts.       About 1,400 years ago, the civilization know as the Puebloans chose Mesa Verde as their home. The first Puebloans were leading a 'more settled way of life'. Their first homes, pithouses, were shelters containing a firepit with air deflector, an antechamber containing storage bins or pits, and an entrance the home located at the top. Many of the Puebloans were skilled a weaving baskets and other useful items. By A.D. 1000, these people had advanced from basic construction to skillful stone masonry.       The myth of the Greek city, Atlantis, has been told many times over the years, but all it is is a myth. Marine geologists have used the information, however, to learn about and discover a sunken city. Off the coast of the Greek city Neapolis, the submerged city was discovered and its roots were amazingly traced back to some 1,200 years ago. Ceramic were found dating back to the stone age.

We know that as they went on that they changed how they lived, but at a time went back to how their ancestors lived. These are very important because it shows how they evolved and how they still kept a hold to their ancestors life's.            Lastly, let's take a look at the Pavlopetri. Archaeologists found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. This in itself is an amazing finding because this suggested that it was occupied around 5,000 years ago. This was amazing because this was 1,200 years earlier than what they thought!           So as you can see, the findings of archaeologists are not just something you can look past.

Incas believed in many traditions;they killed their pets and buried as mummys too cary them on in after life. They had many other different arrivals in the empire,some of their visitors were spanish soldiers and priest. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. They did not speak Inca language well. They didnt really understand what the Inca told them. The rest of the Inca comes from artifacts anf the things they left behind.   Almost 1,400 years ago,before European discovered North America, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. More then 700 years they lived here and they started building homes and making pottery out of stones. After the late A.D. 1200s, the Europeans left their homes looking for food and a new homes. Way before they left they were known as the Basketmakers for the things they build and made. Later they started to settele here,making a settled easier life.They build Pithouses clustered into small villiages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. The Europeans latered learned how to make bow and arrows,their weapons too kill animals for food and clothing. Thats then later the Europeans populations started to increase so they started killing more animals,their food moved so the Europeans followed their.Leading them to find North America.   The secrets of the lost city Atlantis, this was one of the worlds inspired enduring myths.Atlanntis was a city that had wealth for people and thats when Europeans started traveling to Atlantis.This is what many people believed, but then the city sunk under the sea.THE OCEAN FLOOR. This famous city was discovered by a British underwater photographer 40 years ago. It had revealed a world of buildings,courtyards,main streets,rock-cut tombs and religous structures.The ocean floor was also half covered with thousands of pottery,so this lead to the city of Atlantis   Imagine with out finding none of these results we probaly wont know about the alphabet or calender,also pottery;like what we use today glass bowls.This will also probaly effect our history,we wont know nothing about these things.

The Incas are from Peru and they had no formal alphabet or system of writing. The Inca mad knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed thay they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone being able to read the knots the Incas is more like a big mystery.             Many people find lost ruins fascinating. The fact that the ruins are really old many people wanna exlpore how the Inca lived. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. The visitors who met the Inca were Spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts that were left behind by the Inca. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniard's accounts of the Inca. Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.             About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops.             These were fairly prosperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. About A.D. 750 they began building their own houses above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. The people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Pottery also changed, from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before. About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before.              The Cliff Dwellers is next on my list. Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1800s, archaeologists have sought to understand these people's lives. We will never know the whole story: they left no written records and much that was important in their lives has perished. Yet for all their silence, these structures speak with a certain eloquence. The structures are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. Based on modern Pueblo practice, Ancestral Puebloans may have used kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. Kivas were gathering places and sometimes also places to weave. Pilasters supported a beam-and- mud roof. Entry was by ladder through a hole in the center of the roof.               Using nature to advantage, Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction material was sandstone thay they shaped into rectangualar blocks about the size of a loaf of bread. The motar between the blocks was a mix of mud and water. Rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, space enough for two or three persons. Isolated rooms in the rear and on the upper levels were generally used for storing crops. Underground kivas, ceremonial chambers, were built in front of the rooms. The kiva roofs created open courtyards where many daily routines took place. Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. Several theories offer reasons for their migration. We know that the last quarter of the A.D. 1200s saw drought and crop failures but these people had survived earlier droughts. Maybe after hundreds of years of intensive use the land and its resources soils, forests, and animals were depleted. Perhaps there were social and political probles, and the people simply looked for new opportunities elsewhere.                A diver explores the sunken settlement beneath the waters of southern Greece. The diver is exploring a myth called Atlantis. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most largest search. The sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of  Homer's heroes. There is no doubt that Atlantis is the oldest submerged town in the world. The remains are from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. There are other sunken sites in the world but this one seems to be one of the biggest of all time. Atlantis is unique than other sites because its considered to be planned towns. This myth lays about 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese.               What they found in the ruins surpassed all expectations. It revealed a world of  buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. It was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. During this operation they also revealed over 9,000 square meters of  new buildings. More than any underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. Elia Spondylis co-directed the survey as the head of Greece's underwater antiquities department. Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. As the world's oldest submerged city it is truly amazing. It not only shows how people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists.              Locals in the nearby town of Neapolis are delighted. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.

Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.Nearly a hunderd years (1432-1532) ruled a south american empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient rome. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life.We know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. We know some old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were spanish solders and preiest they described the Inca in letters and diaries.Some of the Inca stories were lengends rather than history. As in many ancient civilization,Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone pottery, gold, and silver. some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today.The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.The origins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived  had long been inhabited by diffrent peoples.The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshipped some mountain peak. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, on mountain tops. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountains for study. The cold mountains act like giant freezer.

The way they lived inspires many archeologist today, the way they lived, ate, survived, and got there resources.   For many people that doesn't mean much but others would pay a fortune to go to the Andes mountains and see the Incas artifacts. in  other words many archeologist find it fascinating how the Incas would keep track of weather. The Incas had a colored string called quipus and where used to record the calendar and keep a count of the livestock. Europeans had come into this country at the time of the Incas and they were surprised that such a powerful Empire was run by colored strings to keep records.

Then their were cliff dwellers a local cowboy first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, archeologists have sought to understand these people's lives.   Sadly decades of excavation, analysis, classification, and comparison, and scientific knowledge remains sketchy. The reason why scientist find it so hard its because the cliff dweller left no written records and everything that was important in their live perished.

The article lost civilizations is about the Incas, pueblos, and the Greeks.the Incas were so important because they had no formal alphabetic or system of writing. they did not leave archives for historians to study. the Inca had different ways that hey communicated, and only the people that were part of their tribe could figure it out. they made knots in colored strings called quips to record cleaner to keep a count of livestock. since then many or all have died and archaeologists have found many of the quips but cant find anybody who can read the stories that are tied into the colorful strings. civilization lasted from (1438-1532). civilization ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. some clues that were left behind when the Incas died were art, religion, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. since the Incas didn't leave much behind, and the things they did leave Americans couldn't read the archaeologists finds out information from the Incas by their oral history and stories that were passed down from generation to generation. since the Incas spoke in different languages the Europeans had came and written down some of their stories. the visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. they wrote down the Incas description in letters and diaries. the Spaniards did not speak Inca language well and some descriptions may have been inaccurate but they tried their best. another way they found out the Incas way of live is by their artifacts or objects they left behind. some artifacts they they mostly found was gold, silver, stone, or pottery. the Spaniards had murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.the Incas lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. some Incas were buried in caves in cliff faces. or on mountain tops.       the second article ( Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebla and Their World)   this article is about a group of people living in the Four Corners region in Mesa Verde about 1,400 years ago before the Europeans had even explored North America. more than 700 years them and their descendants lived and flourished there. in the late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved away. Archaeologists have called those people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as the ' ancient ones ' or'ancient enemies '. the first ancestral Pueblos settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. they were known as the basket makers. for their skills at crafts. farming replaced hunting. they lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on top of mesa tops but sometimes in cliffs. they learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a better weapon for hunting than spear thrower. by A.D. 1000 people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole- and - adobe construction to very skillful stone masonry, pottery also changed, and farming. between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 during the classic period the population may have reached several thousand. people mostly lived in compact villages of many rooms often with eh kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. ( kiva- church or ceremonial room). fires were built in the summer mainly for cooking. in winter when the rooms were damp and uncomfortable people burned fires throughout the village. the smoke blackened walls and ceilings are reminders of how cold it was for several months a year.               the third article   ( lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secret)   this article is about a diver who has discovered an sunken settlement beneath the waters of southern Greece. the sunken settlement date was back some 5000 years ago, to the time of homers heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. archaeologists say that it is the oldest submerged town in the world. it has remains from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the days of classical Greece. it straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, and it is believed to be consumed by the sea around `1000 BC. under the shifting sands and the settlements enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock- cut tombs, and religious structures. the archaeologists revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. but what surprised the archaeologists the most was the discovery of possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, which also suggests that the town had been used by an elite. ( a person of high authority). marine geologists have yet to find out the reason why the settlement sank. they believe that it could've been cause by sea level changes, ground subsidence, earthquake, or tsunami. the settlement is now known as the worlds oldest submerged city.

Archaeologists have made many important discoveries about these ancient discoveries. They have found evidence in Peru, Mesa Verde, and beneath the waters off southern Greece. Finding these artifacts are very important to finding about our past.              The Inca lived in Peru. They had a prosperous land until the Spanish came and conquered them. Because of the Spanish conquering the Inca, we know little about this lost civilization. It is very hard to learn the Inca's ways because they had no formal writing system. They made knots in colored strings called quipas to keep count of livestock  and to record a calender. No one knows what these knots mean so it is hard to learn about this lost city. Much of what the Spanish recorded could be inaccurate. Archaeologists have found many artifacts but a lot of the artifacts have been looted. We don't know much about the Inca, but over time we will find out more about this lost civilization.              A group known as the Ancestral Puebloans settled in a place called Mesa Verde. They lived in Mesa Verde for 700 years. They are known as Basketmakers because they were very skilled at it. They farmed and settled in pithouses. As time went on their population rose. Because of the population rose they moved into the cliff alcoves. Nobody knows why they moved and hopefully archaeologists find out in the future.             Alantis was a city in southern Greece that disapered underwater. This inspired one of the largest myths. The ocean has presereved many artifacts that we have today.

What they have discoverd in the Inca are every many things. Like they did not have a aphelbet so they dident have a way of writing either. So when the Spaniards came over they translated what they were saying (or the best they could) and wrote it in their language. The archaeologist have tried to uderstand what the spaniards have written down but some of it is unaudible. Understaniding the Ancient Inca is like solving a mystery.       Some people may ask how we know what peoples life was like almost a hundered years ago. Well we dont know exactly what it was like but we get clues from their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. some of what we know comes from oral history or stories passed down from generation. Passing on stories was very important in the Inca because it was a way to preserve a community's history. The Inca had lived high in the Andes may have even have worshiped some mountain peeks. Some of the people died in the mountains that their body's have been frozen and experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how people died.           From there they went to the peubloans which settled in Mesa Verde about 550 A.D. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming had replaced hunting to lead a more settled way of life. They lived in these things called pithouses from about 550 A.D. to 750 A.D. as settled agriculter began. By 1000 A.D. the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. By the 1880's archeologist have sought to understand these peoples lives. We will never know the whole story: they left no written records and much of that was important in their lives has perished. Whatever may have happend, some of today's peublo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.           The lost city off of southern Greece is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. It has remaines that date back to 2800 to 1200 BC, long befor the glory days of classical Greese. They have found things dating back to the end of the stone age.

There are several lost civilizatons out there.  Some we have found and some still need to be discovered. One of them was the ancient Inca of Peru. They had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They made knots in colored string in order to record the calender to keep count of the livestock. They were called quipus. the first Europeans that they meet were amazed that they could run a huge empire just by keeping colored knots in strings as records.

They even built elaborate stone communites in the shelter of the canyon walls. But in the late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved away. They left us there building to look and and tons of other stuff.       There were also Cliff Dwellers. They made kivas. Kivas are another word for cerimonal rooms. They were underground chambers. Many Ancestral Puebloans may have used these kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, a good crop, or even luck in hunting. Pilasters supported a beam and a mud roof. The entry way was by a ladder in the center of the roof . Then the small hole in the floor is a sipapu, or also know as a symbolic entrace to the underworld.

Learning about the past and how they ran their city is very different and unique to the way we do it now. People believe that ancient civilizations have a lot of history behind it, that's why every discovery archaeologists make about these civilizations is important.                 The Incas ran their empire using colored strings to keep records. These colored strings were called quipus, the Inca made knots on them and also used them to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists found clues left behind by the Inca that form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. With these clues archaeologists can put together details of Inca life. Some of the old stories we know of the Inca are because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532, and also because of letters and diaries that described the Inca that Spanish soldiers had left behind. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind. The Inca artifacts might be objects made form stone, pottery, gold, or silver, these materials last a long time. Even if these things have been buried for hundreds of years, some turn up in the ruins of buildings, and others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.               The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They lived in pithouses usually built on mesa tops. The Puebloans began building houses above ground, from here on these people are known as Puebloans. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 the population reached several thousand, that is when they started to improve their houses. Instead of pole and adobe they started using stone masonry, walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. The Puebloans are known for there magnificence buildings and stones.               The secrets of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths, the fable of Atlantis has been brought to light form under the waters of southern Greece. What archaeologists found surpassed all expectations. The shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. They say the city sank in the sea around 1000 BC, and that the settlement dates back 5,000 years. Yet marine geologist have yet to find out why the settlement sank, theories say that it might be because of sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. This is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.              Don't all these civilizations have a lot of history behind them? Well they have more, and every discovery more that is made, they get even more history, that is why these civilizations are important. People find them important when they read their history, they become fascinated and begin to read more about them. With out knowing all the the things they did and built, we might assume that their government and cultures were just like ours, when in reality they did things different and unique. Now you know why all these different type of discoveries archaeologists or scientists make about lost city's, ancient tribes, and many different civilizations are so important.

The discoveres found by archeologist of the Inca is that they had no actuall alphabet. The way that they took notes on how their crops grew or how much cattle they had was by using colorful string to keep records. The Inca was a South American empire that ruled during 1438-1532. Since some of the Puebloans liked to live in the desserts, some of their clothing has stayed tact because of the heat from the sun. With this we can learn what they used to make this type of clothing and how they made it. Since people have entered Inca sites some of the valuables have been taken, and we may never know what they were. Archeologists can easily predict when it was that the Inca empire fell, beause the Spaniards killed their king around 1532.      The Puebloans lived in the Four Corners region at Mesa Verde. In Spanish Puebloans means 'village dwellers' but the first Puebloans are known as Basketmakers because of their skill in craft. Since Puebloans were nomadic the only lived in this area for about 700 years. While they were there they flourished and expanded in family. Now Mesa Verde is a park that people can go visit to see how it was that these people lived. Their first homes were called pithouses.The Puebloans were very smart and knew a lot about architecture so by A.D. 1000 they went from buillding pole-and-adobe constuction to stone masonry.

The Inca helped us with the idea of the calendar to keep count of the days, they also left many artifacts for researchers to study to learn more about there civilization. The Puebloans were the first ancestral community to live in mesa Verde. They were known for their skills at basket weaving, but they also had made pottery, bow and arrows, and more efficient weapons.               Another reason why these societies were such an important find was because how old they were and some being a mythical legend. The Inca society was found to be hundreds of years old from 1438-1532 ruling the South American empire. The Puebloans had settled in the year A.D. 550. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages.

They all have on thing in common though, they are ancient civilizations. Three out of these many civilizations are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.       To begin, the Inca was an ancient civilization that ruled a South American empire for about a hundred years(1438-1532). Archaeologists found that trying to piece together this civilization wasn't going to be easy. They discovered a system of knots made with colored strings, called quipus, which was used to record the calendar and keep count of the livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus, but no one today knows what the knots mean. The Inca did however leave behind clues that helped give us a better understanding of what their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life was back then. The Inca lived high up in the Andes and they may have worshiped some mountain peaks. The sites were in remote, high areas, which made it difficult to reach them. Some of what we know came from oral history, but the rest came from the amzing artifacts that the Inca left behind.       Next, a group called the Puebloans, for more than 700 years, they and their descendents lived and flourished in Mesa Verde. The first Puebloans to settle in Mesa Verde were known as Basketmakers for their skill at craft. Farming then replaced hunting and gathering and became their main livelihood. These people live in pithouses which were cramped into small villages. Puebloans learned to make pottery and discovered the bow and arrow. They became 'smarter' and began to build houses above ground. Sadly though, the Puebloans left no written records and much of what was important has perished. Eventually the cliff dwellers left and traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona. Some of the Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of this interesting group.       Finally, the secrets of the lost city. Dr Jon Henderson once stated,' There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' Living in this town many years ago were people known as the Pavlopetri. This town was believed to have been consumed around 1000BC. Henderson found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, but what really took him by surprise was the discovery of a possible megaron. Now you might ask what a megaron is, well its a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall. This is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. This city has inspired one of the greatest myths of all time and to actually of found it was even better.       In conclusion, these three ancient civilizaions are very fascinating to archaeologists. Maybe one day you might discover something like this. It would be an interesting discovery dont you think? Maybe even one day, a hundred years from now, people will be learining about us and wondering what life was like when we lived.

The past offers history that can be found no where else.  In all three of these civilizations: the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, history of all kind roams the areas.  Each of these locations lived in a different time, and had things that made them different, some better than others.       The Incans had a unique way of doing things that made them different.  Such as quipi which stood as calenders and planers for them.  Other places had different types of calenders , but they were all similar.  Incans were different from all of the other civilizations at the time, which is a huge reason arceologists took such a huge likeing to their civilization.  They also had good clothing and textiles that have lasted throughout the years. This shows that the Incans were good at making clothing and showed promising techneque. The Incans lived back in a time when there was not much technology, but the ways that they lived their lived make them a great civilization to study.        The Puebloans lived life in a way that made them different from others.  Their most known inventions are their buildings.  They started off with the pithouses, and got more advanced and made kivas.  Each of these places had different areas that were dedicated to certain things in their culture.  Including a hole that they said led to the undergrounds which is where they came from.  Each time something was built they became more advanced, showing that the Puebloans constantly grew as a group of people in technology and beliefs.  They were an interesting group of people who sent ideas and teachings into the future generations that have been shaped into how everyone lives now.        The Pavlopetri people lived the longest back, and now their towns and remains are under water.  Historians have found peices from their past time which has helped them to understand these amasing group of humans.  They had a possible megaron which supprised historians because that would automatically raise the status of the city.  This discovery has caused scientists to want to roam the seas more to try and find more underwater civilizations.  Everyone was really thrilled that history is really this old, and are glad that we can keep learning from it.        Finding old peices if history is important for all of mankind to continue to strive to improve.  Not only has the history from the past been interesting to study, but it has also shaped all of the countries into what they are.  Without the mistakes and great discovories from the past none of the countries in the world would be able to know what and what not to do.

Pithouses were homes set into the ground with a covering overhead and they were about the size of a living room. These later became kivas, which were places used for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or good crops. These are present-day churches and houses.

The ancient civilizations of the Incas, Anasazi, and Greeks teach us what their lives were like back then and inevitably where we came from and evolved.       The Incas used a quipus in order to keep track of their lifestock. this shows us that even though they didn't have an alphabet, they had the brain power to count and record their number of lifestock.       The Puebloans built highly advanced buildings and were highly skillful when it came to stone masonry. as time goes on the people begin to evolve more and more, becoming more intelligent.       The ancient Greeks built huge sophisticated cities, but as time drew on most of these cities fell subject to a changing enviroment and inevitably sunk into the ocean.This helped preserve the town and showed how people lived at the time, and is of great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow.       ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Incans, and Puebloans showed intelligent life and has showed us where we came from and how much we have evolved.

The city being so far ahead of its time makes th discovery of the city even more desierable.        Atlantis sinking is very similar to the dissapearence of the Inca.  Like Atlantis, the Inca vanished in one day leaving little evidence of there existence behind, apart from their city ruins.  Strange fenominones such as these have happened a few other times.

The Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are all societies that failed brutally. We must discover as much as we can about them so we do not make the same mistakes they did.       For example, in the passage 'Ancient India: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past', it states 'Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate.' If we were not precise in discovering this historical significance, our society could have easily failed. The Spaniards were revolutionary conquerers. If we didn't know that the Incas were conquered, we might not have been as well-prepared for people trying to wage war or take over our society.       Also, in a later passage, known as 'Mesa Verde National Park ancestral Puebloans and Their World', it states 'when the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there.' Had historians not found this out, Americans might not have known about the vast ancestral differences in their country, which could have led to major social differences. This could completely change how we look at society today!       Even furthermore; in the article 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets,' it is addressed that 'Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlemtn dates back 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say.' Therefore, if we did not discover 'this site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor,' we might not be as a ware of natural disasters and have the protection we need when a storm or flood comes.

Then you are probably a very intelligent person because they are. There are many reasons to disagree if you have never seen one but for those of us who have; we believe.        Unicorns are mainly believed to be a 'made-up fairytale character'but, in truth, if they werent real, we would not have evidence to prove their existence. They are a very intereresting animal in fact and i can very well describe them to you. they are very light in color, almost white but more of a shiny salmon/pink color. Now not all of them are this particular color though. many are lavender aswell and even blue but blue ones are very rare. Only very very very very cool people, like myslef, are allowed to own blue unicorns. yes i do in fact own a unicorn but no one must know about bashfyej (thats his name and its pronounced CHAD). some people just call hiim bluesker though for a nickname because, for some reason, they cant seem to remeber his full name. i have ridden my unicorn before and believe that he is very calm and easy to sit upon. i hope that you get to meet him in the future.        so back to the unicorns in general. their tales always have to be darker tha their skin. for example, if the unicorn is lavender then it has to hae a puple tail. theres no if ands or buts about it. chad (ill use his pronunciation so u understand) is light blue with a navy blue tail. i braid his mane and tail alot and put bows and stuff in it. i think he like me a lot because he has never tried to bite me before. wen a unicorn bites somebody it turns all different colors. thats where people get bruises from. they just blame it on somebosy else because they are too stupid to realize that a unicorn ewas actually bitning them. they are usually a very gentle creaure but only to prople who really truly belive in them, like me of course.        so, in conclusion, and yes i know theres only 4 paragraphhs, unicorns are my life and i absolutely love them. to whoever is reading this, ium sorry, and i hope this made you laugh because i am actaulkly a straight a student  with a gpa of 4.00 (as high as we can go) and i know exactly what i am doing and this test is not better then pen and paper. my friend did the same thing and i hope many other students did as well.

Mesa Verde was found about 1400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, the Mesa Verde lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. the pithouse featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four coner timbers suppirted the roof. The firepit an air defector. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground, with up right walls made of poles and mud.They built the houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in front. In A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.                      The Lost Greek city. The secrets of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring  myths &mdash;the fable of Atlantis&mdash; have been brought to light from beneath the water off southern Greece. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Although discovered by British oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this yeah that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins.                        Thanks to the shifting sand and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a word of building, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.                         Marin geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level change, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.

During this exploration these archeologists found many intresting artifacts of these ancient people.This city is the oldest submerged town in the world followed by the fact it is very unique in many ways.In October 16, 2009, archeologists went into the sea to explore this submerged city.In this exploration they found some qualities of these people.These people thought of the future when building this incredible city.They went above and beyond anything that has been created in the past because they built buildings that were meant to last for a long time.As you can tell these people were very smart and had a very unified society.Besides being very unified, this society was very large and were very wealthy.People can tell this because of the way they built their buildings.         The fact that the people from Atlantis thought of the future and strived to built this perfect society is a very smart idea.These people reached their goal but unfortunatley they never thought of the idea of creating a system to protect their land from natural resources. The city of Atlantis still remains under the sea 5,ooo years later. The interesting fact is that all the artifacts are still found today. By this fact  people can tell how skilled these civilized people were.         Dr jon Henderson stated 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world...'.Archeologists thank technology because it played a major roll in the discovery of this town. Even though the people from Atlantis did not have the advaced technology we have now they could still be able to construct sturdy buildings so they can last as they planned. The most important artifact they could have left for the future generation is the tools they used to construct their buildings. I support my thought by stating that if we did not watse so much money providing machines to build structures in todays life and used ancient tools, then we could use the money not spent on the machines to create a system securing our nation from the powerful forces of nature.The same thing that happened to Atlantis could happen to our nation.         When the archeologists explored the city of Atlantis they found a whole world of buildings. It is unimaginable how large this city was. Many people might have moved to this town thinking it is powerful and will never be destroyed.The fact that the people went ahead and thought of the future shows they were blinded and did not worry for the present. Due to this they were not prepared and were consumed by the sea. In my opinion if the town had not been consumed by the sea  the city would still be standing on ground today.The lost city of Atlantis is an important find because it shows it would have been a utopian society if they did not worry too much of the future. It is was a good move to think of the future but at the same time realize that the present could destroy what they had in mind for the furture.         The people from Atlantis are a good precident for our generation because it opens the people's minds and gives us a wake up call. It brings the question in mind 'Are we prepared for a natural disaster or any kind of desruction?'Our leaders should focus on the civilians safety and prepare us for a destruction. The people should be like the people in the city and become united in this plan of safety.I admire the people in this city because they did a beautiful job on creating this city. Peoplehave a glimpse of what they believed in thanks to technology. The technology may not be what the poeple now a days  consider technology but it is very helpful. We can know many intresting fats of these people due to the fact they worked hard on creating this city.People should worry about the present and future and should not get too carried away so we can have a united society.

We have recently discovered many civilizations, but the most important ones are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations.       The Inca Empire has been known for many years, but some people do not know much about them. The Incas were very interesting people. They built their empire on the Andes mountains because they wanted their enemies to have a hard time reaching them. There are many places in the Andes mountains that are Inca sites for artifacts, but most of them have been disturbed. They have been disturbed by looters because the Incas people had many valuable artifacts.       The civilization that was once in Mesa Verde was known as Puebloan. The Puebloans were also very interesting people because they were very skilled people. The archaeologists who study artifacts from Puebloans have found many pottery. The shape of the pottery varies in different shapes and sizes. The archaeologists have also noticed that most pottery have paintings on them. The paintings are very detailed and precise. this is evidence that the Puebloans were very talented and patient.       There has recently been a new civilization discovered by British and Greek archaeologists. Its name is Pavlopetri. This civilization is so unique because it is completely underwater. Archaeologists have studied many artifacts from here. They have discovered that it is very well preserved. It is well preserved because the shifting sands and protected bay protect the city from much damage. The archaeologists have also discovered that the city was filled with shards of pottery. This it evidence that the people of Palvopetri were also very skilled at crafting.       These civilizations were very important to discover and study because they teach us about what ancient civilization was like. People are very interested in ancient civilization because it is very different from what society is today. It is also very interesting because as society changes, so does technology.

You probably are wondering how this worked for them, what the did was for an important event they would tie a new piece of string. They had certain colors for certain events. The Inca were very religious.               Clues left behind from the Inca from an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others were able to put things together and figure out there past.              The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') about A.D. 550. They are also known as the basket-makers. because they have such high skills in arts and crafts. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for the help for hunting. At about A.D. 750 their population increased by a lot! Some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.               In my opinion people are fascinated by civilizations from the past because they are interested by how things have changed or how far we have come sense then. Maybe to know what they do or there way of living. The lost city is a very important find because now we have places to explore and there might be better resources on the city that we need. Its something new to study. Good things to study would be things that help us move forward such as, weapons, things to help find what race they are.               As i said, imagine living without the things we have now. Try thinking about what it would have been like living with them. The sicknesses that they most likely had and the way they mad a living. They didnt pay for the things they had. There was no money. There wasnt much to eat or drink. They had to fight for life. There are many more things that i didnt mention in this that they found. The way we live now is a blessing. They would have loved to be able to watch TV after a long days job.

The Incas hade there own specilized calender that only they understood and they had an empire that lasted from (1438-1532).           Anothor Tribe that lasted many years was the Puebloans. They settled in Mesa Verde at about A.D 550. They were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They were Formerly nomadic, they were brginning to lead a more settled way of life. They weren't big on hunting but mostly farming, that was there main livelihood. They lived in Pithouses most were usually clustered together and were built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff revesses. By A.D 1000 th epeople of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole- and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between A.D 1100 and A.D 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand.

The three main lost civilizations were going to talk abbout is the Ancient Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and the lost city of Atlantis. These three things will grab your attention and hopefully get you thinking about the world! There are also there type of people, which is the Inca the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.          The first thing were going to talk about is the Ancient Incas, the geologist that have studied all that happened in the past know that the Inca had no alphabet or system of writting. We know that the Inca used some type of system to keep a Calender for there live stock. 'The Inca made knots colored string called quipus' (Sorce 1) Geologist find many quipus but, since we have no one who can read the knots, their language is a mystery. The Inca lived in the high Andes, many of the Inca sites were in relativly high places. The Inca went so high up so they could avoid the looters.          The next type of people were going to visit is the Ancestral Puebloans, 'About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Coners region chose Mesa Verde for thier home.'(Sorce 2)  You could say that these people are natives who needed there own place to live. In the late A.D 1200's within the span of a couple genarations they left theit homes and moved away. The park preserved a reminder of the culture the Eurapeans had. The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde at about A.D 550.(They were know as the Basketmakers)As they settled they began to liver more of the human life we live now. They stopped hunting so often and farmed there food. They lived in things called Pithouses. Puebloans built their dwellings beneath over hanging cliffs. The way they would keep their homes together was a mix of mud and water. These people were so important becasue they helped create some of the frist civilization.           Last, is the Pavlopertri, the suken settlement. This settlement dates all the way back 5,000 yuears ago durring the Homer's heros time. This is one of the oldesdt suken settlements. This dates all the way back to 2800 to 1200 BC. What geologist found prooved that there was a suken city. They found: Buildings, courtyards, main streets ETC.

The Inca people had no formal alphabet and they made nots in colorful pieces of string to record information, and these colorful pieces of string are called quipus. The Inca used these qiupus to record the calender and to keep track of livestock. The only written information that archaeologists could find was the journal entries of the Spanish Soldiers and priests that came to Europe in 1532.       The Puebloans of Mesa Verde lived in pithouses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. The pithouses had a living room that was sunk a few feet in the ground and had timbers to support the roof. At about A.D. 750 the Puebloans started building their houses above ground, with upright walls made with mud and wooden poles. The Puebloans then started making these homes in long curving rows,( often having a couple pithouses in the front) and these homes gave the Puebloans their name.

They told many storys and tales that have been passed adown by generstions. Resarches have found diarys of other people visiting the incas.

The rest of the inormation we get just comes from old artifacts. Foun in several places such as: Building ruins, under ground, in graves, and other weird stranges places.

Others have found stuff onn land off thand in stuff out of stuff buried covered almost any where.

Some times its hard to disipher what is what. Yeah you might know a pies of clothing is acient but who said it was the incas? It could be some solders or empires who went to their empire to fight or visit. Thats why archeologists are so  hesitant to just relise that ya thats from the incas and they made that and so and so wore it. No it takes more time then that. If it waas like that then most of our history would be fake and we would be learning for no reson. Some times something tey find isnt even an artifact. It migt seem old but it could just be from the present day contry and some one barried it you never know. dont get to exited cus it most likely isnt an artifact its just a pies of unk.

They lived in high remote places like in caves in cliff faces or on mountain tops. The icy cold mountains acted like a gianted freezer by preserving their bodies for pber 5,000 years.

They were known as Basketmakers because they had good craft skills. They farmed instead of hunting and gathering. The first Puebloans live in pithouses, which included a living room and a sink a few feet in the ground, a four corner timber suppoted roofm a firepit and storage bins or pits clustered into small villages usually built on Mesa tops but also sometimes in cliffs. They learned how to make pottery, bow and arrows, and a spear thrower. They soon multiplied, about A.D. 750.

After the Spaniards arrived to South America, they recorded their days in their diaries. Here they wrote about their experiences and stories they heard as of every day. Although inaccurate, archeologists have used these writings to record Inca history and myths. This is due that Incas had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Inca artifacts and objects are used to find clues on Inca daily-life. Inca artifacts might be made of stone, pottery, gold or silver. Some of these are found in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. Inca sites provide the best idea of all about life in Peru before and during Inca rule.       The Pavlopetri city, recently found underwater near Neapolis, is about 5,000 years old. The find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. It is significant, because as a submerged site, it was never reoccupied. Theories of how this ciy sank include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquekes, or a tsunami. It is very likely a combination of the first two. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plate wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.       The Puebloans first settled about 1,400 years ago in the region of Mesa Verde. Here, they began constructing homes and farms. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill in crafting. They lived in pithouses and they learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground. By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.

If not for the clues left behind by the Inca , we would not known about this civilization that ruled the South American empire that rivaled the expense of ancient Rome for nearly a hundred years. These clues that the Inca left behind showed their way of life, transportation, government, religion, agriculture, and art and agriculture and with the knowledge of this, archaeologists pieced together the details of the Inca lifestyle.                                                All of what archaeologists know not only comes from artifacts of this civilization, but from the passing of stories from generation to generation.       The Puebloans              The first Puebloans were Ancestral and were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages that were sometimes built on mesa tops or cliff recesses. Since they didn't hunt or gather as much, farming became their main way to food. They also took the time to make pottery and developed a more efficient weapon for hunting by replacing the atlatl with the bow and arrow.       The Pavlopetri           The Pavlopetri were explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. The settlement was sunken and dated back to the time of Homer's heroes about 5,000 years ago, and in terms of wealth and size of detail is unprecedented.           Said to be the oldest submerged town in the world, Pavlopetri has remains dating back to 2800 to 1200 BC, years before the days of classical Greece. Archaeologists know that there are older, undiscovered sites in the world, but none can really be considered a planned town such as the Pavlopetri.           Lost Civilizations (cont.)           The discoveries of these lost civilizations are very important in history back then, and even today's history. Most of what archaeologists know about today's history comes from the discoveries of these lost civilizations, so before you think to yourself how boring early civilizations are to you, remember that these lost civilizations play a big role in our way of life.

Living in high places preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them.

The firepit had an air deflector.  Pithouse will later on evolve to Kivas.  From here on these people are known as Puebloans meaning 'village dwellers.'

Next i'm going to talk about the Puebloans.Known as basketmakers,for their skill at the craft, the puebloans lived in pit houses which are like tents.They made pots and aquired the weapon the bow and arrow.The Puebloans farmed, and lived in compact villages, they hgad some houses on cliffs and had churches.               The people called the pavlopetri lived in a place which is now underwater, we dont know exactly how it ended up underwater , but people think because a tsunami or maybe ground subsistence do to earthquakes.there were ceramics that dated back to the end of the stone age,about 5,000 years ago.Some investigations also revealed about 9,000 square meters of new buildings.This underwateer city is what had started myths like antlantis.                All of these different people(Incas,Puebloans,and Pavlopetri) have helped modern civilization.Without the discoveries we have made about these people the world may be different then it is today.

Every finding is important, it helps learn more about their way of life. Some of the most importanat findings archaeologits have made are about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Each one showed archeologits many different things about how the ancient people lived. Each one has its own meaning in the rare discoveries of archaeologits.           The Inca left behind many clues as to how they lived life. Due to the passing down of storeis and myths, archaeologists have found out their 'history'. Also, with the 'clues' the Inca left behind, we may be able to find out their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. For example, their way of keeping records was to tie knots in colored strings. Though no one knows what they mean now, it is proof that they kept records, and didnt' have a writing language or alphabet. What they also left behing was ruins of old buildings, textiles, and clothing, which in another way of figuring out how they lived. Archaeologoists have also found bodies in the ice of the Andes. With these bodies, which are well presevered, scientist have somewhat figured out how the person lived and died. The Inca discovery was very important because it not only showed how the people lived in their 'houses' and that they hunted and gathered, it showed they they kept recoreds, and they had stories and even history.           The Puebloans were/are known as basketmakers. They are also known for their houses, known as pithouses, and as they evolved into better structures, kivas. Puebloans were also one of the first tribes to also evolve from hunting and gathering to farming and having weapons for both. As they evolved into better structuers and better at farming, they learned to make pottery and more efficient weapons for hunting, like a bow and arrow. As they kept evolving, the houses evolved along. With the population growing, they startin making their pithouses above ground. They built houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in the front. Then they started making the houses of thick stone, often two or three stories high. Pithouses were now called Kiva. Now, this source was very important because it explained their living. Not just they lived in something called a pithouse or a hut, etc. This explained how the houses were build and how they evolved from underground made of dirt or above ground made of stone.           The Pavlopetir was dated from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the 'glory days' of Greece. Now this city is underwater. The site covers 30,000 square meters of ocean floor, and contains many artifacts. It has revealed building, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. Due to it being underwater it was presevered some iteams, and has shown different iteams of pottery. It not only showes ruins and what is left of the city unlike the other two, but it actually shows a city with has been dived underwater due to a natural cause. That's why it's important. It shows how the city was structured and placed, and how the streets looked. It was also a great finding because it is of the few underwater.           These places that archaeologists find are all important. They show a bit of history and something new in all of them. These three places were important because they went and explained a litte more than any other one of the ruins did.

These have all been made quite recently and shed insight on some of these cultures. More importantly however, it shows the ancient ways of life and tools of these groups, and may even develop our government even further than it is right now.       These groups may all be ancient, but what they lived in and where they lived was most certainly unique. Puebla Kivas might give us information about their past. These kivas obviously show us that the Puebla were religious, enhanced by the fact that they contained an 'entrance to the underworld'. As we can see from the Greeks, some chose to live in towns. Some of the Incas preferred more privacy, and chose to live in the mountains. Possibly more important than the shape or community these civilizations chose to live in are the locations. The Greeks lived near water. This means that they probably were not as worried about war, and might have lived off of seafood and foreign trade. In sharp contrast, the Incas lived in the Andes mountaintops and the deserts surrounding. Having the higher ground is an unmistakable advantage, which means they might have feared war more than starvation or running out of water.       Some of the tools made in each of these communities are still used today. The Greeks developed beautiful pottery, which has evolved into the plates and cups we eat and drink out of every day. The Puebla evolved the atlatl into a more complex, yet easier weapon to use, the bow and arrow. Archery was a typical war factor all the way until medieval times. and is still practiced for recreation and food today. Perhaps one of the most unique items developed in this time period was the Quipus. The quipus was developed by the Incas and was a way of keeping records by simple knots in string.       Can you imagine how much simpler life might be for government officials if we just did records in string? They would not have to worry about foreign countries seeing them, and we could put less time into preventing computer hackers and more time into working Obama's sixteen trillion dollar deficit down. This isn't the only thing we could learn, as we excavated the Incas, we learned that dry weather and freezing work very well for preservation. This has lead to more advanced coffins and chryrostasis. We could learn from their houses, for all the homeless people in the world. The ancient houses might be a good, affordable substitute for a modern house.       These advancements have all came from history, quite great accomplishments for people living in what we might consider the stone age. It is time for us to finally recognize that these ancient achievements are important; that they do really matter. All of these give us insight on what life might be like in the past, and possibly the future.

For years, the have studied the lost civilizations of the world; the Inca, the Greek, and the Anasazi. The archaeoligists are exploring many sights to link the past to the present. It hasn't been easy though.           The Incas were all wiped out by Spanish conquistadors in the 1500's. Extremely wealthy, everything in their society had a lot of value, so it was taken by the Spanish and looters. This makes it hard to find objects to deduct what happened. When an archaeoligist does find something, it is photographed and documented, dusted off, but not moved. The location is essential to proving historical accounts true and to deducting what the item was used for. The mountainous terrain and dangerous jungles also make it hard to access. Event though most artifacts were stolen, the Incans left more clues behind then the Anasazi.            The Anasazi were a group of Native Americans living in the southwestern USA. The only clue left behind from this group were many structures and some hunting weapons. The structures indicate that they were a religious and creative group of builders. One such structure is called a kiva, a ceremonial room for religion. is Little is known about the Anasazi. With Greek society, we have a lot more to go off of.           The Greeks were a prosperous empire until the Romans came and took over, destroying most of their culture. A Greek city said to have inspired the myth of Atlantis is currently underwater. The city is called Pavlopetri and it's the oldest submerged town in the world. It has many artifacts because being covered in water makes it hard to loot. The shifting of sand in the currents has revealed a huge planned city with streets and everything. Marine geoligists and archaeoligists are using the latest digital technology in exploring Pavlopetri.            The Incas, Anasazi, and ancient Greeks are cultures that are lost to us. We can still explore the buildings that survived what the people did not. Geography has gotten in the way and often, things have been stolen from the site.

Some of what we know about the Inca is within stories passed down or told with nots. Some stories were writin down by Europeans that arrived. But Spaniards did not speak the same launguage though. The discovry of the Inca has help us understand many things about them and their lives.        Mesa verde, now a national park, was home to a group of people living in the Four Corners region about 1,400 years ago. They were often callled basket makers. They built strong houses and had  many techniecs. they also changed pottery.

Around 1400 years ago, a people called the Puebloans lived.  Around 5000 years ago, a people called the Pavlopetri lived.  I find it amazing that we even know this, but I find it even more amazing that we can know all their ways of life.  Without discoveries by archaeologists, however, we wouldn't.  They are the ones who search through ruins of ancient communities, looking for artifacts.  Without their work, history class would be a lot more boring and pointless because there would be no information that was more than 100 years old.  Without the discoveries that have been made about the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, we would have no knowledge of what happened in South America and elsewhere long ago.        Some of the people who lived long ago were more technologically advanced than we think, and we can learn and use some of their ideas because archaeologists study artifacts and ruins.  Some of the discoveries made gave us valuable bits of information that are interesting to know.  For example, the Inca made their items out of materials like gold and silver, and we had yet to discover gold in 1800.  Also, the Inca ruled South America for around 100 years.  For this information, archaeologists had to find written records, and more importantly, interpret them.  It is harder than you think to understand ancient languages, especially the ones that are not in use today.         Without the discovered information, there would be gaps in our history of the world that would be awkward and strange.  But archaeologists are here to fill these holes with their discoveries of ancient civilizations.  These discoveries are some of the most important things to ever happen, so that people now can draw conclusions about what happened long ago and see the similarities and differences between their lifestyle and ours.

The Europeans found in extremly amazing how they were able to have a huge site and be able to use just strings to keep track of things. No man on this Earth know what these knots mean today though. They say that understanding the acient Incas is just like solving a mystery. These people have left behind many clues such as buildings, pots, houses, etc. The archaeologist study these things still trying to put together the Incas way of life a hundred years ago. Stories about these people have been passing from generation to generation. Passing on these stories has made the Incas still alive today meaning we know that they once existed on our earth. The Europeans have written stories about them in 1532. The Spanish and priests also wrote about the Incas these stories about these people are a important way to know how they survived back then. Some of the Incas sites have been completely destroyed by the treasure hunters and the looters. People who take anything that might be valuable today. This still goes on to this very day. These people are basically taking away out history and making it a mystery by stealing things that might help to solve this puzzle. The Incas would live on high mountain tops and cliff faces which makes it harder for the looters to take things but it also makes it harder for the looters to take things but it also makes it harder for the archaeologists to get all of their equiptment up to the sites.

But some stories were passed from generation to generation. And some more knowledge of the Inca comes from their artifacts or objects that they left behind. Many artifacts were made from stone, pottery, gold or silver. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may have worshiped some mountain peaks.       The Puebloans were a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. Their were known as Basket-makers or their skill at the craft. Their population multiplied in A.D. 750 and started building their homes above ground made of poles and mud. By A.D. 1000 the people had advanced construction to skillful stone masonry. Their pottery also changed from simply designs to black drawings on white backgrounds. They used nature to their advantage building their homes beneath overhanging cliffs.

For example'Archaeologists have to be careful to make sure exactly which people built which sit. Archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about Inca's predecessors'. 'But it is also makes the job of the archaeologists are expert mountaineers.

I also strongly believe that electronics can make it easier to find answers faster and more clearer. Scientists have proven that some people at any age can focus better if they are listening to music at the appropiate times. For example like when the teacher is not talking or when your doing something indpendent and at those types of times. So, these are my reasons for getting electronics more involved in school and saying that they can help some people focus a lot better no matter what age you are.                 If I was allowed I would start my own petition to get kids and maybe even parents to change Theirs and others minds about the rules for electronics. But if I got a lot of signatures would it actually change their minds about electronic usage in school. But now in our school we have a program called 'BYOT' which means that kids are allowed to bring in their electronics and use them on the schools guest inernet. Such as phones, laptops and other devices but they can see if your on the things that you shouldn't be on. So I thank the people that had the idea of program and allowing BYOT exist.                 But another thing is that I think we should be allowed to text in school when we are at a time like lunch or when it is okay too. One reason for this is because if it is an emergency then you should be able to text back to whoever your talking to. Another thought is for some reason your gaurdian texts you then I think you should be able to reply back to them because they are the people that take care of the kids. So, this is just another reason for more usage for electronics in school.                 This is for at home it is easier for me to focus and get my work done while listening to music so why not at school. Is it because I could distract other students. For that I could just turn it down so they can't hear it. Or maybe because I won't focus on the teacher, if thats the case then I would only play music at appropiate times. So now that I have reasons maybe this will change peoples minds for electronic usage. If you are reading this then I thank you for actually taking the time to read and listen to what I have to say. So all the things I talked about in the end wrap up to the whole point in writing this passage.

They all provided what kind of buildings they lived in, the clothes they wore, the weapons they used, and what they did to survive.      The Inca was a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a Southern American that rivaled the expanse of Ancient Rome. The Inca used a piece of string called a quipu. The Inca weren't very known, so the very first Europeans to discover them were amazed at how they could run an empire just by using a piece of string.      The Puebolans settled in Mesa verde in A.D. 550. They are known for making baskets, pots, and used the bow and arrow at their time. They lived in what was called pithouses that sunk a few feet in the ground. Many generations have lived in Mesa Verde from around A.D. 550 to A.D. 1300.      The Pavlopetri was a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. The settlement dates back to 5000 years ago to the time of homers heroes. It's no doubt that its the oldest submerged town In the world with remains dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC.

But we still want to learn about them, so i am going to tell you a little about them all.       The ancient inca started in about 1438 and ended about 1532. they were first founded by the europeans. they made many things like colored strings called quipus. this is how the kept their records. then years later south americans arived and were also very amazed. we only know these things because they were writen down by the spaniards. when we were digging we had found many artifacts from them silver gold clothing, they were all preserved by the desert. some of the inca sites were disturbed by treasure hunters. the inca fall was easy to date because the spaniards had just killed their last king and had taken over. that was the end of the ancient inca of peru.       the ancient puebloans lived about 1400 years ago. long before the europeans started exploring north america. for more than 700 years they had many decendants who lived and flourished there. they had a park anmed after them called the mesa verde national park. they farmed more than the hunted and they also weaved baskets. they had created a spear thrower that was called atlatl. they lived in pint houses they looked like a small tent with one side coverd. they were made of mud and poles. then after a while they were called cliff dwellers because they started living in the cliffs. no one really knows what has happened to the pueblo people now. that is what i read for the puebloans.       the lost greek city was found by marine biolagists. they had been diving and found land under water. it was weard because it was in pretty shallow water. where normally they are in very deep water. it is about 5000 years old experts say. it is no doubt the oldest submerged island ever found. it was dicoverd by a british oceanographer some 40 years ago. atlantis was amyth but a myth that keeps under water exploration going. their is still alot to be found under the great big ocean, so lets hope we keep it going.

I think that the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important to the nations history. My reasons for this are as follows. They were alive on our planet and influenced something or another, They came up with the Pithouses, as well as kiva.       These religions all had something in common. But what was it? Archaeologist found that they all lived in the same region and all had almost the same religious views. However, they did not come in contact with each other often. The Pueobloans invented the pithouses were called pithouses because they sank a coupple feet into the ground and they were quite small. The pithouses later envolved into a kiva though. This statement shows that if Archaeologist wouldn't have done research then we would have had no clue on anything that happened in our history.

Knowledge of the past world helps us better understand the world of today. Take, for example, the Inca quipus. It was a tool of string used to record the population of a Inca empire. It helped the rulers in understanding just who it was, and how many it was, they ruled over.        Ancient sites also tell us what the world was like at that period in time. Graveyards housing the dead show us how long Incas lived on average, which can help us determine fatality rates for generations after. They also show us diseases that may have killed off many civilizations, which we may link to some diseases today, and in turn ay help us find cures for those said diseases. Buried sites also show us what weather patterns may have been like, which may aid us in figuring out how civilizations may have effected the environment around them.        Discovering these ancient empires also shows u the mistakes they've made so we can learn from them.          Some mistakes may include improper civilization placement. Civilizations built high up in the Andes Mountains were prone to rockslides. The cave that many lived in were susceptible to collapse. Another mistake would be abuse of the land. The Puebloans faced this problem.        The over use of land led to less fertile soil. Improper use of water led to droughts.

As fascinating as these time periods were, there was scattered information. Sometimes, archaeologists would have more information on one subject than the other. This made it difficult to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle.       Archaeologists had a really difficult time deciphering the Inca's language, as they barely had any written information or records. Something that was an astounding breakthrough however was a quipu. This was a 'device' that the Incas made and used. This wasn't any particular was of writing or keeping track of events, but it was a number system. A quipu had a bunch of different colored strings that symbolized many different numbers. The quipu was extremely vital and important because it showed that the Incans were capable of inventing their own number system.       In Mesa Verde, Puebloans were shown as intelligent by the important findings made by archaeologists and historians, as well as scientists. The Ancestral Puebloans found out their own unique way of building huts, or 'Pithouses'. These living spaces were extremely important findings because it showed how the Puebloans lived. Soon, Pithouses became even more complex when they evolved into 'Kivas'. Kivas were made of a more solid, almost stone-like, clay. Not everyone lived in a Kiva as they were used as a ceremonial room and often held rituals for healing or praying. Shortly after Kivas were made, people called Cliff Dwellings started appearing. As their name states, they lived in cliffs. The first reports of Cliff Dwellings were made by cowboys in the 1880's, and this is when archaeologists started getting interested. These cliff homes were very sturdy and provided excellent protection from weather and other dangers such as enemy tribes or wild animals.       If you've ever heard of an ancient civilization called Atlantis, you might recall hearing somewhere that it had been submerged into the ocean and renamed 'The Lost City'. For years on end, divers and archaeologists have been trying to uncover secrets and other information about this sunken city. Though it still remains a mystery, the finding that have been made so far are extremely important to uncovering a truth. In source #3, 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets', the author states that a monumental structure consisting of a rectangular hall called a megaron was discovered. This means, that the settlements status was raised because these were usually used by an elite. Not only was a megaron found, but ceramics dating back to at least 5000 years ago were uncovered as well. This means that Atlantis would have been submerged a full 1200 years earlier than scientists originally hypothesized.

Clues were left behind by the Inca for a portrait of religion art agriculture, etc. that's a way for archeologists to find out how the inca lived. Some things that we know are mainly from the Inca. Like for history for example, Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532, wrote them down.            Most of the history of the Inca comes from the knowledge of how archeologists discovered the artifacts and etc. such as stone gold pottery silver clothes also still exist from that time most was destroyed by dampness.       Puebloans History:             The first Puebloan settled in Mesa Verde, in 550 A.D. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, to use for hunting.When they settled they began creating their shelters known as Pithouses.             In A.D. 750 they began making houses above ground, for there on they were known as the village Dwellers. Between A.D. 1100 &amp; A.D.1300 during the classic period the Puebloans population grew, their was about several thousand. About A.D. 1200 some people began  moving back to the cliff alcoves.

These ancient civilizations have provided sufficient information about how life was lived beofore modern times.        The Incans had no sort of system of writing or alphabet, but they did have a kind of number dvice called a quipus. This device was used by tying knots onto a rope, and using that to keep track of numbers. keep track of livestock and to record their calendar. This early system of record keeping was useful in the Incan empire, and showed us how advenced they were. Humans today have still never decoded the system, this shows how advenced they must have been to be able to come up with a complex code that only they could understand.        A group of people called the Puebloans were very helpful in understanding the weather and way of life these people had. They lived in 550 A.D. and were well known for being amazing basketmakers. This shows us that they had makings and certain plants that allowed for this. They also were very early farmers, instead of being hunters and gatherers. They were very advanced and built pithouses gathered in small villages on mesa tops. They were amazing engineers in the way they mastered making houses and basketweaving. Their techiniques of basketweaving are still used, and since they were so durable we have some today!        There is a legend of an underwater city off the coast of Greece. It is the oldest submerged city in the world, it is 30,000 meters of ocean floor. Though some people want to believe it was built underwater, it was really just sumberged much later after it was built, caused by earthquakes.

Well, there are three recently discovered civilizations. There are the Inca's, the Puebloans, and the Palvopetris. These three cities are such an important find, because it links us with the lost past and inspires archaeologists to search for more lost lands. The Inca's used no form of writing, nor did they have an alphabet.     First, the Incas were a civilization that lived in the Andes. The Inca's were a civilization that had no alphabet or writing. The Inca's us quipus, or colored string, to record their calendar to keep count of their livestock. Noone still knows what the knots mean. We discovered about the ancient Incas by their clues left behind with architecture and paintings. We also know some about the Incas from stories past down from many generations, and Europeans wrote down about them. Since the Inca lived high in the Andes the dead bodies were frozen which helps us learn about how they died and lived.     Next, the Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde. They lived there for about 700 years until they left their homes and moved away. The Puebloans were very skilled at basketmaking and they were formally Nomadic, until they began to lead a more settled way of life. They farmed more than they hunt for food. They lived in pithouses that were clustered into small villages. By A.D. 1000, the Puebloans used stone masonry. In A.D. 1200 the population began to shift and they moved back towards the cliffs. They lived in these cliff dwellings for about 100 years until they they left.     Finally, the Palvopetris werew found in the ocean. They sank 5,000 years ago. It is the biggest submerged town in the world. It straddles 30,000 meters of the ocean floor. They had buildings, courtyards, mainstreets, and rock cut tombs. They had ceramics dating back from the end of the stone age. They had a town hall and the city was never reoccupied.     These civilations help archaeologists figure out about the past and inspire them to find more. the Incas, the Puebloans, and thePalvopetris were such an important find for archaeologists and helped ancient discoveries.

There are things in the past that arent here today or that have got us where we are by new writing or languages that werent known things before. Its important because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied. Which means it was a one time deal. People lived there and made lives there and as it sunk there was no life to be found. Nothing existed there anymore and maybe someone would like to know why.            The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. It not only shows how people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow. Meaning there must have been life there. They would like to know all about it at one point. How it got there and why it sunk. If they can figure that out than the importance would be finding more and more.               Older generations always knew it was there but they had no idea about the extent of it. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. So with them finding it so late in time they had even less time to really study it before it was washed away by sand and water. Less than one percent of the worlds ocean floors have been surveyed so there must be more but they wont know till they look. Atlantis is an extraordinary find but there is still lot more down there that has to be found. Other artifacts and places may be down there and Atlantis will help find them. With them finding Atlantis it may lead to more submerged towns if they can study this one to full extent and find its all true values.            They say it remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. This is before christ and some say nothing existed before christ so with this there is proof that things existed. There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is so unique. It is also said to be the oldest Submerged town in the world which makes it very important to our world history and how we came to be. Maybe its not the real important parts of history but we wont know that until they actually fully investigate it.            In the future i think it would be good for people to know about the past and things that took place in the past. They might want to know about the past places and past people, but in my opinion i think it would be amazing to know about a sunken place such as the lost city of Atlantis. There might be more to Atlantis than we know and have found but we they will never known because of the never ending amount of sea levels and ocean floors.

The discovery of the Inca and The Puebloan's are very important, because many important and fasanating facts were revealed. We learn about how the people lived in the ancient civilized times. How they survived. And what they went through. It show's us the Uniqueness in these towns. There different cultures. In some cases you can even see what kind of diseases and illnesses where in the town if theres human remains. Lots of things get discovered. Thats why there important. These towns are important to our history. All these facts discovered helps us understand how kife was back then. It also helps us value what we have, because they didnt have what we have back then.       In the 'Ancient Inca' they found many artifacts such as preserved clothing. Clothing usually is destroyed by all the dampness but these clothing were preserved. It's very odd and fasanating. Some Inca artifacts are made of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. Pottery is a very good artifact, because they probably wrote stories on them and there pattern designs are fasanating, there awsome. They even found bodies in the icy Andes. They ran medical scanning to see how the people died. It also revealed to them how the people lived.       In 'Mesa Verde(Puebloan's)' they found out how people lived and what they lived in. The mesa verde peole lived in pithouses. Pithouses are small houses that have a sunk living room about a few feet in the ground. And it has a four corner tombers supported roof. But then later on pithouses evolved in to Kivas. Kivas were a gathering place, much like a church. Pilasters supported a beam and mud roof. And the entry was a ladder through a hole in the center of the roof. You see that it shows us that they had different entries then now. Now we have doors, we dont have to climb a ladder just to get in a building through a small hole in the roof.       Now the discovery of Atlantis was inspired, because of all the other discoveris that had been made. Atlantis is a unique town. It also has different cultures. They found many pottery and religous buildings in it. Which is great. Atlantis is found in southern greece underwater. Atlantis was discovered 40 years ago. But is older than 40 years. Atlantis straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Atlantis is the oldest sumereged town. It has so many secrets. All those secrets need to be revealed.

They help teach us about the past and what people did to survive in ancient times. The Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri all help support the information we use to teach kids all over the world today.       In ancient Inca, there was no alphabet or system of writing. The times have changed from way back then until today. Imagine your life today without the alphabet, it would be pretty hard. There definitely would not be texting. How did they survive? Archaeologists believe that they used knots on colored string to record the calendar and keep count of livestock. This seemed to work for them at the time, but without any other real form of recording things, understanding the Incans is like solving a mystery.       The Puebloans were very skilled. They invented many types of houses and are considered very good basketmakers. They also created farming to replace hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. Life would be very hard these days without the help of the Inca. We would not even know how to produce our own food. How would we have adapted to the old lifestyle?       Without the devastating blow to the Pavlopetri society, we probably would bot know how to predict disasters such as the weather. We also wouldn't know how to react to things such as earthquakes and tsunamis. This ancient ruin has greatly helped influence our warning system to help avoid people in the way of danger.       All of these ancient discoveries helped us gain the knowledge we have today. It has helped us to invent things such as computers and cars. Without the knowledge of how these things worked in the past, we gain no skill of building things for the future.

The discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri can show this.       The Inca kept track of multiple things using nothing more than tied knots called quipus. They used these for everything from calendars to keeping track of their livestock. The Inca ruled South America for about 100 years, and their expanse rivaled that of Rome. While many sites have been looted for valuable items, many remained hidden. This is partially because many Inca cities were built up high on mountain tops. This keeps the looters from getting to them, so archaeologists have been able to find them undisturbed. They find many artifacts to show the history of the Incas and how they lived. These range from scraps of cloth to diaries that Spaniards kept when they visited them. All of these things contrubute to seeing the rise and fall of the Incas.       The ancient Puebloans are still shrouded in mystery. While much is known about them, such as the homes the lived in, there are still a few questions. However, scientists have learned much about them. They adopted an agricultural lifestyle at Mesa Verde. While there, the quality of their homes increased until they were building multiple-story buildings with intricate stonework. They were also know as great basketweavers, and archaeologists have found examples of changing the way the made pottery. Eventually, they moved to the space under the cliffs where they lived and learned for a while. Then, they went off south, to families in new Mexico and Arizona. The reason is still unknown, but there are theories. One is that after hundreds of years the land was depleted. This may still be in speculation, but there is a great many things known about the ancient Puebloans, and they were a great race.       The secrets of the sunken city have been partially brought to life, thanks to a team of Anglo-Greek archaeologists and geologists. For a long time, people have been told the myth of the lost city of Atlantis, and they may now be revealed as true. Protection form the elements has revealed a large city, full of buildings, and even shards of pottery all over the seafloor. These ruins date back to possibly 5,000 years ago, 1,200 years farther back than scientists previously thought. While these ruins were discovered 40 years ago, not until recently were they showed in such detail. Scientists think that it may have once been above ground, but sunk due to rising sea levels, earthquakes, and other natural events. Thanks to the astonishing discoveries of archaeologists, the myth of Atlantis may no longer be a myth.     In conclusion, many of us have a fascination with the people that lived long before us. The hard work of archaeologists have uncovered many secrets of the past that have quenched our thirst for knowledge. There are still many things to be learned, and one day we may finally learn all we want to know about those who lived in the past, such as the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.

In the writing to the left, it talks about many different discoveries that they have either dug up and found, stories past down  from the Inca people in the past, or just simply looked around for items left behind.           For example, ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing, so because of this they made knots in colored strings called Quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many of these ancient quipus, but today no one knows what the knots mean. Since nobody knows how to read or interpret what the colorful strings and knots are or stand for, it is very much like a mystery to the archaeologists.           Also, clues left behind  by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of  life. By studying these clues that they left behind, archaeologists can put pieces and details together to form what the Inca life was like.           Some of the Inca's history came from stories past down from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was a super important way to preserve a community's history. Archaeologists say that some of what we know are from stories that were written down by the Europeans in the 1530's. They wrote the Inca's stories down in diaries or in letters. But some of the Inca's history may be thought of as legends, because the Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language very well so some of the stories may not be true.          What we know today are very important facts about the Inca history found by are Archaeologists that work very hard to discover them.

Therefore , they keep records on lost civilizations so they can study about them in the future. That is a very important thing , too keep track of their health &amp; their stabilization. Without keeping track of their things , we would probably not know one thing about them. Keeping track of them , is actually very very important. It shows how they are,what they have been doing. Its just simply their records. The record is imporant though. Say if they were too get stolen or ripped or anything. That would be a very bad thing. You would probably have too pay a fee or serve some time for doing something like that too it. Lost civilizations are usually what people learn in history about. Archaeology unlocks secrets of the past. The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding ther Anicent Inca is alot like soloving a mystery. So how do we know about a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a South American empire that rivaled the exspanse of ancient Rome? Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, argriculture,goverment,transportation,and the way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca Life. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history,or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and preists. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate. And some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found. As in many ancient civilizations,Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone,pottery,gold, or silver. Such materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundereds of years. Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness,but these have been Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archaeologists very much. Other sites are reported to Archaeologists, who can dig them up ccarefully. They provide the bestidea of all about life in Peru before and during Inca rule. Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down Photograph any artifacts they find, and note the exact positionin which they find them. They need too learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards accounts of the Inca. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record. Amoung the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happen too it. The fall of the Inca is easyto date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the empire. The orgins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived had been inhabited by diffrent people's. Archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world too discover more about the Inca's predecessors. You'll see how aerial photogrtrapghy can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they connot see from the ground. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped too preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult. High-altitude archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equiment up a mountain for study. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equitment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived .

In this article there will be information about three different lost civilizations, the ancient Inca tribe, the ancestral Puebloans, and the lost city of Atlantis. They were all once great communities, but they all were lost.               The Inca were once very powerful, they, at one time, controlled most of South America. The Inca tribe had no real way of writing, there was nothing left behind for the archaeologists to study. There was a colored knot system that kept record of the calender to keep count of the animals. There have been archaeologists that have found this ancient knots, but have never been able to understand what the knots mean. Since nobody can read the stories left in the colorful strings, figuring out the way that the Incas lived is much like solving a mystery with no clues. There are still clues left behind by them, like portraits of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Using these clues many archaeologist are able to interpret what some of their daily life routines were like. Some things that historians know comes from oral history, and stories that had been passed down from generation to generation. Europeans, who had arrived in 1532, had written some of the stories down and had described the Inca in letters an diaries. It is hard for historians to really know what to understand, because the Europeans did not understand the European language well. Their descriptions of them probably would not be accurate either. Everything else the archaeologist know comes from the artifacts that they find in excavations. Many of the artifacts are mad out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver, and many of them are found in ruin of the building, or in a grave for the dead to use in the afterlife. There are som sites that do not help the archaeologists, because of looter, or treasure hunters, that had gotten the artifacts first. But many other sites are first found by the historians who find artifacts and may be take to different museums. The historians can differentiate the differences between the artifacts and the Spainards descriptions of them.               A long time before the Europeans explored North America, there was a group of people living in the Four Corners region, who chose Mesa Verde as their new home. For over 700 years generations lived and made their lives there. But in the late 1200s the moved away. The first Ancestral Peuebloans that lived in Mesa Verdewere known as Basketmakers, for their superb skill at the craft. They had begun to live off farming instead of hunting and gathering. There was a time that their population had multiplied, and houses had begun to be built above ground. After this occured, they had begun to be known as Publoans. Back to the former statement claimed, the Puebloans had begun to move from Mesa Verde, and go to the cliffs around the late 1200s. Nobody knows exactly why they had done that, but all that is known is that there was a drought towaards the end of the 1200s, and that they would not be able to do anymore farming. Nobdy will ever know the whole story and the Puebloans because most of what was important to them perished long ago. When the moved to the cliffs, they used them to their advantage, they had begun to make their homes under the overhanging cliffs. But they only lived there for around 100 years.               There are many stories to a submerged city, and about 40 years ago, it may have been found. The lost city of ATlantis was just a myth, but because of that myth many people kept searching the bottom of the oceanfloor for this grand city. It is believed that this city had been under water for about 5000 years, many experts say that in terms of size and wealth the amount is unforseable. There are other sunken cities around the world, but none seem to be as modern as this city, which is what makes it so unique. The reason that historians believe it was submerged 5000 years ago, is because some of the ceramics found dated back to the end of the stone age, this was over 1200 earlier than they had once thought. This city is very significant because as a submerged site, it had never been reoccupied, unless by fish. Many marine geologists still wonder why the city sank, and they are still trying to figure out why and how. It is a theory that the sea levels had changed, or ground subsidence, which could have had and outcome of a series of earthquakes or tsunami.                   There are many different reasons why archaeologists would be so interested in the past. All that we know is what they have figured out.

Other reasons are because some things might have an explanation for something. I think that some of the discoveries that they make are very important and have a significant meaning to people and are also fun to look at. There a lot of reasons why some of these discoveries are important and mean a lot to some people in the world.           For example some things that they find are historic things that are over hundreds of years ago and are interesting to look at. There have been cases where  archaeologists have discovered things from the dinosaur era to the era of the Mayans. Some of the discoveries they make sometimes have meanings to many cultures and religions. they might have a meaning to one of the gods they believe in or something to do with their religion. Other discoveries have things to do with ancestors of people and how they used to live back then or what they would were.            Archaeologist have been making lots of discoveries for over many years. Discoveries sometimes have an explanation to something like why something occurred, how someone became a ruler, or maybe how something was invented. In my opinion I think that's how information is gathered from the past events and how they occurred is from the discoveries archaeologists make that support the event. Archaeologists discover things that have symbols and pictures that represent something but are written in many types of languages that people used to communicate in. The languages or symbols are hard for them to understand and sometimes miss out on things that might be important or interesting.          Some discoveries that are found by archaeologists are fun and entertaining to look at. Archaeologists sometimes find statues, paintings, cloths, utilities, and sometimes toys that kids used to entertain each other with.  Statues are interesting to watch because you get to see there artistic view and the details they put into them. Their paintings were also a pleasure to see because you would get to see the portraits they painted and wonder who it was. They would also paint symbols that represented their tribes or cultures.The toys that the kids used to entertain each other with are also interesting to look at because you would get to see how their toys were back then.Another thing is that you would get to see how artistic they can get when it comes to entertaining each other. They would use anything they could find and build a toy. They would sometimes even play with rocks and sticks.          Archaeologists work very hard to discover new things and to entertain us with the things they discover. They have made a lot of amazing discoveries that amaze people. Today they are still out in the desserts, mountains, and oceans hunting for new discoveries. Some archaeologists have to survive any type of weather that hits them because they wont give up until they find what they are looking for.

Over the past years,     we have come apond many ancient civilizations. Three in particular are the Inca, Mesa Verde,  and the lost city nicknamed Atlantis. Now the question is what have we learned from them.       First up we have the Inca. When studing the Inca civilization, we have discoved that this small place has been surviving for around a 100 years based on a system called quipus. This is their way of keeping records and making calenders. The incas also used this method of recording for counting cattle and for keeping a diary. So far after many years of studing them we still havent figured out what the colored notes on the quipus represnts, making this civilization more interesting and mysterious. I doesnt really help either that its on top of a dangerous mountain       Next is the MEsa Verde. THe thing about there little world is that it was astablished in AD 550. When claering the sight, arcutecs found many ancient tools, writings, pottery and weapons. They also learned that these ancient people lived in structed pithouses that were clustered together like a community. the mesa verde people lived roughly for 200 years but why. scientist found that they lived so long because of there variety of weapons they have to kill. they taught them selfes to use a bow and arrow and how to throw spears creating a longer civilization.       Lastly we have the alantic city. It was said to be a myth but it turns out it was true. although there isnt any mermaids discovered, there was a discovery of structures  and pottery.

Every past or future ruin can teach incredible amounts of information to archaeologists. In the Inc-an civilization, bodies and artifacts were skillfully preserved, providing awaiting knowledge. Another civilization, the Pueblo-ans, are from thousands and thousands of years ago. The Pavlopetri show insight on the Earth's past geological structure. Whether it be satisfying curiosity, discovering the human roots, or tracing back past landscapes, ancient civilizations contain the necessary pieces to complete history's puzzle.        The Incas were helpful to have kept their civilization in such a condition that benefited archaeologists. Much of there clothing, bodies, and architecture was buries by vast snow up in the mountains. Their clothing speaks of past weather patterns and perhaps extinct animals. Their technology used to produce such may have been more advanced than others around the world. Their ruins inform archaeologists of neighboring regions that left behind nothing. Medical advancements can only be displayed in the form of performed bodies or documents. Their success attempts and past living population helps calculate the number of people today with Inc-an roots. In general, art tells us about their lifestyle; entertainment, responsibility, agriculture, etc. The study of their preserved culture fits the Spaniard and Inc-an puzzle pieces.        As with the Incas, the Pueblo-ans and Pavlopetri were vital to tracing back human roots and evolution. As these civilization began to break tradition and begin new, nomadic lifestyles, archaeologists can further understand the technology advancements of mankind. Rocks used for weapons and other household items hint towards common rock features of the past. The number of bodies and artifacts discovered help historians study the growth of the human population. However, most importantly, is what the Pavlopetri civilization was able to teach. Never had archaeologist been able to discover underwater civilizations, but they did. This drastically changed views of the changing water level in the world. Scientists were now able to study more geographical features and access the climate of the areas. Unlike the Incas, who provided a cultural view, the Pueblo-ans and Pavlopetri informed archeologists and geologists of past climate, weather, landscape, and rocks.        The puzzle is yet to be completed. Upon more advanced technology, the puzzle will continue to grow, as will our history. What will future civilizations think about today? What artifacts of ours will be used? The Incas, Pueblo-ans, and Pavlopetri preserved their culture and way of life for geologists and archaeologist to discover thousands of years later.

In the three following sources, Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, Mesa Verde National Park Puebloans and Their World, and Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets archeologists learn about ancient civilizations and in these sources its extremely apparent that the discoveries made by these archeologists are important to human society.           In the first source written by Beth Gruber archaeologists in Peru learn more about Inca culture which is very important. For instance, Inca's managed to produce textiles and clothing that were very sturdy. This is important because it allows humans to see how their ancestors dressed in the past as well as give modern day cloth makers techniques on how to make more durable clothing. Another example that leads people to believe the archeologists discoveries in Peru were important is that they found preserved bodies in the Andes mountains. This is important because it allowed scientists to learn how people died back then and prevent it from happening now.           In the second source that was illustrated by NPS and Roy Anderson archeologists learn many things about the Puebloans past which are very important today. For example archeologists found that the Puebloans and their descendants lived for seven hundred years building elaborate stone communities in canyon walls. This is important because it allows people to witness how people can settle virtually any environment if they try hard enough. Another instance of archeologists findings in an ancient civilization being important is when they found the kivas. Kivas were very important in Peuoblan culture and it lets people of today see how intelligent the Peubloans were because they were able to create rooms dedicated to worship.            In the third source by Helena Smith archeologists divers explore the ruins of a sunken settlement in Greece which is very important. One reason its important is that the whole settlement which was once on dry land is now underwater. This is important because it inspires more people to explore the sea and believe in myths such as Atlantis. Another reason why this settlement is important is because it lets scientists observe how water could be so dangerous and lead to destruction of entire cities. The settlement for very large so seeing that the whole thing was under water makes scientists want to know how and why.           These discoveries in Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, Mesa Verde National Park Puebloans and Their World, and Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets are very important to human society.

By discovering these civilizations, everyone is able to explore their cultures and have a different way of looking at ideas.   These civilizations had very basic architecture. Architects have   now evolved their ways of creating complex, stable structures.Not only were their buildings basic, but their building materials were also low-tech. Building materials have converted from weak substances like adobe to more sturdier materials like metals, stone, and asphalt. Many advances in architecture have been made since the fall of these ancient civilizations.   The ancient civilizations had created a different religion based   on things they depended on to survive. By finding artifacts of the past, explorers can tell or come up with something to explain some of their religion. If Catholicsm were to end now, one could find a rosary or a cross and assume that they believed in the story of Jesus Christ. If Judeoism were to end now, people could find religious objects like jewish stars or manorahs that help determine what someone's religion was, what they celebrated, and what they believed in. Finding artifacts of these civilizations are important so that people can learn about someone else's views on things such as religion besides themselves.   Finding these artifacts have helped for people to look at things   differently and create thoughts of their own.

Many archeologists study past civilizations like the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.  When we study these civilizations we get to learn many about our past life.      Many artifacts found at these sites can tell us a lot about ways of life back then.  They can tell us whether ancient people had a religion or certain traditions.  The Inca's had a different life style.  They had a complex language and advanced agriculture.  Since the Inca's lived in the high Andes they had a different way of farming. The Inca's had a very interesting culture and the things we learn about it gives us an idea on how things advanced.      The Puebloans also had a unique culture.  The lived in small communities with elaborate buildings.  They did many things like hunting and making necessities like tools and home goods.  They lived in huts called pit-houses, which had the floor sunken in a few feet deep.  Because of there good works with their architecture they were called Basketmakers.  Like most ancient civilizations, the Puebloans had a religion.  They practiced their rituals in temples with chambers for certain things.  Many would go in certian rooms to pray for luck, healing, rain, or a good crop.  The Puebloans with their great architecture and ideas influenced many things from buildings to life skills.      Another important civilization was the Pavloperti.  They were believed to have come from the ancient myth of the sunken city of Atlantis.  Greek mythology says that there was a city that was consumed by the ocean.  Many people today are searching for an answer to see if this legend is true.  So far they have said that they think they might of found the ''lost city of Atlantis''.  Off the coast of Neapolis oceanologists have found ruins of what might be from the sunken city.  The Pavlopeti are believed to be the citizens of the ''sunken city''.      All of these civilizations may not seem that important.

From source one,about the Inca civilizations, it explains how they have found many quipus which were used to record calendars and count livestock. This is an important find because it shows how even back then they would keep track of things. Clues that the Inca have left tell us of their life, religion, art, agriculture, and more. This information lets us know how they were before and what kinds of things they did, like if they did any rituals or how they built. We also find out more about the Inca from oral history that is passed on, that can tell us things we don't know and also preserves its history. Artifacts and any other objects they left behind tells us more like objects that they buried in their graves. Finding bodies from the Inca that are in good shape can be scanned and reveal how they died along with how they lived.                In source two, about Ancestral Puebloans, Mesa Verde National Park preserves this ancient culture. This helps so that we will always have that reminder since it's being preserved. They lived in pit houses, which were usually built on mesa tops or cliff recesses. This shows how they built and maybe their reasons why they built it. The Ancestral Puebloans made pottery, baskets and used the bow and arrow to hunt. This shows that they are artistic and good at making crafts. The structures show evidence of a society  that learned different ways to do things, different traditions, and that they are skillful at building. We also find out other things, like how we know that they had to deal with very cold winters because they had blackened walls because the smoke.                          Source number three tells the reader about  a lost Greek city, and archaeologists amazing discoveries. It has remains from 2800 to 1200 BC, and 'We found ceramics dating back from the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 500 years ago...........' said Henderson. The settlement was preserved because it is in a protected bay, and because of shifting sands. There have been many buildings, courtyards , religious structures, pottery, and maybe a megaron, in the sunken Greek city that have been found. This lost Greek city is thought to be Atlantis, and even if it's a myth it is what encourages underwater searches.

They Inca discovery told us more about their life religion, and more. The Ancestral Puebloans lets us know more about where they lived and what they made.

The Inca did not have a formal alphabet or system of writing. They also made knots in colored string to record the calender. Inca comes from oral history and the stories are passed from generation to generation.The Spaniards visited, but did not speak the Inca language very well. Some materials lasted a long time and some artifacts were in buildings or buried in graves with the dead people. Clothes were usually found and some were in perfect condition but some were water.        The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde means 'green table'. Puebloans means 'Village dwellers'. The are know as basket makers. While they were traveling they would hunt instead of farm. They also learned to make pottery and bows and arrows. They also learned to make a spear. In A.D. 750 Puebloans built houses above ground. A.D. 1000 they advanced in adobes. They also advanced in pottery because when they verily started it, the designs were simple. Now they were so detailed.         The Pavlopetri also known as marine geologist have discovered the lost city of Atlantis. This is probably one of the oldest cities to be discovered. Its 30,000 square meters of ocean floor that is taken up by this city. The Pavlopetri has discovered building, courtyards, main streets, tombs, churches, and some pottery. They think an earthquake or a tsunami occurred Atlantis to fall.Atlantis is still a myth, but people are still trying to discover it.

Artifacts, written languages, and textiles have provided us with knowledge about these ancient civilizations.? Archeologists keep careful records, and get as much information out of the evidence as they can.                                           The Inca of Peru had no form of writing, thus not allowing archeologists to study. By finding out clues from artifacts and their way of life, maybe the archeologists can piece the Inca life together. The Inca artifacts left behind might be objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or sliver, and may be found in buried graves for the dead. This allowed us to research the life style of the Inca.                          The Puebloans chose Masa Verde for their home in A.D. 550. Their skill at craft gave them the name, Bastketmakers. They learned to make pottery, and a more efficient way of hunting, the bow and arrow. Around A.D. 750, they began to build their houses above ground. These homes were build out of poles and mud, often with pit houses. They soon evolved into fifty rooms of stone masonry. The architecture was not the only thing changing. The pottery developed into more intrecut, black designs on a white background. Using the landscape, Puebloans built their dwellings beneath overhanging cliffs. They lived underneath the cliffs for less than one hundred years. They then left Masa Verde and traveled south, leaving their ancient civilization behind.                         The Puebloans society may have been abandoned, but a city has been sunken underwater for a some five thousand years. The secrets hidden in this lost city have inspired the myth of Atlantis.This city was found beneath southern Greece, covering at leas thirty thousand square meters of the ocean floor. The seabed held thousands of shards of pottery and a whole settlement of buildings, courtyards, streets, tombs, and religious structures were discovered.Many of these artifacts date back to the stone age.

With this study we can also learn their language to say read any markings or signs that tell of their past history.

First, the Inca made knots in quipus, which was the first 'counting of livestock.' The Incas left clues behind which helped shape their religion &amp; culture. So the scientist can piece together how their life was. Most of what we know comes from oral history or stories passed down through generations.Most Spaniards that found the Inca civilization could not understand them. Inca's main artifacts were stone, pottery, gold, or silver. The Inca had lived in the high Andes which protected them from other civilization.       Next, Mesa Verde National Park preserves some of the areas where the Puebloans had once lived. The first Puebloans settled there in about 550 A.D. They were best known for their basket making and incredible craft skills. Most of them lived in pit houses. These were house that sank into the ground that were built using mud, wood, and other supplies. In 1000 A.D. they finally started building better structures. Also there were cliff dwellers which lived in the side of a cliff.       Finally, the Palvopetri lived in Southern Greece. They once lived where there is now an ocean. Scientists are still trying to find artifacts to complete there research. There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged city in history. This site of where they lived straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. They have found buildings which help them find more artifacts about this civilization.

They find notes or dairies that they have discovered.They find out what it was like back then and how it effected them and what we can do to not have history repeat it self.                To begin, in ancient Inca of Peru they discovered that they didn't have formal alphabet or a system of writing. The Inca recorded records by using knots in colored string which were called quipus. We've know some of their old stories because the Europeans wrote them down. They also revealed that the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language very well. Our best knowledge on them comes from artifacts and objects left behind like textiles, clothing, and ruins of buildings. Most Inca sites were disturbed by treasure hunters and looters who took anything that they thought was most valuable.              Then, the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde and that's Spanish for 'green table'. Their skill of craftsman ship brought theme the name Basketmakers. The people who lived there changed pole-and-adobe to stone masonry by the time of A.D 1000. The most famous were the cliff dwellings. Cliff dwellers left no records but they also were very skillful at making a living from a difficult environment they were in. Their structure, skill, and traditions were past from generation to generation.             In addition, the secrets of the lost city enhanced myths. There was shiffting sands and the settlement enclosed. This revealed buildings, courtyards,and tombs. There's also thousands of shards of pottery. This Atlantis myth is located near Neapolis in Greece. We still do not understand why this settlement sank but they are still researching it and trying to discover new things.            All and all, these different amazing sites have many different artifacts they found and still looking for. Maybe the Lost City of Atlantis isn't true but we still have yet to find out.

Throughout the years, people have been fascinated with ancient cultures. People dedicate their whole lives to learn about them. These people look for, and find, ancient sites in the most remote places and make important discoveries.         The ancient Inca people settled in the Andes mountains, it most of their history was recorded only orally, so historians weren't sure if they were true or not. According to Beth Gruber, 'The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts.' These objects tell us how the Inca lived, what they believed, and how they survived. Without these important archeological finds, we may have only known what happened to the Inca by false tales.            Another ancient civilization, the Puebloans, strived in Mesa Verde. When scientists discovered the remains of their living arrangements and other buildings, they were amazed at their 'advanced...pole-and adobe construction [and] skillful stone masonry,' according to the National Parks Service. From these sites, archeologists were able to determine the Puebloans were skilled basket makers and potters. They dug up beautiful ceramics created by these ancient people and were amazed at their ability to make these amazing artworks. The Puebloans left no written records, but scientists were able to piece the puzzle together one step at a time, thanks to archaeological sites.              One of the most lasting of all Greek myths, the story of Atlantis has intrigued many. Therefore, archaeologists were delighted when a sparkling city was found underneath the waves of Greece. What they found amazed them. The city was much older then Plato's Atlantis myth! The city was extremely advanced for the time it was built, and made scientists reconsider the intelligence of ancient peoples. 'We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.' says Dr. Jon Henson, co-director of the underwater survey. This suggests that the people of the past were much more advanced than historians originally believed. '...It represents a frozen moment of the past.' said Elias Spondylis, the other co-director of the survey.

The Inca were a civilization of people that lived about a hundred years ago. Puebloans were a group of people that moved to Mesa Verde long before the Europeans explored North America. The Pavlopetri was the name for the sunken city explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archeologists and marine geologist           Discovering the Inca society helped us learn about them more and about their way of life compared to ours. We know about them by artifacts that they left behind. The Inca lived high up in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountains peaks. Inca lived high up in mountains some even lived in caves, and this helps to preserve sites because looters cant get to them because they are high up in the mountain. The Inca fell in in 1532 when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the empire.           The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as basket makers for their skill to craft. Formerly nomadic they began to settle down and started farming which then they didn't have to gather and hunt. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages sometimes built on mesa tops, but mostly on cliff recesses. The population had multiplied, and by about A.D. 750 they began making houses above ground with upright walls. By A.D. 1000 the people from Mesa Verde had advanced in their skill of construction. They began making more villages, but by A.D. 1200 the puebloans moved back into the cliffs we still don't know why but the archeologists are still looking for the answer.           The pavlopetri was a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. This settlement dates back to 5,000 years to the time of homers hero. '...this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr. Jon Henderson. The theories made by marine geologists include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.        These discoveries helped shape history and show what is still there from billions of years ago. The Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are examples of what show people the past.

One reason it is good to know about your history is that so it does not repeat itself and we make the same mistakes. We could even get some ideas from them. They have learned to adopt just like modern day people.          Some things that we have learned about the Incas are that the clues they left behind form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life. The things you will learn will fascinate you.          Some of what we know from Inca history is from oral history. Europeans who arrived in their empire in 1532 described the Inca in their letters and diaries. The rest come from artifacts that could be made from gold, silver, or pottery even if they were buried for hundreds of years. Archaeologists who study these site keep careful records. Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.            About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verda for their home. For more than 700 years this civilization occurred and archaeologists have the artifacts to prove it. We have learned what kind of houses they had, what weapons they used, what they learned to make all from the stuff that people find.           Over the years civilizations begin to change and adopt to their surroundings. One example of this is the Puebloans who change their houses and their scenery. They made new houses that were more stable and livable. They went to the cliff dwellings and then they completely deserted it. Archaeologists are unsure as to why. We will never know the whole story, but we do know that they adopted to whats around them.           An incredible discovery that was made by archaeologists was a city that was submerged completely in water. It is off the coast of Neapolis. They have found ceramics that date back to the end of the stone age, which suggests that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought. The marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Because of the conditions around it the city is basically a frozen moment of the past.

The ancient Inca's left behind clues that archaeologists can study from and see what the Inca's form of religion was, their way of art and architecture, way of agriculture, how they managed their govenrment, how they transported, and finally, their way of life. We know some old stories because they get passed on from generation to generation.           No I'm going to talk about the Puebloans. Puebloans were from Mesa Verde. The Puebloans are 1,400 years old. They even lived before the Europeans explored North America! For about 700 years, maybe more, the descendants lived and flourished in Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde means green table in the Spanish language. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops and sometimes built on cliff recesses.       Finally, I'm going to talk about the Pavlopetri. People have secrets passed on that the Pavlopetri are from Atlantis. Atlantis is supposed to be sunken from many, many years ago. It's located in the waters of southern Greece. It is 30,000 square meters ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It was descended from 1000 BC.       Well, I hope you enjoyed my little article. I hoped I somewhat inspired you to look up these places. And I hope your interested in the whole archaeologist thing. I actually would have a lot of fun being an archaeologist when I grow up. Maybe that's what I'll be!

They did not wright us a single thing so we could see how they lived. Today the only was Archaeologyes cane learn about the Inca is by stoies we got from the Spaniards and artifacts they find. Inca artifacts were made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver and that made it so the artifacts last long. We also find there cothes. the only reason we can still find some of there clothes is because they lived in desrts or cold mountains. Some of the artifacts have been taken by treasure hunter or looters that take stuff that might be of value. The way the Inca people die off was the Spaniards killed the last Inca king in 1532.   The Mesa Verde people were some of the first people to live in North America. The Mesa are mostly known as basketmakers because they had great crafting skilles. With that skill they didnt hunt as much they farmed and gatherd mostly everything they needed.the people population multiplied over and over agen for some reason we dont really under stand. The people lived on cliffes or mounton tops.but the Mesa Verde left to travel south to New Mexico and Arizona were they soon die off.   The greek whad made the oldest town known to man the bad part is its under water.the greeks were some great people that made many things we us today.We do not know why this great city has went under water or what mad it go under yet.   many Archaeologyes go diving to look and pull back up some of the things left behind by the greeks.

But, really, history is extremely important to our future. The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important because it shows us how ancient civilizations used to be.   From the Incas, we have learned how they kept their records, with knotted string. These knots of string were called quipus. Though, not many can read the colored string, we know that they were used to keep the calender and keep count of livestock. We have learned that many artifacts that have been found were buried with the deceased, these have provided the best idea of the life in Peru before and during the Inca rule. We have also learned how many of them died, due to preservation in the icy Andes. The bodies of the Inca were preserved in caves in cliff faces mainly, so looters could not get to them. The mountains, with their icy cold weather, can act as a freezer, leaving the bodies of the Inca in such good shape that experts may use modern medical scanning.   From the Puebloans, we have found how they lived in places called pithouses, a living room suck a few feet in the ground with four corner timbers supporting the roof. Later, around A.D. 750, the Puebloans began constructing houses above ground. The houses were built wall to wall in long, curving rows, often with a couple pithouses out front. The walls of the houses/buildings are known as the finest built in Mesa Verde because of the straight edges of the carefully shaped stones. For a time, the Puebloans were known as the Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Later on, pottery became more popular and baskets made a decline in quality. Mesa Verde had two major population shifts, one between A.D. 1100, and A.D. 1300, the other in A.D. 1200. The latter caused people to move back into cliff alcoves, though the sure reason is unknown.   The discoveries of the Pavlopetri are also significant. Evidence has been found on the 'oldest submerged town in the world,' and it's still the most well preserved. This town is expected to be the home of an elite, which raises the status of it exponentially. The submerged 'frozen moment of the past' has baffled archaeologists with how much information has been preserved. Only just recently have we been able to survey the ruins of the ancient city. Ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age suggests the settlement was occupied around 5,000 years ago. Many discoveries offer information about when the settlement was above water, and tells of possible other groups, for example, the Mycenaean Society. Not only is this underwater city an intrest because it reveals how people lived back then but it also intrigues natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow. Also fascinating, this area predates Plato's writing of the sunken continent Atlantis.   In conclusion, all of these discoveries are extrememly important by telling us of the past. By learning from the past, people can predict more about the future. All of these ancient civilizations failed in some shape or form and we could avoid these same mistakes by studying them.

It is important to learn about all of the ancient civilizations because when we learn more about the ancient civilization we can understand more about how we came to be or how they lived.                  When we find out more about about how the people of the ancient time lived we can put the pieces together so to speak and discover how our ancestors came to be and how the minds of people changed. In source one the Ancient Inca used string to record days and any kind of counting. The string was knotted to count days or to just keep track of counting for math. So in this ancient civilization math grew and prospered.                   In source number two archaeologists discovered buildings called Pithouses. Pithouses featured a living room, some might have contained storage bins or pits. The sipapu was a hole for a way to the underworld, from which people had once come from. Later on a Kivas was built, the Kivas was a ceremonial room which was built as underground chambers that later where churches.Ancient Puebloans might have practiced healing rights or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or for a good crop. The religion and buildings where what prospered.                   In source three the thing that prospered was findings that helped rebuild a city. The ancient Greek city that had submerged beneath the Atlantic Ocean. The city is said to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. The city was well kept by shifting sands, and the protected bay help archaeologists find buildings and roads and all kinds of structure along with many shards of pottery. The site had 'potential insights into the working of the Mycenaean society.' 'It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied.' So the city was never reoccupied was sea life or any life at all. Marine geologists still do not know how the city sank. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.'                     In this passage I have explained what prospered in different ancient times and how each of the civilizations prospered. But also how the civilizations affected us or our time.Each time before our own has a story and that story can be lost but could also be found. History affects us even today, what ever happened long ago still has effect today.

If it wouldn't be for the artifacts found from people many years ago, we probaby wouldn't know as much as we know now. Artifacts from the past life, tell us how people lived. Scientists studied artifacts found, for a very long time to learn as much as they could about it. We've learned about how people hunted, and lived just from buildings, clothes, bowls, and even journals found. Journals have told us stories about peoples lives and stuff they made, but sometimes it was in a language that nobody could understand. We have learned a lot more about the alphabet and who has started many things like pottery, bows, and arrows. If it wasn't for the people before, leaving their stuff beind, we wouldn't know anything about history and there would most likely be a lot more world problems. There were artifacts from farming left behind, that probably taught more and more people how to farm. Legends were passed on, which makes you wonder what is true, ad what is added on everytime someone tells the legend. People from the past have taught scientists many things and caused many mysteries that may never be figured out, but they're all very important. I believe that just knowing about history and civiliazations is just a good thing to know about.

Why do I say this? well without the discovery of these civilizations there would be a huge gap in history. The discoveries may have filled in those gaps of time. These civilizations helped us understand more about them. They could also possibaly help us learn more for future discoveries.        The Inca lived High in the mountains and prosbered. They lived so high in the Andes that the bodies could be preserved by the cold conditions, and looters could not reach the bodies so the bodies were undisturbed. Most of the Inca civilization was left undisterebed and that means that todays archaeologists could observe how the people lived. This means that they can learn about past history and things created to help every day live.   The Puebloans also showed us how they lived. The information and objects they left behind showed us a lot about them. By the information given from the article 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World' we know that the were nomadic people. The were nomadic for a little bit, but then they were trying a more settled way of life. They built Pithouses to support them selfs in their enviroment, these Pithouses later became Kivas. So without the Puebloans Kivas would never have been made. They learned how to make pottery and soon made weapons that we all know today such as bows and arrows.        These are reasons why the discovery of these civilizations were important. These civilizations helped with todays tools and weapons. They also help identify different ways to look at how people prosbered and lived.

The Inca's left many ancient artifacts such as stone, pottery, gold, or silver that last a long time even if they been buried. Archeologist have found bodies in the icy Andes that are in good state that they can learn how the people lived, and how they died. Incas left many interesting items for archeologist like art, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way they lived this tells you on what they had, and how there culture may of been. The Incas made a quip's that records a calendar to keep count of there livestock no one really uses one today since no one may know what the knots mean.Though it seems like it could be a regular calendar only without the livestock and colorful strings.   The discoveries that the Puebloans made were on how they made things or buit them. Puebloans built houses out of mud and poles that were up against each other. Later on by A.D. one thousand people started to advance on how they built there houses. They used stone masonry, and wall that were thick, double coursed stone that were often up to two or three stories high. Though something changed in A.D. twelve hundred people started to move back into the cliffs that sheltered their ancestors before.

In this article will be information on three very important human civilizations; the Inca, the Puebloans, and what many think could have been what inspired Homer to create his lost city of Atlantis.          One of the three ancient civilizations is the Inca. The Inca were important because they were a giant civilization that according to the article 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past' by Beth Gruber on paragraph 2 'For nearly a hundred years (1438-1532) Ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome'. The end of the Inca empire is easy to date because the Spaniards killed the last Inca king but the beginnings are harder to date. In that time period the Inca lived high in the Andes so many of the artifacts are well preserved and we can learn many things from them.          Another ancient civilization were the Ancestral Puebloans who left great reminders of their civilization in Mesa Verde. The Puebloans started out in little cliff alcoves but little by little they started developing pithouses that changed to kivas eventually. The Ancestral Puebloans were skilled basket makers and created great houses on the Mesa Verde. At about A.D. 1200, for reasons unknown, the people moved to the cliff alcoves that had sheltered their ancestors before.          The lost city of Atlantis may be fake but one thing we know for sure is that it could be based off of a real city that sunk. The city Pavlopetri has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 B.C. and is off of the coast of southern Peloponnese. The city is believed to have sunken at about 1000 B.C. and was never reoccupied so the houses and everything else is frozen at that time.          All of these societies are important because they all have something that they can contribute to our world history. these cities can show us what life was like back then and can help us understand the world around us.

I think that because we don't know much about their civilizations. The artifacts help us know: how they lived, what they hunted/ate,and maybe how they died.       By finding the Inca and Mesa Verde civilizations we can learn where they lived,and how their houses were built. The artifacts found help us greatly to learn about the people of Mesa Verde, or the life of the Inca. That is why the artifacts found in the ancient ruins of the Inca and Mesa Verde are important.       Some of the major artifacts we have found about the Inca are: Textiles and clothing, and knots in string for counting livestock or used as calenders.       Some stuff we found in the Mesa Verde places are: The baskets that made them known as 'basket weavers', pottery, bow and arrow, and the atlatl (spear thrower).       Another ancient civilization is the Ancestral Puebloans or 'Cliff Dwellers'. They left no written records and much that was important to their lives has perished. We have however found their structures that have helped us learn about their lives.       Kivas were the ancient Puebloans ceremonial rooms or churches, they used them to:   pray for rain, used them for healings, Prayed for luck in hunting, or a good crop. These structures help us know a little about their daily life.       The artifacts we find are very important in learning about the Inca, Mesa Verde, and Puebloans are the only things we can use to learn about them. These people left no written records, so how else are we to learn about them? The artifacts they left behind are all we have in learning about them.

They created our language and created our religion. Without ancient civilizations we might be the ones to have to create everything. I don't even know if we'd be living had it not been for ancient civilizations. In this article I'm going to be talking about 3 important ancient civilizations: the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.        Would you ever like to live on a mountain with a very cold climate? I didn't think so, but the Inca thought differently. The Inca lived in the mountains of the Andes, and that's how we know so much about them. The freezing weather has preserved artifacts and even bodies really well- so well that we can use modern medical scanners to learn how the people died or even how they lived. Some of what we know, though, has come from stories passed from generation to generation. Since they didn't have any archives or even an alphabet for that matter, historians don't really know much about their civilization except for what's in stories and what the artifacts show.        The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. But, now, nobody knows the Inca language so nobody knows what the knot means and nobody can read the stories tied into the colorful strings. Ince artifacts might be objects made from stone, gold, or silver. Some archaeologists have found artifacts in the ruins of buildings but, others were found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. That is important because it gives historians an insight on their religion, and what kind of lives the Inca might have lived to be able to make things out of gold and silver.        The Puebloans of Mesa Verde, were very good at basketmaking. They also replaced hunting and gathering with farming. This is very important because it tells us a little bit about how they lived, or what their lives were like. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops. Puebloans also learned to make pottery and they acquired the bow and arrow, which was a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. That is important because it shows that they don't spread out, and they were all just one big heard of people- they were nomadic afterall. Some historians might also find their pithouses important, because their was a hole for passage to the underworld called that 'sipapu.' That gives insight on their religion and on, once again, how they lived.        The findings of the Pavlopetri are very important. Geologists have found a megaron, which is a monumental strucure with a large rectangular hall, which means that the town might have been used by an elite. That tells us that the people who lived their were probably high status or were rich in some way. Geologists have found ceramics which dated back to the end of the stone age, and from that we can learn in what era these people lived.  That gives us an idea of how their life was like or how they lived.

The ancient civilization helped improve on how we live, starting with where is the right place to build your house. You couldn't just make a house where ever you want. You have to have the right level and far enough from water. if your hows was too close to the water your house would be flooded every time it rain. Us today didn't discover that. People in the ancient civilization discovered that. The Inca lived high in the Andes and worshiped some mountain peaks. Most of their sites are in remote high places. The Inca lived in high places because it was harder for enemies to get to their houses and attack their families.   On the other hand, the Pueblians were an amazing discovery. The Puebloans learned to make pottery and the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than a spear. The Puebloans made a house called the pithouses. The pithouses, people lived in pithouses from A.D. 550 to A.D 750. The living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbers supported the roof. There was a fire pit had an air deflector. The people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and -adobe construction to skillful stone. The walls were thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stores high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, the population may have reached several thousands. ABout A.D. 1200, another major population came, and people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Archarologists still don't know why they moved, they thing it could of been for defense; or it was for religious or pshychological reasons; perhaps alcoves offered better protection from the elements.

Through reading these excerpts, I havae come to the conclusion that the discoveries are not only fascinating, but also very important to learn more about the history of ancient civilizations and how their ways of doing things can benefit us.                Back in the times of the Incans, history was often communicated through stories pasted down generation after generation. Source #1 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past', goes on to say that, ' Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history.' I still think that it is important to tell stories because, like what happen to the Inca's, your language could eventually be lost and all you have to go off of is the stories that have been past down ' from generation to generation'.                From Source #2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World',  I found that ancient Puebloans lived in pithouses. Without archaeologists finding  evidence that led them to the conclusion that Puebloans lived in pithouses, perhaps many of the modern day architecture could not have been built. A lot of people would like to find out who their ancesctors are, without the discoveries found about the Pueabloans, many of today's Puebloans wouldn't know why they live where they do, how their ancesctors lived, or how to preserve many of the things they did, such as being able to construct ' skillful stone masonry', and their pithouses.

Learning about these discoveries will tell us how and who lived before us. These will help us in the future and past.       Learning thing like ancient Inca didn't have a formal alphabet or that they didn't have a system of writing is important because we know now that our alphabet didn't come from them. It shows how things became how it is now, and that is why history is so important.       Finding out how they lived in there houses and why they had there houses like that, shows us why we do or dont have our houses like that.

For one the Inca has no system of writing unlike us today. Let me explain the ancients to you in my multi-paragraph article which i did NOT volunteer for.                 The Inca was a very interesting civilization which suprisingly survived for a time without a written language. The inca did not have an alphabet or written languague which is crucial in life for us today. I could just imaginge how hard it must have been for the civilization to communicate with each other if they weren't in the same area (such as letter or any other kind of distant communication). We know alot from the civilizations by artifacts or other thing left behind. It tells us what kind of people they were and from other documented journals from europeans that invaded them we can tell there history. The Inca is a great civilization but what else can we tell from them besides language.                Archaeologists can learn and compare from artifacts and sites with the spaniards accounts of the Inca. Such artifacts can help determine the origins of the Inca and the area where they are from. The landscapes and stuff left behind can tell us what kind fo farming technique they used and if they were farmers or hunters and gathers. The Inca were high up on the mountains in the andes so archaeologists must climb high mountains with all there stuff.                   Archaelogists must be both fit and smart to do there work.   Above all they must be very carefull with there artifacts and fossils because they could break. I think archaeologists have to do work that are harder for modern people to handle.

Looted sites often do not tell much to archaeologist.. Another example is the Mesa Verde National Park, which is a spetacular reminder of the ancient culture of the Puebloans. The Puebloans left no written records and most of their life has perished. There is also the discovery of the underwater city of atlantas that has brought some light on the ways of  the people that lived there, how they lived and what they lived in.

They mainly looked for things from the Ancient Incas, Ancestral Puebloans, and the Lost Greece City.        The Ancient Incas were the a bit different then the other civilizations. For example, they didn't have a written language , they lived high in the mountains , and used colorful knots to keep track of dates. Bodies of the Incas were also found in large ice caps because of the weather. Archeologists used modern scanning equipment to learn how they died.

On the other hand Ancesternal Publoans were from Mesa Verde 'green table' and lived in a deserted area.

Archeologist are able to know what years the Inca ruled because they were able to find information such as religion, art, transportationa, and other things too. Understanding the language of the Inca was difficult becasue the Spaniards didn't understand the language very well, which made it hard for the archeologist to know what it ment. Materials such as clothing and textiles helped archeologist know what type of clothes they would wear. The weather helped to preserve many of these objects. In mountains, bodies were found in well shape because caves worked like freezers that kept everything as it is. Any object that archeologists would find helped to find out any information about the Incas.                 For instance, Puebloans were the first to settle in Mesa Verde. The discoveries that archeologist found in Mesa Verde are important because it shows how things used to work out back in time. Pithouses were the places were the people lived. Pithouses consisted of  a living room sunk a few feet  in the ground, four corner timbers to support a roof, a firepit, and a sipapu that was a passage to the underworld. Kivas were Hopi word for ceremonial room. Kivas were gathering places and sometimes also places to weave. Fires were built in the summer were mainly for cooking. Cliff dwellers left no written records so it was a little difficult to find a lot of things.                 Pavlopetri was explored by  an Anglo-Greek team of archeologist. It is 30,000 square meters and it was consumed around 1000 BC. Archeologists were able to find buildings which was a way of knowing how and what way they lived. The bulidings helped to find out the stucture of how they would build their buildings. Marine geologist are still tring to figure out wht the town sank. Some reasons archeologist thought that the town sanl was because of the cange in sea level, earthquakes, and tsunamies.

The rediscovery of these unfamiliar tribes had shaken the way that scientists think about the past.  The discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have shown us the past itself.   From studying the Inca, archeologists have learned that they lived in different climates, from the desert to the jungle or mountains.  Scientists have found out that Incan tribes kept records with string, as they had no alphabet.  The archeologists who have studied the Inca have found out the Spanish conquerors killed the last king of the Inca's, leading to the destruction of the empire.  To the north of the Inca, the Puebloans had lived for nearly as long, and for hundreds of years before North America was colonized by Europe.   The discovery that the Puebloans had been living in the side of a cliff had shown scientists how people without the 'modern' knowledge had lived.  Based on what was left in the cliff dwellings, archeologists have made several discoveries.  One is that they both hunted farmed for their food.  The pottery depicted the everyday life ofthe Puebloan.  One last discovery was that the Puebloans moved several times in their history.  One century, they lived in undergound house, the next was above ground, a few centuries later they lived in a cliff.  The next civiliation has had a major relocation, more so then the Puebloans.

Pieces of pottery, tons of building and more have caught the eye of many explorers.  Scientists believe that a large earthquake or tsunami sunk and/or flooded the city.

These discoveries made about the civilizatons, are important because they help archaeologist learn more about the past world.            Incan artifacts perserve really well, thanks to the freezing temperatures in which they were buried in. 'Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well.' (Source 1) Through these clothes we can see what the climates of the past were. We can also see when certain kinds of materials were discovered. ' As such it represents a frozen moment of the past.' ( Source 3). All of these artifacts help them. Since thee Incans lived up high in the Andes, some bodies have been perserved. these bodies can help them know how they lived. (Source1 ) ' ...are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation' ( Source 2) When archaeologist found puebloans houses, they compared them and found that the houses were increasing in stability. through this we can see how skills were passed on.            As  you can see, these ancient artifacts have taught us alot about the people who handled them and the they lived in.  We can learn about how they lived, the climate, and much more.

The Inca, the puebloans, and the pavlopetri. I believe that the ancient civilizations were important because it helped explain to humanity how life and the culture was back the in the past.         The Inca were a proud civilization and lived in harsh climates in the mountains. Many of its artifacts have been found high in the andeas mountains where the incas used to live. Matierials such as gold and silver were looted by grave theifs. the last inca king was killed and the inca civilization was extinct.         The Puebloans were called Anasazi. They were modern descendents now call ancestral. They were known for basket making and very skilled. They lived in small villages and small clusters of people. Puebloans were hunter gatherer societies and their advancements in life taught them how to make bows and arrows and pottery.          The Pavlopetri were Greeks who lived in this great city that was believed to sink to the bottom of the coast of was is southern greece. The city was near Neapolis and was very wealthy. The seabed of the ocean was scatterd with pottery and graves.           In conclusion the Ancient civilizations helped us make our techonological advancements.

One of the main reasons is to learn what our ancestor did and use it in our daily lives. Some ancient civilizations that has made an impact in our lives are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. We learn what they have done and try to fix their way of living into our lives. During the time we try to discover these civilizations, we also need to edit what we do to handle the situation. Discoveries like these can help us determine our understanding and thinking of our ancestors.       Our ancestors have always had an reason in order to do something. For example, the Inca never really had a formal alphabet or system of writing, but instead they used knots to keep track of stuff. And still, they could run a big empire. But why knots? They could have used anything else but they chose knots as their communication. Also, how did they ever become a big empire without the use of words. If archaeologist had known the reason why our ancestors did this, we can use it to also have a big strong community or country. Another example are the Puebolans in Mesa Verde. They left for a strange reason in 1300 A.D. There are many theories why they left, like a drought and crop failures; but they have already survived many droughts. Maybe the soil depleted and they had to leave. Whatever the reason we can still learn from their mistake. If the soil had depleted, we can tell scientists to find ways for the soil we have now not to deplete too. We can prepare for a drought and crop failures. There is so many things to learn about our ancestors, but we can never learn it completely. Like for the discovery of the Pavlopetri. Though they made huge discoveries, archaeologists still haven't discovered even 1% of the ocean floor. Because of this, people are more eager to discover more about our world. To do that they need the technology. We now have scuba divers and submarine to explore the vast ocean. So as the demand for new discoveries increase, our technology will also dramatically increase. So curiosity has driven our world forward.       For now, we literally don't know anything about our ancestors. We can only guess what they did.  So, we need the technology so we can be most accurate as we can be in our theories. The discoveries we make can ultimately determines what our society will be like. If we had not even bothered in finding out about our ancestors, we wouldn't know a lot of our basic methods until we have to find the solution ourselves. So why are our discoveries of ancient civilization so important? It is because we can learn from them and use them in our daily life.

Most things we know about them is though the word of mouth. Which is always bended and stretched. But recently we discovered many things about the Inca. The Inca ran a whole tribe ran by knots in colorful stings. That is how they counted and kept track of everything. They also praised and looked to the mountain peaks as a religious symbol. For important rulers they made graves and buried them high in the mountains. This makes it hard for grave robbers to reach and destroy.       The Peubloans lived in the Mesa Verde and made their lives there. They were known as Basket makers, because of their skill at the craft. They lived in Pithouses in crowed villages on the top of mesas. The bow and arrow was their main weapon and hunted skillfully with. The Peubloans were a very strong tribe that their story will live on.       Finlay the Pavlopetri. The lost city of Atlantis is a myth that many people know about. But its just a myth, right?

What happened to these lost civilizations?               The Incans had a giant empire and how conquistadors took them out so easily?

The Anchient Puebloans at Mesa Verde why did they leave. Possibly it was because the resources were depleted, or religous resons no one knows for sure. But in the hieght of the civilization is crazy.

The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about that time. Their main craft was as basket makers. They started of nomadic, but as they grew and their culture matured they begin to lead a more settled life. A lot of  other things changed also including their means to get food. Farming replaced hunting and gathers their main source. They learned to make pottery and the bow an arrow replaced their signature tool of a spear thrower to hunt the atlatl. Most of their houses and living areas were found in cliff recesses, but sometimees mesa tops clustered with small pint house villages.       In times like these they lived a fairly prosperous and decent life as basket makers. Their population multiplied and their living resources expanded. They began building houses above ground with supported upright walls made out of poles and mud. the houses were built right next to each other. From here on these people are known as puebloans, a Spanish word meaning'village dwellers.'       As with and group or walk of like the only thing left to do was to succeed in more growth. Between A.D. 1100 and 1300 which was known as ' The Classic Period' the population increases to the thousands, and a more advanced home was created. It consisted of compact villages of many room, with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls instead of out in the open. The stone walls of the large pueblos are  regarded as some of the finest.       since the beginning of times we as a people have known what to do in order  to survive , what to in order for our world to become the great one that it is today.

These discoveries have been made by archaeologists traveling the world to find the artifacts needed.   While exploring the area where the ancient Inca lived, archaeologists discovered some amazing things. They discovered that since the Inca did not have a language or writing system, they made knots in colored strings to keep a count on livestock. The Inca also left behind clues as to how they lived. Textiles and clothing survived by being perserved in dry deserts and the cold mountains of the Andes. Even though some artifacts have been stolen by treasure hunters or looters, archaeologists still managed to find these clues to the ancient Inca.   The ancient Puebloans lived 1,400 years ago. They were mainly basketmakers. They lived in structures called pithouses. These structures had four corner timbers that supported the roof. They eventually advanced to skillful stone masonry instead of pole-and-adobe construction.   There have always been many cities n Greece, but when archaeologists dove under the surface of the water, they found something that no one had ever seen before. They discovered a lost city! This lost city was probably the exact city that inspired the Atlantis stories that people tell over and over again. The site of the city is about 30,000 square meters. It is located off the southern Peloponnese. Archaeologists believe it was consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Marine archaeologists had to find help in technology to survey the city. This may be a huge discovery, but there is still about 99% of the ocean floor to explore.   Archaeologists traveling the world have found so many discoveries.

There were many civilizations that were formed thousands of years ago. The main three ones were studied by archaeologists.These places have so much history that you would wanna know more about the discoveries about them. So I am gonna tell you how important they are and how they survived.          The first reason why Inca's are so important because they have a lot of legends left behind.The Inca's were very working people; they would built stuff, make stuff and were very good at some stuff and not a lot of other people could do. The Inca lives high in the Andes and they might of owned one of the mountain peaks.Europeans were the first people to discover them. The Europeans arrived in the empire in 1532. They described the Inca's in letters and diaries.          The second reason why Puebloans are important because they had an interesting life.   Archeologists called these people Anasazi, it means the 'ancient enemies'. But we all call them Ancestral Puebloans because of their modern descendants. They first settled in Mesa Verde; and they are known as basket makers because of their skills at the craft. Farming was replaced for hunting and gathering as their main live hood. They lived in small villages, usually would built stuff. Puebloans use to built their houses under ground and from there on theses people were known as Puebloans, which means 'village dwellers'.         The last reason why Pavlopetri are important is because there were a lot of secrets left and you would wanna know how those secrets inspired many people. Secrets under water were found; dates back from 5,000 years ago. Archaeologists found many stuff from the past. Marine geologists have been working out there to know why the settlement sank. This was the first time a city has sunken and has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical story of the sunken continent of Atlantis.         Now you know why the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important. As you can tell they had a ruff life and it wasn't easy.

On the article, 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secret of the Past' that ancient Inca of peru had no formanl alphabet or systemk of writing. They did not leave us archives for historians to study. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts of Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.

They write down and photgraph any artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. they need to learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence.        On the second article, 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' the discover that about 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde abput A.D. 550. However, by A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole and adobe construction to skilful stone masonry.

Here they examine artifacts and/or ruins to find out how ancient civilizations lived.       The Inca was a Native American tribe that resided in the Andes mountains in South America. Archeologists have asked people with Inca blood to tell stories about their traditions. By doing this, they have learned a lot about the Inca's ways. Second, archeologists have examined ancient artifacts and belongings. This suggests that they can learn about what the Indians used as tools. Finally, archeologists use satellite imaging to look at ancient ruins. Like the Inca, the puebloans have some archeologists of their own.       The Puebloans lived in the Southwest in places called cliff dwellings. Cowboys first stumbled upon these ruins  in the late 19th century. The puebloans had ladders to reach their homes, which held a couple thousand residents. Pottery was also beautiful, with lots of drawings and decorative designs. The homes also had chimneys and air vents, which were very advanced at the time. In the next paragraph, archeologists may be on the brink of uncovering Atlantis.       Atlantis is a lost Greek city buried beneath the water. Taken by the sea in 1,000 BCE by an earthquake or tsunami, it is the oldest lost city in the ocean.  Archeologists flocked to the area when ruins were found by an oceanographer making depth charts. The tides, which caused sand to shift, revealed many artifacts and city ruins. There was even pottery which dated from 5000 BCE, a lot earlier than the archeologists thought. Today, the exploration is still going on, and there is a lot more to uncover.       The Inca, Puebloans, and Atlantis all keep archeologists busy.

However clues left behind allow archaeologist and others piece together details of ancient life.           Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. The rest of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from sites where artifacts are found. Inca artifacts include objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and photograph and artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record, only making fact, more true.           About 1,400 years ago, the Puebloans chose Mesa Verde as their home. They flourished here, and eventually built elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, they left their homes and moved away. Puebloans are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. Archaeologists and others have been able identify all these attributes due to artifacts left behind and preserved.           About 5,000 years ago, a group of people know as the Pavlopetri strove. They lived in an area of about 30,000 square meters in southern Peloponnese. Today that sight has been found underwater, and has allowed marine geologists to study the ancient civilization.           Discoveries about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because it has allowed people to understand how civilization has evolved. Civilization started small, but grew and grew until what it is today. These ancient civilizations show that and tell a tale of how they lived.

They had no alphabet or system of writing, and they used strings to keep records. No one today knows what the knots mean, so we do not know what really happened. But, we do have clues. There is history passed down orally from generation to generation, and there are stories written down by the Europeans. The rest of our knowledge comes from artifacts, such as objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Inca textile and clothing has been preserved because of the deserts in Peru. These clues can help us compare the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca.            The discoveries of these civilizations are very important. Archaeologists have aqquired artifacts and information about these settlements, and are learning more and more about it everyday. There are some issues when it comes to searching for clues, like people stealing artifacts, weather conditions, and even geopgraphical conditions. In the future, we will probably discover more and more lost civilizations and will discover more and more about them.

In Source #1 it was about how in a desert there were findings of all sorts. They we preserved because of the desert. The desert was able to keep the things dried out and well preserved. this was a crustal part of their discovery, because the archeologists were then able to use these items to help them with putting together the past.        In Source #2 was the discovery of buildings. People found different things that are bigger. They found things like there homes. This was an important finding because it helped astronomers see what it would be like back then. They were able to then see what the mothers and the fathers did, how their house was set up.        In Source #3 was under the ocean. Trained scobadivers went under to see what they could find. It turns out that there was an under sea city. They were able to find a lot of things. The bad thing was however that some of the stuff got rusted out, because of all the salt water. This under water city was found just near Neapolis, Greece.         There has been a lot found, but there still is a lot of undiscovered things that may or may not change the way that they have thought of the time back then.

The discoveries of the Inca's are important because they let us know about how they keep track of everything and how early inventions was made. They used knots in colored strings called Quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The Inca's used stone, pottery, gold, or silver to make artifacts. Archaeologists had been told about the life before and during Inca rule by the different artifacts that they all found.In the first source I read called 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secret of the Past' it states that it's important to know the discoveries of the Inca's because we should know about how a civilization formed and what happened to it.        The discoveries of the Puebloans that I read about are also important to know about because we should learn about how they lived and how difficult things were back then. The source that I read about the Puebloans stated that the Puebloans lived in hand-made homes called Pithouses which was later made into Kivas. Kivas are named by a Hopi word meaning Ceremonial Room. Underground chambers was turned into churches. Puebloans used Kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. The sipapu hole would allow them to go to the underworld. They mostly built sandstones as big as a loaf of bread to make a building. Fires would burn throughout the village during winter, leaving the Puebloans suffering in the cold. The way Puebloans lived was terrible compared to the present day.        It is important to know about the Pavlopetri because it is good to know about how cites are lost at sea. The city that I read about was the city of 'Atlantis'. The myth was sort of true but wasn't exactly accurate. The settlement sank by possible earthquakes and tsunamis. Because of the shifting sand, the remains of the city was roaming around the sea which sort of makes it harder for archaeologists. The city of Atlantis are yet to be fully discovered.        In conclusion, the discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri because we should know about how the ancient people back in the days lived and how we are trying to find answers about lost things. So basically, the history of the past is very important to present day.

We need to discover things about them because they can show us things that are bad in history. We don't want to make the same mistakes.           Firstly, the Incas tried to fight people with better technology. This meant instant death. If we went to war with some people with laser guns and antimatter rays, we would be dead in seconds. The Incan story is just a way to tell us what not to do. If we don't bother, then we could become just like the Incans and die out. But if we try to be smart, and look at the past, we can actually live for our full life.       Secondly, the Puebloans. They lived in a cliffside manner. This meant that they could be easy target, because they are already cornered. If you lived in a cliff, then you are impossible to sneak up on, but then you will be easily killed. This means that if we can find more strategic, safe places to dwell, then we will not be repeating history. Also, the Pavlopetri are a good example of geographical placement. If they had decided to live on some dirt, not sand, then they would not have drowned. This is a good example of geography playing a part in history. If they had been higher up, they would have a city full of people and a bunch of descendants.       Some may say that there is no way that there is any place more advanced then America, and that cities nowadays don't fight each other. But Hitler in world war one is a great example of history's part in modern time. If Hitler had read about Napoleon's march to Russia, and how it failed, then he would not have repeated the history and been defeated. He could have tried a different way, and probably succeeded.       These are all examples of history being useful. If we didn't listen to these 3 stories, then we would be part of England, or not exist at all. If history is useless, then why do people still listen? It can be interesting, and it can save lives.

These colored strings were called quipus. Archeologists also found artifacts that were made up of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. These objects lasted a long time which is why its still in good condition. They found other objects buried in graves so the dead could use it in it's afterlife. Inca clothing were still in good shape, although it should've been damaged by dampness it was preserved in cold mountains or in dry deserts. When Inca people passed away they would be buried in caves or on mountain tops. The bodies would be buried on mountain tops because the temperature helps preserve them, they act like giant freezers.       Discoveries made about the Puebloans is important because they are known for their skillful basket making art. They farmed instead of hunting and gathering. Farming also counted for their diet. They created the bow and arrow which was more useful than the atlatl which was a spear thrower. They built houses above ground with upright walls made up of poles and mud. There houses were built mostly by cliffs.There named after the spanish word which means, village dwellers. Their pottery upgraded from simple and easy designs on a dull background to black drawings on a white background. As the population grew, their houses and homes were being downgraded because there were more pottery which meant less work for the crafty work. Although, as centuries went by skills and traditions were being used and passed on from generation to generation.       Discoveries made about the Pavlopetri is important because it shows that this was how the fable of Atlantis began. This is the oldest sucken town in the world. The underwater discovery is 30,00 square meters off the southern Peloponnese. It was underwater since 1000 BC. Because of shifting sands and being in a protected bay area, archeologists dsicovered buildings, courtyards, main streets, tombs and religious structures made up of rock. There was also alot of broken pottery. The town was used by an elite, they think this because they found a monument with a large rectangular hall.

Incas had lived in high in the mountains and worshiped moutain peaks and had a amazing portrait of their religion, art and argiculture, government, transportation, and the way of life.

Also, sometimes history repeats itself and if we know how it was ended or fixed in the past then we have experience to do it now. Another reason is that if something unusual or uncommon appears to exist then scientists can conduct more research and find out more about it which can bring up myths and legends that didn't appear to exist before.       Among the years history can repeat itself. For instance, the blizzard that occurred about 35 years ago had the most snow and no one thought it would happen again. However, in January we had Superstorm Nemo. About 35 inches of snow came down. However, the precautions used back in around 1978 were suggested again because that's how that got through it and since we had experience with events like that we know what to do. In the article archaeologists are researching the existences of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri before they have been taken over by different peoples. They didn't leave any archives for historians to study and learn from so now we know to write archives and leave behind photos so just in case our civilization goes extinct another can find our clues and learn from our mistakes and keep their civilization healthy.       If something unusual or uncommon appears to exist, then surely scientists can research it and see if it's true or false. For example, the undersea city found beneath the waters off southern Greece. It dates back some 5,000 years that it hasn't yet been discovered until about 40 years ago. Now scientists are testing the proof of Atlantis, a city that supposedly sunk decades or centuries ago. Maybe scientists will find proof of fictional characters as well. There will always be mysteries in our world, it just takes patience and dedication to solve it.       Discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because it helps us learn about the world's history and what is true and what isn't. I think this because many lies, rumors, myths, legends, and fables are passed down from generation to generation. Nobody knows for sure if they are real or made up unless it's proven by scientists. The expression, ' seeing is believing,' really takes place in my generation. Photographs can be edited by a computer to make it seem real, or photoshopped.       The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important to us because it helps us learn about our world's history and what exists and what doesn't. In addition to this, history tends to repeat itself among the years and if we have experience which we can learn from history then we know how to fix the issue or move on through it.

Many archaeologists have found them. But even trying to find them has taken them years and years of hard work. These are extremely major findings in archaeological history.       Lets start out with the Inca tribe. This was tribe that lived near the Andes mountain range. There was lost until about 6 years ago in 2007, the ruins hold great mysteries. The ruins have been sculpted so finely. These Incas were masters of building and architecture.       Now to the Puebloans. Puebloans created the first pit houses. These houses were rather small in today's world, but back then they were huge for their standards. The Kivas were at least four times bigger than the pit houses.       Greeks made a huge archaeological discovery as well. Apparently off the coast of Southern Greece, there appears to be a sunken civilization. As said by Doctor Jon Henderson, 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world'. There were ceramics dating back to the stone age. This is probably where the myth of Atlantis came from.   Well, that myth is now officially one hundred percent true. There is more to be found down in the city of Atlantis.       In conclusion, the lost civilizations are not lost anymore. There are major findings in human history. All this came from years and years of hard work. These lost civilizations will never be lost again.

The ancient Inca of Peru are hard to study because they left no archives for historians to study because they had no writing system or alphabet. They lived up in the Andes where it is really cold, but they managed to live. They also had a huge empire using strings to keep records. Their civilization lived for nearly a hundred years, but later was taken over my Spaniards.       The Puebloans were people who made it on terrible land, but were the best basketweavers and house builders of their time. They learned how to plant and grow food, and they invented the bow and arrow, and easier way to hunt than the throwing spear. They had to figure out how to live on such bad land and they lived there for about 800 years. No one knows why they moved, but they think that the land was probably stripped of all the nutrients and they just deserted the area.       The Pavlopetri were the people who lived in the unknown underwater world called Atlantis.

When we think of a lost civilization, we think of the Lost City of Atlantis, the mythical city that was sucked under the ocean in 'The Odyssey ' by Homer, a Greek philosopher. This is not always the case.           Let's take the Inca empire of Peru. They had no sort of alphabet or writing system.  They used colored and knotted string to keep records of goings on in their Empire. In fact, the first Europeans to meet the Inca were astounded that they could run an Empire rivaling the Roman empire just through knotted pieces of string. However, not much is known about the Inca empire. They left behind no archives or writings for historians to study. But, we mad with what we had. Clues left behind by the Inca put together a puzzle revealing the complex art, history and culture behind this great empire.           Atlantis was a city in the Greek 'Odyssey' that was swallowed by the ocean in one night. Now scientists believe it wasn't solely myth. A team of divers has discovered an underwater settlement that dates back 5000 years, back to the times of the Greek empire. The size and wealth of this city was supposedly phenomenal. 'There is no doubt that this is the largest submerged city in the world' said Doctor Jon Henderson, professor of underwater archaeology at the University of NoNottingham. It's oldest remains date back to 2800 to 1200 B.C, Long before the days of classical Greece. There are, however, older sunken sites, but none can be matched to a planned city such as this one.            An idea of lost civilizations filled with ancient undiscovered technology has excited humans since the first reading of the Odyssey. However, not all lost cities are as exciting as Atlantis. And not all can be found.

Take for example the Inca, or Puebloans, or Pavlopetri. They all have secrets to be discovered and most of it could explain alot.             The Inca didnt have an alphabet or system of writing so there were no archives for historians to study. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that the Inca could run a big empire with colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. What the Inca left were clues like portraits explaining their religion and way of life. Since the Inca lived high in the Andes mountains they probably worshiped som mountain peaks. Some Inca were buried incliff faces or mountain tops so that helped to perserve the sites. the bodies that are found in the icy Andes are in real good shape. Eperts can use our modern medical technology to learn how these people died it also reveals information on how they lived!             The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde which in spanish means 'green table'. They are known for good Basketmakes because of their skill and the craft. They used to be nomadic but over the years Puebloans replaced hunting and gathering with Farming. Puebloans population multiplied about A.D.750 and they began building houses above ground. The population decreased after a while and began moving back into cliff alcoves. They used nature to their advantage and built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. They built 'Kiva' which were like ceremonial places you could think of it as a church in these times.             Have you ever heard of The Lost City of Atlantis? Well something similar was found and that could of started the whole Atlantis fable. explorers discovered a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. It is know as the oldest found settlement. Local people in the nearby town of Neapolis are amazed. 'Older generations always knew something was there but we had no idea about the extent of it' said Neapolis`s mayer, Yiannis Kousoulis.            Now think about what would our world be like without these ancient civilization influences? Im sure it wouldnt be like it is now. We probably wouldnt have much fun without the fairy tale of Atlantis and we wouldnt be able to keep up with days without calendars.

If we don't learn about our past and history, then we are either bound to repeat it, or if we went through an economic crisis, we wouldn't know how to restart or where to begin. By researching the ways of life of these different cultures helps our knowledge and understanding of survival and how civilizations came to be. My theory is that there are still thousands of civilizations that we still know nothing about. The Inca were a great civilization. Clues left behind from the Inca helped to form a better understanding of how they lived, such as religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, and transportation. Little of what we know about the Inca comes from stories passed down through the centuries, but some of the information given were from the Spaniards, who did not speak the Inca language well, so it is not a completely reliable source. Some of what we know are from letters and diaries from the Spaniards, describing what they were like. Most of our knowledge, however, comes from ancient artifacts, like objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver, which last a long time, even if they had been buried. Some clothing and textiles have been surprisingly preserved over time, mostly because of the dry desert environment. One of the main reasons that their civilization had been preserved so well was from their location. The Inca lived in the Andes, and many of their sites are in high locations that are hard to get to. The cold mountains acted as a freezer to Inca bodies, making it easier for experts to examine and learn about how they lived, the health conditions they had, and maybe even how they died. It is hard to tell some details, however, because of their location being hard to reach. The Mesa Verde National Park preserves an immense amount of reminders from this ancient civilization. At one point, archeologists called these people Anasazi, meaning 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies,' but we now call them Ancestral Puebloans. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde at about 550 A.D. They led a more settled way of life, like farming instead of hunting and gathering. They lived in built pithouses built on mesa tops or in cliff recesses. They learned pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. They were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They were fairly prosperous, and population multiplied. At about 750 A.D. they began building houses above the ground with upright wals made of poles and mud. Population continued to grow, and so did their technology and knowledge. Eventually, fires were built for cooking, houses became more comfortable, but they realized their living conditions were unsatisfactory, and around 1300 A.D., Mesa Verde was deserted. The last civilization is one that had been named a myth for thousands of years-- the sunken city of Atlantis. After researching the abandoned city on the ocean floor, archeologists found several clues preserved from the shifting sands in the ocean. The city had been planned out; a world of buildings, courtyards, streets, tombs and religious structure, along with many shards of pottery. Marine geologists still have yet to find out why the civilizations sand, and theories include many sea leven changes, ground subsidence as a result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have been discovereed, and there may still be a lot more down there that is waiting to be found.

Only their writings, tools, and buildings remain today.  Their achievements captivate people to this day.  Three of these ancient civilizations stand out from the others.  They are the Incas, Puebloans, and the lost city of the Greeks.           The first is the ancient Inca of Peru.  The Incas were a great people with an empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome.  Archaeologists have discovered amazing clues left behind like their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.  They were able to thrive in their unforgiving land.  These artifacts left behind are amazing because are the only things that are left of the once great empire that rivaled the Romans.           The second in the Ancestral Puebloans.  They were once a nomadic people who made great baskets, but traded that life for a one of farming and permanent settlements built on high place like a mesa.  Their population prospered, so at about A.D.750 they began to build houses with upright walls made of pole and mud.  Between A.D 1100 and A.D. 1300 their population reached the thousands.  They built compact villages to house the growing population.  These buildings were carefully crafted with well cut stones.  In A.D 1200 another population shift occurred.  They moved back to the cliffs for unknown reasons like maybe the alcoves provide better protection from elements, religious reasons, or even psychological reasons.  Whatever the reason it gave rise to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is most famous.  This is important discovery because the shows a group of people who were once excellent basket makers and became a great group of people who lived on high mesas and alcoves.            The third is the lost Greek city.  This ancient city is covered with great amount of ocean water.  This might of been the city that inspired the myth about Atlantis.  It is not the oldest town, but it was the first to be planed.  The underwater city holds great submerged buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.  In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. This is an amazing discovery because less than 1% of the ocean floor has been surveyed.  This find was like finding a needle in a hay stack.  Also, the relics are in good condition and haven't have been looted.  This just adds to the great find.           These three ancient civilizations are important discoveries because they give great glimpses of the past.  These discoveries could lead to an idea or invention that that we could only dream of.  The people may not be alive any more, but their items from their daily lives on and serve a reminder of those whose time has passed on this Earth.

These civilizations have provided new knowledge to archaeologists about their rich culture and history.       In the article, 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past', written by Beth Gruber, Gruber exposes how the Incas are a very mysterious civilization that archaeologists yet have much knowledge about. The Inca 'made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock'. These colorful artifacts are of no meaning to archaeologists. They have no clue about it, but these knots yield the answers to all of the Inca's history because the quipu was their only form of records. The Inca history archaeologists know about comes from 'oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation'. This means that the Inca remain mysterious to this day. The human race may never find out the Inca's culture. Yet, the desire for knowledge keeps archaeologists searching for more Incan artifacts.       In the article, 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and their World', it is revealed to the reader that the Puebloans are very significant at keeping archaeologists doing their job. The Puebloans built 'stone walls of large pueblos that are regarded as the finest built in Mesa Verde'. The Puebloans must have been very creative people because their constructing methods are elegant. Archaeologists have discovered their beautiful building and have learned that they are great builders from just looking and examining their architecture. The Puebloans later 'traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there'. The Puebloans remain one of the most fascinationg civiliations ever to have lived, and having living descendants of them today gives archaeologists a huge help in finding out more about this unique ancient civilization.       In the article 'Lost Greek city that may have inspred Atlantis myth gives up secrets', by Helena Smith in Athens, Smith describes how the Pavlopetri might have been the people living in the famed 'Lost City of Atlantis'. This lost city found beneath the waters off of Greece may have inspire that infamous myth. Even if this city is not the genuine Atlantis, it still remains 'the oldest submerged town in the world'. This city, doubtless of being Atlantis, is still a huge archaeology discovery. This city provides new information about what kind of culture the Pavlopetri people had. In addition, this city may be the city of Atlantis, but regardless of that, Atlantis 'is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going'. Whether or not this city is Atlantis, the town just pushes underwater archaeologists to push harder to try and find more artifacts and more knowledge. To find out that a myth truly is real by using hard facts would be amazing. It would feed some of the human desire to gain more and more knowledge. The Pavlopetri people, having have lived in Atlantis or not, have provided a huge find for archaeologists everyewhere.       The ancient Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have given archaologists around the world so much to study and so much more knowledge. These ancient civilizations have given the us their rich culture and history to examine, and the human race is both grateful and thankful for the huge amount of knowledge that they have recieved about these mysterious people.

Do you think that civilization today may have been the same without the discoveries made by the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri? There are a few reasons why civilization wouldn't be the same if the Inca, the Puebloans, Pavlopetri. The reason why I say that mankind would not be the same without the ideas made by the ancient people is because most of there ideas are used by us today. For example for our Army and Navy, we learned from ancient civilizations and we looked at what they're army was like and we actually used ideas from ancient civilizations and we use them today. So without ancient civilizations the Army and Navy would not be the same. Are alphabet wouldn't be the same either because we took ideas from ancient civilizations to create are alphabet that is used today.

The publoans settled in Mesa Verde about     A.D. 550. , they were as know as Basketmakers because of their skills as craft makers. Hunting and gathering were their main livelihood. They live in houses called pithouses. Puebloans learned how to make pottery, acquired a bow and arrow, and make a weapon more efficient for hunting. In about A.D. 750 they began to built houses with walls of poles and mud. In A.D 1000 people of Mesa Verde started changing their way in life by things more stronger. By the A.D 1100 the population of the Pubebloans started to grow. When cowboys can into the cliff dwellings, archeologist began to understand the peoples' life.

The discoveries found from ancient civilizations are important, they are important  because we can use them to understand the past, and how much we have advanced in technology today. Some ancient artifacts that help us understand the past of ancient civilizations include the quipu from the Inca empire, the pit houses from the Puebloans, and lost sunken Greek city believed to be Athens.         Quipu used in the Inca civilization helps us today understand how the Incans kept track of numbers without an established number or writing system. The quipu was a long colorful string attached to a stick with knots in it. Each knot was used to keep track of anything from money, to food, to cattle.         Pit houses from the Mesa Verde community were being occupied by Puebloans from the year A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 when people began to ditch hunting and gathering to a settled farming community. The pit houses were held up by timbers in each of the four corners of the structure. The pit house also contained a living room which was sunken in a few feet from the ground. A fire pit was also included in the pit house and had an air shaft to release smoke from the fire.         The sunken city in Greece, believed to be Athens, tells modern day archeologist and scientist much about the ancient civilization. Since it was so well preserved by the sand in the bay, Anglo-Greek scientist can survey through to find main streets, buildings courtyards, and even religious structures. This sunken city helps us today by showing us how technologically advanced the ancient Greeks were.         Quipus, pit houses, and sunken cities all are important to the discovery of our past. All of these artifacts help us conclude information to the development of our ancestors in the advancing civilizations they called home.

The ancient Inca civilization was a very important discovery because we could see how advanced they were during their time compared to the other civilizations. Incas have taught us by leaving artifacts behind that they showed us what games they played and what kind of tools they used to cook and the weapons they used to hunt with. They also showed us how they kept records with quipos. The Inca left many clues behind including religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and a unique way of life. The bodies scientist find can tell how they died because the bodies are in good shape which allow scientist to use modern medical scanning equipment.                 The Mesa Verde Puebleans are another ancient civilization that we have discovered. The Mesa Verde people lived long before explored North America. The Mesa Verde people lived and flourished here and built elaborate stone communities.First Puebloans were known as basket-makers for their skill in craft. Farming began to replace their nomadic way of hunting and gathering food. They lived in small villages made of clustered pit houses. Pit houses were like tents only made of wood and had four support timbers that held the whole thing up. The pit houses later in time evolved and became known as kivas. By A.D. 750 they began to build houses above the ground. These houses had upright walls made of poles and mud. The houses were built right next to each other in long curving rows. The Mesa Verde people, due to their new housing methods, started to be known as Puebloans.                    The ancient underwater city of Atlantis was a huge discovery to  all the people around the world. Some of the remains found were dated long before the glory, golden age, days of Greece. The famous city takes as much as 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It is believed that the city was consumed by the sea around 1,000 BC. Atlantis was found with buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. The sunken city of Atlantis dates as far back as Homer's heroes and as far as to when Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Experts say that the knowing of size and wealth of detail is unprecedent. The city of Atlantis also provides potential insights to the workings of a Mycenaean society. That is why the discoveries of the ancient Inca society, the Mesa Verde Puebloans, and the discovery of the ancient myth of the sunken underwater city of Atlantis were a great discovery and influenced us in many ways. The Incas left behind their quipos as calenders, the Mesa Verde Puebloans left the houses they built above ground that sound a lot like an apartment complex, and the underwater society of Atlantis left their buildings and many other important artifacts to show us how advanced they were during and before their time before being underwater.

There way of life in history was amazing and we would have never of known if they didn't keep any of their records, documents, and structures of how they lived. This helps and gives us our history that we wright down and what we study in school, we have history so we don't make the same mistakes as our kind has done in the past. Their artifacts help us understand them more and see how smart they were with technology and other things we would have never known about if there was nothing left from their time period. This helps our way of society to understand each other and bring us into one union.          In the book, Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, by Beth Gruber, explains how the Incas lived their way of life. The Incas were hard to learn about because they didn't leave any archives, which made it a little more difficult to understand their way of life. They did leave knots on a string and that was their calendar, they were called quipus. To this day scientist still don't know what the different colors on the knots represent. Later in years we were provided with amazing discoveries they had left behind like, portraits of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. From the left over artifacts, scientist are able to identify their way of life.          In the book, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, by Roy Anderson, explains how the Ancestral Puebloans lived their life. The Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table'), they had settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were very skilled at crafting and were called Basketmakers. They were formerly nomadic, beginning to settle in their lives normally, civilized. Instead of hunting and gathering, they took over farming, they also lived built their homes on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses in pithouses. They had also discovered pottery and making arrows for hunting in stead of the atlatl (a spear thrower).          In the book, Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets, by Helena Smith in Athens, explains how the Pavlopetri lived their way of life. The Pavlopetri lived in the lost city of Atlantis, on the southern side of Greece.

They are artifacts from along time ago around 1000 years. Inca came from South America that rivaled the exanse of Ancient Rome.           Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They left no archives to historains can study. Inca made knots to keep count of livestock. The first Europeans were amazed that they run a huge empire. Today no one knows what the knots means. Inca left clues behind that formed an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, transportation, and way of life.           Old stories have been told by Europeans. Reset of the the knowledge we know of the Inca is the artifacts. Most artifacts survived well. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that mgiht be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but still looting goes on today. Looted sites do not have much to tell.           The Inca lived in high in the Andes and may worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces. This helped the perserve, because is was harder for the looters to get to them. It also made the job difficult for archaeologist. But it was good for them as well. They cold mountain top made the dead bodies in good shape. That made it easier to learn how the people died.             There are no more Inca living in the present time. Most Inca sites have been cleaned out from looters, archaeologist, and treasure hunters. But most artifacts are cept nice in a museum, locked away from looters and hunters. Inca will be remembered in history about how they lived.

I believe  that the findings are important, because it is how we learn about our early history.

We know so little as it is we need to be able to find things so we can learn as much as we can about the early civilizations.

We need to learn about them because they are what mad us who we are today. if it weren't for them developing things such as pottery, languages, stories, currency we would still be stuck in the stone ages. without them we would not be as technologically advanced as we are today. We would not have big cities like we do today if it wasn't for our early foundation, like the puebloans they were the earliest planned civilization kown to man.       We also wouldnt know how to do alot of the things we know how to do today, like alot of the architectural styling many people enjoy today.

They are dated back to 1438! They are very important because they could have started the whole human race. We don't know that for sure yet but that could be true. I don't even have a thought about it.         We have found many artifacts frm them and the most commonly known ones are the calendars. Yes, I know they don't sound very interesting at all but the are. he Aztec calendars are what some people think is the countdown to the 'end of the world.'       The Inca lived high in the Andes Mountain Range. Some think they worshipped the mountains thinking they were gods and goddesses.They even buried the dead in caves or at the top so looters couldn't get to them. That just made the job harder for the archeoligist. We scan and anylize the bodies for information about how they lived.         Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde in pithouses, 'houses in the ground.' They went from building with pole-and-adobe building to masterful stone masonry. They would join together alot of units that had more than 50 rooms.         They had churches or Kivas.This is where they worshipped and weaved. They would make fires in summer mainly for cooking and in winter mainly for warmth. They then made a city that is now under water. That may be where we got the idea for Atlantis, but I still think Atlantis is real.      Well I hope that you enjoyed my article about ancient civilizations.

All this precious history is preserved by nature. In this article I will be telling you about the well preserved artifacts that were left by the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.       First, the Incan empire ruled from 1438-1532. Although some Incan tablets have been looted, we still have learned a great deal about the Incan life from other Incan tablets. From these tablets we have learned that the Inca lived high in the Andes mountains, and that they may have worshiped some mountains.  We have also learned that the Inca sometimes buried tablets with the dead. Although the Incan ruins had many records looted, they wrote such thorough that we still learned a lot about their lives.       Secondly, the Puebloans ruled from 550-1200 a.d.. They ruled for over 700 years. The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verda, in North America. From records, we learned that they Puebloans created the bow and arrow, and pithouses. The bow and arrow was a weapon, this  weapon was a long piece of wood that had a string that ran from the top to the bottom of the wood. Pithouses were created when the Puebloans settled. These were holes dug a few feet into the ground with four corners of wood that provided shelter. Altogether, the Puebloans were people that adapted quickly to their envirement.       Third, the lost city, also known as Atlantis, ruled from 2800-1200 BC. This city is located 30,000 square meters away from Southern Peloponnese. This lost city was preserved by shifting sands. These shifting sands covered up the city, therefore preserving it. Some believe that Plato, a very famous Greek writer, wrote about this city in his tale called'The sunken continent of Atlantis.' We will never really know if his writing was based off of this lost city. Furthermore, this lost city has been one very big mystery.       Lastly, these empires and cities have left many written records. Through these records, we have been able to see through the eyes of the people of the past.

There have been many discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri that reveal most of the answers to your questions about their lives back then.               One of the first discoveries that were found was about the Inca. They lived in the years 1438-1532 in a South American empire. What clues did they leave behind for us to study how they lived? Researchers pieced together amazing puzzles of their religion, government systems, art and architecture, and many details of the Inca life style. Their stories were also passed down through generations and generations by oral history and important stories. However, most of these stories were legends rather than historical facts about their past. Another part of our knowledge comes from the Inca's well preserved clothing and some bodies found in the mountaions from the Andes. Even though some sites were raided by treasure hunters long ago, archaeologists can still uncover some truths about their past.               Another reason why we can learn from ancient civilizations is through the Pluebloans. This group of people lived in Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. They lived sunken houses a few feet in the ground called pit-houses.They were known for making baskets and were very nomadic people too. We can learn from this because it shows how much we have changed from back then. Also,when they built fires inside their houses to cook and keep warm, they cut a hole in their roofs to let the smoke out. This reveals that they were not only good at doing things, but they were also smart too. Eventually they figured out how to make potery and better houses made out of stones. There population may have reached around several thousand during the classic period which led to bigger towns and cities.               There were also many discoveries made about the Pavlopetri. The only thing different about this ancient civilization is that is was underwater in southern Greese. The water really helped preserved the 30,000 square meter city considering it has remains dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC. In this sunken city they have also found many artifacts buildings, rock-cut tombs, and religios structures. This reaveals a whole new world of exploration for archaeologists.              ? Do you now know why ancient civilizations are so importatnt? It is because of some groups like the Inca, Pueloans, and the Pavlopetri that we now have less questions to answer about life back then.

Archaeology Helps Discover Lost Civilizations                                      Many historians  have contributed to discovering and studying objects obtained from areas where ancient civilizations once prospered.This practice is called Archaeology.Archaeology has led to the discovery of several lost civilizations.                In ancient Inca of Peru, archaeologists discovered that the people did not have a written record system during this time period. Instead, the people of Inca made knots in colored string called Quipus to record dates and to keep track of the amount of livestock.They also discovered stories written by Spanish soldiers and priests telling about the Inca when they arrived at the empire in 1532. However, most Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language and could have misunderstood the culture.Most of what archaeologists learn from the lost civilization of Inca is from the artifacts discovered .Some of these artifacts include, clothing, pottery, building ruins, bodies, and weapons.Bodies have been found in the Andes mountains and are in such good condition they can be studied with modern medical equipment to show how they died and how they lived.                Another society archaeology helped us discover was the ancestral Puebloans. They lived in Mesa Verde,Mexico(now a national park).Archaeologists discovered remains from homes that were called pithouses, these houses consisted of a living room sunk a few feet in the ground and four corner timbers supporting the roof.People lived in these houses until A.D. 550 to A.D. 750.The people who lived during this time are referred to as Basketmakers for their skill in weaving baskets . In the year A.D. 1000, people's homes had evolved from pole supported homes to walls of stone holding fifty or so rooms.The populations continued to grow and in some of the artifacts observed from this time a noticeable decline in quality is seen. The people appeared to be moving into cliff alcoves that had previously sheltered their ancestors. These people became known as the cliff dwellers. They built their homes under overhanging cliffs with sandstone shaped into rectangle blocks.However, ancestral Pueblans only lived in the cliffs for less than a hundred years.Several theories were made about their migration. For example, crop failures, drought,or land resource depletion may have caused the people to migrate. Studies from archaeologists have shown when the cliff dwellers left they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona.               Archaeologists have also discovered a submerged city that was  off the southern coast of Greece. This lost city  could have inspired one of the world's most legendary myths,the fable of Atlantis. The sunken settlement was explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists .They discovered the settlement was as old as 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes.The site covers 30,000 square meter of the ocean floor and is believed to be consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.Arcaeologists  have studied building structures, pottery, rock-cut tombs, and religious a monuments. By finding the lost city Arcaeologists have allowed historians to discover how many people lived in this time and what their religious beliefs were.They  also can use this information to compare modern day lifestyles to the ones our ancestors lived by before.

Well with today's advances in technology you can. Archeologists have discovered many things about living conditions in the past from 3 main civilizations.            One of the civilizations is the Inca. The Inca had portraits that left behind amazing accounts of their religion, art, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Also archeologists have learned many things about the Inca from reading accounts of Spaniards that were left behind. We have been able to piece together enough data to know what happened to the Inca up until they were slaughtered by the Spanish.            Another civilization was the Puebloans. They used many advanced things for their time period. Some of these thing were basket weaving, bow and arrow hunting tools, and pit houses. They also lived in cliff dwellings. All of this archeologists were able to learn by careful studying, and meticulous deciphering.            The Pavlopetri civilization was found submerged by using modern day sonar. This ancient civilization is the oldest submerged city currently found. It was also thought to inspire the myth of Atlantis. Due to shifting sands and a protective bay most of this civilizations artifacts are still intact today.

Some of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, transportation, and ways of their lifes had helped us figure out why Inca ruled South American empire for over a 100 years. From generation to generation stories have been passed down, but since the Spaniards counldn't speak the Inca language well it was very difficult to pass on the stories. They were very talented people for their time, they made thinks out of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. These artifacts helps us discover Inca past history, as well as weather and other natural conditions. When archaeologists go to a site sometimes they discover tht stealers and looters have been their and have disturbed them. As archaeologists go to site the most important things on their mind is to fine out what happened to a civilization and where it had came from. These are the importances of the discovery of Inca and how.        The Puebloans lived in stone houses for over 700 years. Archaeologists call these people Anasazi, which is a Navajo word meaning 'The Ancient Ones or Enemies.' They were also known as basketmakers, for thier good skills at crafts. They were settled back people, after many years they lived in pit houses. Their population had been multipling quickly, so they began making houses of uprights walls made of poles and mud. Fromm generation to generation over centuries structure skills had changed, they started to built their dwelligns beneath the overhanging cliffs. They had lived in them for less than 100 years. These are the importances of the discovery of the Puebloans and how.        The Lost City may have inspired one od the worlds most enduring myths, this is the oldest submerged town in the world. Do to weather and shifting sands the bay was protected where the Lost City was. They had found 9,000 square meters of new buildings, all under water. This is very different because a sa submerged site it was not reoccupied. They think it was a combination of two towns at the start, this is the first time a sunken city had been found in greece.

Ancient greece includes my favorite, Atlantis. It is the oldest submerged city. It was thouroly researched by divers last year because the technology would finally allow it. It was discovered poetry and many other facinating things. Theese discoveries of pithouses, the kiva and more have been very important to us as a society. I would be able to go into more depth with all of my research but sadly this is only a article with so much room. I hope my insight has made you want to go in depth on your own.       Mesa verde pithouses-  People lives in theese from 550 to 750 AD. They featured a living room a roof a firepit and a underworld passage. This innovation led to kiva and many more archetechtual structures.       The Kiva- It is a ceremonial room and or church. Puebloeans practiced modern religons at that time. Older generations used it for healing rooms or to pray for rain. Also luck in hunting crop growing or anything that could result in life or death.       One amazing thing about the inca is they comunacated without a writing system. If you think of today we rely so much on other people and things we would be no where without a system of communication. That gives you a idea of just how intelligent theese people were, just in a different way.       I enjoy theese places and i hope you do to.

Ancient Rome left clues behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together detail of the Inca life. The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the Spainards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.            Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on peru`s coasts or the cold mountains or the andes. Some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, Who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. looted sites often do not tell archaeologists, who can dig them up carefully. They provide the best idea of all about life in peru before and during Inca rule.               Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this acient culture. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as ''the acient ones'' or ''ancient enemies.'' We now call them Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descents. The first Ancestral puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for ''green table'') about A.D. 550. They are know as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled wayof life.              The structers are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. By the classic Period, Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a virgorous civilization, whos accomplishment in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America using nature to advantage, Ancestral Pueblanos built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction  material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread.

The lost city is important find because its very big and very old. It's also been there for many years. It was very replete with thousands of shards of pottery. The fable of Atlantis have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.       The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It was revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. THe sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of details is unprecedented, experts say. There was many things found in the lost city like old tools, weapons, money, coins and old pottery. There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considerd to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the working of Mycenaean society. 40 years ago it was only the year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or tsunami.       The Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. Greece was the first time that a sunken city has been found that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. One percent of the world's ocean floors have ever been tested. The lost cities extraordinary found is still a lot more down there that has no been found yet.

These cities were all found by archaeologists. The lost cities we found were called the Inca, Puebloans, and Peru. these cities are very old they are about 5,000 thousand years old.        Also the Inca city did not leave any alphabet or systems for use to study on now. The Inca city made knots with colors on them so they could recorded the calendar and keep a count of the livestock. The first Europeans that meat the Incas were so amazed that they could run a huge empire with just using strings. But we still don't know what the knots mean or the colors that go with them. Also the Spaniards did not speak any of the Inca language. Also some of the Incas stories were rather legends than history. The Inca artifacts were objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or sometimes silver. These materials that they used last a very long time even if they have been bared for a hundred years.        The second city we are gonna talk about is the puebloans, this city was long before the Europeans explored north America. Also the first ancestral puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They are known as a basketmarkers they are known by that because of there skills at the craft. They learned how to make a lot of stuff like pottery, bow and arrow, and more efficient weapons. They started building houses in A.D. 750. but from here on they are now known as the puebloans. In the A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 the population reached several thousand. In 1880 archeologists started finding our how these people lived.                                                                                                      Also these cities were frozen and they started to unfreeze when it hit the water because the sand was helping it dissolve.Also our investigation revealed that 9,000 square meters or new buildings were built.We also found out that when earthquakes and tsunami's hit.That the cities would sink in deeper. Also our older generations always knew something was there but we had no idea about it.These are the first cities that we found of Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent.Finally this was an extraordinary thing we have found under water but we still have more things to discover that have not been found.                                                                                                                                    The third city I want to talk about is called the lost Greek city. this city has been found under water by a diver. The city that the diver found was about 5,000 thousand years old, it was there before Christ. Also the city was frozen, but every time there would be an earthquake or a tsunami it would sink and some of it would devolve into the sand. This city is the biggest city we have ever had it is 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. we also found a lot of things we found buildings, main streets,  houses,  courtyards, and a lot of culture things we think this city was very rouges. as so we think. Our investigation also revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. This is one extraordinary city we have found. but we still have a lot more in the ocean to find out about.       finally the cities we have found gave use a lot of things about our old Coulter's. And gave use more historical things to learn about. These cities are very interesting to learn about because, we get to find out what people did before we had technology.

Archeologists found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.Wich suggested that the settlement was occupied soem 5,00 years ago, at tghe least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought.Then other investigations revealed 9,000 square meters of new buildings.

The question is how did the archaeologists know about the civilization, what made there civilization fall, and how they kept record of livestock?  I'll explain that just continue reading.                     First of all how did the archealogists find about the civilization their were clues left by them like the portrait of their religon.  So how did the lnca kept track of livestock and used as a calendar?  Although  the Inca also had no formal alphabet or writing system.  They used something called a quipus which was a colored strings with knots that indicated the value of the number.  The archaeologists have found many quipus they still don't know what it means (what it was used for).                     Archaeologists need any information they find to study the Inca.  Every single artifact hey find is very important, they have to photograph the artifact and note the exact position.  They need to learn as much information from every piece of evidence/artifact.  The mountains act like a freezer that keep the bodies in such good shape so experts can research them and find the cause of their death.                 The fall of the Inca was on 1532, archaeologists know that because thats when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the Inca empire.  For the archaeologists finding the origins of the Inca is harder because the area they lived in was inhabited by many different people.  The Inca lived high in the Andes and have worshiped many of their sites in high places.  They made pottery, artifacts made of gold, silver, and stone which they found.

Many people could learn from them and see how we humans have evolved throughout the years.  I am going to explain why it is important using the Inca and the Puebloans as examples.            The Inca of Peru, were known to rule a South American empire for almost a hundred years.  They do amazing art work and are very imaginative.  For example, the Inca have created a record calendar using colorful strings to help keep count of livestock called quipus.  You can also see by the way they do their architecture, agriculture, and government.  Some of what scientists know about them have come from stories that have been passed down each generation to generation.  They are still trying to uncover their past by looking at the many artifacts that have been left behind, though some have been stolen, because of its value, by treasure hunters and looters.            The first ancestral Puebloans, meaning 'village dwellers' in Spanish, were found in Mesa Verde at around A.D. 550.  They were known as skilled basket makers that lived in pit houses.  These people have been evolving themselves by changing the way they do things over time.  For example, the thing that they have changed the most might have been their houses and how they would build them differently to make more efficient for living.  They went from the pit house when they first started out, to the kivas in A.D 750, back to the cliff alcoves in A.D 1200.  We can look at them as an example to try and make our lives better by evolving in our own lives and not having to do the same thing over and over again.            History isn't just reading about the things people have done in the past.  I have been hearing students say over and over again, why we have to take it as a class.  It is so we can learn about those people and try not to follow their mistakes if they have one any.  Anyway, history can be fun and see what kinds of things have been improved over time.  Everyday, people have been thinking of great ideas on how to make our life easier, safer, and, and more efficient.  For example, the Inca were smart and imaginative group of humans that used things in a way that we wouldn't have, like the knots of string.  We can see all around us that we can be just like those people that we have learned today to make our future generation better than what we might have now.

Or how they lived, how civilized were they? Well archaeologist have studied many different tribes. One of them were the ancient Inca of  Peru. They are kind of  a mystery archaeologist were very interested in their history. The Inca once ruled an South America empire. The Inca left many clues of their art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their ways to live. Most of what found came from stories they left.                            Archaeologist found many clues that the Inca left behind. One of the were quipus. Quipus knotted colored strings used to keep a record of livestock. One of the first Europeans to them were shocked that they used strings to keep their empire going. They also found letters and diaries from Spanish soldiers and priest who went to visit them in 1532. The archaeologist had to be careful when they read them because they had to remember that the Europeans did not speak the Inca language nor did the Spaniards. Also most of the stories were more like stories then history. Archaeologist found a lot about their religion. They say that they left a beautiful portrait of their god. Some also say that they lived in areas so that could worship they may have praised some mountain peaks.                            The Inca live high up in Andes. They were buried in caves in cliff faces. Some Inca's were buried with their treasure. Some of the Inca believed that what ever they buried them with would go with them to heaven. Many tomb did not fall apart. Most of their thing were in good condition because of the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or maybe because of the cold mountains of the Andes. Archaeologists got most other studies from artifacts. Inca's made most of their artifact out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver like most ancient civilizations archaeologist think. Now it come to the end of the Inca fall.Although they were not able to find the origins of the Inca archaeologist found the fall of the Inca's empire date easily. The Inca empire ended in 1532 because the Spaniards killed the last king of the empire and took over.                               I learned lots about the Inca empire. How t e lived.

Three of these 'lost civilizations' include the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. These three civilizations are significant because they all contributed something important to the human race and proof is rare.        The Inca worked well with things normally used for a simple task such as string. This was very important because this enabled them to make knowledge of a simple resource and use it to their advantage. This civilization was able to keep count of livestock by placing a colored string on them. The Inca also left pottery, stone, silver, and gold behind. This showed that they were skilled enough to find valuable materials, create art to trade, and hide their important things. Inca people were often buried with their belongings. This helped prevent stealing to a certain extent as well as confusion and fighting amongst the other Inca members.        The Puebloans were very skilled builders who built very detailed stone communities. This allowed them to stay safe from outside attacks and were able to move easily and resettle. Having this skill might be important because in case of emergency, they might have had to know an easy way to save themselves. This was also very helpful in the sense of outdoor materials. This lead them to know what they could or could not make a community out of, how well it would work, and how durable it would be. Puebloans produced the finest of expressions of the human race and that made them well known and admired. Kivas might helped the citizens to find an easy place for hunting/fishing which made it easy to feed their community and families. These members were able to make fir which was important because it allowed them to stay warm and welcome the village (source #2).        Finally, the Pavlopetri were skilled in areas such as ceramics and monument structures. Source #3 states: ''We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought,'' This, to me, means that this civilization was very experienced in trade and elegant forms of art from that time frame. This was important because that meant the Pavlopetris were able to trade and move around as much as they wanted. Since the 'ceramics' were found in the sea, that obviously meant they were strong, durable, and hefty which was important for carrying and transporting goods.       For these reasons and many others, I believe the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were important civilizations.

The Inca were very interesting people. They did not have a formal alphabet or system of writing. They kept records with knots called quipus. They made a lot of pottery and art decorated with pictures and colors. The Fall of the Inca was in the year 1532 when Spaniards murdered the last Inca King and took over. The Inca lived high in the Andes and worshiped some mountain peaks. Most of their sites were in remote, high places. This helped preserve the sites because it was more difficult for looters to get to them. It makes it difficult for archaeologists to get to it though. They have to carry their equipment up and down the mountain, and they have to carry artifacts down the mountain for study.

The Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago, dating long before Europeans explored North America. Puebloans chose Mesa Verde for their home at around A.D. 550 and lived there for more than 700 years. They made elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. They made pithouses In the late A.D. 1200's, they left their homes and moved away.

Why do they even bother trying to uncover ancient secrets about people living in the past? Is it really that important?                 During the A.D period things were both physically and mentally challenging for the Inca's and the puebloans because they didn't have the advanced technology we have today. During their period of time they had to rely more on nature and outdoor resources versus the food markets and clothing stores we use. The reason archaeologists want to know about their past is because they want to uncover how they lived and what life was like for them.                 First, to discover more about the Inca's or Puebloans land they might visit their ancient homelands to discover what kind of terrain they lived on, how good the soil was for farming or they might even try to find any old ruins they left behind long ago. Just from one visit from their lands archaeologists can discover a whole lifetime of unknown secrets .                 Next, archaeologists find it important to discover the past because they want to know the tools they used or to see what materials they used for houses, clothes, and art such as pottery. Again by visiting their homelands if they find any broken pieces of pottery or any tattered cloth they can learn all the materials they used and how advanced their economy really was.                 In the end an archaeologists job is very important because without them we would not know anything about the past and its people.

They play a huge role in discoveries of ancient civilization. The Incas had no formal alphabet system or system of writing. Puebloans are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. The marine geologists that studied the Lost City of Atlantis are known as Pavlopetri.            The Incas did not leave archives for historians to study. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life. Passing on stories was an important way to perserve a community's history. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where the artifacts are found.            This was a very important time for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. They began to built houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud. From here on these people are known as Puebloans, the spanish word for 'village dwellers.' By A.D. 1000 the peopole of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful masonry. walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more.            Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say.

The Inca left clues behind that form an amzing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportaion, and a way of life. Archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life by studying these clues. Some of the stuff we know about them, comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. We know some of the stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1852. The rest of our knowledege comes from artifacts and from the sites where they found. The artifacts were made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Such materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Some of the textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well. Usually they would have been destroyed by dampness, but they were preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.             About 1,400 years ago, before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from the Navajo word sometimes translated as ' the  ancient ones' or ' ancient enemies.' The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were known as the Basketmakers for their skill at the Craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usuall built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff reccess. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl. About A.D 750 they began building houses above gorund,with upright walls made of poles and mud. By A.D 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.             The site straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the Southern Pelloponnesse, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.

Without some of the Incan's highway system we would not have long highways or messaging systems, and without the Puebloans we would not know how to make sandstone or adobe bricks with a unique morder. History has gave us many reference points and examples to show us how to live our lives and advance beyond our technology.   In 1438 to 1532, the Incans ruled most of what is now South America. They made different veriatys of textiles, pottery, jewelry, and buildings. Later in 1532, when the Spaniards arrived, most of the Incans' stuff where looted or disposed of. Now when archaeologists find these, they can understand more about the Incan life styles. Even now we not only get information about the Incan from their stuff, we also get it from Spanish journals or letters. Thanks to the Incans we got a base for our technology that we have now.\   About 1400 years ago, before North America was discovered and explored, people known as the Puebloans inhabited the four corners. They lived in an area known as Mesa Verde (now Mesa Verde National Park). They mostly specialized and are known for their building methods. They built huge walls, diverse housings, and different types of bricks. When a cowboy discovered these structures, study began on it. Now we understand how they made these bricks and what they used them for.   Poeple form all over the world spend their lives searching and studying different artifacts from different civilizations, trying to unlock their pasts. Most of those findings served as a basis for our technology we have now. Without some of the Incan's highway system we would not have long highways or messaging systems, and without the Puebloans we would not know how to make sandstone or adobe bricks with a unique morder.

They have many things like artifacts and crafts that show the life before us and show what and how they did things. They left behind buildings, paintings, documents and many other things that are useful to ourselves in todays life. They also showed daily life and how to not make mistakes twice.

They didnt leave any archives for historians to study. One of the things the Incas did was they tied knots in coloresd strings called quipus, This is the what they used as a calender and they also used it to keep track of their livestock. someof the first people to meet the Incas were Europeans and they were amazed at how huge their empire was and all they did was use strings to keep track of the days and their livestalk. the quipus have been found by many archaeologists but they still to this day don tknow what the knots mean. The reason why is because there is no one that can read how the knots and colorful strings are used to keep the track of time.   A lot of what we have learned about the Inca have come from stories passed on thropugh generation. Some say that the passing of the stories was a way they think that kept the communtiys history. Other then the stories a lot of other things we know about the Inca is from the artifacts that they left behind. Lot of what we have found they think is made of stone.   High in the Andes is where most of the Incas lived. IF not located there then they are located in other remote high cliffs. They found many bodies of them burried in cliff faces. The only bad thing is this brings the job of the archeaeologist up to a more dificult level.

Livivng in the high Andes Mountain in Peru was a smart idea because no one could get to them and they were isolated until the Spaniards came and took over the empire. The Inca were very smart when in came to keeping track and keeping a good empire; which is why archaeologists are so interested in their civilization.        The reason archaeologists do what they do is because they love finding more out about the past because we can repeat the past but under certain cercumstances we don't because it could put the United States in trouble. The Inca ran a well organized empire and thats what  make them so interesting because they didn't use techniques like other civilizations used in that time period. The Inca tied knots in string to keep track of cattle, crops, food supply, money and many other things, but archaeologists dont know what the knots mean. No one today has any thing to do with the Inca or have any Incan blood in them to help find out more about them.       The Incas aren't the only civilization that archaeologists are interested in finding more about. There are the Puebloans are also another civilization that archeologists are still finding more and more about eveyday. The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde, which means green table, in about A.D 550. They were also known as Basketmakers for their skills and craftsmanship. They did the usual, farming, hunting and gathering as their everyday routine; they lived a more settle way of life. They lived in villages and in those villages were their homes that they called pithouses. They're called pithouses becasue their living room sunk in a few feet into the ground and four corners supported the roof. The firepit had air deflectors and the house alose had antechambers.       These civilizations are all important to archaeologists to uncover the past and the help see what we have in store for the future.

By understanding the ancient cities and looking at their articrafts, we have unlocked so many secrets from our past. Whether its finding temples or lost articrafts, to finding out  how our past generations lived in this world.                One of the biggest purposes of finding ancient civilizations is by learning the ways of our past generations.In the past the Incas knots in colored strings called quips. It was a calendar to keep records of events. By investigating our ancestors methods of living a daily life, we have figured out how we have evolved from that and how we have changed our world.The same with human evolution. We got from apes to educated humans.                 Another reason for finding civilizations from the past is for learning the techniques they once used. The ancientt humans back then didn't have any technology. Today, all we rely on is on technology. For having cars, phones, computers, and you may even be using technology when you don't realize it. But back then how did they survive without using any technology. They used baskets for getting food, spears for weapons, ropes for specific use, and gold for treasure. In Mesa Verde the puebloans used pit houses for relaxing. It was more of a living room for most of them.                  So as we know more about our past, we know more about ourselves and how we evolved from that.

Each ancient civilization played a very important key role in the change we have had in technology over time.             The ancient Inca of Peru lived high in the Andes mountain range where the climate would get extremely cold. Each civilization had their own ways of worshiping and had their own beliefs of what one should do with a dead body, whether they believed in the concept of the afterlife or not. In the Inca's case, dead bodies were simply buried in the surface of the mountains where they were well-preserved. When experts discovered these bodies in such good condition, their first question was how these people died and were able to use modern medical scanning equipment to figure it out. This way, medical experts can discover what diseases may have hit the Incas.             The First Ancestral Pueblos of Mesa Verde were formally nomadic but began to lead a more settled lifestyle. They were originally hunters, but evolved to farmers. As they settled, they began to adapt to their new lifestyle and started to build houses called pit houses in small villages and got more crafty since that they had one place to be. They were known for their skills in basket making, making pottery, and acquiring the bow and arrow and spear. By archeologists discovering these ancient artifacts, we piece together how we got the structures of our homes today; where they evolved from and maybe even where we got the idea from to make the modern weapons we use today.            The discovery of Pavlovian, the sunken city beneath the seas off of southern Greece also know for the fable of Atlantis, dates back to at least five thousand years ago. This once lively city takes up 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor and is thought to have sunken around 1000 BC. While marine archeologists dove down to search this city for any lost items that may still be in good enough condition to study, they found roads, thousands of broken pieces of pottery, religious structures, ceramics, and courtyards. These findings can help us understand the religion that the ancient people followed and the use of technology that they already had before us.            Our discoveries of the ancient Inca, the first ancestral Pueblos, and the Pavlovian helps us to figure out where all of our modern day technology started from. Without our findings of all the ancient artifacts, we would be lost in thought about where it all came from. From the way that dead bodies were buried to how their architecture influenced our modern architecture today, the ancient people really did play a key role in history.

How is it thats archeologists make these predictions about the past? First, archeologists are people who study ancient artifacts. Know that you know this, archeologists get sent to a specific location where ancient civilisations were located at. Now they dig up objects that give them clues about how that specific civilisation lived. They look at the material they are made out of, how they are made, and why they are made. Once, they obatain this information they will get how they lived.             Let's take a look at how the ancient Incas lived. Some of these civilisations were located at the mountains or at the coasts of Peru. Knowing the location of the civilisation will give up information about what they coulod've eaten or harvested. also this can explain how they got their materials to creat their clothes and pottery.            Also, another great ancient civilisation was the Puebloans. This civilisation was known for its hunting skills and because they were nomadic. They created an efficient weapon for hunting called the atlatl. This weapon was also know as a spear thrower, which made catching their pray easier.             Finally, an important civilisation thought of as a myth is Atlantis. this civilisation was thought of as a myth due to the fact that people thought cities couln't be floating water. But scientists have found walls and even buildings under the deep, deep ocean. This has many people amazed at how this city was created there, how did they live there and what did they do, and why it end up in the bottom of the ocean.              To sum up, archeologists are making new discoveries on ancient civilisations and will keep finding more. Archeologists might even end up lokking on how our culture worked and what our life styles were like.

Artifacts founded by archaeolgoists have greatly impacted our society today. As we look back on past civilizations that have come before us, we can identify that some of things that we do to this day have originated from such societies as the Incas, the Puobelans, and the Pavloetries. For example, Incans made knots in colored strings to record the calender and keep count of their. Little dow e know, we could have been using the exact same stuff as them, but in a more advanced and technological way.

Another way that we, as Americans have accustomed some of the tools and crafts made by past civilazations are things like houses. In about 750 A.D., Incans began to construct houses of their own by building them above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. Becoming more and more advanced, the civilazations' homes were constructed in a similar way as ours are today. Meaning that we most likely have used their ideas and ways of life and have gone based on that but more advanced in new ways.
