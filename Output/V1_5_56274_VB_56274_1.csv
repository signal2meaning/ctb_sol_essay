They find artifacts from way back in history when George Washington was alive and artifacts from Jamestown Island. They used many tools to keep the artifacts safe and in great condition. In this report you will learn what the archeologists found and used to give you history we learn today!!!       In 1994, a group of people were interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeologists Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.       The first objects were found in 1861. They found uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. That's when they finally found James Fort!       The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. The archeologists also found eleven cellars and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. Today, the group finds nearly one million objects each year!       Archeologists used a lot of tools. Most of them were used to clean off dirt off the artifacts. They used picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels.

They had added new thing to  protect enemies from there ships.Artifacts were found in 1861. they had made images of the area to. And they found fort James.They saw drawings and read stories about it to. Also they were ledges that were made for canons also they were sellers , burial sites, and buildingswith forts . they were  objects like potery, coins, and toys. James fort had struggled year with little food . These information  tells a lot about James Fort.         People had  lived in Fery farm over 12,000 years.George Washington father was Augustine Washington. George had moved away when he wasjust six years old.No one new were he exacty moved for surethey so they started to find artifacts in 2003.In aYear they finall foundit and they started to dig.The first thing they found was a kitchen , slave quarter , and astorge house. Then a few years later they had found a main farmhouse. Then they found  four othe houses on the ferry farm and one of them was Georges Washington farm house. In Washingtons farmhouse that thier was a fire in the house. And they suggested there was a fire. Washington had smoked clay pipes which might of start the fire which gives proof.               To find James Fort Rcheologist had found had uncovered armor weapons. A group had found the exact spot where the fort was. Then the groups had found the spot and built it again. The National Park Service studied it and  figured how to use the land. Then they tried to Find proof of James Fort. With all the studing of James Fort ythey finally found it.They at least find 1 million things in th fort. And then the archeologist  knew that they Powhatan tribe that they had attacked them . With all the information with the past and ties of the peaople who had started the colonies. And they're life style.              They were curios about what george did in his life. So in 2003 they had started diging and looked for clues. To try to learn about Gearge they had used 3D maps. And other teams had focused diging for answers. The group had started diging which were called Trowelling. they had found his farmhouse. And then they had  made it to a work shop.               A lot of aarcheologist use tools. These tools are Pick, shovel, whisk,dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel , and a trowel. The pick and the shovel were used to dig in the earth to find artifacts. Then the whisk and dustpan areto clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knifes are used to scrap of dirt from the artifacts. The wheel barrow is used tocarry the dirt. The skim shovel is used  to scoop soil with each scoop. And the trowel is use to view the layrs of soil. And those are the Tools used by the archeologist.

Archeologists are people who find fosils and bones with teams using tools. Some tools an Archeologist might have are a pick and shovel, a wheelbarrow, trowl, and much more! Sometimes, it takes two weeks digging up a 25-square-foot section!            Some of the tools that Archeologists use are a Pick and Shovel, a Whisk and Dustpan, a Knife, a Wheelbarrow, a Skim Shovel and a trowl. I even went to the store and got to hold some of theese tools! the most common tool is the pick and shovel.            Another thing I learned about Archeology is it take a team. Sometimes it take two sets of eyes to find something. Some people even say is better with a team.            So you want to be an Archeologist? its a great job that make good money.

Without archeology we wouldn't know anything about our past. In 'Finding Fort James,' and 'Digging up George Washington's Past,' archeologists teach us about the history of Fort James, and about George Washington as a boy. Not only does it teach us about our history, but it's interesting!          In 'Finding Fort James,' archeologists are searching for Fort James to find out if it really was washed out by a river. In there journey they find out where the fort was and they also find out a lot about how people's daily lives went, and how people survived. Without archeology we would know nothing about this.          In 'Digging up George Washington's Past,' archeologists are trying to find out more about George Washington's life as a boy. They believe that the stone base of George's house is still there. They use a high tech computer to track what is underground.                     Technology also helps archeologists find out about the past. People use analyzers and metal detectors to find things and figure out what things are.Thank goodness for technology.            As you can see the job of an archeologist is very important. without archeology there would be lots of trouble with finding out things like the problems  people had in the past and how do we prevent them.          In conclusion, without archeology we would know nothing about our past...Or anyone's past.

Learning About Digging Up History            This is what I have learned about George and is that well for starters he both worked really hard.    I would like to mention that he will never give up and not just for selfish reasons, but for people, the city, the (I might be exaggerating but) the world. Washington work very hard each and every day. That's exactly what citizens  need.A hero.            George Washington was a soldier and a great president. When Washington was a little boy about the age of six he moved to Ferry Farm. Though no one exactly new where he lived , archeologist thought the stone base under the house was still there. So they worked, worked, and worked ... and they have finally found the proof.  Mr.Washington smoked clay pipes, he does more like a hobby thing though.                                        Finding the Evidence            Archeologist work in many different orders to find proof. Some archeologist use three demential / 3D to track what is under ground. Though it will be easier using technology some scientist just do the actual digging process. Mentioning that Washington's events had hundred of years ago you ant take a quick guess that most of researh has been found from under ground.

Archeologists can start groups likethe Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project this project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought thta the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.                   Archeologists also dig up things from the past, like a stone base. Archeologists believe that there was a stone base under George Washington's house!  George Washington grew up in his childhood home in Ferry Farm They started digging in 2003. It took them over a year to finish, however, when they finished the found a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. The found  the main farmhouse a few years later.                    An archeologist is a type of scientist that studies the past. Archeologist might just be still discovering the Underground Railroad or dinosuar bones.

With hard work and tough digging  they have to find artifacts or bones.  This is the life of an archeologist.         As an archeologist one main event was to dig up the artifacts in Fort James.  It was tough because they had to dig something up that was 200 years ago.  It was dug up in ruins by a flooding river.  Fort James was built in 1607, that's 406 years ago!  Since archeology was started way back then they have found the first artifacts in 1861!  They found armor and weapons in the ruins.  The National Park Service led a five-year study of it to figure out how they used the land.  That's when they finally found where Fort James was built!  Finally they found about how the people of Fort James did their daily routine.  The dicovery of Fort James was very exciting to archeology life.         The second and last discovery was digging Goerge Washington's past.  As you know Washington was the fist president of the United States.  I will not tell you about Goerge Washinton, but about digging up his past.  They had a numerous amount of teams with 35 people on each team.  The first team scans the area using 3D computers.  When the information got back to them they got to work.  They digged for their lives!  Each team got a part (layer) of the dig.  One team got a skim shovel and digged the first layer.  Then it went on to troweling.  Troweling used small shovels, paint brushes, and toothpicks!  It can take up to two weeks of digging a 25-square foot area!  The last team studied the artifacts they found.  A place called Ferry Farm is based on Washington's past.  It has classes, games, and crafts.         This paragraph is based on the tools that the archeologists used.  The pick and shovel are for hard mining.  The whisk and dustpan is to clean the dust from artifacts or make it easier to see the floor.  The knife is used for detailed digging and scraping dirt from the artifacts.   The wheelbarrow is used to move heavy items from one place to another.  The skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt.  Last, but not least, the trowel is used to scrape and view different layers of soil.         As an areologist it is very hard and takes patience but in the end it is all worth it.

So, look at the paragraphs below.                       An archeologist is a hard worker, because they have to look for very old thing and new things. Like in the story Digging Up George Washington's Past and Finding Fort James.  The archeologist had to look very carefully in the dirt, the fort, the pit, George Washington's house,  and more. They need to work carefully, so they don't break anything that is fragile or just old. They need to think, because in the story Digging Up George Washigton's Past they had to think of what George Washington's did.                     An archeologist needs to be aware of what is where and if something is glinting in the sand or the dirt.  So, they need to pay attention to what is in front of them because what if it is an important piece of information or it may tie up the mystery. If you want to be an archeologist you have to pay a lot of attention to what you are doing because what if you something wrong.                                     An archeologist needs to work as a team to find what they are looking for or else they will get no where. If you work alone it would take forever to find or discover things. So don't think you can do it all by yourself, and when you work as a team you find things that need to be discovered faster.                            To be an archeologist you need to use your tools like the Wheelbarrow. You need to use it for moving things to  other areas or to move things like dirt to different places.And the Knife is used for careful digging and to get dirt off from the artifacts. Whatever other tools you get use them they will help with whatever you are working with.                            So, if you do all these instructions and you want to be an archeologist follow all these instructions and you can be a great acheologist. These are my paragraphs about being an archeologist.

My name is Emily and I am going to be telling you all about the job of and archeologist.  Let's get started shall we?  Well an archeologist has alot of resposobilities.  Like being very carful while they are using sharp tools. Or make ing sure that they are very careful with the artifacts they find while on a search. This is a list of some of the jobs or resposobilities of an archeologist!!!!           #1 In my opinion an archeologist's job is not always so bad.  Actually I am a little jealous that archeologist gets to wake up every morning and get to find unique artifacts like pottery, tools, coins and so much more!!!!  And did you know that in the 1600s people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit?           #2  Archeologists also have to use 3D computers that can track what is underground!  They used those computers to dig up the Ferry Farm.  They all got split into teams of 35 and took turns using the computers.           #3  And the final thing I am going to talk about is that archeologist have to work together as a team with the historians, because all the artifacts they found go to the historians and they learn even more about history! Like the type of life Colonial Americans lived.

We are now going to learn about finding Fort James.        In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Redicovery Archaeological Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. for over 200 years,people thought it had been washed away by the river. Some dicoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.      The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from england to start a new life. Most belived that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot problably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.           the first objects were found in 1861 those items were armor and weapons.They also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later,a group effort to find the exact spot the fort was built began.           The national park service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.        That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the forts walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read,and drawings they made,the archeologists knew it would be shaped like a triangle.They made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way to the river.Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold cannons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings within the border of the fort.

In fact it could take two weeks just to clear away a 25 square foot section of dirt at a dig. They use various tools to dig at the site. These tools include the pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and trowel.   When archeologists find something while digging they have made a discovery. These objects are called artifacts. Artifacts can be many different things like clay pots old guns and different cloths and materials. If someone finds an artifact they clean it then take it back to a lab to study it.   Most archeologists search ruins in places all over the world. They make a 3D image of the site. After they make the image they start an excavation. an excavation is basically searching the site for artifacts. An archeologists work is never done until they find what they are looking for.

Fort James was built in 1607 when the England settlers arrived to start a new life. The settlers chose a spot located near the fort. The location they chose probably gave the English settlers more protection from the enemy ships. The English found the first object in 1861.                                                                                                The First Object                         The archeologist also discovered the floors of the buildings. 100 years later a group effort helped find the exact spot where the fort was built. The National Park led a five year study for the land that was used for the fort. The park new that this would help them decide were to search for proof. The people who were studying used computer maps.                                                                                 How They Found Jamestown                 The first thing the researchers found was a set of marks on the ground. Then they saw the marks were the walls used to be. The researchers made maps and found out that Fort James stretched all the way to the river. The researchers realized that the stone ledges built over the river. The stone ledges were built to hold canons.                                                                                        The Archeologist                         The archeologist found 11 cellars. They also found a dozen of burial sites. And the burial sites were within th border of the fort. The archeologist fin 1 million objects each yaer. The objects they find include pottery,tools, and coins. The people in the 1600 used to throw thier trash down a well or a big pit.

When some people saw the Fort James, they discovered its past and started Jamestown Rediscovery. An event in the past was when settlers needed to start a new life there. They lived there, and while they were staying, they had things that they had thrown, and those became objects of the past. They discovered animals and trash they had eaten and thrown away. The archeoligists relised that the settlers didn't have much food.                 The last source of history is George Washingtons past. People lived on Ferry Farm for decades. While digging things up here, they had to be careful because there were lots of fragile things there. They had to use skim shovels, which slowly but catiasly remove the dirt to discover the artifacts. These people also had a long process of trowling. All in all, this is good for kids to learn about George Washingtons past and all the artifacts that the archeoligists scooped up.

First, they find a spot where they think something is. The spot that they picked is where they set up camp. Next, they keep digging and looking until they find something that might be helpful for their notes and search. Sometimes this can take up to more than five years. After that, they examine what they find and then they keep digging some more to find even more things.             Archeologists use many tools and each tool has a different use. One tool that they use is a shovel. This is used to dig up dirt so that the archeologists can uncover priceless artifacts. Another tool that they use is called a trowel.

In the story,Finding Fort James it talk and tells the reader that this is a informative text. In this story it also thas something to do with digging with archeologists.

Because mostly when objects or valuable items are dug up by archeologists are usually found to put in museums. Or to put some were special to dedicate that special person who once belonged to the object. Another reason I  believe that archeologists are sent places. The person that sent them or that helped might get money or anything valuable from that item.       In the story Digging  up the Past, it says that one of the special things they found in the house that George Washington once lived in was dry bones and pans they used to make food in may be valuable.

You could reveal soo much!              Another thing that archeologist can do is learn more about the pass, like my example, we could learn soo much about George Washington and what goes on in his life like maybe his family and we could know why he wanted to do what he did.              The last thing that archeologists can do is help people understand more about the pass, they can help scientist find the answers to their questions about the pass like what happened to Einstein.

Archeologist are people who can help they are able to Tell then and  now   many people don't understand why these people are remember or what they did, just like Martin Luther King Jr. he was remembered for bringing peace to the world that's something an Archeologist would be able to tell you,base on their job they dig up specific objects but if they was able to dig up the past you will see why the job they have is very important.  I think Archeologist have a very decent part in life not only because they get dirty they get good information.  For example in 1994 thousands of people believed in the fact that the Fort in Jamestown had been washed away, the Fort was build in 1607,the National Park Service  led to a five year study,that's  when they found James Fort!.  Another example most of what we know about George Washington is from his time from when he was a soldier and president,No one really know were George Washington lived since the building was long gone, they started digging  in 2003,It took over a year,But then they finally found it!    The first  building they found was the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses,They found they Farmhouse a few years later.

There are many different teams who do different jobs for this process. The first team finds the place they will be digging at. The next group focuses on the digging itself. The last group studies the results.                 The first team finds the place where the diggers will be digging. That is probably the most important job of them all because if the first group chose a place in the middle of nowhere, where there is nothing to be found, the hunt will not work. They also need something to look for. If they don't know what to look for and don't have information about it, the hunt won't work either. So, they find the place where they will hunt and map it out in detail on a 3D computer. Then, they record the information so that the diggers know what the place looked like before the digging began. That is the first groups job.                  The second team is the digger team. They have a very important job too, because they are the ones do the actual digging. They use very special tools that are great for delicately digging through the earth. They must be very careful in digging, because if they dig too hard, they could destroy the artifacts or even miss them. The most common tool used by the archeologists is the Trowel. Archeologists use it to look at the different layers of soil. Some more tools archeologists use are the pick and the shovel. They are both used to dig through the earth and look closely at the dirt. Once the diggers find what they think is an artifact, they give it to the third team.                  The third team receives the artifact that the diggers find and look very closely at it. They have special tools for that as well. They examine the artifact, determine who it belonged to, and got most of the credit. The diggers got a lot of the credit too, though. This is what the third team does.                       So this is what archeologists do. They have three different teams that work together to find artifacts that belonged to people long ago. All the teams must work extremely hard to get the job done. If I were to be an archeologist, I would want to be in the third team because you get to examine the artifacts the second team finds. I wouldn't want to be in the second team because you have to dig for a long time and give a lot of your effort into it. This is what archeologists do.

They dig up objects that can range from dinosaur bones to a gold miner's pipe. Some other examples of what they dig up are items found from old forts. One such fort is Fort James. It is a fort from 1607 where they find close to a million artifacts per year.       The process of finding these artifacts is long and hard. It involves lots of digging and working. First, the archeologists cut away at the Earth with a tool called a skim shovel, which works slowly, removing very small layers of dirt one at a time. They also begin sometimes with picks and bigger shovels. Once the objects are found, it is an equally hard process to study them.       Once artifacts are found in the dirt, a team of people examines them. If the artifacts are dirty, they are brushed off with a tool called a whisk. Then the objects are identified. They are sent off to museums and looked at by many people. They will be admired for the history that they hold and people of all kinds will enjoy them.

The information is recorded so that people will know what it looks like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging and the place the team does the digging is called a dig . Those  archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels .           The shovels are small ,flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom .This lets the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in.The diggers also use a process called troweling .Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes ,and wooden picks to remove dirt .It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section !

You have to dig deep in earth's soil. And you will have to look for grand objects from the past. Which is a very difficult job indeed. Now, for this paragraph and the other paragraphs I will type,I will explain to you about the life of an archeologist.               First let me tell you the tools an archeologist uses while working. The pick &amp; shovel are used for finding artifacts. And is also for digging up tons of artifacts from the earth's soil. The whisk &amp; dustpan, are brushing the dirt away from the artifacts that have been dug up. I will continue the rest of the tools in the next paragraph.              Now, archeologists use the knife. Not for cutting veggies at dinnertime, but they use by carefully digging in the dirt. Also use it to scrape off the dirt from around the artifacts. They use the wheelbarrow for moving the extra dirt away, and use it for moving items including tools, pottery, coins, and metal toys to one location to another. I will continue the rest in the continuing paragraph.              The archeologists use the skim shovel. They use it for removing the thin layers of soil with one scoop at a single time. And finally, the trowel. Probably the most common tool in archeology. And it is used for scraping and cutting to find different layers if soil. That was all of the tools that the archeologists use.             Now it is time to explain what the archeologists do besides using tools. Of course, archeologists dig, and find things from the past. Things like dinosaur bones, or dinosaur footprints. Well, some of the archeologists find things other than prehistoric reptile bones. They found man made objects.             Some objects like I said before, pottery, old toys, tools, coins and metal. Sometimes they even found the animal bones they ate. They also found the trash left behind. Well, besides what they found, the archeologists found some pretty neat stuff. I will tell you about what they did in the next paragraph.             Now, I will tell you what the archeologists did. They did things like traveling to far away places. Now back to what they found. Something interesting about arceology, is that the first object was found in 1861. Is that cool or what? It could also take over a year to find those artifacts! Well, that is all I can say about archeology! Just like I said, being an archeologist isn't easy!

In a team their can be up to 35 people.       Tools   As you know 35 people can be on a team. Each team has the some tools to use.  Pick and shovel; most digs start with these tools to dig up the first layer soil with grass. Whisk and dustpan; are used to brush dirt off artifacts. Skim shovel; is a shovel with a flat edge to remove a thin layer of soil. Trowel; is used to scrape and cut different layers of soil.       Finding Proof   Some times we find houses of people that are buried. We need proof. We keep records such as the home had a fire in it. To make shore that this is the home we need to find burnt items. We some times try to find parts of items that the person owed.       So inclusion the job of an archeologist can be fun.

Well, have you ever wondered how the report was made? Simple! By archeologists. Archeologists have a very important job. They find facts about well-knowned people in history. When you think about George Washington, you think of the first president. Most people don't think about George Washington's childhood.      But archeologists find more, and more information about him. They try to find proof about their artifacts. They will try to find very important things that are from history. Archeologists even tried to find George Washington's house! Archeologists make predictions about what they find. For example, when they found George Washington's house, they predicted that there was a fire, because they found burnt pottery.      They also found clay pipes. And, we know that George Washington smoked clay pipes. So, the archeologists thought this was the right house. They also found important artifacts that people now know. Archeologists make history because they find stuff very important, that can be used. But, being a archeologist isn't so easy. Archeologists use tools, like the pick and shovel. Archeologists use these tools to start digging. They also use: whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, a trowel, and a skim shovel.      Archeologists are very important. They know a bunch of history!

Well all of the sudden another person yelledout well how about we go dig for Fort James right now. So then they all went back to their houses and gathered all of their supplies and headed out to go dig for Fort James. So first they would have to get a three demensoinal picture to see if there would be anything in their way to dig. And then they started dig for Fort James, then the first evidence of the fort were found.

You have to have a lot of skills to be a skilled worker like archeologists. You can't just go out in a historical site and start digging. You need to do research and look at maps to know where to dig. You need to have three skills if you want to be a good archeologist; Perseverance, teamwork, and knowledge. if you have those skills you can become a good archeologist.             Perseverance is a major skill in archeology. The National Park Service led a five year study about Jamestown's Fort James. It took perseverance for archeologists to research Fort James. Imagine yourself studying one topic for five years! It really took a lot of time! And perseverance! So an archeologist's job is important and takes a lot of perseverance.           Teamwork is also a big skill for an archeologist. Without teamwork you can't get anything done. And with an archeologist you need to have teamwork to find artifacts and ancient remains. Without teamwork you can't find artifacts fast and you can't find them easy. You will not even find an artifact if you don't have teamwork. Thats why teamwork is a good skill you need to have if you want to be an archeologist. In the five year study it also took a lot of teamwork. People had to cooperate and work together to find Fort James.           The last skill you need is called knowledge. If you don't have knowledge you can't get artifacts. In 2003 when archeologists believed that a stone base under George Washingtons childhood house it took knowledge to know that it could be under there. They ended up finding many rooms. But it took over a year! You really do need to have knowledge in being an archeologist.           These examples show and prove that you need perseverance, teamwork, and knowledge to be an archeologist. If you decide to be an archeologist you should consider having these skills. It will help you through life and being an archeologist. An archeologists job is mainly to discover artifacts and treasures from the past. An archeologists job is really unique and special.

It comes with responsibility and you need to be very organized. if not you may lose your research and and have lost all these things lost and all you'll have is some bones. Also to be an Archeologist you have to be OK with getting down and dirty so you can do your job of finding the body of old famous people or dinosaurs. also to be a archeologist you have to be found of math because if this person or dinosaur live crescents ago you have to do the math to say how old they were or to see when the died.

Also to be an archeologist you will have to work with tools like the pick or shovel, whisk and dustpan knife,wheelbarrow,skim,,trowel.To even be able to do this job you have to be able to find the bones they could be any where so keep your eye out for bones. to do this job you have to have computer skills like knowing how to type because you might have lest written thing and more typing.

Like having fun and when you do this job you will get to go to very famous places.Like if your trying to find queen Elsbeth then you would get to go to England. the bad part about this is that your hands would always be dirty and finger nails would have dirt under the nail.             One more part about being an archeologist is that on your team it can be up to 35 five people on one team. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that track what is under ground.The info is recorded so that people start diging. so by saying that a hole team works to gather to get the job done.This may seem like alot of work but when your doing some thing you love it's not work it's fun.

The first thing you have to do is find the spot where you think the debris field is. Next you map it out on  a 3D mapping machine that tells you whats underground. Afterwards you start using shovels and the wheelbarrows to haul out dirt. Next you use a skim shovel to carefully remove thin layers of dirt.       Afterword you would use a Whisk and Dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts. After that you would then use a small shovel called a trowel it is probably the most common tool in archeology. The trowel does lots of things to help and archeologist one of them is to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Another one is that you can maneuver around the artifact and get in the crevices. Finally the last one is that you can use the trowel to smooth out the area where you dug the artifacts up.       My conclusion is that an archeologist's job is very hard and long. Proof that their job is very hard and long is that you have to use so many different tools. And the smaller the tools get the longer it takes to cover as much ground. As  with a big tool you can cover twice as much ground in twice as much time. Finally you can tell that it is a long and hard job is that there are almost 25 people on each dig at one time.

The shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half- inch screen at the bottom.

First you must be very smart by finding out where ancient might be and you must be able to research and things on the computer.       Also you must be smart by digging in the right places so you don't destroy any fragile artifacts. Archeologists have to be so careful that it can take months just to dig up a couple of artifacts. Archeologists have many to special tools for finding lost artifacts. Like many different types of machines, hammers, and drills.       There are many different teams of archeologists there are the research where you use the computer and find things,digging group who dig up the artifacts, and the displayers who clean the things and show them in museums or special places.       Archeologists search from dinosaur fossils to kids toys in the past. An Archeologists main job is to collect stuff to help us understand the far back past. A very old toy were rattles because back then they were pretty easy to make. You could use an animal bone for the whole rattle then place a stone inside the opening of the bone. Normally very young children enjoyed rattles.       Digging up dinosaur bones is probably the hardest and trickiest thing to dig up. The reason is because the bones are thousands of years old and are packed way into the earth. There are over a hundred types of dinosaurs to dig up. That does not mean it is easy to find them though. The computer archeologists team has to find and predict where dinosaurs would have been. Then they send the digging team to the spot and tell its cordinates.       Now the digging team has to get a very special machine that digs deep into the earth. Now the team takes all the dirt they dug up and puts it through a thing that takes all the sand off and leaves the rocks and artifacts there. They search it to try to find fossils or items. When they find a dinosaur fossil they search to find the whole body. If they do they send it to the museum people and they clean the fossil up and put it together.       Soon it is put in a museum. Being an archeologist is a very long prosess. But it is a very good job to have when you are older. It is a really good paying and interesting job and you can have a really fun future being one.

Did you know that archeologists have to be extremely careful when dealing with artifacts? Archeologists have to find the right spot to investigate, put effort into digging the artiifacts up, and study what they find.         Before archeologists start digging they have to figure out where to dig. There is a whole team of archeologists commited to finding the right spot. They use high tech 3D computers that can track whats under ground. the information that the team finds is recorded so that they will know what it looked like at first before they dug.          Next the archeologists have to go into action. There is another team that focases on the digging. The place that the team does the digging is called 'The Dig'. first the diggers use small flat shovles called skim shovels to tin layers of soil that is soon put iin a box with a screen at the bottom. this makes the dirt fall out while any artifacts stay in. next archeologists use small shovels wooden picks andpaint brushes to remove any dirt from artifacts. it can take upto two weeks to dig a twenie-five foot section!            Finaly, another team has to spend days in a lab study the artifacts that were found. This is a long hard process but in the end it is all worth it.

They learn themselves too. They have found things that if they had not found them then we not have known that they existed. Archeologist do awesome things like finding four hundred year old forts, find old president homes as a kid, and use really cool tools.        For over 200 years people had thought that Fort James had been washed away. It was in 1861 when the first objects of the fort were found. Over 100 years later a group found the exact spot of where the fort was. They realized that James Fort was triangular and that they had a big well type thing that they threw their waste into.        In 2003 archeologists decided to try to dig up George Washington's home as a child. After 1 year they found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Also a few years later they found the main farmhouse. To have proof that this was actually George Washington's house they found his clay pipe and burnt pottery in which they knew that he had a fire in his home.        How do they find all of this stuff ? They have to have some sort of equipment. They do,  in fact they use different types of shovels to help with different types of soils, they have a wheelbarrow to carry artifacts and soil away, to get dirt away from artifacts they use a knife and a whisk and dust pan to brush dirt away from the excavation.        As you can see their job is not the easiest thing to do. When they dont find something they probable get down but they always keep their heads up and keep on keepin on. If you know someone who is an archeologist tell them thank you for their great work.

I will explain more about archeologists and the tools they use if you keep reading.       If you ever want to be an archeologist you have to study a lot about the place you choose.  The archeologists in source #1 were trying to find James Fort.  First they had to study about it like I said in the sentence before. Then they had to look for artifacts. They probably had to use some of the tools I was talking about. Since they did a lot of studying and read books about it,  all of there hard work payed off.  They finally found James Fort.       In source #2 the archeologists were trying to find more on George Washington's childhood.  They believed that the stone base under the house was still there.  They had to dig if they wanted to prove it.  So they started to dig, and dig, and dig. Finally they found it even if it took over a year.  They found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.  There were other houses so they had to find proof that it was his house.  Finally they found proof that it was his house.       I will talk about the tools now.  The tools they used were a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.  They were all used to find and dig up artifacts.

But actually its the best job ever. You get to learn cool things and have fun. We also dig from the past and search. We get to use cool 3D computers to search stuff and many more. Let me tell you some ways how its fun and how we do the work.       One reason why being an archeologist is cool and interesting because we get to find things that famous people in the old days used like old plates well they used wood as plates and bowls, we would find that and we would also find many more things like pottery and clay pipes as you know George Washington smoked that.  We where actually digging and we found burned pottery and many more stuff.       Some tools we use are pick and shovel, we start digging with those two tools. The skim shovel is very useful we use that to take off very thin and thick layers of soil.  Then we use a knife to dig and scrape dirt of the artifacts.  It says the best thing to use in archeology is the Trowel, it is to scrape and cut the soil to see how it looks. We use a wheelbarrow because all the artifacts are heavy and we cant carry alot of heavy stuff,It hurts. At the end we use a whisk and a dustpan to brush the artifacts because we could see whats under the dust.       We find proof, we don't just lie we actually look. We find burned pottery and sometimes houses underground. Its very cool, we sometimes even find a canon. Its very cool, but to find that stuff we have cool equipment like 3D computers and scanning robots to find metal stuff.       So I really think being an archeologist is fun and interesting.

The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all withen the border of the fort. While digging in the area, the archeologists ound the trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they hate.                       Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made, arsheologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. Today, the groups find nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metel toys for children.

The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is under ground. So that was my report that I wrote. Thank you very much.

An archioligist studies objects which they find in the dirt called artifacts and studies them. Even though you have to dig alot it is worth it when you find the artifact you were looking for.            If you would like to be an archioligist you have to be really patient because you might be digging for weeks. Artifacts may also tell you something about that time period.

This all may sound simple, but it's not! Archeologists must be very patient and careful with the artifacts and the digging, because if you are not careful with an artifact than you may drop or break it! Also, like I said before, you must be very patient because digging sometimes can take a very long time! Now, you must be thinking, what's so great about artifacts anyways? Well, artifacts are not just a piece of history, they can also tell us more about the history in that time period. Actually, I had already said that earlier, but that is okay.               Now we shall be talking about how artifacts help understand and tell us more about the history. For example in Source #2 it talks about George Washington's history and how some artifacts helped to understand a little bit more about his life, I mean they found clay pipes, and George Washington smoked clay pipes!That is also how archeologists knew that they had found the right house because it was evidence that it was the correct house. Wow! How cool is that! Archeologists can find the place that they are looking for just by having the right facts and finding artifacts! I'm pretty sure that is something that archeologists are trained to do.          Now you must be wondering, ' How do archeologists find and dig up these artifacts, and what do they normally use?', well, hold your horses, because now I about to tell you! Actual archeologists do not just find these artifacts by themselves. No way that would happen! Then finding the artifact or artifacts would take forever! No, that actually doesn't happen, because archeologists work together as a team to discover the artifacts. As a matter of fact, some teams can have up to thirty-five people on the team! No joke! But what do archeologists USE to find these items? You must be wondering. Well right now I shall list a couple of tools that archeologists and their team use to dig up these items. Pick and shovel are used to start most digs to dig near the artifacts. Whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts, and to clear dirt away from the excavation site, too. The knife is used for careful digging and also to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used not only to move items from one place to another, also to sometimes to carry dirt away from the excavation site to someplace elsewhere. The skim shovel is used to remove thin layers of soil, carefully, with a flat edge made for that specific purpose. Now I will be telling you about the last tool that is commonly used by archeologists, and it is called the trowel. The trowel is actually probably the most commonly used tool in archeology. It is normally used to cut and scrape to view the different layers of soil, there. Well, there is one more thing used for digging up artifacts in archeology, some teams use 3-D computers that can track what is inside what is in the ground right before the digging, so that you will not have to dig in a place where there isn't anything that you were looking for.Well, now I believe that I have covered all the tools!         Wow! Now I hope that you have at least learned something new about archeology, and archeologists, if you have, good for you! And if you haven't, well, too bad then! Anyways, I still hoped that you have enjoyed my report on archeology, and archeologists! Bye!

Archeologists also need to be observant and aware of their surroundings. Something could be laying beneath the dirt 25 feet away from you and you may not notice, so always be aware. You may not think so, but archeologists are very important people. You would be surprised of how much knowledge in history has come from archeologists finding and putting together the puzzles of the past. Archeologists also help people understand famous people from long ago, such as George Washington. Archeologists went out looking for items and hints of his past so people could understand what his life was like before he was even famous.             One of the tools an archeologist uses to find items and hints of the past is a 3D computer that can detect things underneath the surface of the earth. This tool is used in many cases, for it is very important. This device is important to archeologists because it can see more than the human eye can. As I said earlier, something could be laying 24 feet away from you covered in dirt and you may not notice. That's why archeologists use the 3D computer. Although not everything archeologists use is a high-tech device. Archeologists still have to use their own senses to find an item. And archeologists still have to use shovels to dig things up. So archeologists also requires strength.             Some self-operated tools that archeologists still have to use are trowels, skin shovels, wheelbarrows, whisks and dustpans, picks, and shovels. You may have notices that I said shovel twice, but the two shovels I said are two different types of shovels. The skin shovel is used to start the digging. The sharp, flat blade of the shovels helps to remove tough layers of soil that can't be removed by a regular shovel. The wheel barrow is used to put dirt in so other archeologists can take the dirt somewhere else and dump it out, then they bring it back to the whole the other archeologists are digging, then the cycle of that repeats.             Many of the people that may be reading this may feel different about archeologists and may understand them better. I hope that the readers of this report are now truly fascinated by the life of an archeologist.

Archeologists are a group of people who study objects from the past. They look for things underground and they dig it up and study it. Archeologist study places like Jmes Fort and were George Washington lived. They have to find the place where the building was and have to dig it up.          The first objects they found in James Fort was in 1861. They also studied the fort's floor of the buildings. They also uncover weapons and armors. Archeologist today find 1 million objects a year in the spot that James Fort was found and where it was built.The type of objects they find are pottery, tools, coins, and some toys that the children played with. The archeologists found the trash that people in the 1600's threw away including the bones of the food they ate.            Once archologists find the spot where the building or house was, they rebuild it so people can see how they lived and how it looked like over 100 years ago. They build it exactly how it was in the past. With the help of archologist the workers rebuilt it. Archeologist find the spot that the building was, and on the ground there are marks that show where the walls are.            Archeologists find these things by digging underground in the same spot where they buildings were built and then were destroyed. They use tools like the skim shovels to help them dig. They also used the pick, which is used to dig. The most common tool is the trowel, it scrapes and cuts to view the different layers of soil.            Archeologist have difficult jobs and can take about 5 years to finish finding and studing the objects they find. They work in groups so they can work faster and each group has about 35 people. the first group maps the area usning 3D computers. The process is slow.

Being an archeologist you have to be really be patient and persistent. I don't think that it would be a fit job for me. Spending  your whole day outside digging is what it takes to be an archeologist. Even if you spend your whole day on you hands and knees that dose not mean you are going to find anything.               Most people just think that archeologist are people that just dig. But that's not right there is more than that to one who is an archeologist. They split the archeologist into teams ( there can be up to 35 people in a team ) The first team uses 3-D computers that can tell them what is underground. Then they keep track of what the computers are saying what's underground. So therefore they can tell the diggers what they are going to find roughly. The second team is doing the digging. The place where that dig is call a dig.                Archeologist have to use many tools too. Here are the tools they use to dig at the digs                     -Pick and a Shovel      Which they are use to start a dig                  -Whisk and a Dustpan     Which are used to clean off that artifacts                  -Kinfe     Which is use to dig dirt off the artifacts                  -Wheelbarrow     Which are use to carry things from one place to another                  -Skim Shovel     Which is use to dig thin layers of soil                  -Trowel     Which is used for cut through the ground to see the different layers of soil Thoughs are the tools that archeologist use in the digs.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came England to start a new life. Most believed that James fort was built near the river. did you know that it was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. some people found objects nearby and suggested that the fort was located further away.the new spot mostly gave the settlers more protection from the enemy ships around them.                 Did you know that the first objects were found in 1861. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

Did you know that the people that were studying use computer mapping software to make an image of the area.                     Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. While digging in the area, the archaeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate. they said  that this trash the settlers threw away helped them under stand the way the people in Jamestown lived and what they ate.

First,it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous. The first thing that they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the fort`s walls used to be . Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made, the archaeologist knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.                                              They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges were designed to hold canons.

We also know what the setters did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.   They had new that mybe had to do it because they  had something to protect and they had to go through all of that.

Archeoliogists also use many tools to recover these objects like a Trowel they use this to scrape and cut to view the layers of soil this tool is the most common tool in Arceology.  Arceologists also use other tools like Wheelbarrow they use this to move items from place to place or carry dirt away from the excavation site.

Archeologists also have a role to fill in math and technology when they have to calculate in their head or even on a site then they have to be exact and they also use tecnology too and they have to have very good computer and tech skills because they use these alot in Arceology and when they use these they also have to make sure that the computer is also working properly!            Archeologists often are very exiciting because they could find anything that interests people of all ages because they could find a dinosaur bone or something that could also intrest kids.  When they dig they use very good postures they have to have  clena hands and most of all gloves so they dont get any of their prints on the object because if they get a print on the object then when they send it to a Sciencetist then they can figure out whos artifact it is or where did it come from and how long has it been there for?

Well, you guessed it! Archeologists. Archeologist have a very important job to do. They dig up things that are still unknown about and they find out more about our marvelous history. Though the job is very tiring and slow, it is all worth it.       First, you'll need some tools! Archeologists have to have many tools to dig things up. Some of the tools they use are the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, the knife, the wheelbarrow, and the skim shovel. These help a lot in finding old artifacts. Most of the time, you will need a pick and shovel. They are basically used to dig. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush off dirt from the artifacts but without destroying the artifacts. The knife is for scraping off dirt around the artifact and the wheel barrow is for moving items from one place to another. Lastly, the skim shovel is different from a regular shovel, It has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.       Next, archeologists need to have accurate measurements to see where the artifacts are. Archeologists use 3D computers that can track what is underground. There are many teams that help out. One team can be up to 35 people! Each team has it's own job, for example, one team can do the actual digging and the other can study the items that were dug up. They can spend days on one artifact which may seem very long; it actually is but it's all worth it in the end.       Then, after the artifacts are dug up, a team studies the artifact that was brought in. And this can help people understand better about our history. When you put the pieces together, you can see how our history connects in one piece. That shows that archeologists have a big job.       In conclusion, archeologist have a very important job to do and that is to find out more about our past and history. They do the hard and tiring work to discover more about history. So that shows that they should be respected. Archeologists have a interesting job and I think it would be fun to have a job like that.

Archeologists use  a pick and shovel to dig into the earth close to artifacts. They also use a wisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skilm,shovel, and trowel.  They go in teams and 35 people can go on a team. The first team maps an area by using 3 demention computers to trackt what is underground. The other team goes on a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with a skilm shovel.   When archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt is called Troweling.           Archeologists started digging to find Washington's house in 2003. Records show that the Washington's   house had a fire in it. The diggers found pieces of burt pottery that showed a fire was there. They also foun part of a clay pipe so we know that Washington smoked clay pipes.            Finding Fort James   In 1994, a group of people intrested in studing the past started the jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was desined for discovering the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia. For more  than 200 years, people thought a river washed the fort away.        The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most of the people believed that James Fort was built near the river so it was easier to dock ships there so it made sence.  Objects nearby suggested the fort was located far away so the new spot maybe gave the settelers more protection from enemies.       The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists are the name for scientists that study objects from the past that uncovered armor and wepons. They also dicovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort wwas built began.           The National Park service led a five - year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing this study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.       That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read and the drawlings they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized ther were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges where desined to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.           Today, the group  finds nearly 1 million objects a year. The objects include pottery,tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or in a pit. While digging in the area, diggers find the trash and animal bones settelers threw away.   The information learned from these objects helps them understand how the people in James Fort lived. Now we know how settelers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. We also know what the settelers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.

Archaeologists are scientists who study objects from the past. The first objects from the past were found in 1861. Some archaeologists uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered some floors from buildings. Some even look for famous places, things, and people from the past, for example, Fort James and George Washington's past.                     Some tools they used were picks and shovels. Picks and shovels were used to start digging until you got close to the artifacts. I think the picks were used to brake rocks that were in the way of the dirt. I think the shovels were used to carry dirt to the wheelbarrow.                     Wheelbarrows were used to move things away to a new place. Things wheelbarrows might have carried things like dirt, rocks, and maybe artifacts. Wheelbarrows maybe important to archaeologists because if they didn't have wheelbarrows how would they carry things from place to place.                     Whisks and dustpans were used to brush dirt off of the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Maybe whisks and dustpans were also used to sweep up thing like broken artifacts or bones. I think whisks and dustpans were important to archaeologists or else if they didn't have them they wouldn't be able to sweep away all the dirt.                     Knives were used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Also I think knives were used to cut roots that were in the way. Or knives could be used to dig out left behind dirt in the artifacts.                     Skim shovels is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Also I think they could be used to carry dirt to the wheelbarrows. If archaeologists didn't have skim shovels they wouldn't be able to remove the thin layers.                     Trowels are probably the most common tool in archeology. Also used to scrape and also to cut to view the different layers of soil. If archaeologists didn't have trowels they wouldn't be able to scrape and cut the soil.

Well, now you will. Archeologists are scientists who study objects, known as artifacts, from the past. I used 3 resources with facts about archeologists to find the right information. The articles are titled, 'Finding Fort James', 'Digging up George Washingtons Past', and ' Tools Used by Archeologists'.                     In 1994, archeologists found Fort James. The fort was believed, for 200 years, that it was washed away by a river or moving water. The fort was built in 1607 and the first objects giving facts about the past were found in 1861. The artifacts found wwere armor, weapons, and floors of buildings. About 100 years later a team of archeologists worked very hard to find where the fort was located. Even though they might not have found the exact place, they found near it. Today, groups of archeologists find 1 million artifacts from Fort James a year.              George Washington was a heroic leader and it's so fascinating to learn about his life, where he got is ideas, and where he lived. The land George and his family lived on is called Ferry Farm and families have lived on that land for over 12000 years. Ferry Farm is a perfect place to build a home, and that's probably why George's father moved his family there. George moved to Ferry Farm when he was only six, that means he spent almost his whole life on that land. Nobody knows exactly where the house was, nor which main farm was his, but we can use artifaccts to make an educated guess. The first buildings and floors they found were slave quarters, the kitchen, and storage houses. Occurding to records,it had said that the Washingtons' house had caught on fire. With that information, when the archeologists found burnt potterey, they had a more educated guess on where the Washingtons had built there house. They also already knew that George had smoked clay pipes, so when they found half of a clay pipe, they had a better guess on which was his house and farm. This is how we know and continue to learn so much about George Washington and his family.                Artifacts are used by archeologists so they can find information from our history. As they keep digging, we keep learning all of the amazing facts about our history. Archeologists have such an important job in our world. The job of an archeologist is to dig up the past and get the information we need to know about our history and historical figures in our history.

In the articles, 'Finding Fort James', and 'Digging up George Washington's Past', by Cheryl Bradley and Gloria Corres, it explains what the finders of artifacts, or archeologists do. Archeologists have complicated, time consuming jobs, but it is all worth it to find impressive artifacts that tell us about our past.          To begin, the work that archeologists do is usually complicated. One team creates a map with 3D computer that tracks what is underground. The other team digs with a small, flat, and sharp shovel. They then put the soil in a box. The archeologists can also use a process called troweling, where they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to get rid of dirt.           Another idea is that it is worth all this hard work. With all this work, archeologists can help people learn more about our past. In 'Digging up George Washington's Past', it explains that with all their hard work, United State's citizens have a better understanding of what he was like before he was famous, we get to know more about why he made the decisions he did, and we also get to know how Colonial Americans lived.           Lastly, their jobs are very time consuming. It took two weeks for archeologists to dig up a 25 square foot place! It also took 5 years to find James Fort!          Overall, an archeologists job is complicated, time consuming, but worth it. Even though with all this hard work archeologists work hard.

The genius project was designed to discover the past of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, many people thought Jamestown had been washed over by a huge river, but some discoveries say it might still be around.                  The huge fort was built in 1607, along time ago. When settlers came from England to start an new life. Most folks believe that James Fort was built very close to a river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it would make sense that the would choose that spot to dock. Objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away tho.                  The first few artifacts were found in 1861 when Archeologists uncovered armor and weapons. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built again.

You can learn how they functioned, how day to day life was, and what they did that is different from today.

The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.There were ledges that were designed to hold cannons.Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.                     Another example of what archeologist do is when archeologists found things about George Washington like   when archeologist found that people had lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years.No one knew  exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone. At least four other houses have been built on the Ferry Farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washington's farmhouse.They also found part of a clay pipe we know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house.

But also Archeologists job can be a REALLY fun job because you could be the first people ever to see that certain artifact or fossil and it could change the world.Also Archologists job is  really tiring and time consuming but at the end of the day it all pays off when they get to see all the artifacts ansd fossils of the past from finding Fort James to learning George Wasington's past the job of an Archeologists can be fun interesting tiring ansd tough all at the same time but in the end it all pays off.                I think being an Archeologist would be a really fun job,it would be really interesting to learn about George Washington's past and Fort James and how people lived back then, and the stuff they used.

Well if not I am going to tell you. Archeologists are people who learn about the past and dig in the places where people from the past were or lived. They also dig in the famous places from the past so the can get money, and put the things that they find in a muesum.               I told you they also learn about the past. Well, that is true and one reason is because they can learn about where things were and maybe where they still are. They also learn about some people so if they dig in a place and they don't know who lived there and maybe  that person was very famous maybe like George Washington, Abe Linkcoln, or Paul Revere. Then they would either know who lived there or could learn and see.                  They have dug up a lot of things like pipes, pottery, little things, and even houses, buildings and towns! They found James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. That was built in 1607! They actually found the first items in 1861. One hundred year later they found James Fort!                    They also have found George Washington's farmhouse that he lived in when he was six years old. People have been living on that land for over 12,000 years. The house actually burned down! They started looking in 2003. It took more than a year until they found it.  They used some 3D computers that can track under ground. Since then they have a program for kids and they teach them about things about George Washington.              There are a lot of tools archeologists use. Some are picks, shovels, wisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. There are probally a lot more tools!                 That is all I can tell you about archeologists! I hope you learned a lot of things about archeologists and what they do.

Archeologists                                       By: Zhiarrize ly Rosimo                                                Have you ever wondered how we know about the people in the past and  how they lived and worked ? How we knew dinosaurs that lived here before us ? Well, we know these things because of archeologists. They are the ones who dig up these artifacts and study them. Archeologists have lots of jobs.                    First, one job an archeologist might have is that they have to find an interest that people have from the past that  can not be proved like how people were interested in studying the past of the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. When they find an interest they look for the spot where it might be. They also check if any other archeologists from the past had found artifacts that are part of the interest such as the Jamestown where archeologists found objects in the area in 1861. Then they get ready to dig the site or area . That is the first step.                     Next, before they can dig  they must find the spot where it might be. They also might find  out how the land was used  and how they used resources to find the right spot. As an example; like when the National Park led a 5 year study of the area to figure out how the land was used for the Jamestown Project. To find the right spot and area they use technology to make an image such as computer mapping software and 3D computers that can track what is underground.The information is stored away and recorded so the archeologists know what the area looked  like before they started digging.This the second step.                       Finally, they do the actual digging of the site. Another team does the real digging of the artifacts because of the computers and the technology they use the archeologists know right where to dig and what artifacts to expect. The area they do the actual digging is called the dig. They use skim shovels to start the digging of the dig.The shovels are very small ,flat, and sharp  so that they can remove the thin layers of soil , one at a time. The soil that has been dug is placed in a box with a 1/2 inch screen  in the bottom. It lets the soil fall out but the artifats stay in. They also use the process called troweling . Troweling is when the archeologists use tiny shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the soil. This process takes a lot of hard work and time. It can take up 2 weeks just to dig a  25- square -foot section! Another team of archeologists study the artifacts at a lab and that can take a long time. The tools used by archeologists are; pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and teh trowel.                          So say thank you to your fellow archeologists because without them you would not know anything about dinosaurs or our presidents, anything because they work very hard an take their time for us to know about history. Those are the jobs of the archeologists.

This tool is used for scrape and cut soil to see the different types.            Archeologists can dig up small and big things.

Big things were found when the archeologists were trying to find out where George Washington lived. They found the stone base. That was probably huge!!!

If you want to ' Get Involved' then you can go to Ferry Farm, it has lot of chances to explore sites (digging sites), know how colonial life was like, and even become a junior archeologist!

When they first found  James Fort,they found a set of  marks on the ground,thats were they marked the walls. They also found 11 cellars,tons of burial sites,and 10 buildings in the borderd of the fort. Today groups find nearly 1 million things each year. that includes pottery,tools, coins,and even a metal toy for kids. Fact,in the 1600's they used an unused well or a big pit to throw there trash down into,settlers threw away bones from animals they ate. With that info got from those things we now know how the people in James Fort lived.

Knife, used to careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.Wheelbarrow, used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from excavation site.Skim shovel , a shovel  with a flate edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Trowel,used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                                   James Fort was built in 1607 when people came from England to start a new life. For over 200 years people thouht that  the fort was washed away by the river. But thanks to archeologist they actuly found James Fort . Now we can get to know more about how the people lived at James Fort. The natinoal park service led a 5 year study to figure out how the land was used. They knew that that would help them look for proof of the fort. People doing the study computer maping software to make an image of the area.

People have been living here since and archeologist like me are here to discover it. Being an archeologist is hard work. You work for hours a day. You have to have gentle hands to do the job that we do. Hope you enjoy me telling you about the past and the discoveries that archeologists have made.                       The first thing I should probably tell you is what kind of tools we use to find these artifacts.Some of the tools we use a lot in beginning of the dig are the pick and the shovel. We use these to dig into the earth and get closer to the artifacts. Then we use the wheel barrow to remove the dirt that we just dug up with the shovel and pick. We also use the wheel barrow to remove the artifacts that we dug up. After that we use the skim shovel and the trowel. We use the skim shovel to remove thin layers of dirt gently and we use the trowel to scrape and view the different kinds of soils. Then some of the last tools we use are the whisk and dustpan, and the knife. We use the whisk and dustpan to remove dirt from the artifacts and we use the knife to carefully dig and to scrape the dirt from the artifacts. Those are some of the tools we use when we are out on the job and now you can see how many tools we have to use before we actually get the artifactt.               Now I am going to tell you some of the famous people that we have tried to learn more about. One of them wasn't actually a person it was a huge group of people. They lived in the Fort James in James Town. In 1994 people interested in the past started a rediscovery of Fort James. It was built in 1607 and for over 200 years people have thought that it was washed away by a river. After a few years they finally fond there first artifact in 1861 and national park services led a five-year of the area to find out how it was used. Later they found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the forts boundries. Then they found out that they built stone bridges going across the river and they held cannons. Back then they had wells that they would throw there trash into and and after a few years of looking for one they found it with bones from the animals they ate and the trash they threw away.Today they find nearly 1 million artifacts including pottery, tools, coins, and even a few metal toys for kids. These artifacts helped us learn a lot about the first succesful settlement.                    Another really famous person that we tried to find out more about was George Washington. Most of what we already new about him was from his time of being a soldier and his time of being  president. George Washington moved to Ferry Farm at the age of 6 and archeoligists like my self beleived that the stone base of his house was still there, so they started looking for it in 2003. It took several years to find, but eventuallly they found some of it. They found the slave quarters, the kitchen, and storage houses. Later they found the main farm house. The finding of these artifacts have us discover many things of what people did in the past and soon people will be looking for our bones.                      In conclusion, I hope you have learned many things and that you just got a chance to imagine what it is like for archeologists.   Now when all of these archeologists that you see today are dead you will take there place and keep on learning about our past.

While searching for new places, you have to first scan the area. Because discovering and analyzing an area is not all found in a day's work, you would also need to map out the place. You also would have to do some research on the place, which can take many years depending on how well known the area is. If you find any buildings, broken or not, you still have to analyze them ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.07992668981081,1.05843749725631,1.38841375235959

They have to use special tools like the pick and shovel in which they use to dig up the hard ground at the site. That is one of the different tools that the archeologists use wile finding artifacts.     There are different types of tools for digging up artifacts and here they are and how they are used.    The Whisk and Dustpan: used for cleaning dust and dirt off the artifact.   The Knife: used for careful digging and to help clean off the object.   The Trowel: used to scrape and cut the soil to see the different layers.   The Skim Shovel: has flat edge and is used to carefully dig a thin layer of  soil (dirt) with every scoop.   The Wheelbarrow: used to move big dirt piles and heavy artifacts.     Archeologists find different and really exiting things wile digging up artifacts. Once in 1994 they found Fort James!! Then in 2004 the archeologists found George Washington's farmhouse from when he was a kid!!! They found out that the kitchen, slave quarters,  storage houses, and farmhouse were seperate buildings.     There are different places to go on the enternet to find what archeologists have learned and found here are four I think might give the most information about finding George Washington's farmhouse:   http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-acheology/digs-washington-200809.html?c=yge=1 or http://www.kenmore.org or http://diganthro.wordpress.com/ferry-farm or http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/ProcessArch/ProcessArch/field_excavationtech.html with these you can learn all about how they found the stone base of Washington's house. Then if you want to learn about how they found Fort James here are three websites I found that might give you some infomation:   http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/chronology-of-jamestown-archeology.html or http://historicjamestowne.org or http://apva.org/rediscovory with these you can learn about how they found james fort.

Another team foucuses on digging. The place the team does the digging is  called a dig. The arceoligests satrt digging with a shovel called skim shovels. Those shovels are used to get small layers of soil off the ground becaus they are flat, small and sharp.The soil is then placed in a box. In that box there is a half-inch screen. this screen is there so the dirt\soil can go out and the artifacts stay in the box. They also use these tools : pick and shovel , whisk and dustpan , knife , wheelbarrow , skim shovel ,and a Trowel. Those tools are all used with arceoligests. They say a 25-square-foot section can two weeks to dig !                      The last team spends days in the lad to study the objects they have found.

When the archeologist has found something he or she has to clean it with a whisk and dustpan. If the artifact has to hard dirt the archeologist has to clean it with a knife.          If the archeologist finds a lot of stuff they will have to use a wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow is used to move things from one place to another. Then there is the part to actually study the figuer.

But this is what they learned before that in 1607 when the settler went to England. they thought it be by a river cause it was easy to dock ships. So it moved far away since it wouldn't be spotted by enemy ships. Also they are sposed to find objects that are old  like weapons, food, books, and armor cause archeology found a little bit of stuff like that in 1861. And archeologist like finding new things and explore cause they really want the artifact and examine them.                   Archeologist also dig to find things like the people who dug up the dirt just to find George Washington's house by Ferry Farm. They dug it up because the farm house had burned.

Every one in the class was excited but our teacher said,'' That we have to choose a different job for people who are interested in the study of history. Then our teacher put a list up on the wall with history jobs, she said that after recces you could look at it. Soon of nuff recces was over I was the first one to go over there to the list. Their were a whole bunch of jobs then at the very bottom their was Archeologists I grabbed the pencil and I wrote my name next to it. Then my teacher said that you have to go home and do research  about what job you picked. Suddenly the bell rang school was over. I ran all the way home and ran to the computer then I looked up archeologists,I found a lot about archeologist so I got out by notebook and started writing. Then my mom called me down for dinner, so Iran down stairs to the table my mom said what was I doing on the computer, I said that I had to do a project. After I ate dinner I went back up stairs to start writing then I found a paragraph so I wrote it down : In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships. In Conclusion, I learned a lot about archeologists I also think my class will like it so will my teacher.

The activity is used to explore the hidden secrets of James Fort of Jamestown, Virginia. A rumor spread that a river washed away for the past 200 years. Still, a few clues have been found, which made people think that it is still standing.       Brief History of James Fort       The fort was designed in 1607 at the time when English people settled in the colonies to start their lives again. Many people thought that fort was built near a river to have simple docking. Archeologists later found artifacts that led them into a wrong course. The spot for the fort was clever because it kept more protection of enemy ships.                The Reasearch       The first few items were found in 1861. The revealed objects were a few swords and suits of armor. Archeologists also found floors of buildings. Many, many years later, clues led to where the fort was located.   The National Park Service were paying much attention to the fort. The people were imaging the area to be sure the area was correct.       The Founding of James Fort       It turned out to be right! The James Fort was actually found! The archeologists left tracings and markings so the location can be found many times again and again. Maps were developed, and evidence was shown that the fort was built by the river. The archeologists uncovered 11 cellars, many burial sights, and ten buildings constructed by the fort!       Conclusion        In conclusion, James Fort is a mysterious place that had covered secrets found by the archeologists. In my opinion, James fort is an interesting place to learn and study about.

First a group of archeologists use computer to make a image of the dig site. The archeologist then go out and mark the site with flags. they then call up a different group of archeologist to start the dig.       They start the dig with Picks And Shovels. Then as they get deeper they use Skim Shovels and Trowels. They also use wheelbarrows to haul the dirt away. When they reach the artifacts they use Whisks and Dustpans to get the artifacts clean then they use knifes to get dirt out of small places.       Lastly the artifacts go to the last group of archeologist to be looked at. This group makes such it is an artifact. If it is not an artifact they throw it away. If it is it is sent to a museum.

Archeologists are experts on finding, cleaning, and analyzing ancient artifacts, and other things left behind by ancient people and learn what their lives used to be like. These experts use many tools to help them find these amazing treasures.       To begin, the first stage of extracting an operation is using computer software to map the contents of the ground. These models are helpful towards the teams that will later come and dig up the site. This is important, so people can know where all the artifacts are, and what structures the project might interfere with.       To continue, after the teams who map the area are finished with their part of the job, the team that will do the actual digging come. This team begins by first using small, sharp, and thin shovels called skims to carefully remove the many layers of the dirt. After completing that, the diggers start a process called troweling. This process is carried out with shovels wooden picks to remove more layers of the soil. The entire process of digging can take up to two entire weeks, just for a small 25 square foot section of the soil. This stage is hard, and tedious, but it is one of the most important stages of the large job.       The final stage of the tiresome (but fun) process that archeologists carry out is analyzing the artifacts that were found by the digging team. Technicians spent lots of time to use their expensive equipment to complete the hard work the two other teams did, and actuly learn from the many artifacts found. After many months of hard work, analyzing is complete. The long job has been ended, and all the teams, and all of the other scientists become thankful for the important information the hark work of the many archeologists has found.       To conclude, becoming an archeologist is a painful, but fun, process which helps everyone discover important things in the covered past.

That is why so many people are archeologists.               An archeologist needs to be delicate. They also have delicate tools. First they use the pick and shovel. That is used to dig into the earth. Once you get close to the artifact, you would use a Skim Shovel. It has a flat edge that can easily dig out a thin layer of dirt. If there is any excess dirt, an archeologist can use a wheelbarrow to take the dirt away. When you have hit the object, you can use the Trowel. It can remove small parts of dirt. When you have dug out the object, use the Knife and the Whisk to brush and clean the artifact.               When they are on the site, the archeologist uses the Skim Shovel to dig. Then, they put the soil in a box with a screen that lets the dirt fall out. Then they study the object. Everything takes a lot of patience and work but once you find something, it is worth it.

Over 100 years later a group wanted to find James Fort. National Park service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.     The group knew that this group would help them find that fort.That's when they finally found James Fort! They found it because they kept on trying. Its very exciting to find items from thousands of years ago. The settlers did the difficult years when they had no food.Finding items from the past is what ties us to the people who first started the American Colonies.                                        Finding the information    Most of what we know George Washington comes from his times as a soldier, and as president. Nobody knew where Washington's home was. His father moved George to Ferry Farm when he was just six years old.People believe that George's home is where the stone building is or was.    Archeologist dug up ferry farms to get some artifacts.   They used tools to help them find artifacts.   Digging in the dirt will give you dusty jeans but also a lot of valuable items or artifacts that you may find.   They use a wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another.

This job is hard work because they have to dig and dig and dig until they find something they came looking for.  When an Archeologist digs they don't just dig any where, they have to dig in a place where a building or village once was.         There are still many projects going on like in 2003 there were Archeologists that had started to dig up, what they believed was there, was George Washington home. They believed that the stone base of the house was still there.  it took over a year but they found it!       In 1994 there were a group of Archeologists started a project at James town.  This project was meant to find hidden secrets of James fort in Jamestown, Virginia.  for a long time About 200 years people thought that James's fort got washed away by the river.  It was 1607 when the fort was built and when settlers came to the new world for a new life.  So any ways the Archeologist found many things in this site.  They found uncovered weapons and armor from over 100 years ago.  After all the findings they found the one that mattered most. They found ................ JAMES FORT!!!!        Today this group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.  People from that time used to throw away their trash in a unused well or a big pit and the team of Archeologists found bones of animals they ate and other food.

Archeologists use picks and shovels to help them dig into the earth to find artifacts.Another tool archeologist use are whisks and dust pans.Whisks and dust pans are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear dirt from from the excavation site.Knifes are used by archeologists to dig carefully and scrape dirt from around the artifacts.Wheelbarrows are also used by archeologists so they can move items from one place to another and, carry dirt away from the excavation site.Archeologists also use a skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of soil within each scoop.The last tool archeologists use are trowels,which is used to scrape and cut or to view the different layers of soil.       Something else archeologists do is find ancient objects also known as artifacts.Some of these artifacts may have been pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children. these few objects were found in Fort James. Some other things they might have found were old kitchens,slave quarters,storage houses,and farm houses.these things were found where Washington lived.The last thing I will tell you is the way archeologists have to be careful while doing there job.         Archeologists have to be very careful while doing there job because they could loose very important information or get hurt.Archeologists use dangerous tools to find more about that person.If they are not careful they could get stabbed or cut or even loose a body part.Archeologists also have to be careful because they could easily loose some very information because thy might be rushing and scoop out a artifact.Some tools pick up big piles of dirt that cold have a coin or valuable pot in it.       Archeologists use interesting tools,find ancient objects or artifacts and have to be very careful while doing their job.In conclusion archeologists are important but very busy people.if I did this project again I would pick archeologist in the past.If I did that I would be more specific and easy to do.Now you have learned about archeologists.

They can dig up artifacts and begin to know more about history.        There are several ways of digging up artifacts. But first you might want to have a specific idea of what you are looking for. Maybe you could do some research within the area? One way of digging up artifacts is using a pick and a shovel to get closer to the ground where artifacts might lay. Another way is using a trowel or a skim shovel to remove, scrape, or cut layers of soil. You can just keep doing that until you find artifacts. Once you have found them, you can use a whisk and a dust pan to brush away the dirt on the artifacts. There are many more ways of digging up artifacts, but these are the most common.         Archeology is a very helpful thing. We can learn many things about history from what Archeologists find. It helps to know more about history because we can understand how life was a long time ago and try to make the present world better than it was then.         It takes a long time to go through the entire process. First, you need to know where you are going to look or what you are going to look for. Then you need to begin digging, or finding artifacts. Next, (If you have found any artifacts) you need to try to figure out what it is and then clean it off good. Now you are an Archeologist! This process can be very tiresome and can get you pretty dirty, but it's all worth it.        Now you know what it is like studying Archeology and being an Archeologist. It can be difficult, but it is all worth it in the long run! Understand that Archeology can help us humans learn more about history!

They will be finding Fort James, digging up George Washington's past,finding the spot of Ferry Farm, and the tools used.                            In the year of 1994, a group of people were going to study the past that had started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project or J.R.A.P. This project has been designed to discover secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For more than 2 centuries, people thought that Fort Jamestown was washed away by a river. A couple of discoveries in that area made a hint that it may still be around. The first discoveries were found in the year of 1861. The archeologists that were studying the Jamestown Fort found uncovered armor and weapons. Some also found the floors of buildings. Over a century later, a group found the exact spot where the fort was built.           A lot of what we know about George Washington comes from the time when he was a soldier and our first president. Biographies barely have any information about George Washington's life as a child. That has changed. There has been recent discoveries about where Washington's childhood home is and how it has helped historians learn more about our first president's history as a child.           Lots of people have lived on the land where Ferry Farm once was for over 12,000 years! That is a long time. The location of Ferry Farm makes the land a perfect place to build a home for families. However, it is no surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. At that time George was just 6 years old! Because the actual building was long gone, no one knew exactly where the Washington's home was located.         The tools that were used by the Archeologists to find their discoveries such as George Washington's home were used carefully,so that the objects that were found wouldn't break, because they were very old. These tools are, pick and shovel. (Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts.) Whisk and dustpan.(Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away from the excavation site.) The knife. (Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.) The wheelbarrow. (Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.) The skim shovel. (A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.) Last but not least, the trowel. (Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.)           Throughout this research a lot has been learned. In this research archeologists have found Fort James. they have dug up George Washington's past. They have found the spot of Ferry Farm. They also have used very important tools for these discoveries. That is the end of this research on Archeologists Historical Discoveries.

That's when  they finally found James Fort!  The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground . The marks showed where  the forts walls used to  be. In the 1600s people used to  throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While digging in the area  the archaeologists found the trash the settlers  threw away including  the bones of animals they ate.  Archaeologists   the name  for  who study objects from the past  uncovered many weapons. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels paint brushes and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to weeks to dig  a 25- square  foot section.                       At least four other houses have been built on  the ferry farm land so the diggers needed  to find  proof  that's  this was  George Washington farmhouse. Records show that the  Washington had a fire in their house. The diggers  found pieces of burnt pottery . They  also  found lay  pipe . We know Washington smoked clay pipes  so this discovery gives more proof it is  the right house.  No one knew  exactly  where the  Washington's home   was located  since  the actual building was long gone. How ever  archeologists believed that the stone  base under the house was still there.

For those of you who have no idea what an archeologist is, well, I'll tell you. Archeologists are people who dig in the ground to find artifacts.There are many reasons for how a life of an archeologist can be complicated.           Firstly, being an archeologist takes a lot of skill. They have to dig without damaging anything. You also need to have the right tools to dig into the ground. For example, if you needed a trowel but used a knife, that wouldn't be right to use. Pursuing this further, an archeologist has to have knowledge. They have to be smart and know where to go and to dig. For example, if you wanted to find out about Abraham Lincoln and you were nowhere near where he lived, you won't find anything from him! Finally, an archeologist has to have patience. They must be careful and slow at their process. For example, if you dig, whisk, and wheelbarrow fast, you may not have the most clean artifact.

The people doing this study used computer mapping software to take a photo to look at to study the area. That's when they finally found James Fort!     The first thing they did after they found they put a set of marks on the ground. After they drew realistic drawing they realized it would reshaped as triangle. They did research maps and they found it would stretch to a river. The sides were designed to hold cannons.

It gives us a piece of our past and tells us how are we like this and who started the American colonies.            What we know about George Washington comes from his time as a solder and president. The archeologists know all this by digging up the past by tools.

There can be up to 35 people in a team. The first team maps the area using 3D computers to track underground. This helps people know how did it look like before before people starting digging. Another team focuses on actual digging. Those archeologists start digging with skim shovels. The soil is then then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.           I think the archeologists jobs are interesting.

A lot of people think that archeologists are of no use. Sure, the job is tiring and slow. But it's worth it. Today I will explain why archeologists are important and what they do during the job. I will also explain how archeologists find information about ancient people and my opinion on archeologists.              Archeologists may seem useless because all they do every day is just dig and look for buried things in the ground all day long. It may seem like that but their job is actually very useful to the world. Looking at source #2, it says 'Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood.' People don't have much information about his childhood but thanks to archeologists, that's changing. Archeologists dig in places where George lived as a child to find out what kind of life he led when he was young. Aren't you curious to find out about this great American's childhood? Thanks to present archeologists we are finding more about George Washington's life everyday. It is not just George Washington however, it is also to find out more events from the past of a lot of famous people. From source #1, archeologists have found more information about Fort James. Archeologists are still studying ancient people and let's hope we can find more about more famous people. That is the use of an archeologist. To find out more about famous people. Now you know the use of an archeologist.             To find out information of an ancient person, archeologists use lots of tools. Archeologists work in teams that can hold up to 35 people. Lots of teams work together on a site. This is what archeologists do when trying to dig. The first team maps the area with 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what the area looked like before people started digging. Another team that is called a dig, does the digging in the area. They first use skim shovels that are so small, flat, and sharp, that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. The soil is then placed in a box that has a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The digs use another process called troweling. Troweling is a process that archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt out of artifacts. Surprisingly, it takes 2 weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section! The final team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. This whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it if it's to shape history. Now you know how hard it is to find historical artifacts. The whole thing is so slow that you need to have a lot of patience if you want to be an archeologist. This is how people dig up the past.              'How do archeologists find out about events in history when all they're doing is looking at objects?'. That might be a question frequently asked and here's the answer. Looking at sources #1 and 2, They found lots of things left behind in the ruins of James Fort and George Washington's childhood home. The pieces of burnt pottery they found at Ferry Farm showed that there was a fire there and the metal toys they found at Fort James proved that there were children there. Looking and studying these things actually tell you how people lived in those days. That is how people find out how ancient humans lived in those times.             I think that an archeologists job is fun, even though you need to have a lot of patience. Digging and studying ancient artifacts that have been touched by famous people would also make me feel special. I think that an archeologist's job is very fun and I would love to do it.             Now you know all about the job of an archeologist. I hope this essay has been of use to you. Thank you for reading this!

Once a group of people that were interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. But the project had been designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown Virginia. For over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.        But the fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from England to start a new life the kids thought that was really interesting. Most believed that the James fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. But however objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships the kids that are looking for some things that they don't know about it looks like they get allot of information that tells them allot about what happened back then.   And the first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists are the names for scientists who study objects from the past uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort had been built.               Now the National Park Service led a five-year study of the whole area to figure out how that land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.               That's when they finally found James Fort!!! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the Fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read about and drawings they made the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars dozens of burial sites and ten buildings all within the border of the fort ground.           And the group of kids are going to find one million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins,and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While digging in the area the archaeolists found the trash the settlers threw away including the bones of animals they ate. The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.

Did you know that one group of archeoligists stayed digging in one spot and since it got so deep that now it a fort called James Fort.               Archeoligists use many tools and not all of them I knew about till I did this report. They include a pick and shovel used to dig into the earth close to artifacts, wisk an dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts, knife used to dig or scrape dirt off the artifacts, wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another, skim shovel used to remove soil with each scoop, and the trowel used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.               Archeoligists are very hard workers so if you can do all those things and are not scared of those tools then you could study to be an amazind archeoligist.

An archeologists is a person who studies the pasts or the world! Archeologists reveal the past! Without archeologists we would not know a lot about the past. Here are information more about archeologists.A job that can be hard and fun, something that you can learn from. Being an archeologists can make you smarter.                    Archeologists are people who study the past and Earth. They find clues called artifacts. They work hard to find artifacts and study it. Well. you might say 'finding stuffs is fun why is a archeologists job hard?' Well, it is hard because you have to study it. Like George Washington's fire, They found stuff he used to make a fire like a burnt wood and studied it. How do you get information from that! Isn't that crazy! Also they have tools that helps them, actually they use a lot of tools. Like picks, shovels, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, ad a trowel. Now you might say 'how do they find those stuff doesn't it take, forever!?!?' Archeologists uses a 3D computer to scan underground and tell other archeologists to dig in a certain spot.                    Now here are tricky things about archeologists. They have to be careful, patient, and not being in a hurry. If you can not stand being patient well, being an archeologists might be a job for you. Being careful is really important. you might brake an artifact then  its gone. Patient is important too. Information might not be revealed for hours even days! The artifacts may be really cool but you have to wait. non patient gets you in a hurry, Which is another problem. If you are in a hurry then you may break something. That is why being an archeologists is hard. They do not have fun all of the time.                   This writing is a job of how an archeologists is.

If we did not have archeologist we would not know a whole lot of things like slavory or Fort James or veary important things that happend in history like the Reviutioary War. Each group of archeologist has up to 35 people on a team. The first team mapes the area using a 3D imige on a computer and then they can see what is under ground so that they know where to dig and some what of a imige if what they will try to find. Then the teams spred out and start to dig and hope the will find what they are looking for. After a long long time of digging and searching for this object and they find the object they are looking for they will send it to another group of people who will study the object this prosses could take years to finish but these people will continue to this over and over again.           Tools Used By Archeologists           One of the main tools used by a archeologist is a pickaxe and a shovel these tools are used to start digging into the ground. The pickaxe is used to brack through stone and the shovel is used to did through the dirt. A whist and dust pan is another inportant tool. This tool is used when you find a inportant artifact in the ground. The whist is used to brush off the dirt and the pan is used to move the dirt that is put into the pan. A knife is one other tool archeologist use when the find a artifact in the ground. If the whist and pan dont work the knife is used to scrape of the remaning dirt. The wheel barrle is another common tool in a work site. It is used to move the dirt or stone that is dug out on the ground while triying to find the important artifacts. A skim shovel is just like a regular shovel but thinner. The skim shovel is used to take off thinner layers of dirt. The trowel is the most common tool in the work siste most of the time. the trowel is used to cut through layers of dirt and view thoses many layers of dirt in the earth. The finall tool used used dose not have a name but you place dirt into a box with a half inch screen at the bottom of it and all of the dirt falls and leaves the artifacts that was in the dirt behinde and for the archeologist to study and learn about.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.4658495578862,2.33821264988687,0.955283217565743

Archaeologial is to rediscover something that had happened. In 1994 people descovered some of the things that they had in the past from jamestown. They were trying to descover things from jamestown for two hundred years ago. The archeologists founfd obhects that were very valuble like different places and things. Archeologists also found part of george washintons house and childhood.                           Archeologists also find things like where places go and maps to places. They dig up lots of famous peoples history like there house, there land, and there tools and toys and there barns and there letters. Archeologists take a long time to find the peoples things and history. One took two hundered year to find the spot they were loooking for.

There  most famous thing that they found in my oppinoin was where jamestown fort was. It took a long time two find it but they did find it. It was along, super tireing find but they did find part of the jamestowns fort.

The Pick and Shovel, Knife, Skim Shovel, and Trowel are all used to dig up artifacts. The wheelbarrow and the wisk and dustpan are used for cleaning the artifacts up and carrying the stuff around.             Some artifacts are very valuble to find. Usualy the artifacts are at a famous persons house or a famous place. At the Ferry Farm archeologists were looking for evidence that this was Goerge Washingtons home. They were digging and they found a piece of burnt property. They knew that there was a fire at his house. Then they found a piece of a clay pipe and they knew that he smoked clay pipes. So being a archeologists you can learn more about the past.             Some special places had artifacts. A group of archeoligists went to Fort James. They wanted to find out the discoveries of it. When they got there they found special artifacts. They found weapons and armor. After that they found different floors in the fort. When they were at Fort James they found little marks on the ground. From now on at Fort James they find nearly a million artifacts each year.              Archeologist doesn't allways look at houses. They look at special places too like parks. They also look at places where special events took place. did you know they look at grave yards. they look every where to find them.               Archeologists are a lot like pirates. They almost do all the same things.They both look for treasure. They both get on and off of ships. They both make maps. They both have big groups.

I would like to be an archeologist because I would like to see things from hundreds of years ago. You must use a bunch of different materials like:      Pick and a shovel, you could use that to dig. Whisk and a dustpan, you could use that to get the dirt off objects you find. Knife, you could use that to cut roots that are in your way.   Wheelbarrow, to move items from one place to the other.   Skim shovel, you could you that to to move soil it's kinda like a regular shovel only it gets thin layers of dirt. Trowel it can view different layers of soil.                      Archeologist find alot of interesting things that are from a long long time ago.  When they dug in Ferry farm they found some interesting thing like, burnt pottery that used to be George Washigton's, and a clay pipe that used to be George Washington's to.  The reason that it was burnt is because George Washington's house burnt down. The archeologists had no clue it was his house until they found the clay pipe.                     Archeologists have to dig 25 square foot section to dig a 25 foot section takes about 2 weeks! The discovery of Washington home is important for many reasons because it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous and they are starting to understand why he made the decisions he did.  The archeologists started digging in 2003. It took over a year but they finally found it       The kitchen. The slave quarters. Storage houses.

Once they had found the artifacts they would take the to the lab and study what they were, what they were used for and what they are made out of.              When I had listed the tools  above I will now tell you about them. The pickaxe they would use to dig through hard surfaces. The shovel would be used for digging through softer surfaces such as dirt and mud. Whisks would be used for dusting off the artifacts and a dustpan would be used for sweeping things into it. A wheelbarrow would be used for moving piles of dirt and other things to different places. A knife would be for scraping dirt away from the artifacts. A skim shovel would be for removing thin layers of the earth. And last but not least a trowel would be to scrape and cut to see different layers of earth. The archaeologists would  use different equipment to draw maps of the areas and guess about what might have been there many many years ago.

They use different tools to find objects from the past.  These objects are called artifacts.  Archeologists have found many artifacts.          Some artifacts archeologists find are sometimes places or buildings.  In 1944, a group of people intrested in the past stated the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project.  Their project was to find James Fort in Jamestown, which people thought washed away by a river.  James Fort was built in 1607 by colonists.  They built near a river so it was easier to dock ships.  But, with the artifacts found, it is hinted that Fort James was located further away.  Some of the first artifacts they found were armor and weapons.  They had also found floors of the buildings.  Over a century later, a group effort to find the correct location of Fort James began.  The National Park Service` led a five-year study of the area to find out how the land was used. This would help them find proof of the fort.  The people doing the study used a computer mapping software to make an image of the area.  That's when they found James Fort.  After finding James Fort they also found cellars burial sites and buildings within the border of the fort.          Another place archeologists dug for is George Wasington childhood home. Washington's home was built on Ferry Farm, but no one knows exactly where it was located.  However, archeologists believed there was a stone base under the house.  They started digging in  2003.  It took over a year, but they found Washington's childhood farmhouse.  They also found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.            Tools used by archeologists are pickaxes, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, skim shovels, and trowels.  The pickaxe and shovel are used in the beginning of the dig to dig near artifacts. Whisks and dustpans are used to brush away dirt from the artifacts and the excavation sites.  The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt off of the artifacts.  Wheelbarrows are used to carry dirt and items from one place to another.  Skim shovels have a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt with each scoop.  Trowel is the most commonly used tool in archeology. it is used to scrape and and cut to view layers of soil.          These are what past archeologists did, found, and used.

You would be able to find new things. You could learn about new artifacts from the past. Also you would be able to use different tools.That is why I would want to be an archeologist . In this essay there will be three reasons why it would be an exciting job.                 The first reason that it would be exciting is because you would be able to find new artifacts. Some examples of artifacts that you would be able to find is pottery, tools, coins, and metal. In only one year archeologists find up to one million artifacts! That is the first reason why being an archeologist would be fun.                 The second reason that i would want to an archeologist is because you could learn about the new artifacts that you have found. For example the artifacts you find you could read books about it. You could also search online about that artifact.That is the second reason being an archeologist would be fun.                  The last reason it would be exciting to be an archeologists is because all the different tools you have. Some examples are trowel, skim shovel, and pick. A trowel helps scrape the dirt off the interesting fossil they found. A skim shovel helps remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. Lastly a pick helps dig really deeply into the dirt. Those are all the different tools they would be able to use.                    I have clearly explained that being an archeologist would be an exiting job. The three reasons are being able to find new things. Learning more about an interesting artifact. Also using different kinds of tools for different jobs.

Well I can tell you that an archeologist looks for things from many decades ago. For example a team of archeologists found where Jamestown actually was. Another team found out where George Washington lived. Would you like to learn more?               Archeologists need to do their work carefully and slowly. If they are not careful they might end up destroying a important artifact. If they work to fast they might miss something important. That would not be good.               Some of the tools that archeologists use are picks, shovels, whisks, dust pans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovel, and trowel. A pick and shovel are used for digging. The whisk and dust pan are used to brush dirt off artifacts. The knife is used to scrape dirt off the artifacts. The skim shovel is used to remove thin layers of dirt and the trowel is used to scrape and also cut to see different layers of dirt.               Archeologists find millions of things every year. They work hard and do a good job at it. They are the reason that we know so much about everything. That is what an archeologist does.

An archeologist often maps out their dig site with computer before digging. The place they are digging is called a Dig Site.            They use many different tools to uncover the artifacts without breaking them. Including Whisks, which brush dirt away, Skim Shovels, which remove thin layers of soil, Knives, which carefully dig and scrape around artifacts, Trowels, which scrape and cut yet they also reveal different layers of earth, Picks And Shovels, which dig deep into the earth and are usually the first instruments used, and Wheelbarrows, which help move items around quicker and more efficiently.          Archeologists help us learn more about our culture and past. They go where some don't and dig up things others wouldn't. Without them, we wouldn't even know who important historical figures like King Tut or Cleopatra even were! I'm thankful that archeologists are here. And I love learning about their discoveries.

Archeologists must be good at using and understanding computers because they have to use computers to make graphs on the area they are excavating. They must also have to be able to focus on one thing for a long period of time. If they are looking for artifacts on certain people they would have to know what happened through the course of their life so they know what to look for. If they were looking for bones or a dinosaur then they would have to know what the skeletal structure of different dinosaurs.       There are different jobs on a dig site there is a team that digs and there is another team that's in charge of mapping out the dig sites and dealing with computers. There can be up thirty-five people on a team at one time. It's important that everyone does there job or else all the work won't get done. Different people are probably put on different teams because they have different strengths.

They can find these artifacts to learn more about these important events, or people. Them finding these objects can also help us understand more about the lives of historical people. And, if they think something in history was incorrect, archeologists could assure that its correct, by finding the locations and artifacts from the event they think is incorrect, and find the truth.           In 1861, there were the first objects found in Jamestown by archeologists. Around 100 years later, a different group began to search for the exact location of the James Fort. They believed it was located near a river, so it would be easier to dock ships there. However, in 1994, archeologists began searching again in Jamestown for the James Fort, which people believed for many years that it was washed away by the river they thought it was near. By judging the objects that they found close to the river, the archeologists thought that it was located somewhere farther away from the river, so they were safer from any enemies. They finally found Jamestown by looking at a group of marks on the ground, and decided that it was triangular, and was located near the edge of the river. Now the archeologists find many artifacts near where the fort really is.           Many archeologists wanted to learn more about the home of George Washington, because they didn't know much about his childhood. They knew that the Washington's lived on the Ferry Farm, and moved there when he was six years old. Although they didn't know the exact location of the house, they began to dig in 2003 at the Ferry Farm. It took more than a year when they finally found the Washington's home. They found the kitchen, storage houses and slave quarters first, then years later, found the main farmhouse. Archeologists said there were other houses built on the Ferry Farm, so they needed the proof that it was really George Washington's childhood farmhouse. They said that there was a fire at his house, because they dug up some burnt pottery, along with part of a pipe. Which was more proof that it was the Washington home, because George smoked.           People wonder how the archeologists found all those objects from the Ferry Farm. Well, what they do is form a few groups of up to 35 people to dig. They use 3D computers and machines to track underground, and find artifacts, this is so the diggers know where to look and what it will look like. Some archeologists focuses on the real digging, with a type of shovel called a skim shovel. They are small and very flat, therefore they can dig the layers one at a time. Others will place the soil into a box with a small screen at the bottom, which lets the dirt fall out, and the artifacts, if any, stay in. They also use many other tools, for troweling, such as small shovels, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove any dirt covering the objects. There are other archeologists that take the artifacts to a lab to study them. It can take a while to dig up a section. Up to two weeks for just 25-square-foot area!

Archeologists most likely work in groups, rather than working by themselves. They work like this because the artifacts are very delicate historical items, and all of these items are crucial to discovering the history of mankind. Archeologists hold a lot of responsibility to keep the artifacts safe, clean, and whole.       While working, an archeologist needs many tools. Here are some of the tools that an archeologist might use in their work: a pick and shovel (to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts), a whisk and dustpan (to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear the dirt away from the excavation site), a knife (to dig carefully and scrape dirt off the artifacts), and a wheelbarrow (to carry away dirt from the excavation site or to move something from one place to another). These tools often help archeologists in their work.       How do these archeologists find all these artifacts? The first thing they do is have one team of archeologists use 3D computers to map the area. Then the information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before they start digging. A different team of archeologists does the actual digging, and they place where the team digs is called a dig. These archeologists start digging with skim shovels, a small, sharp, and flat shovel that can remove small layers of soil at a time. The soil that is dug up is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. The screen lets the dirt fall out of the box, while the artifacts stay in. The digging team also does a process called troweling. What is troweling? Trowling is when the archeologists use wooden picks, paint brushes, and small shovels to get rid of dirt. All of these processes are cautious ones, and only professional archeologists should perform them.       As you can tell, an archeologist's job is tough, requires maximum intelligence, and is lined with caution. Beacause if almost anybody else finds artifacts in their backyard and trys to handle them like an archeoloist would, say good-bye to the artifact (well, say good-bye to the artifact being whole, at least). And that, kids, is why you should never dig for artifacts in your backyard!

In addition, the fort was built near a river so it would be easier to dock incoming ships for their supplies. But, the objects which were in the ship ike weapons and armor, were found farther away then the Archioligists expected, so the fort must have been farther away.

They needed proof it was Washington's house so they looked for evidence. They found out his house burned down, so they found some burnt pottery. They also knew he liked smoking pipes, so they found some clay pipes. Their hard work and research really paid off.             Many archeologist like in these sources use tools like these: picks,shovels,whisks dustpan, knives, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowels.

A couple years later, their house burnt down and all their treasures went into the ground.

The 1st group was mapping out the area and they had type recorders under ground.       The 2nd group spent all day digging. They used a skim shovel. A skim shovel is very small and flat, but the tip is sharp.This helps all the dirt fall out.        The 3rd group spends all dad in a lab making sour every thing is going ok. They also make sour every thing is running properly under ground.There is a 25 foot area that all groups are all working on.All this work can add up to a total of 2 weeks process.        In that 2 weeks , one of the things that they found was a smoked clay set. So that means that Mr.Washington smoked clay.

Many archialogist usen tools like pick shovels,whisk and dustpan,a knife,wheelbarrows,skim shovels, and trowels. Some archialogist have to dig and some are in the lab.The ones digging takes about two weeks to be done. Unlike the ones in the lab they have to research the item, that takes a couple of days. Archialogist find many intresting items that people used in the past.Each team could have about 35 people in one team.              George Washington has many intresting things in his life. Archioligist found that he lived in a farm. So they searched there. They digged there and found clay pipes. It took along time to search something and they found the kitchen, slave quartes, and the storage house. George's house was burnt along time ago. The team found many stuff. It took a year to dig and find items.                                                                      The team used 3D computers so that they can check under ground. Another team came and used tools. They focused on skim shovels. Unfortanaly they didnt find anything. But they still were searching. Then the team found clay pots. They send it to the lab reaserchers. They studied it for a couple days. The team found out that that was George Washington's mother.               Archialogists send there items to a musuam. The kids get to look at it and ask questions. The musuem has the items in a glass container. Many people come and explorer the musuem each year. Some of the people pay money to hold it. Kids go to the museum and look at it.              Archialogist work very hard. They spend most of theire life finding items. Many risk theire lives to get old items. All teams  work together. Many found treusere that we didnt know about. This is why I think that archialogists are brave.

Their job is way harder. They have to look at old thing and find out want it is and what it's for.They are important people. If we didn't have them we wouldn't know about the history.                       You would have to study a lot and hard to become an archeologist.Just by looking and studding things they found out that on Gorge Washington farm there was  a fire.Also found parts of a clay pipe and we all knew that Gorge smoked clay pipes. In Fort James they had found uncovered weapons and armor and also found floors of buildings. 100 years later, a group tried to find the rest of the building. Well they go trough a lot to find out what all about what they have.                      Archeologist are very smart. They know more stuff about others than we done. When your an archeologist you find more about their childhood and a little about what they did. Some people may want to do it for the money but that's not the real reason.I think its important because once they learn more about the pass they will tell everyone else.  No one really knew were Gorge Washington lived. However, archeologist that the stone base under the floor is still there.                    The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used in Fort James. That would help them to find proof of anything from the pass. They even found eleven cellars, dozen of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.That's when they found James Fort.                     Archeologist are important to me. If it wasn't for them i wouldn't know anything about history. They found out all about the history today . They work very hard to find proof of history for us to learn.I hope i can be just like them and learn more about the history in the future.

To dig or to find something that you are in luck of looking for you will need to have the right tools. Some of the things you willl need is a pick &amp; a shovel to dig something up.To put all of your artifacts in you will need a wheelbarrow or you can use the wheelbarrow by puting the dirt that you dug up in the wheelbarrow so you can be tidy with the dirt.You will also need a skim shovel to carfully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. You will also need a whisk and dustpan to scoop all of the dirt up in a nice pile.You will also need a good archeoligist group of men to carry hard and heavy things and women to get very deep in the dirt.Last you will need a knife for carfully digging and to scrape the dirt carfully of the artifacts.Those are a couple things you will need to by or have before you complete an archeoligist job.               What Kind Of Things You Will Be Instrested In Looking For?   If you are looking for something think of a great spot with dirt but a mystirious place and start just digging anything you find keep at first have fun and dig and dig and find lot's of stuff and keep and use.Second you want to get serious at your digging first you had your fun now you need to look for things that is just very strage, you would want to look up some things and places and a artifact that has not been found in 100 years go to the place and start digging with your group and when you find something take it straight back to your lab and look at it a disekt it and keep it as your First Artifact  that you have found so far because before all those things you saw and dug that was just having fun and getting the hang of it but when you found that first artifact that was just your first.                       What You Will Do When You Find A Facinating Artifact?   When you find a facinating artifact you just keep on going its the first thing its always the beginning of an areoligist process you dont just stop when you find you find a cool artifact you just wait like I said its just the beginning of an archeoligist process.When you find that arifact you never know if your going to find something bigger and better the next day.Those are things an archeoligist would do if he found a facinating artifact and he had no idea what to do with it at the time and thats the process of an acheoligist process.                                       What Can You Do If You End Up Finding Nothing In The Location Your In?    When you maybe end up finding nothing o=in your location you dont just give up the task you were looking forward into doing you just find a nother location to dig up something mysirious and weired or you can just look up some facts that explain to you what is an artifact that has not been found over than 100 years ago then it will pop up people who have tryed digging or finding this artifact you prombly will end up have a lucky chance of finding it by the process of searching those are things an archeoloigist would do if he is not finding anything in the location he is at.                           What Would You Do If You Want To Reserch Another Person?    When you feel like you are not finding the right artifacts that you are in need of finding all you need to do is reserch another task that no one has been looking for but has and thought was going to be easy but ening up be a whole diaster.And when you feel like when you serched it up think of something you've heard as a diasaster in life like the 'Titanic' you can get up some people and go to where that disaster had happend and end up finding some good artifacts.Those are a couple things an archeologist would do and say.                           How To Pick The Right Group Members To Work With During This Task?   When you are doing a task you would like to find the right group mwmbers to work with like some poeple who know how to work hard and get a task done.Or someone you know who can use a shovel good,Also someone you know who can use all the tools good like a Pick,Shovel,Skim Shovel, Trowel Or A Knife all those things but know what there doing sand know how to do it right and get down to business. or you would like to pick someone who is not sassy or bossy.And last you dont want to pick someone who is weak and not strong.Those are things and archeoligist would say.                       How To Know When Its Time To Stop The Task?   When you think the task you where working on has now been comepleted the first thing you would like to do is count how many artifacts you have the minimum is 20-40 thats all.The next thing you would want to do is skan them and see where this came from? and how it looks like? this and how it got here?.When you are done with that,thats how you know you are done with this task or when its time to stop.                           What Do You Do With The Artifacts You Found?   When you are done with the artifacts that you have found you need to take it to a museam or spit it with your group members.But what you dont do is just throw it away or keep it all to your self those are a couple things an archeoligist would do when he is done with his task.

Archeologists try to find artifacts or pieces of things people used back in the day. First, archeologists are suppose to find artifacts about a person or a place long ago. For example, if an archeologist found an arrow head, that is an artifact.       When they find the artifact there looking for, there next job is to clean off the artifact with a whisk and dustpan and examine it. While there doing that, they might run into trouble! They might not have the right tool for the artifact or, the archeologist cant tell what the artifact is. After they figure out what the artifact is, if they have back round knowledge (skeema) of the artifact they either already know what it is or if they don't know what it is, they do research.       When they figure out what it is and what it does, the archeologist shows who there working for what it is and what it does! Lastly, if its a huge thing of the American history, the artifact goes to a museum where people all over the nation can see it.        There are many tools archeologist need to finish the job. One of the tools is a pick and shovel. The pick and shovel is used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. The second tool is a knife. you think a knife is used for cutting apples or something. Not for archeologists! The archeologist uses the knife to dig and scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The last tool is a wheel barrow which carry's heavy things that a man can not lift.           Being an archeologist is a breath tacking job. If you become an archeologist you get to examine hundreds of year old things. If you are an archeologist, you get to explore almost all the world looking for artifacts. If you where an archeologist and you found something amazing, what would you do?An archeologist has to do many things before he/she can figure out what the artifact did. Would you want to be an archeologist? Why or why not?

First of all we could get information from the encyclopedia right, NO! Because if archeologist did not dig up the past then there would be no way of knowing about any famous dead people. In the next paragraph I will tell you how the archeologist found all this information. So that is part of why archeologist's work is very important.            So the archeologist found all of the information by using clues that they already have about that person. Here's an example, they found his house because they knew that everyone lived on a Ferry Farm so they found a house. The way they could tell that it was George Washington's house is because his house was burned down, when the archeologist went to George Washington's house they found a burnt item, so that is how they could tell that is one of the ways they could tell it was his house. So that is how archeologist found all of their information.             They have to go through another process. They have to clean and identify the object so that they can see if it is what they are looking for. They use wheel barrow to carry the objects, they also use a knife to scrape off dirt from the artifact, and they use a whisk and dustpan so that they can brush off the object. After they are done with that they simply use their computer to scan the artifact so they can tell what it is if they do not know. Finally they have to load it into the truck or car so they can take it back to their camp. That is the slow but useful process of cleaning and finding the artifact/artifacts.

Even famous people are alive today from the past and archeologists study them so they know about there history from there childhood.

Some examples about being a archeologist are right here if you want to be a archeologist you have to be watching them on T.V or go to a museum all about the history of a archeologist.  Archeologist are interesting because they can find,tell, and look for a famous persons history.  Also they can find birth and death of the famous person and it would be hard to look for George Washington because he does not have a lot of information about his childhood.  Today archeologist still look for famous peoples history from the past to see what they did or what there childhood was like.        Archeologist is a hard job because they have to go look for information everyday so they can use there sources to find amazing artifacts.  Archeologist have so many tools they have six tools there's a pick and a shovel,trowel,  knife,wheelbarrow,whisk and dustpan, and a skin shovel.  They use all of those things to get evidence and clues so they can find the history.  That's a archeologists job and what to do and what to use because they have a amazing job although they put there best work into it.Those are my examples of being a archeologists job.

It made sense that the settelers would pick that spot. Objects found nearby suggested that the fort was further away. The new spot that they picked would give more protection. The first object that they found was in 1861.                                                                                                                                         Archeologist was another name for a scientist, but these people study objects from the past. Like uncovered armor and wepons. And they discover the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later they found the exact spot where the fort was built. People lead a 5 year study to figure out how the land was used.                                                                                                 It would help decide where to look for proof of the fort. Thats when they finally found James Fort. The first things that they found was a set of marks on the ground. Those marks repersented where the walls were. Today, the group finds nearly 1 million things a year.

Archeologists dig for artifacts. They can examine the artifact and figure out how certain peoples lives were in the past.          To begin with , archeologist are people who find items from the past called artifacts. They also examine the artifacts. Artifacts also help the archeologist find out how people lived in the past.         Second of all , archeologist dig as teams. One team dig in places they call excavation sites. The place where the team is digging is called a dig. Archeologist use a process called troweling. A different team works in the lab studying the artifacts they found.          Finally , Archeologist have many tools they use. They start off their dig with tools called skim shovels. They are used for removing layers of soil. More tools they use are picks, shovels, knifes, wheelbarrows, whisks and many more. All these tools help archeologist find artifacts.

Another thing, is that it can take up to two weeks for archeologists to did a 25-square-foot section. There is also another team that spends days and days in the lab studying objects that were found.The process that they do is very tiring but it is worth it.

Over 200 years people thought that the river was washed away. The fort was build in 1607 when settlers from England stated. Most believed that James Fort was built by the river. The first objects were found in 1861. The National Park led a 5 years study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. Then they finally found James Fort. The first thing they found was a set of mark on the ground. The mark showed where the forts walls used to be. Today the group finds nearly one million objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit.           While digging in the area the archaeologists found the trash the settlers threw away including the bones of animals they ate. The informational from these objects helps us understand how the people in the James Fort lived. We now know how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.We also know what the settlers did to survive to difficult years when they had little food. It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. It gives us a piece of our past and tries us to the people who first stated the American colonies.Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. They knew that this help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.       Between all the stories they heard and read and drawing they made the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over river. The ledges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozen of burial sites, and ten buildings all with the border of the forts. We also know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. It gives us a piece of our past and tries us to the people who first started the American Colonies.

They have very creative and important jobs. They work with              finding bones of dinosaurs.They sometimes even try finding the history of a area where somewhere very important              lived. They sometimes sell the artifacts they find to museums and let all of us see their discoveries. I can tell you              what materials they use to find artifacts, what they do when they find artifacts, and what some do with them. Here              is what I know about archeologists.                                                                                    The Right Tools                          Archeologists look under the concrete and into the Earth to find what their looking for. But they need the              right tools to do that. Archeologists usually work with picks and shovels, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow,              skim shovel, and trowel. Picks and shovels are the starting tools. Whisk and dustpans are used for when they clear              away dirt from the artifact and the site they found it. The knife is used for very careful digging. Along with scraping              dirt around the artifact.                                              Next the wheelbarrow is used to move the dirt that was already researched. Skim shovels have flat edges to               carefully remove a thin layer of soil. Lastly the trowel, the most common tool used in archeology, is used to scrape               and cut to view the layers of soil. These are the tools that archeologists use to help them identify what they have              found or what they are looking for. The best tools to use when they have found an artifact is probably whisk and              dustpan, the knife, and the trowel.                                                                                 What They Do Now                                                                                                               What do they do now they found something? They first clean off the object briefly at the site it was found.                 Then the expert does further cleaning at the lab. Once they have finished the cleansing on the object, they do closer                inspection. They look at the scratches. they reserch how old the dirt is. They figure out what could have possesed                 the artifact, either person or animal. Once they have solved all these mysteries, they sum it up. Example: they find                a foot print near a empty area of dirt where there was once a community. It was a big foot print. Could it be a huge                 footed man or a large creature foot print? They reserch until they find out. They then realize it was a large mammal                that caused it, but don't know what animal. They are still researching.                                                                                                                                                  Where They Will Go                             What do they do with their amazing discovery? They either keep for further researching the object, give it to                important people, or sell it to museums. Don't worry, they keep all of the artifact's discoveries and history to them               and a little bit to us in museums. They give it to important people, such as the military, because it could be dangerous               to all of us and the military can do something about it.

Well, if you are going to be an archeologist, you shall do just that! An archeologist is a scientist who studies archeology, or the study of ancient things. Being an archeologist can be boring and tiresome, but surely fun!!        The first mission to a successful archeology project, is the identification of the material. Scientists use a special computer to track down and locate the item that they want to discover. Using sophisticated radar can be helpful, they use X-ray machines. Given all these privileges, scientists get a rough idea of what the material looks like underground, so it can help them see if they have found it the right thing.         This leads to the process of digging. After they have found the item, it is time to dig it out. Here is where a LOT of what archeology means, comes into action. The digging starts with archeologists using a tool, called a Skim Shovel. These are special shovels that are small, flat, and sharp. All this makes the shovel dig out a layer of soil. The dirt is dropped into a box with a small, so that the soil can leak out by itself. Then comes a bigger tool, the shovel. This kind of shovel takes larger amounts of soil off the ground. The box will overflow, because of the bigger quantity of soil, and dirt. This drags another tool in; the wheelbarrow. A wheelbarrow is sort of like a wagon, which is essential because the soil amount has increased. When the archeologist finally hits a surface, he or she takes out the other tools for the job; the whisk and the dustpan. These are used to brush the dust off the surface so that they can see what the surface is really like. If it is the object they are looking for, they are successful.        The final and most important part of the project is researching it. After the item has been found, the scientists take it with them to their lab, to research the material. They do may tests on it, and analyze it. Archeology is a great study. So why don't you go out and start digging?

You probably get to travel around the world. I would love to go to Africa and solve mysteries there and put bones together. It would be cool if I found a T-Rex and i would have a partner to be with instead of working by myself. It would probably be hard if I work by myself.           I learned archeologist have to be very smart to be a archeologist and of course putting it together.    Their probably working on something right now on this day. I wish my class could be there watching them solve a mystery and putting it together.

It is same for places, too. This tells us that archeologist is a very important job. Then what exactly is an archeologist?     Archeologists find artifacts that once belonged to famous people, or is famous itself. We can know the history of long time ago by using the artifacts. However, archeologist is not an easy job. First they need to know where the artifact is. Then they need to find a proof that it is the right artifact. Finally, they start to dig. This steps may sound simple, but when you actually do it, it may take months and years to find an artifact.     When you are certain that an artifact is in an exact place, you need to find a proof, like I said before. For example, they found a clay pipe in a place where archeologists thought George Washington's house might be. They knew that Washington smoked clay pipes, so it gives proof that it is the right place. Then, they start to dig. Many teams will work on the site. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.Another team starts to dig. They start with skim shovels that remove layers of soil. The soil is placed in a box with a half- inch screen at the bottom. The dirt falls out while the artifact stays in. They also use a process called troweling, which is when you remove the dirt with small brushes and wooden picks. There are a lot more tools that are used by archeologists, but still, everything is used to dig and dig. Another team studies the objects that are found in the lab. This whole process takes a lot of time and effort.     The discovery of artifacts is really important because people can learn how people lived long time ago, and if the artifact belongs to a famous person, they can learn more about the person. Artifacts also give us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies. You may think being an archeologist is a boring job, but it is actually a meaningful and important job!

The job of an archeologists is to find artifacts to discover different objects that came from a long time ago.       An archeologist does this job because maybe to get money or just have fun doing the job and just find cool things that are very old and rusty so maybe not to keep an dusty and rusty artifact.       The first artifacts or objects found were in 1861 and found like floors and and armors and weapons under ground. They also found a fort that was in or called James Fort. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.       The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. they knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the James Fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.       That's when they found James Ffort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be.       Today the group finds 1,000,000 objects each year. The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.       The archeologists use picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel, and other items or materials or tools to do there digging for there work.       Some people tried to find George Washington's house but no one new where it was under ground. Archeologists believed that there was a stone base under the house was still there. It would be cool to find George Washington's home!       They started to dig in 2003 to try to find the house. It took over a year but they still found it.They found the main farmhouse a few years later though.

Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects from the past, and uncovered armor and weapons. In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past, stared in Jamestown. The project was designed to discover the secret of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought the fort had washed away by the river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.            The fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people believed that the fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it would make sense for settlers to choose that spot. However, objects were found nearby suggested the fort was more further away. The spot probability gave the settlers a safe spot so they would be safe against enemy ships.

They help you learn what has happened in the past that nobody knows about today. Archeologists have a very interesting life but to find what they are searching for, they need to have a lot of patience. You can look for years for something and never find it. That's why you can't be frustrated very easily.            I believe that being an archeologist would be very interesting mainly if you found something from the past because it would be fun and exciting to find something that you've been looking for, for years and then revealing it to the public. Also, if they find something very valuable they might become rich and famous. If I were an archeologist, the hardest part for me would be waiting and searching and also digging.             Some very successful archeologists found dinosaur bones or something about a famous person that died. Archeologists must be very smart to do their job because it takes quite a bit of intelligence to solve things that no one has solved before. If you want to become an archeologist you probably should be a good student in school, meaning pay attention, and never give up!             It takes many steps to dig some ancient place. you first have to start old school with a pick and shovel. You would also the use the trowel. After that you would most likely use the skim shovel. The knife it used second to last but before you use the last item you have to cut around the artifacts so you don't break them. Last, you use a whisk and a dustpan to get any stray dirt of the valuable artifact.            In conclusion, it takes a lot of hard work, effort, and patience to become a great archeologist that solves the world's questions about the past.

To begin, archeology is a process that divides between two teams. The people in the digging process have to trowel. Troweling is when archeologists use tiny tools such as small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden toothpicks to take out the dirt from the artifacts. That's one teams job. Another team is looking at the artifacts in a lab and discovering what is has to do with the life of the person. Archeologists have to work together to find the best and truthful results.             Apart of the process, the archeologists have to make sure the facts they find have a reasonable explanation. For example: George Washington's house supposedly had a fire and archeologists had found some burnt pottery proving that his house did actually have a fire. Also, around the 1860's archeologists had discovered that Fort James wasn't only next to the river, but was also farther away to protect the town from enemy ships. Archeology is a very interesting and leads to many new interesting discovery's.             Lastly, when the artifacts are proven to be true, the pieces teach humans about other humans lives. For example: George Washington's past has taught children and adults about who he really was and about his family. Also, the fort James taught how smart people were in the olden days and why they didn't live next to the harbor. Not only is being a archeologist interesting and fun, but it also teaches other people a lesson along with yourself.                   To conclude, archeology is a historical 'mystery' that teaches people about this persons life in the earlier days. It also shows how the people were in the olden days which sometimes is a mystery.

They have a job that requires mysteriousness, smartness, and patience. Though archeologists have important jobs they have hard ones too. I'm going to tell you all about how archeologists do their job and why they do this.            Archeologists do there job so that scientists can know and study what people did or what kind of things happened in the past. We want to know this stuff because it's important to know what happened in our past and how people helped us get to where we are in the world today.            Now for how archeologists do their job. Archeologists find a spot where something important happened and they start digging for artifacts. Artifacts are the things that they find and study to figure out our past. After they find the artifacts they clean them with a whisk and dustpan and clean them off. After they are clean they study the artifacts to solve our history.

Well if you didn't do I am about to tell you all about them and there very hard job. Archeologists spend most of there time mining for fossils and bones and some even full bodies. When archeologists first found objects they had no idea what they were doing. People first started to be archeologists when they discoverd Fort James. This fort is were most all archeologists went when they were looking for bones and fossils. Fort James was built in 1607 from settelers that wanted to start a new life. Many of these settlers belived that James should be built near a river because it was easier to dock ships their. These settlers later became archeologists and they started finding objects everywhere. Once they became more into it, it was their life. Later on, a national park service when on a five year hunt trying to find this fort so our archeoloigests now can study there.                      Between all of their hard work they finaly found the fort!!!!! After they found the fort they also found eleven cellars, and ten whole buildings. This took archeologists a very long time. They studied and studied with alot of hard work and never gave up to find the Fort. An amazing fun fact is that today, archeologists find more than 1million objects every single year. If think that this is an easy job you are wrong. This is such a difficult job that you have to study for many years before you start to do this job profesionaly. Its also not easy to find the objects. you have to be trained and you also need how to use the tools very properly. Now I will tell you all about archeologists tools. Their different tools that they uses are called pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skimshovel, and trowel. Some of these objects I think you will be familier with but most, I don't think you will be.                        The tools that you are not familier with are quite complicated. First of all, the skim shovel is used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. The whisk and dustpan is used to clear away dirt from the excavation side. These are the tools that I am not familier with, but you might be. I thought that it was very interesting to learn about the different tools that archeologists use to find objects and bones. Now I hope you understand more agout archeologists and their very hard job. In conclusion, archeologists are very interesting to learn facts about and I hope you learned alot from my essay about these very interesting and unique people.

Many of these jobs include working with artifacts from the past. In a way they are like detectives with shovels. But, that is not the only tool Archeologists use. Numerous tools are used in the process of finding, studying, and most of all making sure the artifact is not hurt during the event. They use things like the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and the trowel.       Also, archeologists can become very important people. Some have discovered things from the range of dinosaur bones to famous actor's personal belongings. This has made them important due to the fact that people seem to become closer to people of the past once they know something about their childhood or early life. This may be because people are most of the time drawn to the persons life before they became successful. This makes the job of an archeologist more worth wild.       Finally, I believe that this certain job is amazing because of the ground sight that they work on. One might be astonished to know that archeologists actually get to encounter the historical landscape from a very up close view. This interests me because I would love to pretend like I lived in that past life on a farm with my cows. A beautiful ground sight to work on would be a castle of an old pirate. Going into all the rooms; digging up stolen treasures and finding swords. It would be spectacular!       In conclusion, I believe that the job of an archeologist would be awesome. Although, digging isn't really my specialty, finding breathtaking artifacts and holding a little piece of history in my hands would be my dream job.

They have found out that Jmes Fort was not washed away by a river but it was still there! Reports from archeologists say that they found where it is located and why it is located there. They also found out about many things about the people that lived there. They found out how they fought the Indians that attacked them, where they put the things that they didn't want or need. That was the discovery of ''long lost James Fort.''                           Archeologists have also discovered things about the childhood of George Washington. They found out where he lived. How did they find out that the house they were looking at was his? Archeologists found out that the house they were looking at was his because they used details about what happened in the past, to find out about things today. For Example, they used the fact that George Washington's house once caught on fire and that George Washington smoked clay pipes to find out that they were looking at the correct house. That is the dicovery of George Washington's past.                           Why would they want to dig the past? Archeologists dig up the past so they can learn new things about the past. Sometimes books don't have enough information for what they want to learn so they decide to dig it up or investigate themselves.They also like to dig up the past so kids can learn more and also adults. Adults can learn what the lif e of George Washington was like before he became a president.Those were the reasons why they would be intrested in digging up the past.                              Some times people want to learn more about the past.I think that people like archeologists are very nice and intelligent people. I think they are kind because they help people learn more. I think they are intelligent because they use clues from the past to get to a end.

Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.    The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there,so it made sense that the settlers choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.

The archeologist told their leader that they want to find a fort on Jamestown. The leader told the archeologist to get all the people on the building to go find it.                Once the archeologist  where on their way they stop where they saw a mark on the ground, the archeologist got all the tools they will need. One of them took the pick and shovel, other took the whisk and  dustpan, another took the knife, other took the wheelbarrow, another took the skim shovel, and finally the last person took the trowel.When they where ready they start digging and digging until they found a triangle on the ground, so, they notice the fort was on a shape of a triangle.

George Washington was a soldier, that is what we know aboout him, wedon't know much about when he was little, let's see.               On time some archeologists were making a investigation of George Washington.   The archeologists wanted to know where George Washinton lived, so they started to look for information of where did his house was. The archeologists went to look for the house. The archeologists remmember that in the information said that fire was on his house, so the archeologists were looking for some kind of mark of fire on the ground. On day they return to keep looking for the house until someone look something on the ground,and all the archeologists look and look and look. One of the archeologist walk away through the car and look at a picture that they had before of George Washinton's house.               He run with the other guys and tell them that this is the place where Washington lived because it was exactly like the picture.

But later on the Rediscovery Archaeological Project ( who were suppose to find the secrets on Fort James) found some hints and clues that it was still there.                            Fort James had been built in 1607  when some people came from Britain to be free of England's hard laws. A lot of people thought it was bulit close to a river. It was a logical desicion because you could easily dock ships there. But later on work showed it might be located further away to give the colinist more protection.                          After about a 105 years later there hard work bore some fruit. They had finaly found fort James! They first found where the outline of the fort had been. And today we still find artifacts like trash and coins and even toys.                      It is amazing that we found items over 400 years old. Objects that are still used today.

A pick is used to dig into the earth next to the artifacts, a shovel does the same thing as the pick it digs into the earth trying to get dirt from around the artifact.There may be lots of other tools they may use  that I don'n know about.The whisk is used to dust off the artifact carefully.

They use tools like a skim shovel or a trovel to remove and veiw diffrent layers of soil in order to help look for artifacts. Archeology is important because it helps see how people from our past lived and how things have changed from then to now. They find the sights where the artifacts are by looking back in history.          The tools of Arecheologist have special jobs and are needed to find artifacts. Here are the tools and their uses.   The Pick and Shovel are used to dig into the earth and get close to the  artifacts. Whisks and Dustpans are used to help clear away dirt. A Knife is used to carefully scrape dirt away from artifacts. Wheelbarrows are used to move dirt and other objects to diffrent locations. Skimshovels are shovels with flat edges and are used to carefully remove a layer of thin soil. Trowels are the last tool and are the most common tool. They are used to cut and scrape dirt so Archeologist can look at the layers.   I used this information from Source #3           Archeology helps us see into the past and learn what happened back then.In 1994 a group of people intrested in studying the past (Archeologist) started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. It was designed to dicover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. for 200 years people thought it had been washed away by a river but some discoveries in the area hinted it might still be around.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. The first objects were found in 1861.Over a hundred years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.Then the National Park service led a five-year study of the area.Thats when they finnaly found James Fort!The archeologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the borders of the fort.Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.the objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in James Fort lived. We now know how the settlers did to fight the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.this info was from source #1          People like George Washington leave behind history so to find what they where like before they became famous you follow that history. Archeologist thought a stone base for a farm house would be left behind . Four houses had been built on Ferry Farm land, witch is the place where George Washington lived so Archeologist had to find proof it was his so they started a dig.Records show the Washingtons had a fire in their house. The diggers found peices of burnt pottery suggesting a fire had been here. They also found part of a clay pipe.

It takes hard work, cautiousness, determination, and patience.  Archeology helps us understand things about people and why they made the decisions that they did.  They use all different kinds of gadgets and tools to help them find these artifacts, so that's what I'll write about first.    This paragraph will be about the tools Archeologists use to find lost artifacts.  Some of the larger tools would be the Pick and Shovel, the Wheelbarrow, and the Skim Shovel.  Some of the smaller objects include the Trowel, the Whisk and Dustpan, and the Knife.  The Knife is used to dig carefully and push dirt away from the artifacts.  The Trowel is used to do some cutting and scraping to have some sort of a view of the different layers of soil.  The Whisk and Dustpan is probably used after you find the artifact it brushes off the dirt on an artifact.  The Pick and Dustpan is used to start the dig and get down close to the object, while the skim shovel scrapes thin layers of dirt with it's flat edge and dumps it into the wheelbarrow which then takes it away from the excavation site.    In this paper I explained what Archeologists tools do and how they help them get the job done.  If there were no Archeologists, museums like the Smithsonion wouldn't exist.  Museums help us learn about History, and isn't History one of our subjects in school?

Archeologist have to find things in the past.In 1994 people went to Jamestown to discover new things in the past. They also wanted to discover secrets of the James Fort. For about 200 years, people thought  that James Fort was washed away by a river. The first objects were found in 1861 and the Fort was built in 1607 so it took a lot of years to find the first objects.The first objects the Archeologists got were armor and weapons.They also discovered floors and building.                                            The National Park Service led a 5 year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. That is when they found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of footprints on the ground.The marks showed were the Fort walls were. The Fort was shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the Fort was stretched all the way to the river!                           Today people find millions of things including pottery, tools , and coins, They even found metal toys for children. In 1600s,people throwed their trash in a unused well or into a big pit. Archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, they found the bones of the animals they ate.Now we know that the settlers did not eat a lot.

If you do not know about people and you want to learn more about them then you can ask a archeologist. But this job can be scary to because if you put your hand in glass then it can stick you in the hand and can hurt really bad.This job is very fun because you can also tell people who do not know anything about the life of that person and that would be fun.            A archeologist can find information about that person that they are looking up.They can learn about there project that they are working on. They would not have a clue and then they find a clue and it helps them a lot. In the passage it says that the archeologist could not find the James fort in Jamestown but they did not give up and they found it.         When they where looking at the Washington home they found a lot of stuff and they found smoked clay pipes and clay pots. They could tell that the house had burned down because the clay pots were melted.That is how they could tell if the house had burned down.They knew that the stone base was still there so they started to dig in 2003.The first thing they found were a kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.

An archeologist is a person whose job is to study objects that have been buried from the past and dig them up.  What they do is an important job beause they are basically digging up our past and our future history.  Also I think it would be cool to be an archeologist and dig up all of those cool artifacts.  I also think would be hard work and not be so pleasent when you do not find anything.       In this paragarph, you will find out about archeologists digging in George Washinton's childhood home and about archeologists in Jamestown colony.  In George Washinton's childhood home on a farm caled Ferry Farm.  On this site an archeologist team can have up to 35 people!  While digging here you have to be very careful or you can damage something of his past, to avoid this you could use a soft whisk and a dustpan to get dirt from around an artifact. At the Jamestown colony dig workers use 3D computers to graph out what the conlony might have looked like.  Once they find Jamestown, they will then grab a skim shovel to remove thin layers of dirt.  In this dig, they found pottery, coins, tools and even metal toys for children.       As you can see, the life of an? archeologist is very hard. But when you find something it is like you have struck gold. So after a hard day of work, you may be tired but there is always another day ahead to look foward to. You can also think of the next day as a chance to find something more exciting and better than the thing you found yesterday.

You can't just start digging, or else you don't know where to dig.  First, you have to map the area with computers, then you can start digging with the skim shovels.  The skim shovels start removing layers of dirt, but be careful, you don't want to skim too far or else you might break the artifacts.  You could also start with a pick and shovel, once you are close to the artifacts.  You are very likely to use a trowel to remove the last few layers of soil. At this point, you will have to be super careful, or else you could easily break the artifacts.  If the soil surrounding the artifact is hard, you would use a knife to carefully scrape off the dirt.  If the dirt is soft or loose, you would use a whisk and dustpan.  As you can see, being an archeologist requires skill, but is still partially based on luck.  Why luck?  Well, you could be digging for 15 minutes and of found 43 treasure chests, while you could've been digging for 9 years and only found a piece of metal.

First, the team finds the place, which can track things underground, on a map using 3D computers. Then, another team starts digging in the dig. They use a type of shovel called the skim shovel that are small, flat, and sharp. They put the object found into a half-inch screen to let the dirt to fall and the object to stay. After that, they trowel to scrape and cut up the layers of the soil. Finally, the last team spend a lot of their time to study and find out more about the object and what it is. It takes a lot of time to do all this, but step by step you can get a good result.       Digging up objects and discovering things may be hard work, but you can make history out of it.

Architects find artifacts that can retrace or recollect what had happened to a person, place or thing. Architects discover important things such as diaries of a famous person or letters from the time of World War 2 probably they could even find secrets. They sometimes find things you can't imagine that could find for instance an invention or quotes lying around in the debris. Architects can discover many things.            Have you ever thought of a famous person that has passed away and wondered what their childhood was like and what tragic things happened during it's life span. Well that's what an architect can find out. Suppose Thomas Jefferson was your person maybe you would like to recollect his outlines of the Declaration of Independence. You could also find out if there was a fire where the person lived by testing the ground samples. For instance maybe you might find one of Benjamin Franklin's invention or books.

They dig up stuff and they examine it. They find information about the stuff they dig up by examining it. They use tools to dig the stuff up. Here are some examples.   The pick and shovel. Most of the time archeologists use these tools first. They dig into the Earth to find stuff.   The whisk and dustpan. They use this to dust dirt off the artifacts and clear dirt from excavation site. So if there is a lot of dirt on something they can just brush it away.   The knife. They use this to scrape dirt away from around the artifacts.   The wheelbarrow. They use this to carry something or dirt from one place to another. So if there is a lot of dirt in one place, then they can move it to a different place. Or if there is something heavy that they need to move.   The skim shovel. A skim shovel has a flat edge so it can remove dirt carefully. So maybe there is a fragile thing in the ground. They can remove the dirt carefully.   The trowel. This is a common tool used by archeologists. They use this to cut layers of soil. Maybe they just want to view stuff but the soil is too hard.

For example, there are lots of surprises and you don't always know what is coming next, you get to see a lot of cool things that most people don't get to see, and also kids can get involved. Plus, you don't get to say that you have seen George Washington's house very often.                 First of all, being and archeologist seems like lots of fun because there are a lot of surprises and you don't always know what is coming next. I know that I like surprises....most of the time, so maybe the job of an archeologist wouldn't be so bad. For example, it took the archeologists a lot of time to finally found James Fort. They first were seeing a lot of clues to find proof. Because you will need proof to prove to people that you found James Fort or people won't believe you, and as you may know that it takes a lot of work to find proof, most of the time. But can you imagine the great feeling that the archeologists felt when they knew for sure that they found James Fort. I know that I love the feeling of relief after a lot of hard work!                 Another great reason about being and archeologist is that you get to see a lot of cool things (artifacts) that a lot of people don't get to see, and you get to be the first. Not only do you get to see cool artifacts but you also get to use and see some cool tools. For example, when the archeologists discovered Fort James and George Washington's house, the archeologists got to discover objects that were used by people hundreds of years ago. Isn't that cool! Being and archeologist doesn't just give people excitement, but it also gives people a look at the past.                 One more reason that and archeologist seems like lots of fun is because, kids get to get involved. I may not like reading out of a textbook, but I do like doing hands on activities. It doesn't seem bad to get to go out and discover things that many people may of thought you wouldn't be able to do. Any good job takes some hard work. I thind that it would be really cool to learn about George Washington as a kid, or getting to see lots of cool artifacts! There should be a museum where kids can learn the same stuff that the archeologists discovered and doing hands on activities. Even though we wouldn't get as much fun as the archeologists did actually getting to discover, it would be lots of fun for the kids, and the archeologists would feel good about it!                 In conclusion, these were just a couple of examples of why being an archeologist is so much fun. Who knows, maybe you would want to try being an archeologist someday! Think about all the awesome things you would get to do. For instance, see cool artifacts, be the first to discover something, feel the feeling of anxiety, but then again have the feeling of relief. Like I said before, even though being an archeologist seems like lots of hard work, it is still lots of fun!

They all have there own abilities like the pickaxe that mines stone and cobble stone. The shovel gets rid of dirt. The wheelbarrow carries heavy loads.

It is, but it's a lot more then that. Even before the work happens it takes years to plan out the location. Then it's tiresome hours of ?finding objects in the ground on a 3D computer. Finally months of digging in the dirt for those objects. In this report you will learn the forgotten work of the archeologists.          The one of the hardest things an archeologist has to do is search out the coordin&aring;tes of the ruins. In a article I read it took a couple years to begin the search. I once met with a professor, he told me that 'in many of my archeological digs that it took 2-3 years to come up with the location.' He said that 'it takes many calculations. We have to go off of recent reports. Sometimes we go off of findings. One time we had a huge lead when we met up with a business man who said that their is a certain place with artifacts lying around everywhere.' There also is another flaw in this work. Say your calculations are off. You could dig up an entire place for nothing. You lose a bag load of money for nothing. You now have to reconfigure your calculations and spend another 2-3 years on calculations. This is one of the many tiresome events that occur as an archeologist.          Another tiresome act that occurs is the hours of watching a screen for any sign of object in the ground. This can be as boring as staring at a wall because      There is no game, website or anything to do but watch the screen. If you are hungry or go to the bathroom you need to call someone over to take your shift. Then the other person encounters the boredom that you were experiencing. If you sit to long, your butt falls asleep. I personally hate that.    Those were 4 things that may or may not occur if you are at this post. Not only those scary life threatening events but if the fates hate you that day they will either shut down your machine or make you dig up a tin can. If you dug 15 feet into the ground for that you would be furious. This is 5-6 things that can ruin your day in at least 10 minutes.          Finally the toughest part of them all. The dig. This part is the hardest because you have to dig in the hard earth. Yes, there may be machines, but, there always won't be. Imagine breaking your back everyday. Digging and digging and digging till you find the artifact. 95% of archeologists say that they needed 30 day back therapy after the dig. Yes, back therapy. 30% also said they either needed physical therapy for a couple months or needed back surgery. Imagine that! That's why only the crazy, dedicated, and genius have a career as a archeologist. Now you may call it. The dig.          As you can see you are wrong. A job as an archeologist is a crazy career not just fun and games. If you are interested in the job and have at least two of the traits I have listed above here are the simple steps.       Get a bag load of money Take 2-3 years to plan your archeological dig. Get a huge group of crazed workers. Take hours and hours of time on a 3D computer looking for artifacts. Start to dig and dig to find the objects. Schedule a physical therapy appointment.         Now you know the basics, and always remember them, they will come in handy! See you at the dig!

Archeologists are sometimes on robbery cases or maybe sometimes on discovering things from the past and getting all new information. Some archeologists even get payed to do their work. Archeologists can be put in dangerous situations just to find out more about what is going to happen in the future and what did happen in the past that we do not know about.          The things that people find out in their backyard like that they have a squirrel family living in their favorite tree is very different then what an archeologist does. Where as you found out about a family member living in Florida,archeologists found out about a whole group of presidents Berried in Florida(not really). Archeologists are very important to the world other wise we would never know who the first president was or what really happened in the big wars and big events.          Many of the archeologists these days are discovering crime cases or on a daily bases,what other life forms might be out there. You might think that aliens are never going to exist and you might have your head set on that but as an archeologist would say,I predict that there are to life forms of another species out there in this world. You might say,or you might think but that is not what an archeologist would do. An archeologist would think of something that they are not really sure about and has not really been proven,and then they would go out and try to discover what the real true answer is instead of guessing.          Archeologists are very smart people who help our world be a smarter place and we will always know now what these people discovered. If they can dig and risk their lives just so we can have a part of a social studies lesson then I think that we can do it to.  You can just go to a park or while you are on vacation dig around look around see what the world has in place for you and what you can help with.

Have you ever been an archeologist?  What is an archeologist?  What do they do?  All of those questions might be going through your head right now, but I will answer all those questions.  Anyways, to be an archeologist is a lot of work.  Also they have to take a lot of classes to know what to do .  The good thing is that they can get a lot of money for selling all their precious artifacts to dealers.  Therefore, the job of an archeologist can be very complicated.               First of all, to be an archeologist is a lot of work.  You have to work all day long, which can be very tiring.  Also to be an archeologist can be very slow because you have to dig up artifacts that are very precious.  Sometimes you have to use paintbrushes, small shovels (skim shovels), and wooden picks, this is called troweling.  Even if you have a big group digging to find artifacts, it can take over two weeks to find and dig up something.  Furthermore, archeologists have a lot of work.               Secondly, to be an archeologist you have to take lots of classes.  For example, you have to learn about history to know where and what happened in the past.  They do this to know where to dig and what to dig/look for.  You also have to take archeology to learn how to dig and to dig properly.  There is also a lot more classes you have to take to be an archeologist, but that would take a while.  Lastly, you have to take a lot of classes to be an archeologist.               After all, you can get lots of money if you sell the artifacts to a dealer.  This is the good thing about being an archeologist-you get a lot of money out of it.  If you sell the artifacts to a dealer, they can give you lots of money for the artifact(s).  If the artifact(s) are very old you can get a lot of money for it.  If the artifact(s) are not really really old you will get less money, but still a lot of money.  All in all, this is the good part about being an archeologist- you get a lot money.               To sum it up, to be an archeologist is very complicated.  Archeologists get a lot of money.  You have to take a lot of classes to be one.  The on thing that is good is the money that you get.

Secondly, they have to use computers, tools, and science to find ancient artifacts.  Lastly, even though it takes a long time, it is definitely worth it.       Firstly, since it takes a long time for scientists to do their work, it might be a while until they they do find what they're looking for.  Since George Washington`s house burnt down, it was harder for the scientists to find proof that they were at the correct sight.       Secondly, since they have to use several tools to find artifacts they may have to work slower to understand what they have to look for.   Firstly, they have to use a computer with a 3D monitor to find out what they are looking for and where it is.  Secondly, they have to use shovels, trowels, pickaxes, knifes, dustpans, etc. to actually find the artifacts.       Lastly, even though it is very time consuming, it is worth it. it helps people understand more about the first president of the United States.  It also taches people what is done to discover artifacts from famous peolpe hundreds of years ago.       In conclusion, i believe that archaeology is very important in this world.

In this essay you'll learn about Jamestown Isand, working at young George Washington's house and you will also learn a little more about the tools they use and how they use them. I hop you learn more about archeologists by reading this essay.               First I'll tell you a little about Jamestown Island. In 1994 a group of people started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. They wanted to rediscover Fort James in Virginia. For more than 200 years people believed that Fort James had been carried away by a rushing river, but now there starting to doubt that theory. The was believed to be built either by a river or father away to be protected from enemies. The first artifacts were found in 1861. Archeologists found armor, weapons, floors and even ceilings of the fort. Now people are trying to find the exact place the fort was at. There was a five year study that gave them many important clues. Then they found it imagine how happy you would be! Today people can find a million objects or artifacts each year. They find pottery, glass and many other artifacts.Wow archeologists have to work really hard to find the sites even before they dig.       Next we will talk about George Washington's old house. George lived at a place called ferry farm. Finding the spot was very difficult because the farm was very big. but they made an estimate and started digging they soon found the stone base of the house.  Since other houses had been built there they needed proof it was young George's house. Records say the house burned down and they found burnt pottery. They also found clay pipes which they know Washington loved to smoke them. The archeologists have to be very careful while digging and handling artifacts. One wrong move and an important part of our history could be destroyed in seconds. Up to 35 people could be working on one site. They also use Highly advanced computers. They even let kids help out!       Finally I'll tell you about tools they are the pick and shovel used to dig the earth close to objects, whisk and dustpan used to dust the dirt off artifacts, knife used for careful digging near the artifact, Wheelbarrow is used to move artifacts or dirt away from the dig site, skim shovel used to remove a thin layer of soil and finally the trowel used to scrape, cut or view the soil differently. Wow that a lot of tools to dig right and ensure the safety of every artifact.       To sum it up Archeologists are amazing people who help us understand our history by literally digging it up. They have uncover Fort James and young George Washington's house. They use special tools and have to be extra careful. I hope now you have learned a lot more about archeologists. Maybe you want to be one too.

They showed where the Forts walls used to be. All the stories they read they knew it would be shaped like a triangle. Archeologists also found out stuff about George Washington. No one exactly knew where Georges house was located. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year, but they finally found it. It was found on Ferry Farm. Records show that the Washingtons had a fire in there house. They found Georges clay pipes so they knew it was the Washingtons house.

The archeologists found many things such as tools,pottery,coins and metal toys when that kids used to play with.They found these things when they were searching for James Fort.The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the site.Today, the group fins nearly one million objects a year. In the 1600s people used to throw away their trash down an unused well or into a big pit,While digging in the area , the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including bones from animals that they ate.The information learned from these objects helps the archeologists understand how the people lived in the James Fort.That is the end of that summary.

The tools used by archeologists are a Pick and Shovel.Most digs start with the pick and shovel and are used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts.The whisk and dust pan are used to brush dirt off artifact and clear away dirt from the excavation site.The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.Another tool that is used is a wheelbarrow and that is used to move things from one place to another.One other tool is a skim shovel that is used to carefully remove a thin layer off the artifact.The last tool is the trowel and is used to scrape things. The ferry farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved.The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities.Kids can explore the site even.This challenges kids to solve puzzles about the work being done at ferry farm.That is the end of that summary.

You can also use the nife to scrape off the dust that have been all over the place and covered many clues. After all being an archeologists is not that hard.       An archeologists found many things in Washington's house all the years ago. The archeologists use the skim shovel to remove layers of soil, at one time. The discovery of Washington's home was important because, it gives citizens clues to let them know who was he before he became famouse. The archeologists also found clues that Washington had made his decisions he had made.       The archeologists started studying about Jamestown Rediscovery Archeologists Project. Many people for over 200 years thought that that fort had been washed away by a river. Archeologists found some hints that the fort will still be around. First archeologists found some weapons and armor. Then they discovered the floors of buildings, after a while archeologists found the place where the fort was build.

The fort was built around the start of the 16th century to protect a river entering the mainland of the new land that had been claimed. But in a more recent seach to find out more about this time of history the National Park Service sent out teams of up to 35 people in a team to find more about this fort.                   The teams found many amazing things like pottery, tools, and coins. They also found trash, like the bones of animals that the colonists had eaten. That investigation also gave us more information about the attack of the Powhatan tribe. It also told us of how they built things back in those times like, all the cellers, burial sites, and the foundatoins of 10 buildings inside the boundries of the fort.

I think a good way to find out if the fort was still in the area was to just dig.Maybe the if a giant storm did something to the fort it probably didn't do much damage like knocked it over the.The thing is that nobody will ever know for sure because it happened a long time ago,but here is the following things they could of used to keep everyone knowing about what happened.         keep a log book and pass it down threw your family talk to people about it allot! ask your teacher to teach the class about it           The one thing that is for sure is that some of the things in the fort MUST have decomposed because    mostly every thing on earth.the fort is probably under ground or maybe not.Then in 1861 the team of archeologists finally found it!it was a amazing discovery i think it was the best one ever found because forts are just so big and with the army it had to make it a even bigger fort.                                            DIGGING UP GEORGE WASHINGTON'S PAST               History tells us about George Washington wail he was a soilder and a president,but now we know about him when he was a child.When he was a child george's father moved to a land know as ''ferry farm'',at the time george was just six when his father moved there.The building that washington family lived in was long gone be time people wanted to find it.So because of that they had to find the stone base that was under the house so then they can find the house.Then in 2003 they found it because of the stone under the house they found the slave quarters,kithen and storage houses/shed.           the team also needed prof that the house that they found was the washingtons house. the team of archeologists knew that george washington had a fire in his home so thy looked for burnt thing like burnt chairs from the kichen or a burnt wagon.Then they found a burnt peace of potery so they then knew it was george washingtons house.           the team had to dig very carfuly so they didn't break any thing.they had to use 3D maps on computers to find so they can track whats under ground and the data would record the data and give it to the diging crew so they can VERY carfuly.Then they find the house,but they need proof so they find thing from the washingtons.

You can use the pick axe to hit and break rocks and the   you can use the shovel to dig out dirt,and on earth there   allot of dirt and rock to get out of the way.                 WHISK AND DUSTPAN:   The whisk and dust pan is used for getting out just little bits   of dirt.this is use to get dust of things.Or rocks that's why you   need the dust pan part because some of the rocks might be   important so with both you can get rocks and dust off.               KNIFE:   You can use the knife to get dirt off of the artfact or scrape   the ground when you think your very close.

They have specific ways to do their digs. They also have many special tools they use for their digs. Archeologist find many cool artifacts. Artifacts are anything that was made or used in the past. They do their digs at various places that were important in the past. It might be at James Fort, George Washington's house, or maybe they are looking for dinosaur fossils.                      Archeologist are separated into three teams with up to 35 people. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. This information is used to get a look of what the area looks like before team two starts digging. Team two is the team that does the digging and gets the artifacts out of the ground. The archeologist start the dig with a skim shovel. This shovel is flat, small, and sharp. This makes it so it can remove different, thin layers of soil one at a time. Then they place it in a box with a half inch screen at the bottom, so dirt can fall out with the artifact still in. They also use other tolls besides for the skim shovel, like the trowel, pick and shovel, wheelbarrow, and more.              Archeologist jobs take a long time to do. If an archeologist rushed his or her work at the dig than they could brake very valuable objects that help us figure out the story of the past, history. The National Park Service led a five-year study to figure out how the land on which Fort James was on, was used. Five years is a long time, but it is worth it to archeologist who do the work. To plot the land, carefully dig for artifact, and to identify what they are takes a long time.              Now you know why they archeologist dig, to find artifacts. You also know how they dig, in three teams with up to 35 people. Another thing you know is what they dig with, many different tools.

I would want to be a person at the dig because I like using pick, and I want to try to use a skim shovel.

Now they find nearly 1 million objects a year from James Fort. They found George Washington's childhood home in 2003. First they found some smaller buildings. Then the main structure. They found pipes and burnt pottery that supported their thoughts that the house had suffered a fire. Now they have activities there to educate people on the house's history. Thanks to these discoveries we know more about history.            Now you have learned about two important digs you need to learn about the tools they use. They use a pick and shovel to dig close to artifacts, so they won't be damaged. They use a whisk to clear of artifacts and a knife to remove dirt from them. They use a wheelbarrow and a thin shovel for careful work. They use alot of tools and each one has a certain job.

It matters what kind you are though.For example a dinosaur archaeologist has to do alot of researching on the bones to find out what kind of dinosaur it is. archaeologists guested the past like 400 years or more years ago then, they find out.            There are other archaeologists like the ones who finds the fossils. The other archaeologists Just research the things scientists bring back and been checked. They have to enter it into the system so, its in and memorized. After it is in the system it goes to an storage where the Archaeologists put it.             I think I would enjoy being an Archaeologist when I'm older. It sounds like a fun job to me. Although it would be challenging digging up the fossils and old rocks.

They are still finding dinosaur bones. The bones will never run out.            A true Archaeologist would get the date, time, and year when they found the fossil, body, and ect.

Lets start with Fort James. Archaeologist found the first artifacts from Fort James in 1861. They found armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of Fort James. A 100 years later people started trying to find the exact spot where the fort was built.They first thing that the archaeologist found was marks on the ground that showed where the walls used to be. The archaeologist heard stories and made drawings that lead them to relize that the fort was triangle shaped. They discovered that the fort stretched all the way to the river. At the river they foundledges that were designed to hold cannons.They also found 11cellars, many burial sites and 10 building all inside the fort. Today archaeologist fing almost 1,000,000 objects each year. In the area archaeologist found the trash that the settlers threw away. Some of the things found were animal bones of the animals that they ate. The archaeologist found many objects that were used everyday hundreds of years ago.      Next we are going to talk about the George Washington house. Archaeologist started digging in 2003. It took them over a year but they had found the kitchen, slave quaters, and storage houses. They did not find the main farm house untill a few years later.      Lets talk about just archaeology now. First there are 3 teams. 1 team can consist of 35 people. The first group makes a map on 3D computers. The maps help the people who actually dig know where they are going and how deep they are going to dig. The  second team is the team who digs up the artifacts. The third team is the people who later study the artifacts in a lab. Some of the tools that archaeologist use are pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Each one of the tools does something different.

'Hey why dont study about superheros!!!' John said 'No we wanna study about archeologests.' So i got angry like an angry bird, but i accepted it anyway.

Archeologists still have hope that object ,ight still be around the area.                 The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists found armor and weapons. To find these items they had to use whisks and dust pans. Plus, to get away all the dirt they had to use wagons.They now had help from the national park which helped alot!

In this report you will learn about the job of an archeologist. You will discover the good sides       of being one, and also the bad. You will learn things you have never known about digging bones, artifacts, and more!       Does this interest you? Read on to learn more!             What is an archeologist? An archeologist is somebody who digs and discovers artifacts, which are items that give       us glimpses of the past. In the artical, Finding Fort James, it describes archeologists as,'...people who discover       uncovered armor and weapons...', which is true. Those who take this job have a lot of responsibility, holding keys to       hundreds of years ago. To learn about all the good and bad of being an archeologist, read on.             When taking the job of an archeologist, you also take responsibility. To this responsibility, there is good and bad.       If you decide that this is the job for you, you will enjoy digging in the dirt on hot days. Some though, wouldn't preferr       these conditions. Another thing to consider is whether you would like to do this every day. Other jobs may offer       oppurtunities that you do new things everyday, but some may enjoy routine. Being an archeologist means you have       to follow the system, and if you dont, then you might mess it up for the entire team. In the text it reads,'...the first     team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground... ...another team focuses on the actual       digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig... ...diggers also use a process called troweling.       Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to 2       weeks.

Many archeologists find fossils and every so often they might find a city that was buried underground hundreds even thousands of years ago.                One interesting Rediscovery was the one of James town in 1994 a group of people started the Jamestown rediscovery group project that group was designed to discover the secrets of FortJames for over 200 years people had thought that FortJames had been washed away by a river. the fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people believed that FortJames was built near a river so it was easier to dock ships there. However the group discovered items nearby and found out that the fort was built further away the new spot probably gave them more protection from enemy ships. The first items were found in 1861 when archeologists found weapons and armor they also discoverd floors of buildings. Over a 100 years later a group effort tried to find the exact spot where the fort was located. The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to find out how it was used. When they made a mapping of the software for the area Eureka! that's when they found it they found ledgest that were supposed to hold cannons they found dozens of burials and today they nearly fin 1 million objects.              Another expedition was the Digging up of George Washington. Most of what we know about him is his presidency and fighting in the American Revolution many biographies dont have much information about him as a child. But everything will change because recent discoveries show that his home as a child might help archeologists learn about him as a child. Many people lived on the land called ferry farm so of course George Washington's dad moved his family there. Know one knew where they exactly lived because the house had been long gone however archeologists believed that the stone floor of the house was still there the group started digging in 2003 it took over a year but eventually found it.ther firstrooms they found were the kitchen the slave quarters and storage houses, the found the main farmhouse a few years later. Four other houses had been built on ferry farm they found out that they had a fire in their house so they checked and they found burnt pottery part of a clay pipe and Washington smoked clay pipes so that is more proof it was the right house.          Some of the tools the archeologists used were the pick and the shovel most digs were started with these tools. A whisk and a dust pan they were used to brush away dirt. knife used for careful digging around objects. a wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another and lots of dirt. a skim shovel used to carefully remove dirt. trowel used to cut different layers of soil.

Or what job you may want to do? Well today I am going to tell you all about what an archeologist does for a living, and how they do it.            Archeoloy is the study of fossils and old arifacts. An archeologist is a person who studies fossils and old artifacts. In other words, archeology is just the study of old objects that were dug up and dusted off.            First, they find something that they may be interesed in finding more about, like dinosaurs. They sudy them and read all sorts of books about them and learn the different names and bones. They have to make sure they know almost everything about that topic. To be able o dig up these creatures they have to do a lot of researching. The research what they ate, what they looked like, their bones, where they lived, and so on.They had to know all of this because when it came time to dig they had to know which animal, and where to find it.              The next step is getting together the right tools, and finding out where to dig. Once again they have research about where to find hey animal(s) and what tools to use. You dont want to show up to the digging spot with only a shovel and a wheelbarrow. They need to bring a pick and a shovel,to start your dig. A whisk and a dustpan, for brushing off he artifacts, and a knife for scraping dirt from around the artifacts. They also need a skim shovel,  trowel, and a wheelbarrow. To find the right spot is the hardest. You have to research where they lived and may have died.            Lastly, the archeologist goes to the sight, finds where to dig with a computor, and starts digging. When they find something they usually dig carefully around it, then dust it off. When they have made a discovery they may sell it, or give it to a museum.               In conclusion archeology is a very hard job, and being an archeologists is very hard, and important too. This report may make this job sound easy, but it is actually the opposite. It is a challenge and some archeologists don't find many things. If ou like challenges and hard work this might just be the job for you! If you hinks it's just cool and want to see some fossils, go to a museum and look at all he shells and fossils they have. Some museums actually have a sound proof, glass room where you can see reakl archeologists dustin and cleaning some fossils! Here's what I want you to do, try some activities, have our parents bury some oys in a sand box and have you find them. It migh actually be more fun than its sounds to you!

Most of the time archeologists study from 5-10 years or more on a site, such as the one they studied about George Washington. They started digging in 2003, and over a year later, they found up to three rooms. They were the kitchen, the slave quarters, and storage houses. They had heard that there was a fire that happened in the Washington house, and they needed proof that this plantation was actually Geaorge Washinton's house. After lots of digging, the archeologists found burnt pottery, and parts of a clay pipe. Since George Washington smoked clay pipes, it was now obvious that this plantation had belonged to the Washingtons.      Usually on digging sites, there are a big number of teams/groups. There can be up to 35 people on a team!  Archeologists use up to six sets of tools. They are the Pick and Shovel, which most digs start with these tools, used to dig in the earth close to the artifacts. Second there's the Whisk and Dustpan, used to brush the dirt off the artifacts and items gently. Third there's the knife, used for careful digging and used to get the dirt out from hard to reach places. Fourth there's the Wheelbarrow, used to move objects and artifacts away from the site or to carry dirt out of the site. Fifth, there's thw Skim Shovel, which is a shovel with a flat surface used to ccarefully remove thin layers of dirt and/or soil with each scoop. Finally there's the Trowel, which is probably the most common tool used by archeologists, used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. And that is what archeologists do.

Archeologists are very important people and if you want to help 'dig up the past' and work hard digging into the ground I would suggest being an archeologist for your future job.       Archeologists in in Jamestown in 1994 were trying to discover the secrets of their James Fort in Virginia. Everyone thought it had been washed away by a river but maybe some new discoveries may be made.The fort was built in 1607. The first objects were found in 1861 uncovered armors, weapons, and floors of a building.  The National Park Service led a five-year study of the land. Thats when they finally found James Fort! They first found marks of where the walls used to be, and they found stories and drawings that made the archrologists know that it was shaped like a triangle. Today they find nearly 1 million objects each year that includes pottery tools, or coins. It is very exciting to discover new things that were used hundreds of years ago.      Have you ever heard of Ferry Farm? A lot of people jave lived there but archeologists just found out that George Washington used to live there! When the archeologists dug up there they found a lot of things that George Washington used. They split up into groups, one digging, one getting the objects out of the dirt, and another trying to find out what the artifacts are. The dicovery of Washington's home is very important because you can understand who George washington was, the desisions he made, and the life that he lived. Maybe you can help dig up George Washington's artifacts when you grow up.       Archeologists need tools to 'dig up the past'. The most important tools are the pick and shovel because they dig up the dirt so that you can find the artifacts. They also use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifact and clear away dirt. Archeologists use knives to scape dirt away from around the artifact, and a wheelbarrow to carry dirt away so that they can dig more. Some extra tools are a skim shovel and a trowel to remove dirt. The archeologists need a lot of tools to do their work so if you like tools an archeologist would be a good job for you.      All in all an archeologist is a very helpful and interesting job.  If you like finding cool things, using tools and getting dirty, an archeologist is a good job for you. I hope that after you read this you will think of being an archeologist as your future job!

They are very historical and breathtaking. They are important for many reasons because George Washington took part during the American Revolutionary War and Fort James was in Jamestown,Virginia where it was one of the first settlements in North America for England.                      George Washingtons father, Augustine Washington, moved his family to Ferry Farm at the age of 6. Archeologists believed that the stone base under George Washingtons house is still there. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section!The discovery of Washingtons home is important. First, it gives the citizens of the U.S. a better perspective of Washington and his family before and after he became famous. Another, because it tells of a life of a Colonial American and how they lived.Clearly, the dicovery of his past is quite important.                     Fort James was built around 1607. When settlers had arrived there they thought that it was near water. So it was easier to dock ships there. The new spot gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships. Fort James was located at Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years people had thought that it was washed away.In 1994, a group of people became intrested in this fort and started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The very first object that they had found was in 1861. When they had first discovered James Fort they had found a set of marks on the ground.Its swampy low lands made them leave and find a better settlement to make crops. Clearly, its was a good and bad place to settle in.                All in all, it is exciting to dicover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. And it gives us a piece of knowledge and information about are past and ties us to the people who firsted started the American Colonies.Into what is know today The United States of America.

An archaeologist is a person who studies the artifactsof long ago. They use facts from the artifacts to solve long ago mysteries.\              They helped solve the mysteries of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia and solved the mysteries of George Washington's childhood. These people use specific tools to solve the mysteries. Some examples of tools are the pick, shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.              To solve a mystery, the archaeologists must follow these steps in order to make   a big discovery. Before the archaeologists start digging, they use 3D computer models to see what is underground carefully. Then, the archaeologists can start digging. First, the   archaeologists must use the tools very carefully to find any antiques that are very small. They use big sifters to carefully observe the small antiques. Once they find treasues that proves what happened long ago, they will have solved the mystery on what they wanted to solve.                 They just don't dig just like that. They must dig very, very carefully. It can even take two weeks to dig and sift through a 25-square-foot-section. By what these artifacts means is how long ago was important was long ago.               So as you can see, an archaeologist has a very important job. They use common sense and other things to prove about the world.

Archeologist had many jobs to do such as not breaking the artifacts while trying to get it out of the dirt, or finding the artifacts that takes a long time. And the most important part of being and archeologist is making sure it is an artifact and someone didn't just put it under ground. Archeologists have a big job they need to stay on topic and and focus on what they are doing if they don't they could get very hurt or loose there teaser that would not be good at all.         when an archaeologist finds something they don't just pick it up because it could break really easy and it cold have bugs and other thing on it. you have to pick it up with great care or else the terser will just be a wast of time finding, Being an archeologist does not mean you get to keep the treasure actually you take it to a test lab and many people will study it and its really cool and can be fun at times. The job of an archeologist can be fun but also really tiring and maybe even stressful.         When an archeologist finds something they study it with bare eyes and then they bring it to a lab and study it and most of the time the artifacts they find are stuff from many, many, many years ago and now in days we have cameras that can see under ground without digging first that helps them look at the artifact before digging, they also have boxes that they scoop dirt up and put it in the box and there is a thing at the bottom where the dirt falls out and the artifacts stay in the box then they collect it and bring it to the lab. when they get to the lab and do tests on it.       Before archeologist can study artifacts they have to make sure its clean so they can put it in a museum. archeologist have a very important job because without them we would not have known so much about people in the past and without knowing what people have done for us to become a country would not have been good we need to learn about are history and more. People thing that archeologist have a easy job but they don't they have a very hard job when i read 'finding fort James' i realized they don't have an easy job and they work really hard. When i think of an an archeologist I think of a person who study diansor bones but they actually study more than that like pots and pans from when gerorge washington was alive they can learn stuff from that. Archeologist have an inportant job in life and it would be hard withoute them.

I think a job of an archeologist is very exciting in my opinion I think the job of an archeologist can be hard and busy.  Archeologist are people who look for artifact of ancient people during the past.  Sometimes archeologist want to know what weapons looked like in the past,  the first weapons found by archeologist were found in 1861,  the archeologist discovered or uncovered a armor and weapons.  The job of the archeologist can discover many things from ancient time or history.                In 1994 people were interested of studying the past of Jamestown,  people wanted to find and study the James Fort in Jamestown.  So researchers look and studied about them for years until they can find the James Fort in Jamestown.  But suddenly after five years of studying the area of where the James Fort was the archeologist finally found the James Fort.  Right after when they found the James Fort they saw some sets of marks on the ground, the marks showed on the fort were drawings and shapes like triangles.  It would have been an amazing experience  for archeologist to the James Fort in Jamestown, years ago.  For archeologist they had to search the area for at least five or more years until they can look for artifacts or find the James Fort. It must have been many years to find the James Fort in Jamestown.           Did you know that today archeologist finds at least one million artifacts each year wow thats alot it takes people from all over the world to find that many many artifacts each year.  The object include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.  During the late 1600s people would throw aways things down a anused well or a big pit,  while todays archeologist dig they find the trash from settlers that they threw away, an dincluding bones of animals they ate.  The information or artifacts that the archeologist find is very important, they find srtifsct so srcheologist can understand how people lived during this time in Jamestown.

The way archeologist do this is they work together as in team work and they us the right tools such as a pick and shovel it helps the archeologist dig into the earth close to the artifacts another one is a whisk and dust pan it is used to brush off all the dirt when the artifact is found.           Archeologist are very important in life there probably/wouldn't be any history or biographies on famous people now! People would be remarked and joyful to know about different thing that happen long ago in our world such as Rosa Parks people would be interested in knowing about there life time if they already don't know! to me it is extraordinary to learn about the one who brought great pride to the world mainly famous people to know that you've been a child and went through the same thing famous people went to is amazing. some times archeologist may involve in famous people privacy that went on a long time ago thought so you better watch out.       I would think being an archeologist is wonderful you get to learn new things that you never knew before about the past that happen to those are our now gone that happen to you in the past if I was an archeologist I would love to find all different kids of Artifacts that had been there ago such as old dolls and windmills and particles of maybe Furniture that was torn from. an archeologist job is never done there are many famous people out here to figure out what happened to that person, and that person life it should always be wonderful an amazing to figure out what happen to that famous person ant happen to you as a child growing up its outstanding. If you were an famous person who was long gone and was up in heaven wouldn't you want someone to find something you had while grown up.       Another way the archeologist work is they call on a group of archeologist from maybe around the world and they try to find they exact spot where the famous person like Rosa parks home was built in the beginning did you know they use about (5 -maybe 10), form recent discoveries it helps they archologist know more about that famous persons life and more about there childhood                             ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.07570402605776,2.05369243949392,1.26235021126117

Some archeologists don't get payed as much as others do because they do find as valuable things as others do. they might get payed $2,000 a year as others get payed about $5,000 a year.               Alot of the archeologists in NC are the ones who get $2,000 a year but, at least they get payed. some people don't get payed as much as they should. I think alot of the people who get payed $2,000 don't work as hard as they should. But thats my opinion. So back to the topic. Some archeologists are really serious about their job. Most of them are.

Each team uses different plans to get what they had to do don.               Their are 3 teams that work one team scans the ground for artifacts and another teams digs it up and the other team that digs it up is called a dig. When the dig finishes they give it to the last team to research the item they found. Each team works a different part they use different equipment to do it like the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and trowel.

It would be interesting because, you would find the remains of people.  You would also get to find old things we dont use today.  Maybe you can find things that may fetch a high price.  You could also find a one of a kind object.  You could go around the world to places you've never been to before.  You never know what you'll find and how you find it.  You get to use all these weird tools that work in an awsome way.  Some may seem familar but bring a big impact to the dig.  For people that are careful and like discovering new things this is something they might be interested in.  Any one that likes the dirt, digging you name it they might like this.  If you like getting your hands dirty this might be your thing.  This is a  great exspearence for children.  Personally I think this is a chance to learn something new.  You can try it and might even like it.  And try it again to get a feeling of if you want to do this.  You can find new things and name it what ever you want.

A whisk and dustpan, used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.  A knife, used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.  A wheelbarrow, used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.  A skim shovel, a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layor of soil with each scoop.  And a trowel, this is probably the most common tool in archeology.  Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.  These tools help Archeologists in many many different ways!             And this is the job of an Archeologist, and what they do, and what tools they use for the finding of fossils and scraps of any thing or animal that is left behind.

For a long time people thought that the fort in Jamestown was washed away from the waves. They aso thought that it was really close to the shore.               The first object found in Jamestown was in 1861. The National Park Sevice led a five year group to scout the areafor all different kinds of things that went from weapons to potary to bricks. Then they finally found Jamestown with the help of maping computers.Today groups of up to thirty-five people find almost a million pieces of infomation each year.

Trowel   This is used to scrape andcut into the soil so the archeologists can get a good view of whats under the soil.             It is easier for the archeologiss to find more hidden things than it was when they first started because they have a lot more things that are high tect right now.

They spend most of there time digging in paticalr spots to find out more about famous people and places. You must use a lot of different mattirels to do this job. Because you never know what you are going to come acrossed. You could come acrossed a really old tea cup that George Washington drank out of and you need to get all of that extra dirt off so you would use your whisk and dustpan. Or if there was lots of dirt sticking to the tea cup and it wont come off with the whisk you could use a knife to scrape the dirt off the cup. You will always use every tool at some point. If you came across rocky dirt you can grab out your pick and get threw the rocky dirt in a couple minutes flat.                                        Archeologists help everyone they need to. When they dug at Ferry Farm Land they had to do more digging then you can inmaging to finnd where George Washington's house was. The only way they knew it was his house was because George Washington smoked clay pipes. When they found that the Archeologists  found some burnt pottery.  And that means they figured out omthing new. George Washington's house did have a fire occered.  Archeologists are very hard workers. If you were one i bet you would say being a Archeologists is harder then it looks but it's worth it.                   Or when the time they went to Jamestown to uncover the secerts of Jamestown.  And people had thought the fort had been washed away by the river for 200 years. Around in the 1960's some archeologists found the exacct spot were jamestown was first started. The fort was shaped like a triangle. They made maps and the Archeologists found out that the fort streched all the way to the river.  They also figured out that the river had stones on the ledges of the river designed to hold cannons.                  Archeologists do a lot of cool things for us back then and now. They have somtimes desovered the most instesting things that you could never inmagine to find. A job as a Archeologists may sound a little boring but when you do it im sure you might injoy doing it. When you do you are desovering things for you to know but also for everyone else to. Archeologists are amazing people.

Recently, I read some articles about archeology and how it is used to understand history. The process of digging up objects is long and quite confusing. The steps include digging up objects, cleaning them off, and identifying them. These all need extreme care.              While digging up things, archeologist use pickaxes and shovels to dig up top layers of dirt and stone. The dirt archeologists dig up are transported elsewhere using a wheelbarrow. Another digging tool is the trowel, which is used to scrape and cut different layers of dirt. It is very common. These tools, except for the wheel barrow, are used to dig up artifacts. Artifacts are the objects from a long time ago, that tell us about our past.              After, the archeologists dig up artifacts, the clean them off. The tools they use are the knife and the whisk. The knife is used to scrape off the dirt on an artifact. The whisk is used to brush the dirt off. When using the knife, archeologists must use extreme care so they won't hurt the artifact.              Lastly, archeologists must identify the object to know about their past. There are laboratories for identifying objects. For example, if there is pottery made with a type of clay inaccessible in our part of the world, we could know trading routes for Native Americans. Bones of animals could tell us what type of meat our people ate. In George Washington's house, there were many things. Most of those things could be used to tell about Washington's past.                  In conclusion, an archeologist's work is very confusing. They need to dig up, clean, and identify these artifacts. Although their work is tough, it's worth it to go through it. We learn about our past and what happens in it.

In, 1994 a group of people called the ''Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeologist Project'' wanted to know about the secrets of James Fort. They designed to discover the secrets of  James Fort. Over 200 years, legend says that peole thought the fort was washed away by a river. Some say that peole still think the fort is underground. In conclusion, the archaeologists wanted to find out the secrets of Fort James.             The fort was built in 1607. Settlers came from England to start a new life. People would built ships, start businesses, and built new homes. They would even grow crops like corn, tabacco, and other crops. It was easier to dock ships there, and settlers choose the spot there. Settlers also started alot of businesses. The spot even gave people the protection from enemy ships. In conclusion, the settlers came from England to James Fort to start a new life.                 The objects were founded located further away from the fort. The achaeologists found the first objects in 1861. They study the objects that uncovered that armor and weapons in James Fort. They discovered it was under the floors of the buildings. The armor and the weapons were used to protect the fort from enemies, who tried to attack the fort. Maybe, the settlers put the armor and the weapons under the floor of the building so no one will still them. Plus, the enemies won't know where they hid the armor and the weapons. In conclusion, they found armor and weapons under the buildings of James Fort.                  Over 100 years, the group found the exact spot where the fort was built. The National Park Service had a five-year study. They were figuring it out how the land was used by the settlers. They need the proof so that it will help them to decide where they would find James Fort. They have been studying using computer mapping software to make the image for the area. Also there using maps and probably to scan the armor and weapons to find  James Fort. In conclusion, they need the proof to find James Fort.                   That's when they found James Fort! The first thing they have to do is find a set of marks on the ground. The second thing, to do is the marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. All the stories peole heard that drawings they made, the archaeologists knew that James fort formed like a triangle. They believed that the settlers used the stone ledges to built over the river. Plus, the designs on the ledges were canons. The most amazing part is, that the archaeologist found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all with the border of the fort.                   In conclusion, today the group found nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children. Plus, in the 1600s, people used to throw their trash in a unused well or into a big pit. All their scarps were there, including the bones of animals they ate.The objects help us learn more information in history and about how the settlers in James Fort lived.

You have to plan the digs very carefully and make sure everything is in perfect order.  There are three main groups in archeology with up to thirty-five people in each.        The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.  That information is recorded so that the diggers know what is underground before people started digging.  This was very helpful to the discovery of Fort James.  The archeologists needed a good map of the area, so they used the computer mapping software.  The 3D computers are a very helpful tool when looking for the spot where archeologists want to start digging.        The second team focuses on the actual digging.  The site where diggers dig is called a dig. Those archeologists start digging with a tool called a skim shovel.  A skim shovel has a flat edge and with each scoop removes a thin layer of soil.  When archeologists dug up some artifacts from George Washington's childhood, the first tools they used were skim shovels.  The second tools they used were shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks.        The third and last team works in the lab.  They study the objects that were found.

If you would like to be an archeologist I think it would be cool to find Elivis Presley's guitar, house, and clothes.

An archeologist is a person who studies things from thousands of years ago. They dig for fossils and artifacts.  In order for an archeologist to be a good one, he or she must take their time, study hard, and don't give up. Taking this job isn't the easiest task, but if you stick to it, you can get the job done.                                                                                                                                                                                   Taking your time is a big part of being an archeologist. If you don't take   your time, you won't have the correct information for a informational piece. Without the right information, you could easily lose your job. Sometimes people feel like they have the need to rush, but that's not true. If you don't rush life would be a lot easier and safer.                             Studying hard is also a big part of this job. If you didn't study hard you     would again have all of your facts mixed up. If your facts aren't right you are the one to blame if people copy your wrong facts down. When studying, make sure you slow down and read carefully. If you don't, a big price could be payed.     When doing the archeologist job, don'tgive up. Giving up is like just giving up your house because you can't pay rent. That's why you don't rush. Rushing can get you frustrated very quickly.When doing your job take your time and don't get frustrated. In other words, NEVER GIVE UP!

Archeologists even uncover peoples houses, such as George Washshington's house or a house that he lived in when he was a child. Archeologists also uncover dinosaur bones and many other things. They also have teams, there are teams where people dig trenches or holes for other teams to use to discover in the trenches or holes. But to dig or uncover artifacts they use tools.                          Some of the tools they use are; a pick' a shovel, whisk, a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. The use a pick and a shovel to start out with for digging into the ground. They also use a whisk and a dustpan to brush away dirt off of an artifacts or to clear away some dirt from the site. They also use knives to scrape away dirt on they artifacts. Wheel barrows are used to carry dirt away from the site. A skim shovel is used to take off layers of soil with every scoop. A trowel is used to scrape or cut layers to see the different layers.                           Archeologists also use a 3D computer to track find artifacts or to see what is underground. The information is also recorded so the people know what it looked like before and after. Then another team focuses on the digging. This team use skim shovels to dig. These archeologists also use a process called troweling which is when you use trowel, a small shovel, paint brushes.they also use wooden picks to dig up dirt.                            Another team of archeologists work or spend days in a lab studdying the artifacts that were found. The whole process is really slow. But hey its worth it because then we wouldn't know what we found.

There were houses that were built by the water, so if there were intruders they could get their boats and find safety for a little while. People from England wanted to start a new life because they thought they had really good water.      We thought everyone died over the harsh winters because there were little food, but the truth is only a little died but a lot did not. Those who did not die had a hard time but hey eventually made it. Once the winter was over the men had fished for the colony.

Some of the artifacts that they found were weapons and armor. They also found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children. One way archaeologists could have used unusuall aritifacts, is by using them to make inventions.       In the article 'Digging up George Washington's Past' poeple found George Washington's house. I think people should put some of the things from George Washington's house in the museum so other people can see what things they used back then, and they can see how different they looked back then.       The things I think are most interesting are very old artifacts. I think that they are interesting because they can look very different then how things look now. For example: Nowadays, phones have flashights, cameras, games, music, and lots of different cool details. But then, lets say in the 1900's, the phones didn't even have flashights, or games, or any things that the phones we use today have. The old phones might only have a place for you to talk and a place for you to hear what the other person is saying. In my opinion, old artifacts can be very, very, very, very interesting.       One way people can use Picks by pounding on rocks to see what's inside. One way people can use a Shovel is to pick up the dirt and dig down deep to find different artifacts.       One way you can use a Whisk, is to dig the down in the dirt to. Well, you can also use it to sweep it into the Dustpan, then go empty it in the screen.       You can use a Knife to scrape of the dirt of a rock when you find one.       You can use a Wheelbarrow to put dirt into it, them empty it into the screen.       One way you can use a Skim Shovel is to remove thin layers of soil. One way you can use A Trowel, is to break big chunks of soil.       You can use many different things, in many different ways. And it can be very interesting.

The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologist,the name of scientist who study things from the past,armor and weapons.They discover the floors of some buildings.over 100 years later a group of archeologists effort to try to find the exact spot of fort James.National park services led a five year study of the fort to know how it was used.This would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.the people of the study used computers to make and image of what it would look like and the area.                      The archeologist finally found the fort and they first saw marks on the ground that showed where the forts walls use to be.All the stories they have read and the drawings they've made they knew the fort would be a triangle.They made maps and they found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.They have realized that there was stone ledges over the river.they where to hold the canoes.Archeologist found eleven cellars and buildings with in the walls of the fort.                            This was exciting for the archeologist to find these things and learn about are past.Because of the archeologist we know what we do to day.The archeologist found this fort and they found out more about are history.This gives them a piece of are past and they could learn more about are ancestors.The archeologist now know more about are history today.                             The archeologist also found some of George Washington past.They are trying to learn more about his childhood because we don't know much about his childhood.This is all changing historians now know more about him as a child because.Archeologist have been digging up his past and its called digging up George Washington's past.I'm going to tell how this dig all started.                          People lived on ferry farms for over 12,000 years.The location makes it a perfect place for a home and a family.Its not surprising that George Washington's father moved his family there.George Washington was only six years of age when his family moved there.                             They didn't know where the actual location of the Washington's home was located because the building was already long gone.Archeologist believed that the stone base under the house was still there.Archeologist started digging in 2003 this took over a year to dig up but they finally got it.They first found the kitchen,slave quarters,and the storage houses.They also found the main farmhouse a few years later.                              At leased four other houses were built on the ferry farm so they had to find proof that that was George Washington's home.They say George Washington house had a fire in their house.Diggers found burnt pieces of pottery.They suggested a fire was in this house.They also found a piece of a clay pipe inside of the house.They knew Washington smoked clay pipes so this gives them proof that this was Washington house.                    The process of digging at the ferry farm is a careful one.Every year teams will come and work on this site.There can be at lest 35 people on a team.The team first maps the site with there 3D computers that tracks what is under ground.They do so they know what it will look like before they start digging.There is a team that focuses on the actual digging this is called the dig.They start digging with a shovel called a skim shovel.These shovels are small,flat,and sharp and they can remove thin layers of soil.The soil is placed in a box with a half inch screen this lets the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in.Archeologist use a tool called a trowel.Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.It takes up to two weeks just to dig 25-square-foot section.Some teams spend days in the lab studying  the objects they found.It is a slow and tiresome job but its worth it.

An archeologist is someone who uses artifacts to study the past. Archeologists have a hard job to do.                     Archeologists have to be organized, careful, and use their time wisely to get their job done. It can take long times to complete a dig. First, a team will map the area using special devices so that they can see what is underground. This helps the people know what the area they are digging in looked like before they started digging. Then another team starts the actual digging. They start the dig with a special shovels which are very small, flat, and sharp. With these shovels they remove only small layers of dirt. Once they have that soil, they will put it in a box where the dirt will fall out while the artifacts stay in. Another thing they may do is troweling which is done with paint brushes, small shovels, and wooden picks. It can take two weeks to remove a twenty-five-square-foot area with troweling. Finally, a different team will study the things they found. It is a very slow process.                      Archeologists use many different tools. They will use a pick and shovel to dig down into the Earth. A whisk and dustpan are used to tidy up the artifacts or clear dirt from the dig-site. Also they will use a knife for careful digging and scrapping dirt of the artifacts found. A wheelbarrow is used to transport dirt or the artifacts to another place. Taking a thin layer of dirt is the skim shovel's job. A very common tool, the trowel, is used to scrape and cut so you can see the different layers of soil. Those are common tools used be archeologists.                      Archeologists have found artifacts in many different places. George Washington's house is one. They have found things there that have helped them learn new things about George Washington's life. It also helps us know about him before he became famous. Another place is James Fort. We now know about the settler's every day life and challenges.                      Archeologists are actually very important. They help us know what we know about history. They are more than just diggers.

There were platforms that were thought to hold cannons. There were several million items found such as toys, coins, tools, and pottery. The people in the fort were often attacked the Powhatan tribe. There were several rooms such as cellars. There were many graves. In all there were about ten buildings in the fort.   George Washington's home was thought to be gone forever but some archeologists discovered the spot where the house used to be.They found burnt pottery and also discovered that the house had burnt down.They knew this was the spot. they found more buildings later on. They found slave quarters, storage houses and other buildings. They found the main farm house later on.   Some archeological tools are used for most digs.

This topic was chosen because fifth grade is having history day. This text will say stuff about what archaeologists use to dig and what they found during some research.            Archaeologists dig up stuff from the past with tools like the pick and shovel. They also use stuff like the whisk and dustpan,  knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and the trowel. When they find something, they can infer what happened in the past. Sometimes, they even find stuff like old toys, pipes, and other very important stuff. Sometimes it can give us clues on what people learned in school. They also find stuff that give us clues to what the colonial people did at home. They are the keys to finding out stuff on very old famous people!            People think that James Fort was washed away by the river, only a corner was. Some people got a organization started called Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. It was started to discover the mysteries to James Fort. History says that it was built at the river so it would be easier to dock ships, but research says that only a corner was there. They dug and dug through the dirt, but nothing. It took over one-hundred years to find it, but they had found were James Fort was built. That shows how long they put effort into that. Especially how much patience they had.            Everyone wanted to know more about George Washington's past so they started digging at Ferry Farm in 2003. A few years later they had found the main farm house. They used a trowel to scape up the dirt and sifted it through a screen. They found a clay pipe. That let them know that he probably smoked clay pipes.The found pieces of burnt pottery. That confirmed that it was his house.               In conclusion, archaeologistts are very important to the world or we would have no clue what history was. They find stuff every day that leads to our an-sisters. Especially what they did for fun. Even for work.

I also think that it would be interesting. Thats just my opinion. Stick around and ill tell you why i think that.           The job of an archeologist would probably be hard. They have to do lots of research on things. I bet that they are really smart. They have to get down on hands and nees to work really hard. They have to focus really well too. When there done finding things they have to research it very well. Thats why I think being an archeologist would be hard.           The job of an archeologist would be interesting too. They get to find cool things from the past. They also get to go and look at peoples old houses and stuff from when they lived long ago. They also get to dig and use all types of interesting tools. When people lived long ago they had interesting thing that archeologist get to find now. If we didnt have archeologist we probably wouldnt have muesems. Thats why I think being an archeologist would be interesting.           Archeologist use alot of interesting tools. The pick and shovel is one. They dig with these. Another one is the wisk and dustpan. They use these to brush dirt off of things. Another one is the knife. It is used to scrape dirt off of things. Another one is the wheelbarrow. It is used to move items from one place to another. Another one is the skim shovel it is used to smooth out things. The last one is the trowel. It is used to scrape layers off of things.

It is the digging and looking for objects that have been buried over time.You will learn about two digs in particular. The James Fort dig and the George Washington childhood dig.                    This paragraph is about the James Fort dig. The first objects that were found were dug up in 1861. They uncovered weapons, and armor. After a 5 year study they found James Fort. the first thing they found were markings on the ground where the walls used to stand. Then they found ledges built over the river to hold cannons. they also found eleven cellars, and dozens of burial sites.                      This next part of the report is about  a George Washington Childhood dig. They found burnt clay pottery that suggested that there was a fire. They also found a part of clay pottery. They new that Washington smoked clay pipes, so that suggests  that Washington lived there. It took them two weeks to dig a 25 square-foot section of land.                       The archaeologists use a variation of tools to uncover artifacts. They use picks and shovels. These tools are used to start the dig by breaking into the dirt. They use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off of the artifacts. A knife is used for careful digging. They use a wheel barrow to move dirt and artifacts from one place to the next. They use a skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt away from the dig. They also use a trowel to scrap and cut to see different layers of soil.                           Archaeology has a lot to do with the uncovering of our history. It is important to keep organizing archaeological digs. We need to keep leaning about our history. Also we need to keep teaching about what was discovered on archaeological digs.

THE PROCESS OF DIGGING AT THE FERRY FARM IS A CAREFUL ONE. EACH YEAR, MANY TEAMS WILL WORK ON THE SITE. THERE CAN BE UP TO 35 PEOPLE ON A TEAM! THE FIST TEAM MAPS THE AREA USING THE 3D COMPUTERS THAT CAN TRACK WHAT IS UNDERGROUND. THE INFORMATION IS THERE SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. OTHER PEOPLE START TO DIG SO THEY CAN FIND STUFF TO.                                                THEY START TO DIG WITH A SKIM SHOVEL. YOU PROBPLY DON'T KNOW WAHT THAT IS. THAT IS A SHOVEL THAT HAS A BIG PART THAT YOU PUT IN THE GROUND. THE BIG PART LOOKS LIKE A RECTANGEL. THIS SHOVEL CAN PICK UP A LOT OF DIRT AT ONE TIME. THEY USE THIS SO THEY CAN GO FASTER AND GET IT DONE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY CAN'T DO THE GOB GOOD BECAUSE OF THE SHOVEL, BUT THE SHOVEL DOES A LOT OF WORK. THESE SHOVELS CAN GET A LOT DIRT AT ONE TIME. THE SOIL IS PUT INTO A BIG BOX THAT WILL KEEP THE SOIL IN A PLACE TO STAY AND NOT ON THE GROUND.                                              HERE IS ANOTHER TOOL THEY USE TO FIND STUFF IN THE DIRT. THEY USE A WHISK. THE WHISK WIPES AWAY THE DIRT ON THE GROUND. THEY USE THIS TOOL SO IF THERE IS SOMETHING UNDER THE DIRT THEN THEY WIPE AWAY THE DIRT. THIS IS A REALLY COOL TOOL BECAUSE IF YOU ARE PLAYING OUT SIDE AND YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT HAS DIRT ON IT AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT IT IS THEN YOU JUST GET THE WHISK AND WIPE OF THE DIRT AND THEN YOU HAVE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

I think it will be fun but boring to be an archeologist. There are several reasons why, about the job and the tools.                   First, archeologist is someone who discover something. Example of digging the ground to find a dinosaur's bones and fossils. And it's kind of associated with history, too. I think archeologist need to be patient and need a lot of effort and must be smart.                Second, there are many tools that archeologist use. There are Shovel, Whisk, Dustpan,   Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. Basically, Shovel is used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Knife is used for caregul digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one plave to another of to carry dirt away from the excavation site. And Trowel is the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                        Third, I think this job will be fun but kind of boring job for me. But really, I don't want to be an archeologist. Well, I don't like to dig the ground all day. And when if I find nothing? I will be very sad and I will give up this job. Also, I don't want to study of all the history and the tools that I use. So, it will be really boring when if I find nothing special and when I don't know anything about it. And I think this job is for Men, because it's too tiring. But, when I found a huge fossils and other things, I can be famous and I can be on TV, do interview and go to different country to found something. Then I will be really happy and it will be really fun to do that job.              In conclusion, I think being an Archeologist is fun when I'm famous. But I think it will be boring to me.

Each day many archeolohists go out in the hot sun trying to find out more about people thet lived 10s, 100s and 1000s years ago.

Archeology can be used to find out about historic peoples' lives. It can also be used to find out where someone or something is. Archeology can be a tough process. There are three main parts to it, determining who you want to learn about, finding the artifacts, and studying them.          Step 1, determing who you want to find out about, is probably the easiest part. You can learn about George Washington, Martin Luther King, or maybe Rosa Parks. You can look on a computer to research who you want to learn about, which might tell you a little bit about what you might find. If you dont have a computer, use a book. Then you can get on to the next step.          Step 2, digging, is the most tiresome part of the job. Most archeologists use a skim shovel to start. A skim shovel is a flat shovel that digs small layers of dirt at a time. Then they put the dirt in a wheel barrow to be examined. They then trowel through it with a trowel, or a pitch fork and make sure they didn't mis anything. Now to study!          Step 3, studying, will be the part all archeologists want: finding out about the artifacts. From your research, you might have discovered that your person likes to farm. If you found a hoe or a bucket, that might prove it. If you find a lot of tools, you might find out that they were a carpenter. If you are lucky your discovories will be important. Even if not, it still will be good to know that you tried! Maybe you will be the one to discover more about George Washington's childhood!

You will go to many places to find artifacts about what you are searching for. Here are some more facts about archeologist.                  There are many tools that a archeologist uses. They use a pick and shovel to start it with and then will use a wheelbarrow to carry the items away. They then will use a a skim shovel to take off thin layers of dirt. They will use the trowel the most so they can cut the soil to view it. They use the knife so they car push pieces of dirt off the artifacts.They will use a whisk and dustpan to carefully brush dirt off the artifact so it can be clean. Archeologist use many tools on there job.                   Being a archeologist is a hard job. You will use all you know to try to find the artifacts.

The archeologists use these tools for digging, moving dirt, and they use the whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and to clear dirt away. It is important when archeologists discover things. It helps people understand what things were like many years ago, and it helps scientists study how people lived  a long time ago. Archeologists find things by going through a process of digging. Each year, many teams will work on the site. There will be up to 35 people on a team. The first team maps out the area using 3D maps on a computer. Then, the other teams go where the information on the computer tells them to go, and they start digging.

The job of an archeologist is to find special artifacts to figure out other things that nobody knows. It is a hard job and it may be deadly in cases. You can look for anything find it and bring many tools with you. You must be very careful with the objects that you will find.       There are many artifacts you can find the most popular are dinosaur bones. as i sayed Once you find it will leed you on for a long time. You also must be careful if you find an artifact it might be really old or easy to break. You also can travel to very far places to find great artifacts. The most popular artifacts are    Bones Minerals Treasure Carvings on walls diamonds           Bones. There are many archeologists who colect bones for artifacts. Dinosaur bones ,Human Bones, and Animal Bones. Big or small, Wide or thin the are all hard to find. This is where it becomes a hard job. With metal detectors you cant find bones so you will have to dig in a certain place and be very lucky.       Minerals. They are much easier to find in ways. But you cant just pull them out of the ground they are on the walls of caves and they are really hard to pull out so thats why they use picks, to knock them out of there place. another hard thing is they could be huge. how are you going to get a pick and keep hitting a crystal bit by bit. You cant. Why this job is easy is because they can be tiny and out of place.       Treasure is much easier to find you can use a metal detector. Its also very valueable. you can find gold, money, diamond and much more. You can get many things in a short amount of time if your in the right place if not you can just find anything thats metal.       Diamonds are extremely rare they are found way far down in the ground and most of the time you wont even find it. Its really really hard to brake and almost most of the time you wont be able to break it. Although if you do break it and get it you will be popular.

These two materials are used to start out the search.        A whisk and dustpan are used to clear dirt off the artifact without harming the artifact.        A knife is used dig around artfacts and to scrape dirt off the artifact carefully.        Wheelbarrows are used to move items to one place to another carefully.   One skim shovel is used to scoop a very thin layer of dirt.   When you see someone use a trowel, this means they are trying to view the diffrent layers of dirt.

Archeologists look for thing in the past.  For example,the dinosaurs.  The archeologists have been studying dinosaur fossils for a long time.  In the museum there dinosaur fossils that make a dinosaur.  Archeologists find the fossils then they turn them in to scientists to see what bone it belongs to then they build it.                                             Archeologists spend there time finding things from the past.  So they try to find things in history from dinosaurs-now.  Archeologists went to Ferry Farm to see George Washington's house.  Only the base of the house was there.  None of the archeologists new were the Washington house was at.  They started digging in 2003.  The archeologists found the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.The archeologists found the farmhouse a few years later.  The archeologists were digging more to make sure that the house was George Washington's house.                   Archeologists found burnt pottery.  So the archeologists occur that there was a fire in the house.The archeologist knew George Washington smoked clay pipes.  So they gives more proof that it is the right house.  Each year many archeologists get put into teams.  The team have up to 35 people on there team.  The first team maps he area using 3D computers to see what is underground.

WHAT THEY DO       An acheologist is the kind of scientist who likes to 'dig' depper.   They discover artifacts of all kinds from tall caves, to deep oceans. Artifacts are objects from the past. Archeologist ue the artifacts to discover many things from our history. Such as, Gorge Washingtons old house, The exact spot were for jams was built, why the Titanic sank, and more! You might see all kinds of artifacts in local musems. Usually archeologist dig in  the ground or in ccaves to find what their searching for                                WHY ARCHEOLOGIST ARE IMPORTANT       Archeologist find artifacts that ckuld even answer some of the biggest questions of the wrold today. The artifacts they find gives us a little piece of what it was like for people, and any living thing a long time ago. Our children, and ourselves will be able to learn about htese artifacts and what it was like back then. Sometimes they find extinct animal bones or carcasses (if frozen in glaciers) from about 1,000,000+ years ago! Such as the Tyranasaurus, Saber Toothed tiger, Wooly Mammoth, Megalodon, and more. Its also good to know how the creatures of our world 'Evolved'. It gives us some ideas of what the animals of today might be capable of.                                             THE DANGERS THEY FACE        While at work, archeologist face many dangers no matter what terain their in. Some have even died from sickness, or injuries. Lets say your an archeologist on a mountain, digging ino its depths. its possible an avalanche could occur, you fall off, or an animal attacks you. Some tools are hazerdous has well. Such as the knife. We all know what would happen if somebodey accidentaly cut themselves. Some archeologist go on several year long journies to remote places. They might encounter an unknown disease that is uncureable.                                                           TOOLS USED        Arheologist use a number of tools for many reasons. here is a list of too,ls and why they use them.   Pick and Shovel: to usualy dig through dirt or rocks   Whisk and dustpan: To gently clear off dust from artifacts   Knife: Used for CAREFUL digging and for scraping off dirt from hard to reach places on an artifact.   Wheelebarrow: Used to move a number of items, or a big object from one place to another, or to move dirt/soil away from an excavation site   Skim shovel: A shovel with a square-like shape used to remove thin layers of soil with each scoop   Trowel: Used to scrabe away diffrent layers of soil.   These are just a small number of the most simple tools used for archeolagy. You might even own few of these tools.                                                      CONCLUSION       Its true that archeologist have a very tough job. They provide us with alot of knowlage of our history, and other facinating things from long ago. Next time you go to a musem amd see an old artifact, youll know who worked hard to find it. Archeologist face many dangers to find the objects, and usually have no success.

Those tools are a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.  Each of those tools have a special meaning.  For a pick and a shovel the meaning is when they first start to dig they use the pick and or shovel.  The meaning for the whisk and the dustpan is it's used to brush the dirt off the artifact that they found and to make it clear so they can see what it is.  The wheelbarrow is to move items from one place to another place or to carry dirt away from the site.  The skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.  Last but not least the trowel.

Or how we can learn from archeologists? Well, it is very interesting to be an archeologist, in my opinion, and it is very hard!         It's interesting and boring because of the things you might find. Some people have found remains of historical artifacts like walls of Fort James or broken pottery from George Washington's house. You could also find clothes and other things that people used back then. Who knows what you could find out there? Only time will tell! It could also be boring when you don't find anything for a while. You could dig up a large area of dirt and not find anything.         Archeologists used many types of tools for many different reasons. One tool that archeologists use most often is the 'whisk and dustpan.' These are used like a dustpan at home! You would use the whisk to clear off the dirt on the artifact. Then, the dirt would go into the dustpan. Picks and shovels are often used to start the search. They use the pick to chip away at the dirt. The shovel is used to move the dirt out of the area (most likely into the wheelbarrow). The knife is used for carefully scraping dirt off of the artifact. The wheelbarrow is just used for a simple transport of dirt to somewhere else; most likely away from the digging site. A skim shovel would be used for removing a thin layer of dirt from the earth. The most often tool on a digging site would be a trowel. This is just a smaller version of a shovel used for digging and to show the different layers of dirt.         If you have ever wondered what we could learn from archeology? Time to put that question to rest! We can learn a lot from archeologists! One example would be that we could find out what colonial life was like. Archeologists found George Washington's house that he lived in when he was a boy. They found burnt, broken pottery, which indicated that there was once a fire at George Washington's house. We have also found some remains of Fort James. Archeologists started digging up armor and weapons that would indicate that Fort James was built in that area. We can also see what it was like to live in Fort James, like several cellars, burial grounds, and toys for children, all in the same area.         As you can see, we could learn a lot from archeology and fro the people who dedicate their time to helpus learn about colonial life.

They have to plan out what they are trying to find, carefully and slowly follow the directions, and do research. Even when this tiring process is done, all your work will pay off.                   When archeologists want to find out more about something in the past, they get a team for the digging process and finding information. For them to find more about the past they have to do research on it just like the people did when they found Fort James. They have to know where the historical place was, what are they trying to find, and what happened to the historical place to start digging or looking for clues.                   When archeologists are ready and they have done there research, they look for clues to see where the historical place is.When archeologists were finding Fort james, the National Park Serice led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They used that information so they could know where to look for proof of the fort. That's what archeologist have to do to map out where the historical place is.                   When the archeologists find the historical place, they get their tools ready to dig. there are alot of tools they use on the site. Most archeologist start digging with a pick and shovel. They use it to dig in to the earth, close to the artifacts. Other main tools they use are whisk and dustpan ( to brush dirt off of the artifacts), knife ( used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifact), wheelbarrow ( used to move items from one place to another), skim shovel ( a shovel with a flat edge. It carefully remove thin layers of soil), and a trowel ( used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil).                    It takes years to accomplish your goal. Being an archeologist contains being patient. Your job is slow and tiresome so you have to be patient and steady.

Next, you must go to your selected place to dig, and get ready to get dirty! To get your dig started, you better get your pick and shovel. You can't really get into the earth any other way.        Remember, you can use a wheel barrow to carry the dirt away from th excavation site. Once you think you have found something in the dirt, use your skim shovel to remove any thin layers of the ground. You want to ruin your artifact.        If your artifact has dirt on it, you can use your knife scrape it off. Remember to put your artifact in a safe place before you start digging again.

Archeologists have a hard time finding artifacts sometimes. Archeologists take very long to find artifacts because they get tired from mining and working. They need all the tools or devices to find rare artifacts. Archeologist can find artifacts from somewhere where it is deserted, have mining tools,  have lots of hope of finding artifacts, and know about the artifacts they found.                 Archeologists can find artifacts from somewhere where it is deserted because they have devices that show if there are any artifacts underground. They mine for many days or even weeks just finding an artifact. Archeologists look for old yet rare things at that place. They even know if it is or is not deserted.                 Archeologists have a lot of mining tools to bring or find the artifact. They use the pickaxe and shovel to get underground, but the skim shovel and trowel help get rid of the soil faster. After the archeologists find the artifact, they use the knife to cut around the artifact. Archeologists also get the whisk and dustpan to clean the old dirty artifact, then they put it in the wheelbarrow if it is big.                 Archeologists don't give up very fast because they have hope. They don't care how long it takes but if they find the artifact. They might take breaks but after the break, they go and try to find it right away. Archeologists may take long time but they find it. Archeologists are like most kids, when kids lose, some give up, but some don't. Archeologists are like the kids that don't give up.                 Archeologists know what artifacts they found because they research about it. They must know about what they found or they will think it is junk. Archeologists research before they go on an expedition or they will think its for fun like a treasure hunt. Archaeologists may not know about artifacts sometimes but they could think its special for them.                Archeologist are people that studies about the past for artifacts. They have a hard time finding it sometimes. Archeologists have a fun job but it takes a lot of time to find even 1 artifact. Archeologists mine a lot of time just for maybe even 1 small tiny piece.

Some of the teams used a 3D computer thattracks what is underground so the crew members might know what it is without digging.

Some people do but if you don't their people who study the past, it could be about someone that was famous or just someone interesting that happened in the past. Just imagine some things you would have to do to be a archaeologist, for example you would have to dig artifacts up with different tools, find out when they got there, and who they came from and where they came from.                                                                                                                   My first reason is that if your'e an archaeologist you have to dig artifacts up with different tools. For example, you use a pick and shovel to dig into the Earth, close to the artifacts. Also you need to use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, another tool you use is a knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt off the surroundings of the artifact, you need a wheelbarrow for moving items from one place to the next, a skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil, and last you need a trowel to cut and scrape the layers of soil off the artifact. Wow, that's a lot of tools to keep track of. So if you become an archaeologist you'll need to be a skillful and careful worker.                         My second reason for being an archaeologist is you have to find out how the artifacts got there. For example, you might have to look on old maps to see if the artifact was there in that year if not they might have to look in books for any facts about the artifacts the archaeologists found. Many people might say  wow that looks hard but for them it's not that hard and it might only take a few weeks to figure the facts out.                       My last reason for being an archaeologist is you have to find out who they came from and where they came from. For example, they find some of this out by using 3D computers that can track where artifacts are. Thats my last reason for now.

In the time when James Fort was alive ( in the 1600's), people used to throw their trash down into an unused well or into a big pit. While digging the area  where Fort James used to be, the archeologists found  trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.                George Washington and James Fort are similar because they both had trash in a well, pit, or lying on the ground. They are also similar because they both have past and they both had archeologists come and examine their life time and how they lived.

There have been many important discoveries of important artifacts like finding Fort James and finding George Washington's childhood home. They also have many tools to dig up the past. There are many things to do if you are an archeologist.       One job the archeologists do is rediscovering old forts from the Revolutionary War like James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The Rediscovery Archaeological Project was ordered to find and rediscover the old James Fort. The fort was built in 1607 by English settlers. The archeologists found pieces of armor and weapons and the floor of the fort. They used computer mapping to find the exact location of the building.They made many maps of the fort.       Another job that many archeologists do is finding the homes or birthplaces of famous historians from all over the world. Many archeologists were interested in finding out more about George Washington's childhood. So they found the home that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family to when George was six years old. The location of the house is now known as Ferry Farm. Since the house was actually gone, many archeologists believed that the base of the house was still there. So they started digging in 2003, and found the house in 2004, a year later. They found the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage houses first. A few years later, they then found the main farmhouse.They had little proof that this really was the Washington household. They carefully used 3D computers to map the house out before the archeologists actually started digging.They also recorded what they found with the computer in the computer. They dug lightly and carefully and found the evidence they needed.       There are many tools that archeologists used to carefully dig up and move important artifacts. There are picks and shovels, which are used to dig into the Earth that is close to the artifact. A whisk and dustpan are used to dust dirt off of artifacts and pick up the dirt. A knife can be used to carefully dig and scrape dirt off of an artifact. A wheelbarrow is used to move artifacts or dirt to different places. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove thin layers of soil from the item. A trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut soil to see the different layers.       In conclusion, archeologists do have difficult jobs, but they are important to world history. They help uncover important discoveries all over the world. I want to thank them for all of the history they reveal.

They study items like gold, dinosaur bones, and even cave men! This started in 1994 when archeologists wanted to find Fort James. When they wanted to they needed more people so they started the Jamestowm Rediscovery Archaeological Project. This project was designed to find out all of the secrets in James Fort in Jamestown, Viginia. For more than 200 years some people thaught that the Fort was washed away in a river. Discoveries in the area where the fort was gave them a hint that it might still be there.                James Fort was built in 1607 when the British settlers came from England to start a new life. The reason James fort was built by a river is because it was much easier for the people to dock their ships. Some of the objects that they found nearby made it look like the fort was further away. They made a new spot so that the settlers could be more safe from the enemies.              The first items found of Fort James were found in 1861. When they found the first items they found weapons, armor, and floors of buildings. Over 100 years later a group decided to find out more secrets where Fort James was built again.               A National Park Service held a five year study of the area to find out how the land of Fort James was used. They knew this is where they had to look to find the proof of the fort. These people used doing this used a computer mapping of the area. Thats when they found James Fort!One of the very first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. After that they kept going and then they keep finding things!               All together, Finding James Fort was pretty hard to find but when you use teamwork nothing is impossible. Learning about archeologist was really fun! I hope that one day they find something else that is History.

The archeologists find millions of things each year.   The mysterious fort was thought to be washed away by a river, but recently they found it!             A National Park Service found James Fort because they spotted the marks on the ground where James fot used to be.  the archiologists knew that the fort woulgd be triangular.  When the archiologists looked around and dug a little bit, they found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites and ten buildings all in the fort range. they almost found a million things in 1 year.  They discovered that the people there dug a well or a big pit to throw away their trash.  They also discovered that the settlers got into war with the Powharan tribe.  The settlers also faced hunger and difficult times with the Powhatan attacking.

They try to help us understand history more and more.They uncover history as if it were hapenning out our front door. With the amazing discoveries they have made and more great ones to come they don't have an easy job. They have to get all the research about something, predict if needed, and start digging. But, I know that it is worth it.        The whole team of archeologists are working all the time. Scientists in labs are looking at and identifying the artifacts while others are finding them. Both procceses take a lot of time but with the help they need they can make something amazing.When it comes to history they have to be working as ghard as they can and giving their work one hundred percent. they know what they are working for.       Being an archeologist takes a lot of hard work and determination. They also use a lot of tools in their work such as a whisk, dustpan, pick, shovel, trowel, knife, skim shovel, and a wheel barrow. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off and clear away dirt from the excavation site and arifacts. A pick and shovel of course dig to get to the artifacts while a trowel scrapes and cuts to view different types of soil. A skim shovel has a flat edge that is used to carefully remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. Also, a knife is used to scrape dirt away from around the artifacts. Finally, a wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt away from the excavation site or carefully carry artifacts.       Lots of archeologists around the world are looking for answers to mysteries that have come. They might just want to get a little more information about something but, either way they are helping us discover and uncover these mysteries. Some of these include finding the place where George Washington grew up or unlocking the mystery of finding where the mysterious Fort James was or where it went. With all the work the have done we need to thank them for them letting us get a look at the past.

How do the archelogists find all these things? The process of digging on farms are carful ones. Each year many teams will work on them.       There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area  using a 3D computer that can track underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.       Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat and sharp they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets dirt fall out while artifacts stay in.       The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can to two weeks a dig a 25 square foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects found. The whole process is tresome, but it's worth it.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers from England came to start a new life. At first they thought that the fort was built near the water, so it was easier to dock ships. Later they found out that Jamestown was further away from water for protection from enemy ships.        In 1861 the first objects were discovered. The people were called, arceologists. They found armer, weapons, and valuable things. 100 years later they found the exact spot where the fort was.        The National Park Service led a five- year study on the area to figure out what the land was used for. The people studying used computer software to look at the images there.        That's when they found Jamestown!!! The things they found first were markings on the ground. The markings showed where the walls used to be. The arceologists discovered that Jamestown was in the shape of a triangle. They discovered that it stretched all the way to the river. They  realized that there were stone ledges to hold canons. The arceologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings in where Jamestown stood.        Today , the group finds about 1 million things a year. Such as pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys that kids used to play with. In the 1600s, people in Jamestown also through their garbage  down wells that they didn't use. The arceologists found some of their garbage, it was mostly bones from animals they ate. The information helps use understand how people lived back then. We now know how the settlers beat the indians that often attacked Jamestown. We also know how they survived those many years many years without that much food.        It must have been a big acomplishment finding Jamestown. Maybe someday you can be arceologist.   Part 2   The Discovery of Ferry Farm and George Washington        We all know that George Washington was a soldier and was the first president of the United States of  America or (U.S.A.). But something we do not know is his child hood.         We do know that he lived at Ferry Farm. The only thing is that there were four houses. They know there was a fire at his house. They also know that he smoked clay pipes which they found part of a clay pipe, so they have more proof that this is the right house. Now they know more about Washington's child hood.          Now you can be active by going to Ferry Farm, because there's many oppertunities for kids such as: workshops both indoor and outdoor activities. The kids can also experiance the life when the colonists lived, they can explore the sites, and become junior arceologists. Kids can also sign up for games, classes, and crafts. There's even a website!!!!! So come on down to Ferry Farm and enjoy the colonial life.

There job is to study objects from the past. And what kinds of things happened in the past. And they can uncover armor and weapons. And with George Washington  they believed that the stone base under the house was still there. And they started digging in 2003. It took over a year,but they finally found it.The first buildings they found were the kitchen,slave quarters, and storage houses.They found the main farmhouse a few years later. On the mission to dig up the farmhouse up to 35 people were on the team.       And now I am going to talk about their tools they were really cool one of them were a pick and a shovel.

It's used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.         And now two more pair of information about the tools. One is the knife it is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.

Archeologist were digging and searching for things. here are some thing that they used to help them they used a pick and shovel to dig for interesting things.They used a wisk and a dustpan to take dirt off the artifact.The most important things that you need are a wheel barrow that carries dirt away to another place for they could work,map of the place and a 3d computer.

An archeologist works by finding objects of  past people and studying the object. They find the artifacts by digging with a trowel,skim shovel, or pick and shovel. Once they dig far enough and they found artifacts they study them by what they are and what they were used for. They also have to find the location by using a map.       Then when they find the location they use a 3-D computer to see whats underground and when they get what is under they record it so the people that dig know what to find. They also work by having a team that works on locating where the digging will happen. Once they know where to dig they use a skim shovel to do most of the digging, a skim shovel is used to remove thin layers of soil.  After they dig all the way down and found an object they use a trowel to carefully scrape or cut most of the dirt off.  Also while digging they need to get all of the dirt out of the way so they use the wheelbarrow, while using the wheelbarrow they don't just use it for dirt but also to take an object back that is to big to carry.         While digging they would have to find clues about if it is the right location and is this really the persons place of memories. When archeologist dig they don't always use a skim shovel,  they don't always use it because once they get  close to the object they would start to use a pick and shovel but sometimes these tools are used for the beginning of most digs.  If you are thinking why they do all of this well here's why  they do it to find out more about the past and about the person so we can understand their life more.       Being an archeologists is hard because if they are looking for an object that is 100 years ago they need to find they exact spot for that object.  An archeologist also has to careful while digging because if they dig to low and somebody didn't know someone may fall in.  Also with  the tools they need to be careful cause the knife would be one that they need to be careful with cause someone may get hurt while digging with it or scraping dirt off with it.  They also need to be careful with the pick because if some dropped it  they may get knocked right out of the head.  An archeologist also has to be careful with all artifacts they find.       They have to be careful with artifacts cause some may be fragile and if they drop the artifact it may get ruined and then they can't study the artifact. So, that is how an archeologist would work.

If you're an archeologist you can find out more about a persons life, and their career. They could get hundreds of dollars being an archeologist. They could get money for doing this by finding rare items and selling them at public auctions and get money for them. It's their decision if they want to keep it, or give it up for money. The job of an archeologist is a special job because you can see a persons past. An archeologists is a person who loves the future and would like to find out more about a person.  An archeologists could even find out about and Native Americans that like about 1,000 years ago they don't just have to find out only about famous people. That is what is an archeologist is.         Two weeks worth of work            Every thing an archeologist does it takes them a while to do it. They would put like two weeks into working as an archeologist.  As said in the article Digging up George Washington's Past they found burnt clay pots so they think there was a fire in that house. That tells us more about the persons life already. That explains that it took them a while to figure out what happend at that house. When they find an artifact they would have to do research on the artifact. When your an archeologist you use many tools one is the shovel. the shovel is small so it take you along time to take a big piece of land. They also use whisk and dustpans. They use the whisk and dustpans for taking dirk off the artifact so they can see what it is. Now you know that the shovel is small so it would take a while to dig up a big chunk of land. Another tool is a skim shovel. they use skim shovels to take a lair of dirt off so they can see whats under the dirt and see if there is artifacts.       At the end           At the end they have to find out a lot information about what they found. Then they have to put it up for public auction or you can keep the artifact. That is when the might move to another person or stay to the same person and find out more about that person. The person can have proof that he found out something about his\her favorite person and or just a person. They could stop when they find an artifact  but they might be so happy that they might not want to stop.

Other days you'll just have to see for yourself.  Your job will have challenges but you will be achvieble.        You could find some facinating things.  From the 1800 to 1600 heck mabe even from the 1500.  Like in 1994 when archeologists found out that in 1607 fort  james was made by settelers to have a new better life.   History can be amazing.         This job can inform people.  You'll be suprised about the way people lived in the old times.  From toys to how much techonogly has grown.  Plus your artifacts may bring in some money as in khaching.  This job can uncover the history.          Archeologists have a rough job. They spend hours even days trying to find one artifact.  It takes time and effort.  Blood, sweat, and tears.This is a job that is tough and rough.          The job also has some advantage.  One thing you could find is Geogre Washington's old patroit uniform.  You could also find Abe Lincon's old hat.  These artifacts would give you a load of money.  These are the advantages of being an arceologists.           You'll have to have certain tools.  One tool yuo will use is the knife which cuts around artifacts without damging  them.  You will also use The skim shovel which removes one layer of soil in one scoop!  Finnaly to move items one place to another you use the wheelbarrel.  Those are important tools.

There are 3 main groups.  Group 1 does the mapping.  Group 2 does the digging.  Group 3 finally does the lab work and research.                     Mapping It Out                   Group 1 as I told you before so you should know that this group maps the site out. The map it out part is done using a 3D computer.  The reason archeologists do this is to show the diggers where to dig.  This to me means saving time for more exploration of the dig.  More exploration means more time to lengthen the part of ground dug in.  If you thought this group was awesome wait till you hear about group 2 the diggers.           The Dig                    The diggers, or group 2 as I like to call them or course by the name do the digging.  Digging requires experience you cant just walk over to a dig site and start digging.  With this experience the dig of a site weather it is of George Washington old farm house.  Or maybe even a dig of Fort James the dig takes 35 weeks give or take a few.  While digging the archeologists dig up a layer of soil or dirt or what ever and put it in a bucket with a 1/2 screen at the bottom.  The screen helps the dirt go out and the artifacts if any stay in.            Lab Work                     Finishing up the proses the 3rd group takes the artifacts and takes them to a lab.  At the lab they figure out what they are a part of and where they came from and sometimes what they were used for.  For example in the dig at Washington's old farm house they found a piece of old pipe.  The pipe suggested that Washington left it behind when he left.                          Reading this story really made me want to be an archeologist when I grow up but still maybe a marine biologist.

They thought that it was located at the river but then they realized that it was far away from the river to protect it from enemy ships.The first objects to ever be found was in 1861 they found armor, weapons, and the building floors.

Today they find around 1,000,000,000 items a year, they include tools, coins, mettle toys for children, and pottery.            During the 1600s, people threw there trash down a pit or dried up well. while digging they found one of these pits it had the bones of eaten animals in it.

All these jobs are stated here in this essay:                  First, an archeologist digs for artifacts. He/she uses tools like picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels to dig for artifacts under the ground very easily, and quickly!                  Next, an archeologist examines ground for the remains of any forts, or ancient houses. This relates to Fort James and George Washington's house. Archeologists looked for remains of these ancient places, found their locations, and then dug!                  Finally, an archeologist might use computers to plot where things are underground. This way, he/she will know what they will dig for, and what is under them. If a giant water pipe that can easily be cracked is under them, they won't dig under them and create a giant water fountain! Instead, they will use the computers to find where something of a high cost is hidden. This way, they have a higher chance of finding a valuable ancient artifact quickly.                  As you can see, these are all the jobs that an archeologist does at work. These jobs are digging for artifacts, examining the ground for remains, and using computers to generate graphs of things under the ground. all these qualities used together, along with patience makes a archeologist successful.

In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past of the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological project                        the project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, virginia. For over 200 years,                        people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. The first object was found in 1861 over 100 years                        later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.The first thing they found was a set of                        markers showed where the fort's walls used to be.It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by                        people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started                        the american colonies.they made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.Then they                        realized there were stones ledges bulit over the river.The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection                        from enemy ships.They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.The archaeologists                        also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.                                 Now you know how the fort james was discovered and jamestown too now you dont need to learn about the                        fort james, and the jamestown thing too i think with out the report i wouldn't know about the fort james, jamestown                        now  the story i mean the report was all about fort james and the jamestown all that was true things from the report                        now brag to your friends that you know about fort james and the jamestown.                                                                        ??

People have lived in the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000years.Its location makes it a perfect place to bulid a home.      it's not surprising because george's dad augustine washington, moved his family there. george was just six years old at that time.      No one knew exactly where the washington home was located since the actual buliding was no long gone. However archeologists      believed that the stone base under the house was still there.They started digging in 2003.It took over a year, but they finally found it.

If you are not being gentle and you found something it could break because its over 100 years or more. The most safest and gentle tools are a pick, a shovel, a whisk, dustpan, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.A pick and shovel gets you close to the object. A whisk and a dustpan clears the object and removes dirt. A knife is to scrape of the doirt and use for careful digging. A wheelbarrow could move items and carry dirt. a skim shovel has a flat edge so you can use to carefuly remove a thin layer of soil . A Trowel is use to scrape and cut layers of soil.                                                                                        It could take a long time when you are looking for something.

It toke a long time for the archaeologist to know the truth about the past.       For example it take archaeologist over 100 years to find James Fort exact area where the fort was built. Then they used computer mapping software to make an image of the area of the fort use to be. They found a marks on the ground, it showed where the fort's wall used to be.

Archeologist not only get to uncover dinosaur bones but they also get to uncover historical which I think is an amazing opportunity!                                                Being an archeologist isn't easy! I  am not an archeologist so I have no experience but I have read many articles on the hard work and precision you need to be able to uncover the past. Archeologist aren't the only ones who help bring back the past but they do play a major role. An archeologist must be very careful when digging up bones to be sure that none of the bones were snapped or broken. Some of the tools that the archeologist must use are a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. Most of the time when bones are found they need to be dusted or brushed off, that's where the precision comes to play.            Archeology isn't just digging up dinosaur bones! Archeologist have really amazing jobs, they not only look for dinosaur bones but sometimes they get to dig historical figures. Digging historical figures is a super precise job and not only does it take time and precision but it also takes patience. When they dig historical figures they need to be very careful that they do not rupture any wonderful artifacts. If any artifacts are ruined I have there is way to put to the bones back together, but I'm  pretty sure archeologist try for no bones to break. I think it's an amazing opportunity to be able to dig up a historical figure especially someone like George Washington. Finding the perfect spot wasn't that hard, but it's not always that easy.         An archeologist  uses tools everyday! When they use tools they have to make precise cuts and scrapes. Pick and Shovel, most digs start with pick and shovel because you have to make the first hole with the regular shovel unless you are only cutting off a very thin layer. Whisk and Dustpan, used to brush off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. Knife, used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow, used to move items from one place to another or to carry the dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel, a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Trowel, probably the most common used tool in archeology. used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.          If  you haven't noticed already archeology is a very big job! You get to learn new things and get to experience amazing opportunities. I think digging up historical figures is the best part! As you can see, being an archeologist is definitely not easy but with precision and patience you'll enjoy it!

The first thing that archeaologists have to do is find the right spot. They can do this by looking for an anchent place. They also need to get everything to that place and find out exactly where to dig so they can start the dig.They also use a high tehc 3D computer to map out the area that they are at and it can also see whats under the ground.       Next they have to get all of the right tools for the dig before they start. They have to have a pick and shovel so they candig into the ground close to the artifacts,a whisk and dustpan to clear away dirt on the artifact and from the site,a knife used to carfaly to get dirt out of all the noocs and cranes, a wheelbarrow to cary heavy artifacts,a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of the earth near the artifact,and a trowel to scrap and cut to see the different layers of the earth.

This location makes a perfect place to build a home. So, it is not suprising that     Augustine Washington, Washington&acute;s farther moved there. Since at least four other houses  have been built on the Ferry Farm, archeologist have to find proof that Washington and his family were living there at a time.           Records show that the Washingtons had a fire in their house. To prove that,    Archeologist found piecies of burnt pottery. The diggers also found piecies to clay pipes. We know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so that gives more proof that it is the right house.           The discovery of Washington&acute;s home is very improtant to many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who                  George Washington was before he became our first president. We also begin to know why he made the decsions he did. Another thing is it histortians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. Alll of these things are the key parts of our past of Americans.

You have to find out where the right place is where you have to dig.  Then, you map out the are to make sure it is the right place.  After that, you have to start digging until you find artifacts.  When you found some artifacts you have to dig around them careefully to make sure the atifact doesn't break.  Then, you carefully take it out and take a whisk and start to brush dirt off the artifact carefully.            When you are done with that you give the artifact to another archeologist and they will take it somewhere.  After you find another artifact you take a knife to carefully dig around the artifact to get it out.  When you get it out you take a whisk and clean it.  Once you are done with that you have to take all the artifacts and make sure all the dirt is off it.  Then you take all off them to a plce where people put them in a museum.

Archeologists use many different tools to help them find things. There are picks and shovels, whisks and dust pans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels and trowels.

One cool thing they have found is Gorge Washington's house. They had to dig for a long time to uncover this historical place.

Archeologist have an important roll in fing history about places.They dig up atfifacts from the past.They often do jobs that are discovering something from the past. They have to use certain tools and procedures when finding artifacts.               Archeologist use many tools. The most important one is the skim shovel. The skim shovel allows them to dig up very thin layers of soilm at a time. A wisk and dust pan are very useful when digging. If you find an artifact the wisk and dust pan are used to brush of the excess dirt of an artifact. The trowel is one of the most common tool in acheology. It is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. The other tools are the wheelbarrow, a pick and shovel and a knife.                In archeology their are many important tasks to get the job done right. There are two different 'teams' in archeology. One team maps they area digging on a 3-D computer that can track underground. That team also figures out what to look for before the digging starts. Another team does the actual digging. They start their job using a skim shovel. If the archeologist come about an artifact the soil it is in will be placed in a wooden box with a half inch screen at they bottom of it. That allows dirt to fall through and the artifact stay in the box.This is when they use a paint bruch, small shovels and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifact.

Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sence that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearly suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably from enemy ships.The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons.

Archeologist are important in the world because they help us learn about history.     Archeologist find artifacts on different things.Archeologist work at different places from long ago to find information on back a long time ago.This informational report is going to tell about the job of an Archeologist.           Long ago a group of people were interested in studying the past start of different areas which was the Archaeological Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of different areas from long ago.Archeologist are the people to go and look for different things from long ago and study the past time.Archeologist go and search for things like old clothing,homes,and more of things from American history.Archeologist thinks it is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.           Archeologist work at different places that they go to find materials.From along ago people may have put some things in the ground so Archeologist go and work by digging up dirt to find materials.When Archeologist discover materials from long ago it is also very important to them because they had to work hard to find those things.When Archeologist work they help historians learn about the tpye of life Americans lived.Everything that an Archeologist works for are key parts of our past of Americans.           Americans should be very proud of Archeologist because if it was not for them then we could not know a lot about history now.Archeologist help us Americans a lot by discovering old materials.Archeologist work very hard when they find things from long ago to help us learn.When Archeologist discover things they also learn too because they might not have known some facts about a person and when they find things themselves then they learn more.Archeololgist find very interesting artifacts on Americans long ago.

In this report I will be discussing the job of an archeologist. The job of an archeologist is difficult, but can be very interesting. An archeologist uses many tools and has to know how to use all of them and to do their job.          The job of an archeologist is very difficult. For example it may take years to excavate one dig.An example of this is when the James Fort was being excavated, it took over five years. Another difficulty of being an archeologist is that you have to work very carefully. An archeologist must also work very hard digging and looking. Archeologists have to be very smart, because they need to be able to date things, to know how to map their surroundings,and many more things. These are some of the things that make being an archeologist so difficult.          Although an archeologist's job is hard it is also very interesting. An example of how an archeologist's job is interesting is when they make an amazing find. An archeologist gets to meet many different people and go many places, which can make their job very interesting. May we not leave out the things that archeologists find that have changed history. These are some of the many interesting parts of being an archeologist.         An archeologist uses many tools and does many things. The one thing archeologists are known for is digging, but they do a lot more than dig. An archeologist dates things, has to talk about what they find, and a lot of other things. An archeologist uses many tools here are some of them a pick, a shovel, a whisk, a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, a trowel, and many other things. These are the tools and some of the things an archeologist does.        In this report I talked about the job of an archeologist. I talked about how difficult and interesting an archeologists job is. I also talked about the things an archeologist does. I lastly talked about the tools an archeologist uses. I hope You enjoyed my report on the job of an archeologist.

WHAT ARE ARCHEOLOGISTS           Archeologists are people who find artifacts from history. In two sorces that I read I found out that they have found many important artifacts in history. If we did not have archeologists we would not know about what dinosores look like or important information that we know today. So that is why I am going to tell you know.       WHY ARE ARCHEOLOGISTS SO SLOW           Archeologists are not slow they are careful. I they were not they could break important artifacts or hurt themselfs. The tools archeologists use are sharp and could hurt them easily. And because they are so sharp they could also break thier artifacts. This explains why thier jobs are boring. They just sit there and work on something that may take months to uncover.

Many imporiant things have been found over the years by Archeologists, but how do they find these things I mean they can't just be laying on the ground super  easy to see! So Archeologist have to use special tools. For example they use a skim shovel, a skim shovel has a flat edge meant to remove one layer of dirt at a time. This helps with finding artfacts hidden under the dirt. They also use a whisk and a dustpan which they can use to brush little pieces of dirt off at a time.           If you want to be an archeologist you better be ready to get dirty because almost all of the artfacts will be underground so don't wear your nice clothes!

An archeologist is a person who finds artifacts about things like life back in the day.Archeologists also finds bones from what is now dinosaurs they brush them off carefully then bring it to a museum for people to see.                First, we need to see what they do and what the teams are? The archeologist comes in teams of 35 people and the teams try to figure out where the bones are.Some tools they use is the pick and the shovel, the whisk and dust pan, the knife,and etc.The pick and the shovel are used for digging up the earth to get close to the artifact the whisk and the dust pan is used to brush the dirt off of the artifact and finally the knife is used to scrape the dirt off of the artifact.                Secondly, One team of archeologist get the artifacts by a 3-D computer and it tells them what is under the ground then it is recorded so they know where it is! The other team does the digging and they are called the dig team. A fact is that the team that digs, it can take up to a week to dig a 25-square foot section!                 Thirdly, after the digging team digs the dirt the other team study's the dirt this process is long and tiring but it is worth the try because if they do not study it they can miss something that is very important and mess  up the whole process by just doing that.
