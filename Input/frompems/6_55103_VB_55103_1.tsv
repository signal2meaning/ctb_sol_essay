Miners,doctors and robots that picks fruit are a example of jobs that have robots to help them out on the job. I think the robot named the Gemini-scout is one of the best robots to have on the job.             The Gemini-scout is the best robot to me because it rescues miners that are hurt and need to get to safety. I also think that they are important because if it wasn't for the robots some of the miners today might have been killed. Speaking of saving lifes some robots benifiet on the job of being a doctor.            The robot Mr. Grower is another special robot because it helps bring medicine to the doctor and to the nurse. Mr. Grower is like a cabinet on wheels to some doctors. the other ability that Mr. Grower has is that he can also communicate with the doctors.Mr. Grower is a strong robot he can carry up to 500 pounds. The last robot helps farmers on their farm.            The robot Agribots have the speacial ability to pick fruits for farmers. In Massachusetts Institute scientist are making a green houses for these robots to work at and pick the fruit because they do it so well. When the robot, Agribots, sense the fruit is ripe it will pick it and if it is dry it will water it. i think robots really benifiet in our daily life.            These scientist are doing a very good making all these smart robots like the Gemini-scout and Mr. Grower and also the Agribots. the robots are very useful to farmers, miners and doctors. these robots all have some speacial abilities to do certain task.I think these robots are very useful in our daily life.

This story of how the Bobot became to be my best creation... or nightmare... I had been working on a powerful Bobot project. I was in charge of the programming of Bobot. However, my little mistake cost a lot of trouble... AND I mean a lot of trouble.             It was the year of  5-12-1989, Cancun, Mexico. I was excited because to day was Bobot's reveal to the public. Unfortunately, I had forgottten to insert the no-evil programming inside of him ! The lack of that programming was going to cause him to go on an evil outrage! So when the power was turned on, Bobot's uproar began! His hammering arms slammed into the ground killing thousands. Even worse, he released an inferno out of his flamethrowers as well, incinerating everything in the process. My colleagues glared at me because I was the one who forgot include the no-evil programming. I chuckled sheepishly. To stop Bobot's thrash, I needed the selfdestruct remote. I raced to the Lab to get it. I pressed the huge, red, button and flares of oil and fire exploded as Bobot was destroyed...             The good news was that Bobot's rampage came to a halt. The bad news was: We had lost Bobot, thousands of people perished, and their was a lot of destruction me and my colleagues had to pay for. I groaned. This was going to take a lifetime's work to pay off the mess Bobot caused...

Once Joes parents put him to sleep they decided to get him a present for Christmas. They decided he was old enough to take care of him self on his own while they bought him a present so they wrote a note and left.Joe was sleeping happily in his bed dreaming about a toy robot he wanted. All of a sudden a loud crashing soud a though something bad happened. he called for r his parents but there was no reply so he got out of bed to check what happened.He saw his parents note and began to became scared. if his parent hadn't made that crash noise who did! Out of no where a robotic voice said greetings.Joe jumped in surprisment for 2c( the robot joe wanted) was life size standing in Joes kitchen.The robot briefly told Joe how he got there and then he told Joe why he had come.he told joe that he had only come here because freum( the land Joe was from) was under attack by space monsters.The robot then told Joe that if he did not come to help get rid of the space monsters he would have to become replaced with another person and Joe would be locked up.Joe decided that either way he went their would be trouble he decided to help 2c.2c started the space ship that was parked on Joe lawn and they began lift off.On the ride Joe asked 2c why out of all the people in the world choose me. 2c had a simple reply of you will find out later.       when Joe and 2c reached Freum Joe was crowded from aliens and robots who wanted to see what a person looked like.A couple minutes later Joe meet his trainer. Joes trainers name was 3b. once they got to know each other they became good friends. When Joe started training it was harder than he thought it would be. he kept getting knocker over,bruised and hit with the training weapons. After months of training Joe became a fierce warrior and was finally ready to fight the space monsters.Right before battle Joe remembered his home and his parent and he missed them.He didn't want to go and fight right now he wanted to tell his parent that he would be safe.Joe asked 3b if he would ever be able to see his parents again and 3b exclaimed 'of course man ,as long as you live through this war!'Joe suddenly became very afraid but when the fighting started he was just dogging weapons and running not using any of the training he learned from 3b.When hoe thought he was on a safe cabin he saw 3b fall from the sky dead.he suddenly felt rage and began attacking all the space monsters.when the war finally died down Joe was tired and wanted to go home and sleep. 2c took Joe home at around 12 and joe saw that no one was home.he decided to leave a note and go to bed.When Joe woke up his parents were waiting for him down stairs.He was fluttered by presents but his parents didn't seem to miss him. he told them that he was sorry about being away for months and they simply said ' Joe it Christmas morning' 'we only went to the store to buy you some presents.'Joe thought it was just a dream and he happily opened his presents.when he finally got to the last present it said from: 2c to: Joe when Joe saw what was on the inside he almost fainted it was a real mini robot that worked. it walked,and talked, and he ever could open and close his hands.Joe kept that present in a safe spot and kept it fro the rest of his life.       the end 	RB DT JJ NN RB DT RB JJ NN NNP NNP JJ NN VBD IN NNP NNP VBZ NNP NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP TO VB PRP VBD TO VB PRP DT NN IN NNP NNP VBD PRP VBD JJ RB TO VB NN IN PRP PRP IN PRP$ JJ IN PRP VBD PRP DT NN IN PRP VBD DT NN CC JJ VBD VBG RB IN PRP$ VBN VBG IN DT NN NN PRP NNP NNP IN DT JJ DT NN VBG NN DT JJ NN JJ NNP PRP VBD IN NN PRP$ NNS CC EX VBD DT RB RB PRP VBD RP IN VBN TO VB WP -NONE- VBD PRP$ NNS VBP CC VBD TO VB NNP IN PRP$ NN VBD RB VBN IN JJ NN WP VBD .

That was what was going on back when I was a robot that came to life. Everybody was making movies about them but know one noticed how real they were. My name is Grover and I am a robot. I don't do what you think I might do, I work with technology and yes that is me I create the graphics of your video games. You may not think but robots have a big roll in technology. To start us off I can talk, steer, create things, fix things and help people with things like viruses on their computers. If you did not know we only work when people believe in us.       Here in the studios of technology where I work we give people tours and when little kids come saying robots are not real i can't do my job until we make them say 'Robots are real!' Of course all we need to say is that I edit video games and there already loving me! Now I'll talk about my job. My body stores tools that I need for my job. When people call us on the phone saying 'My computer is having a virus' I can fix it. I am only 6 inches and I plug into the computer and collect information about why the computer is having a virus, all the ads that are popping up and more.       To create video games I get plugged into the computer as well and I have all of the cool editing tools. My buddy Jeremy (an actual human) created me and that is when I came to life. So Jeremy makes the designs but he can't do it without the help of me! What ever you can think of, any video game, that you can possibly think of, the graphics were done by me and Jeremy and thought of by Steve. Steve helped to create me but mostly Jeremy.       If you are interested how I came to life it was when Jeremy got tired of having to do all of this work. He went home one night and thought he could make a robot. 'Oh I have the best idea, I can't wait!' Jeremy shouted excitedly.   It took about 4 or 5 years to make me but he knew he could do it. He believed in himself. Jeremy got upset about me that it was taking so long until one day he finally tried me out and I worked. 'YES I got it, Finally i Can't wait!' He yelled. Jeremy was so excited to use me.       So now I am alive and I am working hard. People are very interested in me and I know I have to I have to keep up my work. Some kids think I am cool and others are scared of me. That is okay because not everybody is going to like me. I love working with Jeremy to make new video games for all of the kids that love video games. Next time you go to the Lego store make sure to check out my 3D Video sensor screen!

He brought it back to his house and was playing with it in his room. He had to leave for a few weeks so he said bye to Mr. Gower and left. The next day Mr. Gower starts glowing and he is making noises and starts talking. HE IS ALIVE!! He was programmed to work in hospitals, and help doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet with wheels. The body is a stack of locked drawers stored with medicine. Nurses and doctors unlock the drawers when medicine is needed for a patient. Mr. Gower can ride elevators, steer through hallways, and move things that get in the way.            This robot is so strong that it could pull 500 pounds. Mr. Gower runs on batteries, so he charges for two hhours and can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping. Mr. Gower can talk too. It can say, 'Calling elevator' or 'Your delivery is here.' Mr. Gower works for nurses and doctors and sometimes does their job so they can focus on more important tasks. After a few weeks working at the hospital Marcus comes back in his room to play with Mr. Gower but he was gone. His mom gets the newspaper and Mr. Gower is on the front cover. Marcus llooks at the picture and it looked like Mr. Gower was in the hospital He went in the room Mr. Gower worked at there he was. Marcus yelled, 'Come on Mr. Gower lets go home right now.'             But Mr. Gower couldn't leave. This was his job now and if he left he would leave many disappointed people. Marcus agreed with Mr. Gower and let him stay. Marcus would love to visit Mr. Gower one day. So he drove to visit Mr. Gower every day. When Marcus was old enough he got a job to become a doctor and he got the job! He got to work with Mr. Gower and all the other doctors and nurses. But the best part is that he got to meet snd sometimes play with Mr. Gower at work every day.

The robot is less than 2 feet tall and has wheels.  It can go up and down the stairs and can make? tight turns, and it can even roll through water.  The robot is small, but it is strong.  Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies.  It can even drag hurt people to safety.            Wherever it goes, Leo collects information.  For example, it tests the air for gases and then tells when the air is safe.  Leo also has a thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.  When Leo finds a trapped miner, the miner is usually trapped down under the ground so far that know one can reach the trapped miner.  The trapped miner always has his two-way radio with him because he might need to contact the rescue team.            The robot was built to be easy to use.  Its remote control is the same one that is used for some video games.  if you've ever played a video game,you may know how to use Gemini-Scout.  Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater.  Then the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the vents.  In the past, scientists could not learn as much about volcanoes, but Dante 2 is changing that.  Now scientists can study a volcano up close while they remain safe in their laboratories.  Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job---it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists.  Like a spider, this robot has eight legs.  This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano.  It is also built to survive very high heat.  When a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter, Dante goes instead.           Mr. Bower is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients.  Mr. Bower looks like a small cabinet on wheels.  The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine.  Nurses and doctors can the drawers when the medicine is needed.  Mr. Bower can go anywhere in the hospital.  It can ride elevators, steer through hallways, and move things that get in the way.  The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds.  Mr. Bower runs on batteries.  After charging for two hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.              An Agribot is a robot picks fruit.  It might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples.  Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do.  Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple.  Agribots come in all shapes and sizes.  Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks.  Others are able to move around on their own.  In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries.  This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.  Not only does it work long days, but he can talk.  It has been programmed to say hundreds of phrases.  For example, it can say,'Calling elevator' or 'Your delivery is here.'  Mr. Bower does work that doctors, pharmacists, and nurses used to do.  This allows them to focus on other important tasks. 	.

She wished desperately that there was a robot that could help her do the job for her as she eyed the dusty lump of metal that had a shape like a robot.  Miraculously, the clump of metal came to life and wheeled itself in front of Mrs. Peterson.  She jumped, and nervously asked, 'Who are you?'           The robot replied, 'I am Mr. Gower, a robot, here to help you do work that nurses and doctors do.'           'Oh, I see.  So there are robots that help around in hospitals.  How convenient!' Mrs. Peterson exclaimed with a smile, now not so suspicious.  She then ordered the robot to finish her duty for the rest of the day.           The next morning, Mrs. Peterson found Mr. Gower in the corner of a room not moving.  She gently shook the robot, but Mr. Gower still did not budge.  At last, Mrs. Peterson decided to finish her shift at the hospital without him.  When she arrived home late at night once again, a thought occurred to her, Doesn't Mr. Gower run on batteries?  Instantly, she was relieved.  She had forgotten that all robots needed to be recharged at the end of the day.  That meant her work load would be cut in half if Mr. Gower worked alongside her every day.            For the next couple of years, everything went smoothly as Mr. Gower worked with Mrs. Peterson at the hospital.  Mrs. Peterson was extremely content because her work was cut in half.  From then on, she lived happily ever after.

'MOM' he shouted 'What is it sweetie' said his mom 'My robot is gone, what am I going to do'!?       Alex and his mother showed up to the science fair with no robot.Alex's teacher asked to see his robot but Alex didn't have one, his teacher said 'well if that's the case then you have a F'. Alex was very disappointed about his grade but there was nothing he can do,so Alex and his mother walked around the science fair to see what other students came up with. One kid had a robot that cook his breakfast, lunch, and dinner, another kid had a robot that did his homework,a lot of students had a lot of great robots, but just looking at the other students robots it made Alex very upset.Alex and his mother left, about 15 to 20 minutes later a random robot walked into the science fair.       The robot walked up to Mr. Gomez and asked for Alex 'Oh, you just missed him,and who are you?' Mr. Gomez said ' I am Alex's robot' said the robot 'You don't look like a robot, you look like a human bean'said Mr Gomez well that must mean Alex did a great job on me,right'? said the Robot 'Yes' said Mr Gomez and the robot walked away ' Oh and can you tell Alex he has an A, please'said Mr Gomez 'sure' said the robot. And that's how Alex got an 'A'.

The guests were wining but the home team,the Lakers, were losing. So that night, I went to sleep sad and angry. When I woke up, I had a wierd feeling someone was watching me. Scared, I went to the kitchen for breakfast but there was no one there. I looked all around the house for my parents but they weren't there. Thinking I was in a dream, I hit myself really hard on the head. Sure enough I fainted. When I woke up I thought I saw a robot, but when I blinked a couple times I saw my parents looking at me like I was crazy. I was wierd because one moment I saw a robot the next I saw my parents.                 I got up and asked my parents whats for breakfast. At first I thought they said screws with oil but then they said cerial. When I was done, I went to my room to study for my social studies test. When I opened my book, I found a page that I have never seen before. It was about a boy facing a fleat of robots. It said he defeated them, but they keep coming back every one-hundred years. The page was written in 1908 and it was 2008 now!                When I went to school, everything was normal. Nothing seemed unnatural. But when I came home, My parents were acting wierd again.

Gemini-Scout is a robot that helps other people by doing searching and rescuing in mines under ground. The wierd thing is that it is less than two feet tall, so that means it can go up and down stairs, make an easy turn and most of all it can drag hurt people to saftey. The Gemini-Scout is so cool but once you think about it it can carry food, water, and other supplies. The Gemini-Scout goes with miners to check if there are any gases that can kill the miners and to ckeck if the air is good to breathe.                   2.  The Dante 2 is like a scientist that goes in volcanoes that looks for vents, or holes in the crater. The Dante 2 can stand to a very high heat for it not to melt. It also collects information about the volcano. The scientists feel really lucky for having the Dante 2 so they wont have to take a look for themselves.              3.  Mr. Gower is a robot that is in the hospitals that helps docters and nurses with their patients medicine. Mr. Gower looks like a stack of drawers but those drawers store medicine for patients, but only the docters can unlock the drawers to get medicine. The thing that got my attention is that it can carry about 500 pounds. The Mr. Gower runs on batteries, so it charges for two hours but its okay it works for twelve hours straight without stopping.

I think that science can help you by expanding your curiosity, helps you learn new things, but most importantly you can experiment with it.  We have grown into an age of discovery and knowledge, for example we have created robots, watches that can pick-up the internet, and machines that save lives.  All of them are all robots in their own way.        Robots are my topic if you haven't guessed.  On the behave of my topic here are some robots.  All robots have their very special talent here are some of the names, their is the  helpful Gemini-Scout, the scientific Dante 2, is always on the go Mr. Gower, plant-picking Agribots, the dancing machine HRP-4c, and the ill drive you anywhere Google Car.  Everyone can do something special from singing to picking your plants for you.        To me robots are so very fascinating, I mean seriously robots you can't not like them.  In my opinion robots have a personality their own little microcosm, all robots are special in a way. Robots are a new generation I think we will be having robots that can cure cancer, robots that play with you.  their are so many benefits to having thees machines 	PRP$ VBD IN NN VBZ DT RB NNP PRP VBP IN NN MD VB PRP IN VBG PRP$ NN , NNS PRP VBP JJ NNS , CC JJS RB PRP MD VB IN NNP NNP VBP VBN IN DT NN IN NN CC NN , IN NN PRP VBP VBN NNS , NNS WDT MD VB DT NN , CC NNS WDT VBP NNP NNP IN PRP VBP RB NNS IN PRP$ JJ NNP NNP VBP PRP$ JJ IN PRP VBP RB NNP NNP DT NN IN PRP$ JJ RB VBP DT NNP NNP NNS VBP PRP$ JJ JJ NN RB VBP DT IN DT NNS , PRP$ VBZ DT JJ NN , DT JJ NNP CD , VBZ RB IN DT NN NNP NNP , JJ NNS , DT NN NN NN , CC DT NN VBP PRP RB NNP NNP NNP MD VB NN JJ IN VBG TO VBG PRP$ NNS IN NNP TO PRP VBZ VBP RB RB VBG , PRP VBP RB NNS PRP MD RB RB VB NNP NNP PRP$ NN NNS VBP DT NN PRP$ JJ JJ NN , DT NNS VBP JJ IN DT NNP NNP VBP DT JJ NN PRP VBP PRP MD VB VBG NNS WDT MD VB NN , NNS WDT NN IN NNP PRP$ VBP RB JJ NNS TO VBG NNS NNS

The Agribot is a very cool robot it helps nurserys and hospitals bring medication toothers.That robot is very helpful to Hospitals.An Agribot is a vety inteligent robot for its system.its very hard to control a Agribot in the ways of scientist.And researchers are very suprised they made this robot.       The Gemini-Scout is a water reasercher it gathers stuff from under water discoveries. it can carry 500 pounds in weight. its carried underwater boats.This robot is a very rare robot to have.Theres a preview of this rare robot to have in your labrotory       The Dante2 is like a spider when it comes to dicoveries the Dante 2 is like a spider.Most people want these cause they clean,mow the lawn, and climb roffs.There also rarde to have as what you need in several things.

The head coordinator of the robotics class was Mr. Howwenski. His class was about to go to a championship game in Los Angles and his team had decided that every person was going to build a robot, so they could have a better and bigger chance of winning 1st place and getting the grand prize. Their teacher, Mr. Howwenskie and the whole team were all extremely excited for the championships because they have all been practicing for over three and a half years and they finally made it to the top and if they won this finial competition that would mean that they were number one.         Everybody on the team was almost done with their robots, everyone but John. For his only excuse was that he has been extremely busy and that he has been studying for his big exam.'The championships are next week,' Mr. Howwenski would tell John after every practice and John would always say the same thing,'I know, i am just to busy.' Until one day when John came to practice    Mr. Howwenski told John that if he did not finish his robot that he would be kicked off the team. Of course Mr. Howwenski didn't mean it but he thought that if he told him that he would get scared and actually make his robot because the championships were the next day and poor John hadn't even started hi while everybody else was already done and had time to spare. Time that really needed.        Later that night when John was going his dorm he got straight to work and started to build his robot. That day he did not leave his dorm once and didn't even go to the bathroom or take a break he just kept on working. Once it was midnight John decided to finally go to the  bathroom when as he entered he heard a loud thump! When he went to go and see what the loud noise was he realized that his robot was gone.

And i said:Its okay i guess and you kinda did scare me...a little.Robot:I am truly sorry! Me:Its ok  and its my fault for being such a chicken and how did you come to life?Robot:Oh well..i was made to be alive and i got cursed with something.Me: Oh well pkay then.Me and the robot went outside to play for a little bit,Eat something very yummy,and come back inside to rest a little and see what was on the Tv. The next morning my mom and dad came home and it was only 6:00 but it didn't really matter to me that it was early,I was just soo happy my mom and dad cam.Me:Mom,Dad,The robot can talk and its alive..Really!!Mom:That is ridiculous and I would never believe such a thing..That is not true and you were maybe sleeping and dreaming about it.Me Fine,maybe it was just a silly little dream.I went into my room to read to take my mind of of things.But then i saw it,the robot.It was just cleaning out my closet of clothes and puting it in the laundry basket and i only had 3 or 4 shirts that were dirty and i told the robot:What are you doing?Robot:Im just tring to orgaze some stuff around here.Me Oh okay then but don't come outside because i told my parents that you could talk but they just told me that i was maybe just dreaming about it.Robot:Oh well that is fine with me then!Me:Okay thank you by the way.Robot:You are welcome.    *The next day*    Me:Mom i was not dreaming at all!Please just believe me and see for yourself. Mom:Okay but just this once!Me and my mom go to my room were the robot was.Me:Mom...meet my robot.Robot:Hi there nice to meet you!Mom:AHHHH!!Me: MOM stay calm,its not going to hurt you but i felt the same way at first.Mom:O...kay... Sorry if i scared you robot.Robot:No its okay..I think im the one who should apoligize Sorry.Mom:Its okay...well kids lets go eat!And then we had a great time together.           1YEARS LATER       Mom:Honey I need to talk to you just for a little bit please.Me:Okay mother.As we walked to my room the robot was still cleaning dishes.Mom:Okay well we have to get rid of the robot you have right now.Me:Why?!Mom:Well its not good for us to just use the robot and and not make us do anythink.Me:Okay we will get rid of it but how do we convine the robot to leave the house?Mom:Well..we could take it back to the store that you got it from!Me:Okay then. Me and my mom walk back down the stairs and tell the robot we had to give her back to the store and just to give us spare time on our own.Robot:Okay i understand.Me:Okay then lets go back to the store and give you back to the man so other people will be able to bye you and love you to.Robot:okay lets go.Me,my mom,and the robot walked down the street to the robot store and told the man that we would like to give it back.Man:Okay well have a nice day.Me:Bye robot,I will miss you so much!As me and my mom left home,tears formed into my eyes and let the memories flow through and i watched as the robot i had started going far away as me and my mom walked.Me:Bye robot.

'Is it the cold?' I thought, 'No, it's always cold here in New York.'  I looked around my room.  Through the dim light of the moon, I saw the baby blue color of my walls, my wooden desk, and my robot, Mr. Gower, sleeping on my desk.  'Wait a minute... How can Mr. Gower sleep?  He's not even alive!'  At the sound of my voice, Mr. Gower woke up.  Excitement filled the room.  I jumped up, and ran up to him.                He seemed very happy to see me, and he said in his robotic voice, 'Hello Erin, nice to meet you.'  I was so excited and surprised that no words came out of my mouth.  All I could do was to stare at him, because my kindergarten teacher never told me the robot we made would come alive.                 When words finally came out of my mouth, questions spilled out, 'Hi Mr. Gower.  Why are you alive?  When did you come alive?  Where did you come from? and What...'              Mr. Gower cut me off, 'Please save the questions for tomorrow morning.  Let's go to sleep.  I am really tired.  And with that said, he fell backwards, snoring.  Almost paralyzed, I went back to bed.  I couldn't sleep, but somehow, I soon fell asleep.        The next morning, I woke up, and remembering Mr. Gower, I looked at my desk, but he was'nt there!  Thinking of what my parents would do if they found him, I jumped out of bed and ran downstairs.  Thankfully, I found him peacefully eating a bowl of cereal. 'Would you like to go to the hospital with me, Erin?' he asked.         'Why?' I asked, 'Are you sick?'        'No, I go there everyday to help the doctors and nurses bring medicine to the patients.'        'Cool!  I'll gladly go there with you.'  When we got to the hospital, I saw many doctors and nurses very busy.  However, when they saw Mr. Gower, all of them started calling him.  Mr. Gower went over to put batteries in himself, and started getting busy.  I watched as I sat in the waiting room, and thought, 'Wow, he seems very important here.'  That day, I realized that the future has arrived.            	PRP VBD NNP NNP NN IN VBN , CC PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN NN CC VBD PRP$ NNP NNP VBD NNP NNP PRP DT NN .

Some people might say that robots aren't that helpful or aren't that playful and can hurt people in the future. Well basically robots can help a lot. Robots can help with like business in the future and can like help with people that really need help.                Robots can be very helpful in the future, Nobody knows if robots can be good or bad. Robots are more then you think. Robots can be like a little kid's toy or be a grown up's helper. Robots can also be like somebody's best friend. So basically robots are more then what everybody thinks because they can be all kinds of stuff. It depends on how people invent the robot.                Having a robot as a helper or a friend id good because the robot could help with any problems, but having a robot as a enime is bad because robots can hurt you and it could have source of emotions but always make a robot as your friend not your enime.               If anybody has a robot as their enime it could do these things to you. First, it could hurt you in some way. Second, it could hurt the people you love. Last but not least, it could start a fight with somebody eles.              If anybody has a robot as their friend the robot could do these things. First, it could help you with whatever you need. Second, it could be noce to you and wouldn't hurt you in any kind of way. Last, it could be very helpful and nice to the people you really love.             So those are my reasons about what i think robots would be like in the future and how they would treat people if they were friend or a enime.

They pick strawberry is it different then picking an apple robots come in all shapes and sizes. Other robots are able to move around on their own. In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries.              In Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help at all!! They have created a greenhouse full of plants that are cared fir by small robots .When a robot sense that a tomato is ripe,it uses a mechanical arm to pick the tomato.Robots may seem unusual now,but one day they may be common on farms.While Nevada may be the first state to create a licensing system for self-driving cars, it wont be the last. When robots find the trapped miners,the miners can use it two-way radio to talk with the rescue team.          Grower can go anywhere in the hospital . It can ride elevators,steer through hallways,and move around things that get in the way.The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds.The robot Mr.Grower runs out of batteries .After charging for two hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.Not only does it work long days,but Mr.Grower does not work that doctors, pharmacists,and nurses used to do. this allows them to focus on other important tasks.

One robot can go up mountains and get info about volcanoes. A car can drive and park itself without a acident. A robot that carrys around medicane ,and a robot that saves live underground. One even picks fruit from trees. It is amaving to know how smart we are today and what we can make when you just think. My favorite robot is the car because it can help you drive through the night while you are sleeping on long car trips.      I think that it is amazing we have so many thing like robots.

One of the robots we use to help us is the Gemini-Scout.The Gemini-Scout does search-and-rescue work underground.This small robot carries supplies to miners such as food and water.When ever miners are hurt,this robot drag hurt people out of the way.The Gemini-Scout doesn't only help miners by doing those things.The Gemini-Scout mines to check the air and uses a thermal camera to find living things.These things that apply to the Gemini-Scout helps the miners in many ways.        Another robot that assist people is Mr.Gower,a robot assistant in hospitals.Mr.Gower is a nurse you would want to hire.It talks,it rides,it pushes things out of the way,and it is really strong.It carries drawers to store medicine for the doctors and nurses to use daily.After being charged for two hours it can assist a hospital for twelve hours nonstop.This would help patients and workers to do more important thing while Mr.Gower is programmed to do their minor work.         The last robot I will be talking about are Agribots.Agribots are future farmers that pick crops.These Agribots are reeally unique coming in all chapes and sizes.They use their programmed technology to move around and pick the fruits by using only their color!Some Agribots are being programmed right now to plant food in a greenhouse with no human help.This form of robot maybe unusual now,but it is our start to fresh foods         No wonder people think robots are the future technology.They do things for us that way we can do other things.These robots are intelligent and very useful for evrybody everywhere.These robots maybe our future helpers,but right now they aer just our minor helpers.

'Ahhhhhhh!!!' she scream frightened. Her robot was coming towards her and there was nothing she could do now. This is how it all started.                  Sam woke up on a Saturday morning and new she was late for her basketball game. She quickly got dressed and headed out to the court. 'Why are you so late?' her coach shouted at her. 'I'm sorry I woke up late,' she replied. 'Your robot will soon do something to you,' the coach replied. That got Sam really scared but she trusted her robot and new it would not do anything to her. The won the game and after the game was over Sam went to go play at her friend's house. She told her friend about what her coach had told her and her friend told her not to worry but Sam and her friend were both super worried.                    That night when Sam went to bed and it was all dark and gloomy, Sam got really scared. She was thinking about what her coach and her frind said bit she just couldn't get her mind off of it. Then, all of a sudden, her robot just came alive and started coming towards her. Sam was scared to death. 'My coach was right!' she screamed in horror. 'What are you going to do to me?' she shakily asked the robot. But the robot didn't say a word, instead it just started getting closer and closer. 'I can't take it anymore just do what you want to do with me already!' she said terrified. The the robot came even closer and closer and then it stared tickling her. All of a sudden Sam calmed down. She knew she could trust her robot not to do anything bad to her. Then Sam went to sleep and so did her robot.

Now its a year ago and the painting is done. Now I am trying to build the robot. There is a problem the robot in the picture thats was up on my wall is not there only the outside of my picture. I want to go find it but i couldent find it. Now I moved to a ranch and there i can make an other picture and build it. The robot i was trying to find i saw it at the corner but i didn't chase it. I made a remote control robot now and I called Bob to draw me an other robot picture. We have a remote control robot and a picture robot and it look similar.The next day I didn't see the robot in to picture but, it turned out it was a magical paper that turned real and Bob said it was jest 3-D.The next week i saw it walking and i cought it. I called Bob and he came right away and he said he bought that paper from 3-D paper but we wern't sure.          One year ago. The robots were old and hardly worked but I locked the picture robot in a cage. The remote control robot was still out there doing my chores. The picture robot had ran a way and never came back. Hopefuly i jest get rid of the robots and never have probloms.

It was really cool and it was big it took like five people to carry it. I dont know how he built that robot but he did. But one day he was hearing thing in the garge  and he called me up to come to his house so i did and we saw that his robot came alive. So i told him that we can not tell anybody about this. So i went back home and act like nothinhg happen. So the next morning i went back to his house and we went down in the garage and saw the robot.           When we saw the robot it looked werid like it wasnt real but that night it was real so me and my friend looked at eachother because we thought we was dreaming when we saw the robot come alive. So we closed our eyes and opend them and the robot still look werid. We left the garage and we went to go have fun and we gane back and the garage was a total mess. We knew something was wrong so we look at the robot to see what was wrong with it. It was nothing. We never found what was wrong with the robot so we just left it alone.        But we keep hearing things so we decide to sleep in the gargae and we kinda saw something new so we got up quitly and we saw the robot moving and we knew that he was real we just knew it so we cought him. The next night we did the samething and we saw him move again so we knew that nothing was wrong we wasnt seeing it. We told our parents and they didnt belie us so we took them to the garage and we showed them but the robot wasnt doing anything .                            So i had an idea me and my friend sleep in the garage and i decided to video tape the robot so we can so our parents. And the robot was moving and we stayed up all night and then the next mor ning we went and showed our parent and they were very shock b   because they always thought robot were fake.       So our parents told everybody they knew and they all came to my friends garage and they saw the robot and the were socked to so me and my friend was very happy and we showed our friends to and our teacher. We got a great score on the project so my friend was happy and i was happy for him.

He thought he was going to see her later...but than something happened.       Later on, Jo met up with his friends Annie, Alex, Rain and Fall. They all, friends, were in a creative writig club. Usely they did stupid stuff says so Annie. But Fall on the other hand, love it! She loved science too... One time this club promise that they would find something so grand, something so amazing, something that you couldnt even believe that has comed alive. Or even be helpful in the near future.       When this class was all done, they all walked home together. (Let me tell you how this all begin...) ' It was about three years ago when all five of them met. They live on SpringLake Loop. They all have been friends for quite a long time! They had made sectret club house and handshakes. Everything you could imagine friends do. They even started there own clubs, which is one there is this Creativing Writing Club...they made it up, it was there idea. Not even their parents know. They have always been friends and alwas will. '        But when they got half way to walking back to the neiborhood...there was a strange smell, and  a huge cloud of a dark gray, charkly smoke. Aand flying balls, hard rock, bright red, steaming...it was lava. Volcano, History blew up. Jo and his pantic, the didnt know what to do...go home, which was heading History or heading the oppitsite way, but they thought about every possible way. When they tryed to call their parents, their mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, but the powerlines were down. Fall was screaming and noody knew how to stop her, to calm her down. There was know possible way! The only thing they thought of was running...the Volcano was errupting, more and more! They ran forever, well it was for a long time. Finally they had came to a valley with a huge body of water, conneted to a beautiful, wide, calm, soothing, waterfall. Right next to it they found a cave. But it wasnt a cave would would want to sleep in...but that maybe could have been the case. It was deep dark, pitch black cave...no light was in it. At the farest distance. But at the time, it was the best they got. It was pouring rain at the time, almost about to hail! So it was Jo, than Alex, than Fall, than Rain, than little Annie. Huddling so close to each other...it was super chilly in the cave. They just wanted to stay dry...       Jo knew they needed a fire, or something that would keep them warm now and later in the night. Thinking about what all happen, so quick that they all were still processing their brains. Thinking about how they could loose their own mom or dad. And thinking, about what happen to their sibblings. Brothers, sisters...But than they thought about History, the volcano. They thought it would at least be done now...it had been like 5 hours! But they didnt want to risk the thought, or even seeing their own lives past before them.       13 hours later they woke up..it was a beautiful day, bright and shining! But it was a hard night for them, hearing drips off the ceiling of the cave, drip, drip. The were starving! Non of them really thought of a tragic like this would happen. later on, Jo thought about finding finding some cocmuts to eat. Cocuts are a thing where you can eat it or drink it, well not the counut it self, the milk. Once he found a cocnut tree he grabbed a cocnut for everyone. Trying to cut it open, which was very difficults for them...trying many times. Finally, one cracked open! It was juicy, delicous...but they had to share cause the others wouldnt open.        5 hours later, fall was scoping around the area...she has heared a radio, but it was very dim. Its was fuzzy, on and off. Than a voice can on! But than it went a way. She couldnt tell where it was coming from just that it was near her. She found where the niocew was, but she couldnt tell was it was. But she had to believe her eyes! it was a robot of some sort...shee had to go back and tel Jo and the others!       She ran right up too them and tolded them what she had found. It did like a million things, it had a two way radio...8 legs... was remote controll and had a camera too! Jo wondered ever long, he was wondering how long has it been here. but the strange thing was that it look like it was made out of gold something that weight a whole bunch! It was bright, shiny, and sparkled from every view. If it was real gold, it would be worth thousands and thousands of dollars.       3 days later,k the notice that volcano History had stop. It was a blue sky...no black clouds in the air. So they decided that they should go back home. They found their parents after a long hard time...they were about in tears! After that they introduce the robot to many people and later on there was more, and more of them! It was a great descovery...it was the new later future thing!                                                                 The End!

Pictures are made when you buy a camera and you go outdoors or you could do it in side either way and you take a pictures. You can take pictures of all things like your self,other people,plants, animals,kids,babys,your self,birds, and landscapes.There are many photos you can take in one minute. You could take almost 167 pictures in about one minute if you tryed.               Pictures are usally made when a girl or boy clikes a butten on a camera.It would be on the left hand side all the way up.Also pictures can be amazingly pretty. You could be a photogaraer and take pictures of dogs,cats,kids,people,anything that you could think of.But being a photoagarer can be hard .And if you dont make your prices low you will not get as much cutomes as you thought you would get when you started.                   Also if you think about it you have alot of photos you have to do.Plus in the middle of the night like at lets say 11 pm you could be at takeing some pictures of some dog. But back in the old days they had to use so water to see the pictures. Plus they had to be in a red room and the pictures would take only like 10 minutes for just one to be done.but takeing pictures could be hard.                       You could be standing out in 20 bellow in the cold and take a family picture. But the shapes and the prettyness of pictures are amazing and heart warming if you get a good person to do it. And you can also have good or bad people do your pictures.They could rasie the prices but you know what it can do is  go up and down and up and down. And you could go from michigan to goegia just to take like 30 pictures of one person.                       You could be one or not it all debeis on the way you go in your life. And you could take pictures for the rest of your life you dont know.You could have your only placse to take pictures at. But you are the one you gets the chosse. Your the one who desides.

Everyone would probably agree with me because if your bored sometimes then you can ask if there any robots to do something the robots are supposed to take orders from you so they we'll have to listen to you and do what you say.     Also if you cant talk to people that much you can talk to your robot also in the passage the robots/cars can drive themselves so people who think its cool to drink and drive which it's not no one would crash into each other if the person is hurt like something big and know one can drive them have your car drive you then you wouldn't need to drive your self to where ever you are going.   What I also think is that you can ask the robot to tell your child to learn how to drive a car if you want them to drive them selves you can just ask and I know that maybe some parents may have a problem thinking that the robots does not need to the robot what to do and think oh we can do that ourselves and we don't need it and we can do better than that and no offenses but I don't think we can because look at how many things have robots in them.   Cars phones t.v. calculator imagine all of that gone and i think that we should have more robots to help us do things better in life we should be grateful hat we have these things alot of places do not have stuff that we have now that shows how lucky we are. we are lucky for many diffrent things but we would be even more if we try my idea.   That's why I think that we should have more robots to help people. so many robots help people with modern day stuff technology is advancing so why cant we? we made need these thing to help us who knows what would happen then we would never know its like what people say if you want to do something just try it because if you don't then maybe if you did it could have helped so many people so just try it for once at least once and I hope you enjoy it.

Have you ever wish you had someone to help you? Well, robots are now becoming more popular. They can play with you, and even save your life! Robots can go inside a volcano and find craters, send images to the scientists, and tell when the volcano will erupt. Robots also can go inside mineshaft and rescue people or bring food, water, and other supplies. They also help doctors by bringing medicine to the doctors so they can focus on important tasks.       Driving Robots         Have you ever wondered what its like to sit back and relax while you are driving? Well now scientist  are making cars that drive all around and you don't have to touch the steering wheel! They can see much better than humans can see when driving a car. This idea is safer because you don't have to keep your eyes on the road and you can text and call while driving. There have been hundreds of incidents from people dieing or having serious injuries. Scientist think that this is a safer way to drive.       Conclusion           In conclusion I think that having robots all over the world will be a big help. People will have easier life's than they do now. This of course, will happen in the future. So be prepared, it will be a wonderful time! 	NNS TO DT NNP .

It does research and rescue work in mines under the ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it can even roll through water. The robot is small, but it is strong. Gemini-Scout collects information. For example, it tests the air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe.               Another robot has an interesting job. This robot is called Dante 2. It climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. Like a spider, Dante 2 has eight legs. This robot is a very fast climber. It is different from other robots. Talk about fast climber! It can tell scientists whats in the volcanoes, and/or what they do in the inside. Scientists can now study an up-close volcano. Isn't that cool?               Now, this robot is very helpful. It works in hospitals, and it helps doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. This robot is called Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is really needed. It can ride elevators, steer though hallways, and move things that get in the way. Not only does it work long days, but Mr. Gower can talk. It has been programmed to say hundreds of phrases. It can say 'Calling elevator' or 'Your delivery is here.' Mr. Gower does work that doctors, pharmasists, and nurses used to do. This allows them to focus on other important tasks.               This robot is also helpful. It picks fruit, and this robot is called an Agribot. Agribots are not yet wisely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some even have giant arms that are towed behind trucks. The agribots are like robot farmers. They pick up the fruit, and bring it to the farmer.                Now, the last robot is very, very cool. These robots are called 'Playful Robots.' Robots can, believe it or not, be just like animals, they can even act like them! There is one difference, though. You don't have to take them outside or feed them! Some robots can even play all by themselves. Students in Oregon have created robots that can play hockey or shuffleboard on their own. All year, it takes students hours, and hours to work on robots everyday. The robots can grab the puck, turn, twist, and compete to score. In the final test, the robots must push the puck to the goal without being told what to do.

It can sing, dance, cook, and so mush more. Then one day he realized that his days where coming to an end, and he wanted the robot to be in the hands of someone that he knew would not abuse it. That is when he made his choice to give it to his loving grandson named Billy. Billy was 13 and did not know how to use the robot, but did know about the robot and was determined to figure out how to use it. So that is just what he did             It had been 12 years from when he had gotten the robot from his, now dead, grandpa and he had just figured out how to use it. The robot was not difficult to use, but there was one complication that stood in his way. The robot came to life. The robot did not like to fallow its orders, but it wanted to be a normal human like Bill. The robot tried to do regular human activities, but always got laughed at when it failed.             Yet the robot never gave up, it just kept trying and trying all day and all night. Then one night the robot thought about looking in its memory banks for information about Bill and his grandpa. Once he did that he copied their activities and with the help of bill started to turn in to a human. then after years and years of practice and work you could never tell that the robot was a human.

So tomorrow I went to the junk yard and found some stuff to make a robot.  I brought the stuff home and started to build the robot.  Then when it was done I said, 'It took a long time but I'm done now'.  The next day I was still in bed when I heard something talking.  Then when I opened my eyes I saw is was something walking around my room.  I thought it was my mom or my brothers or sisters but when it talk it sound really weird.  Right then I jumped out of bed and then there it was my robot that was walking around my room and it made a huge mess it pulled out all of my clothes.  Then I went to it and grabbed it and I just looked at it then it said, 'Hello I'm a robot and I'm alive.'  Then I said, 'I can tell but how did you come to life.'  Then it just shrugged.  Then I just took it to my family and I said, 'What am I suppose to do with it now.'  Then Jeffery said, 'Hello I'm a robot.' Then they just said keep him. It was pretty hard to figure out what he was going to eat because he is a robot and I didn't know what robots eat so I ask him. He said he eats junk. Then every day I brought him junk everyday.  Then after that day forward me and Jeffery were best friends.

When he opened his eyes it was just his parents taking a picture. 'Merry Christmas', they said. Mom dad i`m 15 now, i can wake up by myself. Come downstairs. Fifteen more minutes please. My parents walked out of my room with a grin.      As i went downstairs I noticed a box about as tall as me it was normal size but tall. I ran the rest of the way down the steps and jumped on the couch.      Can I open it? My parents nodded. I jumped up grabbed the wrapping paper with both of my hands and ripped off the wrapping. It was just a big brown box.      When i opened the large brown box all i saw was a piece of paper and a shovel. My dad asked if I liked it, yes i answered unsuringly.   What is it, I asked. My dad explained there was a story that goes with it that he heard at work. There was some sort of treasure out in the forest of hands.      About three hours later i called my friend Drake to come over and help me find this treasure my dad was talking about. Drake and his girlfriend Natalie both came over to help me find the treasure. We were digging for about five days until finally Drake was digging far away and he yelled 'I found something'!     Natalie and I both ran over to where Drake was and we were digging around the object to try and see what it was. I.. its a robot. We all stared at the seven foot tall robot all dirty and rusty. I called my dad to come bring his truck over and help us lift it out. My dad tied a rope around the robot and then the back of his truck and pulled it out.     As we got home We put him on the floor of the garage, I noticed a green switch. I flicked it up and the whole garage turned blue from the robots eyes. The robot looked around and jumped up, ran into the corner and was blurting out random numbers.      We all freaked out and we tried to calm it down and finally it stopped. We all introduced ourselves trying to calm it down, He also introduced itself. My dad quietly whispered ' is this the treasure? I sure hope not'. The robot heard what my dad said and it said, yes i am the treasure. The robot grabbed its chest and ripped it off, There were about thrity-two apple sized diamonds that fell on to the floor We all fell to our knees and searched thorugh the diamonds. The robot explained that its creator created it to protect the precious diamonds and we all took our share for finding the robot. The robot had left back to his creators grave and layed there for the rest of its life.

There is a called a Gemini-Scout, a robot called Dante 2, and Mr. Gower.  All of these robots are really useful to our world today.  As you can see there is many robots in the world, but I only have time to tell you about a little by little.               First, the Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot that works in the mines under the ground.  The Gemini-Scout can do many things.  Gemini-Scout carries water, food, and other supplies. It can also even drag injured people to safety.  Wherever it goes, Gemini-Scout collects information for the miners.  For example, the robot has a thermal camera to help find miners.  When the robot finds the trapped miners, the miners can use the radio to talk with the rescue team.               Next, the robot Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job.  It climbs into volcanoes to gather information for the scientists.  This type of robot is built to survive very height heat.  Dante 2 looks for holes or vents in the crater.  in the past, scientists could not learn that much about volcanoes, but Dante 2 changed all of that.  Now scientists can study volcanoes up close without getting hurt.               Then, there is a robot called Mr. Gower.  This type of robot works at the hospital.  Mr. Gower can go anywhere in the hospital.  The robot is so strong it can pull 500 pounds.  After charging for two hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.  Not only does it work all day, Mr. Gower can talk.  This machine is programed  to say a hundred phrases.               All these robots are useful to the world.  They all do many different things, such as helping out the hospital and saving people that get lost in the mines.  Also some help scientists.

Robots are fun to be around with.They make a great companion.If you ever have a robot I suggest you get a robot that likes to play.This particular robot always has time to play.When you are bored you can always play with the robot.The robot plays with you no matter what.If you want to play and there is no one you can play with, the robot will always be there for you.        Another robot that is nice to have is Dante 2.I suggest this robot to scientist that study volcanoes.This robot can go inside volcanoes to see how it is inside it.When Dante 2 comes out of the volcano it gives all the information about it to the scientist.The best part is that you dont have to controll!It controlls itself.Dante 2 is a great robot for scientist that study volcanoes.         The Agribot is a great robot for farmers.This robot picks fruits and vegtables.When farmers need help they can count on the Agribot.When there is a lot of stuff to do on the farm Agribot is here to help.When your to tired to do stuff you need to do or have to do you can always tell Agribot to lend a hand.         Mr.Gower is a wonderful robot for doctors and nurses.When there is to many pacients at the hospital and one of them needs there medication you can tell Mr.Gower to take care of  that.Mr.Gower loves helping out doctors,nurses, and pacients.The best part is it moves by itself and you don't need to control it.          So now you see that robots are not evil.Robots are very helpful to the world.Without them some people that they have saved might have died.Robots are helpful to scientist,doctors,and kids!Without them the world would be kinda boring.Don't listen to the cartoons when they say ''robots are evil'' because robots are not evil.Robots are fun to be around with.They make the workd a better place to be in and not boring.

So that how the story begins......... one day the Danta 2 robot was on a mission to find at what was going on with the Mt.helen after many explode, the USA government  made a decisoins to send in the danta 2 robot.        So when the danta 2 robot was going though many caters and ceavers he finds the soucre of the promblem they have a oringail prota type ran away into the volcane. The prote-type was made by docter Myles to save Human in natural diaster area.        So when Danta 2 find it was flying around looking for suriour and in the look he blown up part of the volcane. so that was why it was pouring lava ever were.So danta 2 called in a robot time. With the help of the proto-type the built a wall to held in the lave and the proto-type was named savior.

My robot said 'Hello master what is my name?' And I told him 'you will be named steve.'Steve asked 'what are we going to do today?' I told him'we are going to see what your abilities are. Then steve said 'alright I will show you what I have got'.          He could fly,had strenght,spell, he was great at math, invent new things and make meals. I told him 'your amazing' he said 'that is nothing.' I gave him a heap of metal and he made in  into a miature me. We had to go to the store to pick up some food for meals but on our way there and we got a flat tire. Steve found some supplies and fixed the flat tire so we could contuine.        At school on monday I must have let my sectert slip. At lunch Andrew and his group game over to me and took steve. I told them 'to give him back.' they said'then come and tke it back'.

She walked over the garbage can and saw a little robot on wheels.  She picked it up and said 'wow'. She walked back inside her house and went to her room. She went to her dad's tool box and got the supplies she needed to fix the robot. When she came back to her room her robot was gone! She turned around and saw the robot moving, and it started talking saying 'Calling elevator' and 'Your delivery is here'.                  Later that night Anna got her laptop and researched the robot she found. It says that 'Its a robot that saves lives and helps doctors and nurses.' It also says that it can pull up to 500 pounds. While she was researching She heard the robot talking she got it before it can turn around and pulled out the batteries. she then heard a sound like it was just turned off. Later that week she made a doctors appointment to see if the doctor wanted the robot.                   No one knows about the robot except her little sister . Anna told her mom that she was going to sleepover her friends house, but actually she's going to the doctors then her friend Emily's house.She walked to Dr.Marks office and told him abut the robot and if he wanted it. He said ''no we have enough worker here''. Anna was upset but left. Anna then walked to Emily's house.                 The next day Anna went to a hospital and gave him the robot. She finally sold it.She sold it for 1,000,000 million dollars. She went home and told her parents the news and then got first class tickets to Hawaii. After that They lived Happily Ever After.

The next day we went to go work on it again but it was gone we couldnt find it any where.so we went looking for it and we found it on the groung accross the streeet.we were wondering how it got all the way over here.when we got back home we got some old scraps we had just sitting around.            I had to go inside to grab more parts and when i came back it was gone! my dad said the cat probly took it but i didnt think so.my dad told me that he was gonna set up some camras so we could see who was taking it.but i didnt think anyone would take a broken little robot.so that night my dad set up some the camras but he made sure to hide them.       The next morning i went out side to check the camras. but when i did i was freking out.the robot came alive!!i wanted to tell my dad but for some reason i couldnt.so i decided to keep it a secret well at least for a little bit.i couldnt belive what i just saw it was amazing.       so that night i went out side to look at the robot when i was alone and the robot was running around! when i saw it i screemed because it was flying. that was a mistake my dad came running out and saw it . but for some reason he wasnt freeking out . thats when i knew that robots are awesome.

The man that was chasing him was the one how created robots and his name was Dr.Doctor.       The reason the robots are scared of humans is because the night Dr.Doctor invented robots was the night they took over,but the humans did not just sit there and died they fought back. The robot were certificated They a government with taxes Armies and they did it all so fast it seamed like only a day passed. The Human governments could not give up so every one on Earth made ONE GIANT GOVERNMENT to beat the robots.       Dr.Doctor fixed the robot sent him to his family to start the war. The war started the next day and it was a literal World War 3. It was crazy. You better hope you win because the robot will torcher you, if found.       When the war ended somehow the humans won.

Mr. Gowers is a robot that helps us with hospital work and how they are saying that looks a small cabinet on wheels and it helps bring medicine to doctors and patients.I think that they should make more of the robots like these and do other jobs like help police or help in schools and like the Agribots do on farms          Robots are amazing to the world and to our society and robot cars will be on the road and if something going wrong with the Google cars businesses will make a big deal about it and the Google cars have spent 200,000 hours on the roads of California and Nevada.                   1.

This robot does work in mines. Since it is a strong robot, it can drag hurt people to safety. It also can test the air before miners go in to make sure that there is no gas in the air. This robot collects information.           The Dante 2       The Dante 2 looks very much like a spider. It is used to climb the steep walls of volcanoes to check out the inside. Mostly scientists use this robot, to see the inside of a volcano. The Dante 2 checks if there is vents, holes, or anything in the crater. The robot also collects information much like the Gemini-Scout.            Mr. Gower       Mr. Gower is a robot mostly used in hospitals. They use this robot for carrying medicine and for delivering it to sick patients. The Mr. Gower can talk, saying phrases like, 'You're delivery is here.' This robot is built like a dresser in order to hold medicine in locked drawers. It is also battery powered.           These are only a few of all the different robots in the entire world.

When Robots are made they try to make them to save people and they take or collect iformation. They can even go down into dark places of vlocanoes and collect information from what they see. Some people think that robots are a herm to them. but sometimes robots are nice. The robots are created by the owner of maybe a scientist created it.

This was Jimmy Balteron's life.He'd always imagine of a world where robots could do amazing things.Cars could drive themselves,robots could help patients, and even keep you entertained.These seemed like the dreams of a child until one day when Jimmy was walking home from school he stopped by the local junk yard.'Look at all this metal and car parts.I'll make fantasy a reality.I'll make the first human like robot.'Jimmy said.he grabbed a few tin cans a car door handle and a lite bulb.      When Jimmy arrived home he ran up to his room and constructed a little model out of the materials he gathered.It was a  model of the robot with one rubber band amazingly he was able to make his own little contraption which could carry a water bottle.      Jimmy wrote this in his journal.Everyday he would stop by the junkyard and grab some items.He made a robot tat could climb a wall with suction cups,kind of like the robot we have today that climbs up the side of volcanoes today.He also made a miniature car which if you wind up could could drive itself.This is where wind up toys come from.It was invented by just a little kid.      Jimmy wrote all of his inventions down in his journal.When he grew old he still had the little book of his creations with him.One day he passed away of age.The family came to clean up the house and take all his possessions to remember him by.His brother found his little book in a drawer.and his eye caught on the little wind up car invention.He saw how Jimmy wrote how he in visioned it.His brother worked for Google so he showed his boss Jimmy's idea and how he in visioned it.Google is actually now working on it.It is the first car to drive itself.

He is very stong he collects information when he goes to space and he is really smart. But that isnt all he can do there are alot more exciting things Night Hawk cand do and here are some of them.                                                He can also get into small spaces and help people get out if they are stuck. He can travel to valcanos and go inside and bring out samples of things for scientists to collect. He can also help doctors, teachers, miners, astronauts, and carpenters.                                    One of his most exciting trips was when he went inside a valcano while it was erupting and brought back samples of lava for scientists to experimend on. Night Hawk can help people in need he is a great robot and scientists are amaezd by him.

She moaned and groaned to her parents how horrible it was to spend the summer studing and practicing but all they said was, ' We know you don't like it but please try hard. You will thank us later.' With that little Emmie stomped up to her room. When she came in she was amazed at what she saw, a beautiful blue robot!She ran back downstairs but too late her parents were gone. Oh well she thought and went back upstairs.When she came into her room she was even more amazed the robot had come to life. Yay! she thought but little did she know what was going to happen next.          Emmie wanted to play with the robot but he had different plans for her. 'So young lady,' he said 'What shall we start with.' 'Games, games and more games!' she shrieked. 'Ok lets start by calling all your friends and telling them to come over.' And so they did and all 11 of her friends came.'Lets start by playing the tebahpla game,' said the robot(Ben)'What's that.' asked a little red headed girl named Ruby.'Oh you'll see,' Ben replied. The kids didn't even notice that tebahpla was alphabet backwards until Ben said, 'Congrats kidos you all know the alphabet now. Wasn't that fun? But guess who's the smartest... Emmie!' And so Emmie got a big bowl of ice cream as her prize.          The next day Emmie ran up to her parents and yelled 'THANK YOU SO MUCH! THE ROBOT IS ALIVE!' but of course the parents didn't belive her and just smiled and said, 'We're glad you like is Em.' An went away to work. Emmie skipped up to her room and said, 'So Ben what game are we playing today?' The robot laughed and gave her a book that said gniward srettel(drawing letters) 'Oh that looks fun!' she said. And so she started working on the book when she finished Ben said 'Glad you liked it now you know how to write letters. Now if you liked that do you want to learn how to write fancy letters.' 'Umm that sounds soo uncool but fine lets try,' she replied. When they finished she was so happy that she asked 'Ben I heard about cursive can you teach me how to write in cursive?' With that they started to write in cursive. By the time her parents came she already wrote them a note saying: 'I love you so much! Thanks for the robot,' in cursive, block letters, and regular writing.          On Monday(a week before kindergarden started) Ben told Emmie it was time for her to learn to read of course like always Em started complaining but still decieded to learn to read. At first Ben gave her picture books that she had to look at and write the story. Then he made her read little tiny easy books. When she learned that he told her that if she wanted she could even read harder books. And so in two days Em learned how to read.          When the first day of kindergarden started Emmie was ready to go. When she arrived she found out that what she and Ben were doing was kindergarden.

Make a robot.        He descided it should scare his cat every time it trys to enter his room. He taped a tin can to a Gameboy and added some wires to it. He got mad when it didn't work. He found some money and sent it to a lab. When they sent it back it worked exactly the way he wanted it to! Yet it looked the same. He was happy anyways because the cat never bothered him again.

It was asking me all these questions, but I answered them. We became good friends. He asked me what his name was but I didnt know what his name was. So i gave him one and his name is Roger. Roger and I done everything together. We played together everyday. He was my bestfriend, he was a good friend to. I told him everything. When I told him sonething and I said not to tell no one he didnt tell anyone. This year I was turning 11 and my mom told me I had to give Roger away but I didnt want to he was my bestfriend. So the next day while I was at school my mom took him out of my room and took him to sell him. Wheni got home my mom told me he broke. I lost my bestfriend that day.

They look like creepy machines. They are very exxpensive to people like poor . I think they should give free robots to a person who is blind.It could save ppl lifes all the time.                               They should also give it to people who are sick, like people who are paralised. they should make robots that could help people with what ever they need. The robots could cook food, and it could also play with other kids.                         Mr. Grower is a robot theat works in the hospital, helping doctorsand nurses bring medcine to patients. Mr .Grower can go anywherein the hospital. It can ride elavators, steer through hallways, and move around things that get in there way.                         An agribot is a robot that pick fruit. It might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very intrested in what theserobots can do. Because picking a strawberry is diffrent than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes.

In the distence was a little gleming lght in the dump. That light soon stated moving like crazy until we saw the whole body. As we scientists we like to know everything thats unknown or mysterious. We went into the dump. Two hours later that little light was part of a robots eye. The whole body was torn up and dirty, it even smelled!                  Back into the labb we studied the robot carefully so that we could ajust a few things to the robot. We had figured how old it was, and it happed to be 50 years old. We now knew that the robot had just came back to life. with all the tools we had we had to do something with the robot now that it came baclk to life. We used all the information to find out what to do with him.                  Instead of dealing with the robot we found out all the information tracking down the robots memorise. of course this robot had a name it was HP-48463. there was nothing realy scary about it but we turned its memroise into a little movie to show it to the world.   The movie didnt give us a lot of information we were looking for to find out who the HP-48463's owner was.                  As we vidoed it there was a voise talking to us. ther we found out it was calling out who the owner was. It said, sir Hennry! we noticed that it was calling the owner or should we say creator's name.   Finaly we sdearched the name and the creator died in a fire. Amased by alllthe history we found we goave it a little question and aslked it if they were the ones who saved a robber. We didn't know what to ask it was just a creative quetion that came in our heads.                 The robot reponded saying yes over and over again. After alll this time. The robot died out agian and we tried fixing the robot but it wouldn't respond. After that we gave up puting it into the musenm of Sir Henery's labb and Artifacts. there it would be in a safe place.

When Roby was exploring he found a mine, then a robot popped out it said, 'hello' It was in a human voice Roby talked back and said, 'Hey there my name is Roby what is yours?' he responded 'Oh a talking robot that's new my name is Bob I'm a human he are talking through a two way radio I'm operating a Gemini-Scout.' Roby replied, 'Whats a Gemini-Scout?' Bob replied, 'A Gemini-Scout is a remote control operated robot that rescues people in mines it has a thermal camera and it is very important.' Roby was glad for the information and he went off on his way.                      Roby kept exploring when he explored he wondered about the Gemini-Scout. Then he found a robot store it selled toys, books, and even robots. There was a lady reading to children about robots. Roby was curious and went over to take a better look he walked until he was close enough to hear what she was saying. He learned a lot like about this robot called Dante 2 it climbs steep walls and other things and like a spider it has 8 legs and gathers information for scientists on volcanoes. Next he learned about a robot called Mr. Gower that is a robot that works in a hospital and bring s medicine to nurses and doctors he even carry things, even better he can talk like Roby. After that he learned about a robot called an Agribot it picks fruits and vegetables, it even plants a censer so they know when the fruits and vegetables are ripe. Roby was very satisfied in what he learned so he moveed on.                                                                                                                                                     Roby was now ready for a recharge so he went to sleep. The next morning something seemed different he can no longer talk either. So he went to investagate when all the sudden he saw in thermal vision. Roby thought back and remembered Gemini-Scouts have thermal vision and he figured out he had turned into a Gemini-Scout. Roby didn't know what was happening. Then he heard voices saying, 'Wake up for school Jimmy you don't wanna be late.' Then little Jimmy woke up and realized it was all just a wonderful dream.

When I got too curious and tried to help her brother get away from a robot. I made a terrible mistake.                         On Friday afternoon I was sitting on the back porch of my neighbor's house sipping on a tall glass of lemonade  when I heard a faint, but strange, noise. I looked up to see my best friend, Morgan, standing there. She was holding a remote that looked like it controlled the television set and VCR. I asked her what it controlled and why she had it. she said 'We'll it was my birthday yesterday and my mom gave me the remote but didn't tell me what it controlled. I wanted a new remote for my television because my brother, Jarred, won't stop throwing it on the ground during his temper tantrums over what he wants to watch, but it wouldn't work. I think my mom hid one of my presents in the basement and I'm determined to find it.' 'I didn't know that you had a brother, how old is he?' 'He's six.' she said.                          I told her that I would help her find what it went to, so we walked down the porch stairs and she unlocked the basement door with a spare key. She always keeps it under the door mat that no one else knows about but us. When we got in I didn't know where to look first, all I could see was stacks of Jarred's old toys. I saw strollers with action figures in them, a really small basketball goal and a little basketball to go with it. I thought I saw a little head popping out from behind storage bins and it was him alright. Morgan told him to help us look for what the remote went to and he wouldn't unless we gave him some money. we tricked him by saying that a pennie was worth fifty dollars. He didn't believe us so we gave him a dime and said it was worth ten dollars. Apparently that was more believe able to him.                After a while I got thirsty and Morgan was, too. We went back outside and sat on the swings while I drank the rest of my lemonade. Morgan got a Pepsi and a Mountain Dew and a very tall glass. I was thinking about what she was going to do and she mixed both of them into that really tall glass and put  a candy cherry in for good taste. We had been sitting there for about ten minutes when we heard screaming coming from the basement. A wierd looking robot was holding Jarred by the arm and dangling him over a huge tub full of old action figures. I knew they were his because of the way he looked at them.               I inched closer and closer to the robot until I saw writing on its arm. It said  'My name is Nik if found please return to this address.' and had her address on it. her address was 2431 Cranberry Road.               It came at me and I yelled 'Morgan push the unlock botton on the remote, Aaahhhahahaha.' It dropped Jarred and got on all fours like a dog and made wierd noises that kind of sonded like an electronic bark. she used the remote to make it different animals and the n kept it as a duck.               When we got done playing with it we went in the house to tell her mom what happened. She said that she knew we would find it so she wanted us to go on a little adventure. Since everything was okay I went back to my house and found a remote on my bed with a sticky note on it that said 'You have to find the present or you don't get it.mom. The process started all over again and I had a great time finding the little robot.

I said good morning to them and they said it back . It was time for me to leave ,so I went in the car. The car also had a mind of its own . The car asked me where I wanted to go . I told the car to go to the local book store . I didn't have to drive, the car did all the work . When ever it was going to turn ,it slowed down to turn the right way. I thought that it was amazing how it could do that. When the car came close to the book store it slowed down just enough ,so it nows where to park.After I got my books the trunk opened and I put them down. When I got home I saw that most of the kids were playing with there robot baby sitters. The robots singed to them, danced with them , and even played with them. I was just amazed how robots efected our lives. Once in side I saw that the robots had done all the work I needed done. In the end it felt like a perfect day with all the robots.

Then we suddenly heard a 'Thump'. We  rushed toward where we heard the noice and we found a giant hole right behind the trees in the forest near my house. We looked inside and there was a robot.We brought it up to have a better look. It was a robot but it wasn't alive so we all thought t was a waste. Either way we decided to keep it. As we walked back we thought of  ways to hide it because we knew we weren't going to be able to keep it. 'I know where i said'. 'We can hide it in my tree house and play with it when ever we want. We walked back in silence. When we arrived at my house we hid the robot. Then we all made a wish ''I wish the robot was alive'we all said.             The next day we all met up at my house we saw the robot it was moving and making itself some oil. we screamed in fear from this but then  we smiled. 'It came alive just like we wanted ' said Colby. Months passed as we played with Robert that was his new name. We played tag ,video games ,and dodgeball. We also went to the movies, the arcade, amusement parks it was the best time of my life. One day Austin told Robert ' I hope you never leave ' he said. Steven said 'your family now Robert and you'll always be safe with us'.  'Here is a present for being our friend' said David.Then out of nowhere Robert told us he had to leave 	DT NNP NN PRP VBD DT JJ CC JJ NN PRP NNP , NNP , VBD , CC NNP VBD VBG IN IN PRP$ NN NNP NNP PRP RB VBP DT NNP NNP VBD IN WRB PRP VBP DT NN CC PRP VBD DT JJ NN RB IN DT NNS IN DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD NN CC EX VBD DT JJ NN PRP IN TO VB DT JJR NNP NNP VBD DT NN CC PRP VBD RB JJ IN PRP DT VBD NN VBD DT NNP NNP NN PRP VBD TO VB NNP NNP PRP VBD RB PRP VBD IN NNS TO VB PRP IN PRP VBD PRP VBD RB VBG TO VB JJ TO VB NNP NNP VB WRB PRP NNP NNP MD VB PRP IN PRP$ NN NN CC NN IN PRP WRB RB PRP NNP NNP VBD RP IN NNP NNP PRP VBD IN PRP$ NN PRP VBD DT NNP NNP PRP DT VBN DT NN NN NN DT NN VBD JJ DT NNP NNP JJ NN PRP DT NN RP IN PRP$ NN PRP VBD DT NN PRP VBD VBG CC VBG PRP DT NNP PRP VBD IN NN IN DT CC RB PRP NNP NN VBD JJ RB IN PRP VBD '' VBD NNP NNP VBD IN PRP VBD IN NNP IN VBD PRP$ JJ NNP NNP VBD NN , NN NNS , CC NNP NNP RB VBD TO DT NNS , DT NN , NN NNS PRP VBD DT JJS NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN NNP VBD NNP POS PRP VBP PRP RB VBP '' PRP NNP NNP VBD JJ NN RB NNP CC PRP MD RB VB JJ IN NNP JJ VBZ DT NN IN VBG PRP$ NN '' VBD JJ IN IN RB NNP VBD PRP PRP VBD TO VB

She tapped her foot, figuring out what had happened.  'Alex I know you took Bolt!'   Alex, her older brother came out of a closet, holding the small dog and laughing.   Allie groaned and snatched her dog away.  She ran up to her room and plopped on her unmade bed.   Snap, snap.   'Hello?' Allie called, facing the way she thought the sound was coming from.  She knew it couldn't be Alex, since she just saw him downstairs.   Snap, snap, snap.   'Whatever,' Allie said, deciding to ignore the sound.  After all, they lived in an old house, so it was probably just some creaking floorboards.   Allie burried her face in her pillows and fell asleep.       'Huh?' She croaked about an hour later.  A large figure towered above her.   'Alex, go away!'  She threw her pillow at who she thought was her brother.  But the figure stayed put.   Finally, the large body stepped into the light, where she could finally make out who or what it was.    'Ohmigosh,' she said, stunned.  The figure wasn't her brother at all.  It was a large robot.   'What the heck?!'  She turned away and closed her eyes, thinking it was all a weird dream.   'Oh, don't go!'  A sweet voice pleaded.   Allie turned to face the robot, amazed that it could speak.   'Where did you come from?'  Allie asked quietly.   'Your brother,' the robot replied.   'What?'   'You know how he always creats things?'   'Yeah.'   'Well, he made me about a week ago, but I have no idea how I'm alive.'   'Um, okay.'  Allie said, surprised that her brother could actually be successful. 'What's your name?'   'Oh, I never really thought of that.  Um...'   'It's okay, I'll name you.  How about Mia?'   'Okay!'  Mia replied, cheerful.   'So, um, why did you come in my room?'   'So I could kill you.'   'WHAT?!'  Allie shrieked.   'What, what?'  Mia cocked her head to the side, innocently.   'Nothing, I must be hallucinating, or something.'   'Okay.  Why don't you go back to sleep.  I'm sorry I woke you up.'  Mia sounded sincere.   ''Kay, thanks!'  Allie retrieved her pillow and fell asleep.       While Allie was sleeping, Mia stayed put for a while, making sure Allie was not awake.  After about 10 minutes, Mia tip-toed down the stairs and got a hammer from the cabinet.  Next, she walked back up to Allies room, and fake hit her on the head with the hammer a few time, making sure she knew where to hit.   'Allie?'  Alex yelled from the hall.   Mia didn't seem to hear, because she was continuing to do what she was doing before.   Alex saw Mia, and quickly rushed inside to save his sister.   Knocking the hammer from her hand, he picked Mia up and chucked her out the window.   'ALLIE WAKE UP!'  Alex shrieked.   'WHAT do you want?'  Allie jerked up from her sleep, alert.   'My old invention, a robot, was about to kill you with a hammer!'   'You mean Mia?'   'Whatever.'   'Um, okay, so where is she?'   'I, uh, threw her out the window.'   'Are you insane?!'  Allie rushed to the window to see the robot passed out on the ground.   'Don't do that.  Next time just call the cops.'  Allie insisted.       Together, the called 9-1-1 and told them the details.  The cops seemed skeptical about taking a robot to jail, but finally gave in.  After that day, Alex and Allie tried to never fight again, and created a really strong bond.  Mia was never heard from again, and probably never will be. 	JJ . '' NNP CD NNP , VBG TO VB PRP$ NNP NNP . '' PRP VBD NNP NNP VBD PRP NN , VBG RP WP VBD NNP NNP NNP VBP PRP VBD NNP .

For months, he had been in his garage, working on making a robot. Jimmy's biggest dream was to be tall. Jimmy had always been the shortest kid in school, and he always got picked on for that. It made him furious. So he came up with an idea to make a gigantic robot that could lift him up so he'd feel tall.       Jimmy's dad came in to the garage. 'Hey Jimmy, want to go throw the baseball around with me?'       Jimmy didn't look away from the robot. 'Not now, Dad. Maybe later.'       Jimmy's dad sighed. 'Okay, maybe later...' Jimmy's dad wished Jimmy would come out of the garage sometimes, but he knew how much that robot meant to Jimmy.       Weeks went by, and it was the middle of summer. Finally, one night, Jimmy was so close to finishing his robot. His robot arms and legs could extend just by the touch of a button on his remote controller. Only one step had to be finished, and that was adding the head. Jimmy was tired that night, so he thought he'd do it in the morning.       As Jimmy was walking up the stairs, he heard a loud crash. However, he was so tired that he just ignored it. All night, Jimmy dreamed of what his robot would turn out like. He imagined his robot lifting him up so he could dunk on the basketball hoop, like the other tall boys at school.       The next morning, Jimmy ran downstairs excitedly. When he walked into the garage, he screamed. His mother and father came rushing in. When they saw the big commotion, they gawked at the huge mess of various robot pieces laying around.       Jimmy went and picked up the pieces. He sadly laid them on the work bench, but didn't bother to put it back together. His father took him out for ice cream to make him feel better, but it didn't help.       Jimmy sat on the sidewalk all alone, with his head hung down as he watched his ice cream drip onto the ground. He was too upset to eat. 'Jimmy, what's wrong?' He heard an unfamiliar voice behind him. He turned around to see who it was, and...       It was his robot! He was too shocked and surprised to say anything, so he just stared. His robot came over, picked him up, and spun him around. Jimmy was so happy and surprised! Jimmy and his robot became best friends.

As a young boy I regret wanting robots to be a part of your society.   There are many robots now. They have taken over, scientists didn't realize how powerful they made their beautiful yet terrifying creation. There are the three most powerful robots, Mr.Gower, Dante 2, and the self driving car.   Every Mr. Gower created has medical smarts. This intelligently designed piece of equipment has created a mind of it's own. it has learned how to change medicine into poison and with great accuracy can shoot needles filled with toxic medication.                                     The next robot is Dante 2, used for research. This robot learned many things about volcanoes and finding it's way through the craters and looks for vents and/or holes. It has eight legs like a spider, but recently it has gone roge and learned to harness the energy from the magma and uses tht energy to destroy the human race.                           Finally, the biggest robot. The self-driving car, has unlimmited sense of data and can see all of its surroundings. They are infectionus and almost impossible to get rid of! Because of it's $80.000 cone-shaped laser it has umlimmited vision all the way around. Also, its unlimited data comes from its wireless gps navigator system. I used to want one of those cars so badly. Now i regret they were even made.                   Hopefully someday someone will be brave enough to come save us here in the prison.

Some peolpe were walking down the street and saw a robot and they thought the robot didnt have batties.And when they got closer the robot suddenly came alive.The robot was looking at them and the robot suddenly smile.They smile back at him and they waved at him.                    The people train the robot how to talk,play,sing,and play music.One day the people left the robot in the house all by himself and when they came back they saw the robot cooking them food.The people were shock.The  robot said'I made you guys food'.                    The second thing the robot learn was how to drive.how to feed animals, and how to write.The robot was very happy that he got to learn how to learn all these stuff.The robot was happy that he found these people because without these people the robot won't have learn how to do these thing.Everyday the people well teach the  robot all these things.The robot becaome smarter and decided to go to school.The people agree with him.                       The first day of school thr robot made alot of friends.In school the robot became more smarter and intelligant.And the people will still teach him alot of new sttuff.From that day on the robot became more smarter and was very happy with the people,that he felt like he had a family.

It is the future now, and the world is gathering more information to try and make the world a better place. They believe that this is the next step.       Robots are said to be the most inteligent things in the world, and can be programmed to do things and see things that no other human can. They might be able to speak every single language in the world, own every type of music ever invented in their minds, amd they can save lives at times a human can't. It is also possible that they can help fight in combat when the USA is having trouble in war. Robots are the earth's newest and better species.       Although there is the likely chance this will take years, maybe even centuries, the government and other big officials are just beggining to develop the technology needed for these future activities. These projects may also fail more than once, but giving up on project for future purposes is never the solution. The world needs this!

He finished the comic and looked on the back 'lets look on the back to see when part two is coming out.' Instead of  an ad for the comic book it was an ad for a toy, but not just any toy, it was a robot it said 'robot best freind only 19.95$.' Wow, it must not work if it cosy that much.   But drake changed his mind, even though he already have a best freind 'Ivette' but he thought this would be cool.    Drake got some of his birthday money he got 21$ out of 102.09$ he sent it to the adress and waited. He waited for 3 weeks. The robot was 1 foot tall maybe a few inches shorter. He was all white, he had two black dots for eyes and a cheezy looking smile, and he had no shoes, no shirt, and no hair. I named him Bob. The AD said that he walked and talked but all he did was a marchimg walk and say 'your my bestest freind' that really creeped me out. I didnt care it was still cool looking.    I went to bed early becuase it was sunday so that meant school. I had put bob on my shelf next to all my action figures. I stared at it all night thinking what if i missed a button on him? what if he could fly?' All that thinking got me tired even more so I fell asleep. The next morning I found out that bob was missing. it was quite I heard loud snoring I thought it was my annoying older sister 'natalie'. But it wasnt. It sounded like It was In the room. I felt the bed vibrating, I grabbed the covers threw them off and I screamed. Bob was sleeping in my bed, he was in a cuddling position and snoring awfully loud. Bob sounded like a pig sleeping. Bob got startled by my scream, I didnt know it but, my mom did too. Bob woke up shouting 'AHH, dog dont eat me!!!' I was amazed ' y-y-y-y-you can....... talk?!' 'yep' but why werent you talking to me yesterday ?' 'well-' but before he could finish 'Honey are you okay?'the door knob started to turn    Before drakes mom could open the door he stood up put bob behind his back 'I heard you scream' 'oh I woke up falling off the bed 'oh, be carful and get ready for school.' 'Okay' 'phew that was a close one' 'yep' 'well I have to get ready for school' 'Okay'.

I slowly walk downstairs aproching the entrance of it. Then I saw a confused little robot. I slowly and quietly walked toward it and then I threw a bag over it. I took it outside and I tried to talk to it. Then suddenly I teleported to a dark world!       I heard a very dim moaning sound coming from the distance. I was terrified. Then I saw a different robot that looked like a man. He asked how did I get here but I didn't want to answer. He turned around and he nodded his head sideways. Then robot from my house  walked in. The robot said, 'Did you touch this or did you come close to it?' Then I said yes to him.'Great! You need to go now. We've to change the future. Goodbye now.' Then the robot left and I was very confused.       The robot was still there and it said, 'I'll obey your command.'   Then I said, 'Teleport me to back to my house,' and I was in my bed.

They call it the Dante.            This robot has eight legs so it can climb hill sides or a  steep side of a volcano.Its design is like a spider the scienctest test the robot to see if it works. Now, were ready to test it on real volcano.             A few months later after testing the robot they took it to a never before seen volcano they sent dante in  he  suddenly gained extra power dante went into the volcano then,dante's camera broke  it was not working well, a few minutes later dante came out the scientest chest what dante collected it was full of lava Dante threw it on them and said a few words 'you treat Dante bad so Dante kill you' suddenly his power ran out and the vocano erupted.

Some of them are helping us save lives,  they farm,  and mine under ground.  There are some robots that I am going to introduce to you (the reader).  Gemini-Scout is a robot that does alot of things for us.  He searches and rescues people, animals,  and other things.  He also works in mines under ground.  He is less than 2 feet and has wheels.  This robot can go up and down.  The next robot i am going to inroduce to you is Dante 2.  Dante 2 has interesting jobs.  He climbs volcanoes just to do it.  This robot finds information for scientist.  The robot can survive in high tempetures.  Now time for the last robot which is Mr.Gower.  Mr.Gower works in a hospital for nurses and doctors.  He is like a cabinet the nurses can put medicine in them.  If the patients need medicine they can get it from the robot.  Enough with theese robots lets learn more about any robot.  Robots can drive their own car.  They can also get their own permit to drive.  Human people can drive robots it is like their own car bu tthey don't have to drive.  robots are like us they can have the ability to do almost everything we can do.  They are very inteligent machines.

My friends got some cardboard and some tape and some markers. We first started off by cutting the cardboard into the shapes we needed. We cut lots of rectangles an some squares.   Then we taped the pieces into our robots shape. Then we drew some features onto our robot. When we were finishing up we saw the eyes light up and it became alive.                    We decided to make it our new best friend forever becaus eit was fun it sings, dances, plays music, etc. Best of all he never talks bad about us.

The plane was experiencing problems. Then the plane went down, like a bird that didn't know how to fly, and crashed. Dust whirled into the air and created it's own sandstorm, then it settled down to rest on the ground where it came from. A small boy who saw the plane ran to the crash site. Out from the plane rolled a piece of machinery the size of person. It rolled until it hit a rock that pushed a button. The machine's lights flickered like firefly, then steadied to solid colors. It appeared to have a head, a body, limbs, and lights on its highest section that resembled a face. It then stood up on two legs. The boy watched in amazement. The machine looked at him. 'I am the Muffin Man,' it said. 'I am a robot.' It didn't talk in the choppy voice you'd think a robot would talk in. It sounded just like a normal person. 'I'm John,' said the boy. The Muffin Man looked at John with its bright, colorful eyes. 'I am a robot that makes muffins. It is my destiny to make delicious muffins.' John thought this was amazing. 'Can you make me a muffin?' John asked. The lights on the Muffin Man's face showing a smile shut off and in the same instant new lights turned on that showed a frown. 'I'm afraid I can't,' he said. 'A couple of my parts had fallen of of the plane in the crash. There are only two but they could be anywhere, and now I will not fulfill my destiny.' John wanted to help the robot. 'What if I help you find the parts?' he said. The Muffin Man smiled and said, 'Really, you would do that?' John said, 'Sure.' 'Okay,' the Muffin Man said. 'Then let's go!' John and the Muffin Man set off to find the missing muffin making parts.                 The first place they went was the city. Enormous skyscrapers towered over John and the Muffin Man. The part could be anywhere. 'I wish I didn't have to walk,' John said. 'Well, why didn't you just say so?' said the Muffin Man, and just like that, he twisted and turned and transformed into a go-cart. 'Get on,' said the Muffin Man.' John got on the brightly colored cart and sped away. They flew through the city on the small cart, but they didn't find any parts. Then John spotted a construction site. 'Let's look in there,' John said, and they sped through the gates. Then there, in the middle of the site, was a piece of machinery. It had words on writing on it that was cut off. ' There,' said the Muffin Man, 'that's one of the pieces. The construction workers must have thought it was for their building.' Then a construction worker saw them. 'Hey, kid, what do you you're doing here?' he said. 'Step on it, Muffin Man!' yelled John. Without hesitation, the Muffin Man accelerated toward the part. John snatched off the ground and the Muffin Man drove up an improvised ramp. They soared over the fence and raced out of the city.                The go-cart stopped at a small shop outside the city and transformed back into the Muffin Man's normal shape. 'That was close,' he said. John nodded. 'Just one more part,' John said. Then he noticed the sign in front of the shop. Muffin Factory, it said. John noticed a big truck pulling into the back of the factory. 'Hmmmm.' John thought about something. 'Follow me,' he said to the Muffin Man, and they followed the truck. Two men started unloading packages. John noted what they took out: muffin mix, blue berries, chocolate chips, vannilla, muffin mixer-wait, muffin mixer. John noticed the mixer had writing on it that looked like it matched up with the writing on the Muffin Man's other part. That was it. 'Muffin Man,' said John, 'transform into a go-cart, I've found the last part.' 'Really?' said the Muffin Man. 'Really,' said John. When the men weren't lokking John snatched the part and ran back to the cart. The Muffin Man immediatly sped away just as the men turned around and realized the part was missing. The go-cart stopped back at John's house and transformed back into the Muffin Man. 'Now let's make some muffins,' said the Muffin Man. He put the parts together and the words spelled, 'Muffin Man.' John pushed a green and the mixer started to turn. John watched as the Muffin Man created creamy and delicious muffins. The Muffin Man shouted with joy. 'YES, I AM FULFILLING MY DESTINY AS THE MUFFIN MAN. WWWWHHHHHHAAAAAAA!' he screamed, and out popped a delicious muffin. John bit into it. It was the most wonderful he had ever tasted. 'We should do this every day,' said John. 'We will,' said the Muffin Man, and they went into John's house for the night.

Robot stories were realistic fiction a while ago, but now some of it is starting to come true! now that we have all of this technology we are actually starting to build robots similar to stories.       The Gemini-Scout is one type of robot. It is a remote-controlled robot that is designed for search-and-recuse type of things. It can go up and down, make turns, and even roll through water. It is a smaller built robot, but it is definitely a strong one! they can also carry many supplies. Wherever it goes though, its always gathering information. Controlling a Gemini-Scout is pretty much like controlling a video game. This robot sounds truly amazing!       Another type of robot is the Dante 2. This robot has a very interesting job though. It climbs into volcanoes! Why does it climb into volcanoes exactly? It gathers information in very hot volcanoes that scientists cant go into. It is built to survive extremely hot heat! The Dante 2 looks for openings like vents or holes in a volcano. Then it collects up a bunch of information about the gases and the magma. This device has allowed scientists to get information while remaining in their labs.       The Mr. Gower is yet again another spectacular device! It is a robot that works at hospitals for assistance. He helps doctors and nurses with many things. Mr. Gower is like a big cab nit with wells and a head. He carries important tools and medicines for patients. he is also very strong because he can lift over 500 pounds! Mr. Gower runs on batteries. once he is charged for two hours, he can work for 12 hours! Another cool thing is that he can also speak! he has been programed to say many phrases. this allows doctors to be more proficient.       Lastly we have the Agribots. This robot is a robot that picks fruit! it can pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples! Any fruit you name it! Not very many of these are used but they are causing an interest with farmers. Agribots come in all different shapes and sizes. Some of them are able to around on there own. There is a robot in Japan that picks strawberries but also can sense the color of it to tell if its ripe or not. Pretty neat isn't it? Agribots are like robot farmers.       Robots are truly a great technology and i hope we will all be using many of them soon. It is amazing that technology has gone this far! Robots hopefully will be popular in the future. This is really a great technology!         	NNS VBP RB JJ NNS TO NNP PRP MD VB PDT DT NN IN VBG NN TO NN NNS NNP NNP VBZ VBD JJ NN DT NN RB , CC RB DT IN PRP VBZ VBG TO VB JJ .

Now we have many robots such as the Gimini-Scout, Dante2, Mr.Gower, Agribots and many more wonderful robots. Some speake, play, dance, pull heavey wieghts and more.       Gimini-Scout is a helpful entertaining robot. He can carry food and everywhere he goes he collects information like how much gas is in the air. He has a thermal camera that helps find living things. This robot is remote controlled and finds and rexcuses hurt minors.       Dante 2 is a robot with an unusual job. He climbs into volcanos to get information with eight legs like a spider. This robot is ment to survive the harsh heat of volcanos and sends the video to scientist so they can get an upclose view of the volcanos without ever leaving the labortories.       Mr.Gower is a robot thst helps out in hospotals. He is almost like a cupboard with automatic wheels. He can talk to, like saying here is your medicine and please get well soon. Mr.Gower does the work that takes time so doctors can do the more important things.       These are the things I have learned about robots in my research about robots. I have found the robots that aaare most important are here at this time helping people and saving lives.

There are many robots now on the earth. some of the robots can help in the hospitals, can dance with you and some can also bring you the information that you might need to find someone or something .       The robots are all different and some you can spend time with when you are bored like one of the robots can dance with you to keep your busy. or if you want they can sing to you. If you lost something then the robot can track it down. plus the robots can be helpful in more harder times like if someone is underground then they can send a robot down to talk to them so that they can make sure that they are okay. there are many different robots that are all alive and can help you in any way.  Many people put much thought into the robots being alive and that it might be bad. but others think that it doesn't matter and they can help us in Manny ways.       If you are in the car some of the robots can help you keep your eyes on the road and that they are paying attention. the robot helps prevent the driver and the other passengers from getting hurt or in a car crash.

He had three human friends named Justin, Jake, and Johnathon. While at the park, Johnathon decided to have a game of catch with Jake and Justin. Although John wanted to play catch, Justin and Jake refused. Instead, they wanted to play with the big bad robot, Boogey man. Jake quickly activated the big bad robot and tested it out by voice command, seeing if it could talk, and it's mobility.                   The Boogey man reached all of Jakes expectations and because of this the three boys started playing with the Boogey man more often. One night, Justin was incredibly bored, had nothing to do, and wanted to play with the Boogey man.                          The only problem was, is that the Boogey man was at Jakes house. Justin gives Johnathon a call planning to sneak over to jakes house to steal the big bad robot to rearrange him to program him to be a evil robot. The only problem Justin and John didn't know was that The Boogey man was already evil.            Jake is on his computer, chatting with his friend, Charlotte on facebook. As jake is about to send his goodbye message he feels a grasping metal hand on his shoulder. Jake screams ' HELP HELP HELP!'  But this came to no one's attention because no one was home. As jake and the Boogey man tangle in Jakes room, Justin and Johnathon sneak in through the back door of jakes house. 'Hello?' John yells, with no reply. 'He's probally upstairs' Justin said with his first step up the stairs. During this fight, Jake noticed the Big Bad Robot had legs and arms that made him look like a spider, and had the ability to talk, like the Dante II and the Mr. Gower robots.           'Boogey man at your service' the boogey man calmy announces.   BOOM, the door claps open as Justin and John hurry to the room trying to take the boogey man off Jake. With a final punch, the Big Bad Robot, the Boogey man, falls to its collapse. For their cellabration of the fall of the boogey man, the boys sleep over  Jakes house with a nice bite of fried chicken.

Do you want to know why its so important? Well say your outside working or playing in dirt and you go inside just to get something to drink you always need to wash your hands first. Putting you hands near you mouth even if did wash your hands is very important because think about how many germs you have don't even put your hands near your face. This might sound a little grose but doing that stuff can 96% cause WORMS!!!whenever you go to the bathroom make sure when your done wash your hands. Think how much stuff you touch each day aint that super duper grose. 	NNP VBG TO VB DT NN IN VBG PRP$ NNP NNP PRP$ NNS VBZ RB JJ . . . NNP PRP VB TO VB WRB PRP$ RB JJ .

The next day Jimmy and his best friend Mitch decided to get to gather and decide what their going to do. Later that day when they were eating lunch Jimmy thought  they should do a robot.           The next day Jimmy went to Mitchs house to get started on the project, but nether of them knew how to so they started to search on the internet. After Jimmy went home Mitch kept on searching for it, but he could not find anything.           The next day Jimmy asked his teacher for some help and in about 15 min. she had found a web site about how to make a robot so she printed it out for him. The rest of the resource Jimmy and Mitch started putting in  there profactions.            On the 16th  they met up at Jimmy's house and stated getting the materials for the robot. When they got the materials Jimmy's dad started wellding the frame to gather. Then they started putting the wells on. The next day they putted all the gears in and wires witch         took a long time and then they at dinner. the next day Mitch had a lot of home work. the last day Mitch put the head on then they were done with there robot that got the name the badger because it dug tons of holes.

We were trying to find something interesting for our science project. This is interesting but, what is it? 'A metal person!' Lily exclaimed. 'What?' I asked. 'Look there's a head, an arm, and I think that is a foot,' she said. I sighed, 'It's a robot.' It was pretty cool, but how was I going to use it for my science project? Meanwhile, Lily kept rambling on about how she loved anything to do with robots and knew everything about them. 'They can save live you know,' she informed me, 'they save miners trapped in caves, carry off injured people, and even bring medicine to hospital patients!' 'Yes, but can they get me an A+ on my science project?' I wondered out loud.           As soon as I said that, I heard a metallic voice reply, 'Yes.' For a split second I was surprised. 'Stop messing with me Lily!' I scolded. I then turned around. The robot we had found was staring back at me. I nearly fainted! I slowly backed away, in fear that the robot might hurt us somehow. Lily, on the other hand, just kept gaping at the robot. 'What's your name? What type of robot are you? Is it really true that you can help us with our science project?' Lily asked the robot all at once. The robot looked very confused, I know I would have been. 'I am MultiBot.' It said,' I have all the skills of robots such as Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, and an agribot.' Lily's jaw hit the floor. 'What else can you do?' asked Lily eagerly. 'As well as working I can also entertain people by singing, dancing, and even playing music,' replied MultiBot.           I have to admit it's fascinating to see this robot but, I just really want to know how it could help me get an A+ on my science project. As if reading my mind, the robot said, 'For your science project, bring me and pretend that you invented me. If they ask how I was invented, I will answer that for you.' This robot is amazing! 'If you can do so much, why are you in a junkyard?' I asked. It didn't reply. I guess it was a sore subject. Do robots even have those? I shook off the thought. The science fair was in a couple of days and this robot was in no shape for presentation.            At my house Lily and I polished, waxed, oiled, and repainted MultiBot. He looked as good as new. The day of the fair, Lily and I fixed up MultiBot one last time and headed to the school where the fair was being held. 'I hope this works Ashley,' said Lily with a shaky voice. I could tell she was nervous, I was too. 'Don't worry Lily,' I whispered. After the judges had viewed all the projects, they went on stage to announce the winner. I crossed my fingers. Everything had went smoothly with our project but I was still very nervous. 'The first place winning team is: Ashley and Lily with their MultiBot invention!' announced a judge. Lily and I cheered as loud as we ever had before. Many other contestants gave us dirty looks but we didn't care. We got an A+ and a gigantic trophy after that. Sadly MultiBot broke after the science fair; Lily and I didn't know why. We were very sad and Lily cried for a week. Lately, in my sketchbooks, I have been designing a new, improved MultiBot. I hope my design is built one day in the future. I know I would see him again someday, I just feel it. 	JJ VBZ PRP .

The scientist was thinking about the things i could do, so he said, 'I'll make it fire proof for putting out fires. The enginer, however, was thinking about its look, so he said,''I'll make it buff, fast, and rolls. They put their ideas togeather and construced it.'Do you think it'll work', said the enginer.'We'll find out tomarrow.' Suddenly lightning struck on it and it came alive.       The robot was harmless. He saw a fire with a girl inside. He stormed through and in a zip he had the girl in his hands saving her and being a hero. The scientist heared the news,'I'm soooo happy! It works, it works! Then then enginer was wondering,' How did it come alive?' The robot could here the enginer, so he came alive and explained every thing(also said he need to charge so he charged him).       He save lots of lives every body loved him. They made toys,t-shirts for him so he said,' I am the futuer' and built more by himself. He continuse to be famous.

She has 5 arms and she has 2legs like we do. Lexis can climb pretty high,she also can cook, dance, and even sing. She would help you with your homework but not all the time because thats cheating. She is a fun,playful robot she also is a good babysitter. She once climbed a tree and safed a' kitten' cause a dog made the kitten go up the tree cause the dog was chaseing the kitten but we keeped the kitten and Lexis and the kitten which I called the kitten it's a boy muffin so now, muffin and Lexis are friends (like really best friends) they play with each other alot.                     Lexis is respectful with others and at other houses not put her legs on the sofa/caoch which that is rude and righ espetially if it's not your home. Im just telling you she is pretty amazing!! You can take her mostly everywhere. I almost forgot! She is the color hot pink with baby blue and lime green and a kind of  pretty purple. Did  I 'mention' she jumps pretty high about20ft high.She likes music like popstar, jazz well all kind of music.But she can't fall from 1 story floor or she'll break and wont be able to do all the things she use to do and she would aparantly she would be dead which you dont want that to happen right?It will be sad that you lost a friend that helped you so much with you're stuff. Lexi's is endless sourece of fun! She can do two things at a time play and do chores but they have to be at the same place to do those 2 things.She was build in  May 21 2011. Lexi's lives in North Carolina in Randlman with her owner Melina Ambriz.                       Lexis is great helper such as chores. She can help to find crimes and medicine for a doctor or a hospital. To build her I used 'color' medal, strings so it can strich, a switch so you can change the language you want her to talk it has English, Spanish,French, German, Italian and,Russia! Wheels to carry a person if they are tired of walking, or just for fun if your bored. I put a basket inside her so you can put things inside her and carry things in-side if you cant carry many stuff  in your hand your promblem is solve. I guess she is really speacial for me. Oh yeah she has a rocket behind her back for an emergency if i forgot anything she can go get it speedy quick. She lastes about 10-14 years if you take good care of her she'll probaly last longer time. She only can work for 65 hours a day.                   Lexis is a hard worker because she can make a garden really pretty she'll water them ever 2 days cause if you water it to much the flowers can die only if it's really hot out-side and the plant or flowers are dieing she will water them and she will always watch them out side if they're doing good! But she can not drive a car shes not ready for that yet but I can teach her all those things that other robots can't do. Good thing I  invinted her because i feel much better with a hard help and her :niceness , smartness, respectful,hard helper,fun robot to hang out with,her freedom,and rescues she has done to other things or people. And if Incase you forgot something like muiltaplaction promblem and you told her before what it was she'll remember it and tell you, which that's her smartness and hard helper she is. That's what Lexis is to me and about her how she is and how she looks (she looks smart)and  it tells you how I made her. I would never get rid of her unless it breaks or something different thing happens.                                         Lexi's is a smart girl and a brave girl if she gets out of contral you'll have to give her oil and she will go back to normal again.she can react like a pet ,but not a wild pet. She is playful with other animals unless the other animal is being bad and being out of contral she will go out of contral too if she needs to which that's not very good for her to react like that.Lexi's weigh's 267 pounds not bad for a robot I guess. She can also build a hut or a house made of useless stuff. Robots are like reall helpful and strong/brave,but I bet robots are smarter than a human because all the stuff we humans put in them.

He was being reexamined by then.This is his story.        'When is it going to work!?', said Sgt. Johnson.'I thought you were an engineer!'.'Just a little more.', said Pvt. Benson. The robot then sprang back to life suddenly.It looks around and says 'Who are you? Where am I?'. Pvt. Benson said,' I reprogrammed it with a new speaking option that lets it talk.''I guess you were qualified for this job!' said Johnson.' Uh guys, Remember me?' the robot said.'I'll call you Claptrap from now on.', said Johnson. They then sent the robot out with a squad. They were traveling along the route until they were ambushed by some enemies in the jungle wilderness.

Like the gemi -scout this robot can throw us like pillows in a pillow fight. By now the robots have taken over the world [ this is in the year 3000] but the hover cars are the only way to travel. these past years have been hard for the humans who have not been captured yet. The robots can drive cars that are on the ground but hover cars are to high tec for them.            All right enough talk we need to move the robots always find us two times a day.The robots creator is a mad scientist whoose name is Dr. Crazy. That crazy man created the Dante 2 for volcano inspection then it went dead and evil. Here are some ways to stop a robot.   To hit them till they are scrap metal [exept gemi-scout]. To get a blow torch to melt them [ not dante 2].   You should always keep moving intil night because there are no patroll only at the base whitch has 50 robots gaurding it.

Robots are vewry helpful and without them, we most likley wouldn't have a lot of these inventions like cars or everyday items.   There is this obne special car called the google car. It is an automatic driving car. Thsi car may help with many things, like if someone is drinking and driving , this magnificent robot can help save your life. When the google velicle waqs being tested, a motorcycle cut them off on the freeway, and no one in the car had seen it. Without the help from that special car, that could have turned into a severe accident, and not onlyt for the people. But for the remarkable new car they had just invented.   Another robot can be used for scienticfic research, like Dante 2. Dante the 2nd was used for climing volcanoes. Dante was put on the line to climb up a riskful volcano if the scientist thought that it was unsafe or to life-risky to go up there. Dante ll would go up there and try to find holes or vents. This 8-legged robot would collect information from the hole and crawl back to one of the scientists.   Certainly, robots are used for anything, and there are a lot more tha I need to say. Like Mr.Gower and Gemini-Sout. My favotite robot would be Mr.Gower because it is so facinating that he can talk and roam freely around the hospital, collecting medicine and handing them back to doctors. There is certainly a lot more throbots than just 3 or 4. There are probably about 4 million on the whole world, or even more.

Little bit of backround, I live in new york and know almost every inch of it. Ok im heading to the test and going to try to pass ,obviosly. It feels like hours till we reach the place. When we reach there it feels like time slows down. I just cant wait to get my license to drive. The things i caould do without my parents, actulally spend time at partys instead of being 1/2 hour late and leaving a 1/2 hour early.When we walk in I give all my personal info and wait and wait and wait till i can do the driving test. Finnaly its time I step into the car and set my destination 10 blocks away, The bar. When I get there my friends cheer that I didn't crash the car unlike poor Mrs. Envers who lawn mower I crashed, (not my fault its her dogs fault, the dog got in my way.) I turn around and head back towards the drivers ed place. When I gat there im presented with two things. One my license to drive, yay and a texi cab awsome.       When I get in I decide to head to a party that night and see if there is going to be any drunks that need to be driven. sure enough there is two rich people whr drunkaly wave me over and gat in. I imput the adress into the gps and put on headphones so they dont hear the annoying directions. comming from the gps system. It seemeed though that whenever i needed to turn cth car started the turn a little bit before me.       That night i pick up my friends,  (im the oldest so im the only one with a car) and tell them my car is steering itself an all my friends do is laugh, and laugh, and laugh. I decide to show them but the car makes some mysterios wirring soundes and only tugs the wheel a tiny bit so they said its the cars normal swaying. Life went as normal I toured people around but eac time the car seems to be driving more and more. Then one day about a week after i got the car I picked up my friend from his house and took him to the drivers ed place so he could drive himself. That day i  imputed the route into the gps clicked go and the car drove itself entirely. My friend then believed me but warned that self driving cars were illegal. When my parents foung out about this a couple waaks later they tried to make it leagal for self diriving cars.       When we were going to the celebration for self driving cars to be leagalized in new york somemone saw the car was driviong itself and started yelling at me. Whiel he was destracted his car swerved into the rail in that we were all injured from a quite fast flying beer bottle and stoped us fom driving. When I fell I took the key out and the car stoppped. A stranger saw that my car drives itself and put the man who was in the accadent in my car closed the door but not befroe imputing the location of the hospital.       a week later the car had saved four lives and the press was going crazy. By the time we were done every state but new york had leagalized self driving cars. Whe I was healed i got to sighn the document that leagalized self driving cars. From then on I did a nice taxi scirvese and earned decent pay. At the end  I owned the major self driving car taxi servise, in the world.

Robots that help in the mines, explore vocanoes, are assitants in hospitals, can farm and pick fruit, dance, sing, their is even a robot that is a car that is self piloted. All of this has a huge impact on everyday human life. Some even save lifes in ways you never would've thought possible. You may even think that these robots are miniscule, or non-needed in our enviroment. Some inventors would beg to differ.        Gemini Scout is a robot that helps in the mines. This small robot is cabable of many things. For exapmle, it can collect information, climb stairs and take sharp turns, help hurt miners, and help rescue crews get to the wounded. This robot is small, but strong. Gemini is a remote-controlled robot, and the device to control it is similar to those in a video game. So if you have ever played a video game, than the controls to Gemini will probably be quite familiar.          Dante 2 is a very interesting robot that helps scientists in many ways. Dante is used to navigate volcanoes. It can collect information, find vents and holes in the volcano. The robot can also withstand extreme heat and would go places where scientists never thought could be explored.          Mr. Gower is a medical robot that helps in hospitals. Gower runs on batteries, and can work long days without fatigue. Certain features that this robot has are;   100s of phrases Can deliver medicine Dosen't need to be paid          This Robot would save many lifes and has a very high potential when they and if they are mass produced.           Agribots will also have a big impact on lives. These robots have been programed to farm, harvest, and in some cases, pick fruits. These robots are still prototypes are are being experimented on. However, that didn't stop them from making and growing their own garden.           The Google car is a car that is self-driven, or in other words, dosen't need a person to drive it. This is, again, another robot that has the potential to save lifes. The Google car dosen't text, drink, tire, fatigue, or get distracted whilst driving. The way that it works is the censors on the roof, back, and front of the car will sense where the car is going, and it will generate maps to the passengers while its moving, almost like a GPS. A problem that Google faced was getting this legalized and making a law that these can be on the road. Then, in Nevada, a law was passed saying that these self-driven cars were in fact legal.           As you can see, there are many robots out there that are going to, and may already, have a large impact on our everyday human life. These robots may even end up saving our life someday. Some of these fine inventions may not be available for quite some time, but we can only hope, that the wait will be worth it.

Robots can help collect data   4. A paragraph for each robot           Story       Robots are a new way to help people that need it.  Robots can collect data, save lives and much more.  They help scientist, doctors, miners and animals.  Each robot has a different role that is unique.  Some robots can move by themselves and some use a remote.  Some robots can climb volcanoes and some can collect data.  Clearly, There are many different types of robots and roles.        Robots can save lives by helping miners and rescue teams.  The robot that does this is called the 'Gemini-Scout'.  The Gemini-Scout is a remote controlled robot that does search-and-recuse work in mines under ground.  The robot is small and fast.  It is very strong and can carry many supplies for people.  It also has a two way radio to let the trapped miners talk to the rescue team.        Robots can also help humans collect data and go where humans can not. The 'Dante 2' is a great example of that.  The Dante 2 climbs volcanoes to gather information.  It looks for vents, holes or craters and collects information about gasses.  The robot has eight legs (like a spider) to make it easier to climb and get in small spaces.  Now, scientists can collect more information and still stay safe.       Robots can act like doctors too.  'Mr. Gower' is like a nurse in the hospital.  Mr. Gower is like a cabinet on wheels.  Doctors and nurses can store medicine a tools in there and Mr. Gower will bring them what they need when they need it.  Mr. Gower is also very strong and smart.  He can pull up to 500 pounds and ride elevators.  Mr. Gower can even talk.  Mr. Gower is now even helping to save lives.       Robots can even plant and cook. The 'Argibot' can pick fruit and vegetables and plant them too.  Some can move around and some have very long arms.  The Argibot can grow almost anything with no human input at all.  The 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology' is hoping one day the Argribots will become common of farms all over the world.       Clearly, Robots are a very good idea and we should make more.  They would make life easier for not only doctors, miners, scientists, and cooks but for everyone.  With this data and helpfulness they will one day make the world a better place.  They already are starting to.  Clearly, robots are the next generation of everyday life.

IT was awesome  i convinced my dad to pull over and take him home. When we pulled next to him he said,'Hi  it's a beautiful day today.'In my exited voice i said; it sure is.' soy we told him why we pulled over and he said he would love to come home with me. But when we got there he was not in good heath. So after a year past we no longer had a robot. So i decided to make one of my own, so i stayed up that whole night making blueprints but then i fell asleep after i was done.        That morning was nice and sunny great day to build, so i went in my back yard and started. I wanted it to be just like the one we had. It took me one year to do it but i finished he was awesome. he had awesome color he looked just like the other one!! But he needed to charge it took 3 hours to charge and by that time in would be bed time. That night i could hardly even sleep i was so excited. But i soon fell asleep. When i woke up i rushed Down to the basement And there he was he said ed hi and every thing like a human would say.        Then he  remembered he needed a name. So we sat and thought and we thought then we finally got it. His name would be Steve!! So that day i played football baseball and all kinds of sports it was the best day ever. That night i did not go to sleep me and the robot stayed up and talked about what we would do tomorrow. That morning my parents made us sum awesome breakfast. After that we did the same thing as yesterday but i went to the park instead to show him off. Every one was speckles they did not know what to do our what to say.

So I said to myself ' I should build a robot!' So I ran back to my house and told my mom that I going to become famous. She said ' OK honey dinners almost ready.' Then I started researching online wire work. So after a day or two I got really good with wires. Now it was time for practice.          When I was walking home from school I went to the store and bought more wire and scrap metal. I drew a design on my note book of what it was going to look like. Then I decided on a name for it. His name was Toby. So I ripped it out of the note book and put it on my wall above my bed. After that I went to bed. The next day during school I got really bored and started drawing Toby again. But this time he looked more realistic and colored! I got home and started working on the wiring.            When I was done testing the wiring I started working on the metal. I made the head in one week exactly. Then I realized that it was too small!! So I took the nuts and bolts out of it and put them in a little bag. Bent the metal back with some of the tools I bought a while back. I made a bigger head. I was very proud of myself. Then I showed my mom. She said it looked amazing. The next thing I did was put the wires in his head. I also put a voice in him. When I put the voice in him I also put a dictionary with him too so he knows all the words in the world. Once I was done with the wiring in his head I tested him out. He worked perfectly!!! now it was time to make the rest of the body. I got done with the feet that night. The next day At school I was very excited to go home and finis Toby. When I got home I finished the rest of him!!! Now to put the wiring in. I got the wiring in that night. But I didn't get to test him out. I was so excited I totally forgot about home work. I got detention at school. But I got home and tested him out. He worked perfect!!! He was the best robot you can get. We went outside and played everthing you could possible imagine. Everone was complimenting me on my robot. My mom also thought he was great he helped around the house and everthing!! We went outside and played more. When the sun went down we started our way home.

The most unique but terrible incident happened. It all started when we were making the perfect robot. We thought it was just an experiment ,but we thought wrong.                           In the RMI ( Robot Making Institute )  we decided to built a robot that can shoot lasers and stuff, but one day when i woke up and went to do lab I saw the robot move.I tried to figure out if it was a prank ,but it wasn't .I saw the robot  move .I thought in my head it's a miracle . But then I saw the robot move towards me , it took out it's laser hand and shot the wall behind me.I was startled, scared.I said to myself an said 'What have I done I created a monster!'                                       Since then the robot got bigger and bigger, until  I couldn't stop him .It destroyed the rest of the world along with my family.Now I regret every day what have I done now i'm alone.

Now we have robots to do amazing things for us. Robots may be the next step to the future.               First, robots can help us humans in many ways like driving a car. Then we would be able to text, eat, and do other things while the robot drives.              Next, I'm going to tell you about my robot. My robot helps me with anything I need done. First of all my robot's name is Lizzy. Lizzy is like a best friend but she is not living.               Also, She has done a lot for me. For example, she has a calculator inside of her so when i had forgotten mine she was there to safe me from getting an F in math. Lizzy has helped me to clean my room. My room always gets messy after a friend comes over. So having her helps a lot.            Finally, I think that if everyone had robot, they would be a great way to help the world. I hope that robots will save many lives. And help us more in our daily life's more.            Looking back on my paper, I'm glad to say that I think the robot stage is coming in to act. I hope more robots will be made. Maybe we will have new things for robots to do later on in the coming years.

It all started when a scioentist created a super robot that knew all the wrold's questions. Eventually it built its own army.       It invaded Washington D.C first, taking out the capitol was easy. Then it started to invade other parts of the world like Europe. It took thousand of people to take out the main computer, therfore all of the army was destroyed and the humans were back in control.

Jessica came over earlier to keep me company and knew I wasn't really sick. I was glad she din't say anthing. 'Fine, we will bring you back some egg rolls, stay here and do not go anywhere.' she said sternly as she and Dad walked outside to the car. As soon as door closed, I jumped up mand started yelling, 'Yes, yes, yes!' I and Jessica had planed this whole set up. I was not sick and now we were home alone and able top explore the house. My family had just moved in a few days ago, so we were ready to sneak around.       'Hey Isabel! Why don't we check the basement?' Jessica said. I responded by opening the trap door with a rickety ladder that leads down into the basement. I had to connect the string on the top of the door to the hook on the celing to keep it open. As we climed down, I began to rethink this whole plan. Here we were, climbing down into a small dark undiscovered room at the bottom of my house. I heard a thump when Jess hit the bottom. I fumbed around for a light switch. As it flickered on, I heard another thump. 'What was that?' I whispered. We both looked upward. The door, our only escape, had closed. The string had snapped, and the auto lock looked the door. The day we moved in, my parents had told me to always connect the string to the hook. I guess they hadn't expected the string to break.       We looked around for another door, but that was it. 'Why don't we make a robot?' Jessica said. She was holding up an old robot kit. I looked at the cover. Creat your own mini robot! it screamed in bold red letters. I dumped the contents on the floor. We connected all the pieces. The robot was a small little cube with wheels on the bottom and a control pannel on the top. I pressed one of the three buttons. The robot rolled forward, toward the lader. Sudenly, it started to climb up. It was small, but strong. It pushed it's little arms up and the trapdoor came open. It had been close to an hour since we got trapped, so we sprinted out. 'Can we be friends?' a voice said. We turned and looked at the robot in my hand. 'Yeah, sure.' we said in union. We took the robot upstairs and put him in my room. To this day he still stays in there. He even follows me to school. Eventually, we told my parents, and they joked that they were glad the robot didn't take over the house. We never did find out were the robot kit came from, and we never went back into the basement. 	JJ POS NN NN . '' VBD NNP CC , NNP , PRP VBP JJ , NN .

So that morning Cole went to the junkyard to collect some parts he found a some tin cans, a box of wire, a coat hanger, four small wheels used for a trycicle, a steering wheel, and a steel box. 'This should be enough.' Said Cole as he paid the man for the parts he needed.     When Cole finished his robot the robot was struck by lighting and began to move around on its own. Cole was terrified when the robot finally said 'Hi how are you im Bob.' Cole wanted to scream and run out of the house but realized that he had just made a real living robot with the help of lighting of course. He wasn't exactly sure how to react to his new invention so as the robot began to come towards him he decided to give Bob a hug. 'What is this hug you speak of, it feels... nice almost like a strong embrace from another.' 'Thats exactly it!' Screamed Cole as he tried to think of other things to show Bob. 'Hey lets go to the biggest rollercoaster in the country.' Exclaimed Cole as he already started to pack up. 'The only thing is that it's 6 hours away from here.' Said Cole as he put a frown on his face. 'I can fly there lickety split.' declared Bob. 'Okay then let's go' As they got to the rollercoaster Bob already began to get scared. So then Cole told him 'Hey being scared is part of having emotions so dont worry this is what I wanted you to do when you came to life.' 'Okay then I guess I don't have to be scared I should be, ah what's the I'm looking for.' 'Exited?' 'Yes! That's it thank you.' As they got on the rollercoaster Bob realized he didnt have to thata scared and rode the rollercoaster as hapily as can be.     After that day of emtions Cole and Bob became best friends and they went on many more adeventures. When Cole grew old Bob had to start taking care of, it was a good that Cole had taught him how to make homemade medicine with simp,e ingrediants. Unfortunately after Cole died Bob had no other uses and dismantled himself in Cloe's honor.

While I was busy eating,I heard a thumping sound coming from my room.Suddenly,everyone sitting at the table got very quite.Then I realized that they had heard the sound as well.My dad looked at me and said,'Why is there a thumping sound coming from your room?'I replied by saying that I didn't know.So I got up to go see what was going on but before I reached my room,I grabbed a bat-just to be safe.Slowly,I opened my bedroom door,and what I saw almost made me faint.                My robot was alive!I guess a must have put too much chemicals in it.As I tiptoed inside,the robot stopped moving around and looked directly at me.I was so shocked that I screamed,then the robot started screaming.Then the robot said,'Why are you screaming?'I said,'Because you're alive!''ell,of course I'm alive,'then she said,'I'm alive to help you out and to play with you.'                     At first I was a little nervous,then I realized that I'm pretty lucky to have a robot that is alive.After I explained everything to the still terrified people sitting at the table,my parents said that I didn't have to get rid of her.So for the rest of the night we sat in my room watching movies and playing games.I really enjoyed having a robot.

He was a fun and interesting robot that had many uses and was very helpful.  He was created by a scientist who made him but when he didn't work accidentally threw him into a bucket of toxic waste and then he came alive.  It turned out that all it needed was toxic waste to jump start it and then it would work forever.  The robot is used to take care of animals and play with them and something that is cool is that he floats so that he doesn't step on any tails or paws.  Those are some of the aspects of Billy.              There is a lot more things you will want to know about Billy.  He also has multiple extendible arms that each have a different function, like one has a hose to fill up water bowls and another has a soft hand to pet the animals and another has a kind of rough side to scratch them.  Also he has a treat despencer inside of him so he can always give the animals treats.  He never needs to be recharged because the toxic waste makes it so he is charged forever and also he has a built in system that memorize the names of animals and a picture of them with every piece of information anyone could want that he can print out at any second.  Finally he plays with the animals and helps people pick out the perfect pet for them and helps teach them how to take care of it.  Those are just some of the features of Billy.              Billy can help you if you run a Shelter or if you just have a lot of pets.  He is very helpful if you are at work or away a lot because he is completely self sufficient and never needs to be recharged and can think on its own.  But if he does need help he has a build in phone that he can call you on and ask.  Another thing is he can go and buy things for your pet like food, treats, or other stuff we have a company that delivers pet stuff to Billy within 30 minutes.  Billy is the best robot helper you could have.

Billy invented a robot, but was unable to program it. He tried, and tried, and tried, but it would not work. Billy's robot was meant to do everything in the world. It could fly and also speak. It could climb mountains and make smoothies. It could also type and speak Chinese.              Billy loved his robot. He talked and talked to it even though it was not working.He wished and wished, that he could actually talk to it. Billy worked and worked and worked, for countless hours try to program the robot. He even wrote down the information to program and worked a solution during school. He missed his basketball, soccer, baseball, football, tennis, lacrosse, cricket, and badminton practice to try to program the robot.              One normal day, when Billy woke up, he decided to give up. He went to school, and then to basketball, soccer, and then football practice. When he got home his mom said,' Billy something happened! Your robot started to work.' Billy was very excited. He wanted to show everyone. The President liked his robot and approved it. It became a world wide item.

It is also built to survive very high heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter,dante takes there place.           Dante 2 looks for vents,or holes in the crater in a volcano.Then the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the volcano,or vents. In the past, scientists could not learn much about volcanoes ,but dante 2 is changing that. Now scientists can study a volcano up close while they reamin safe in their labitories.               This robot can do very much.there are more robots that can help people, scientists and docters. this robot helps detect when the volcanoe is active,dormant or extinct.Dante 2 is very impotant for people.Dante 2 changed the world.

It sent shivers down the backs of the men on bord! The caption of this spaceshitle was not going to be scared of this noise that they were hering, no not him. He opened the hatch and regerted it the second he saw what was in here...a hole. A hole in the spaceship, that was not good for the men on board. As a day or so passed the hole got bigger and bigger. They had to coke down to Earth now or they would die...     They were crossing over an ocean so they started down but they forgot about the hole and the extreem heat... As they reached Earth the heat got worse and worse. till they could not stand it anymore. The caption opened another door at the end of the ship and jumped. The rest of his men followed him. Off shore a croud of people watched as they landed in the water and as the ship crased next to them. In seconds a resue team had gathered. In minuits the men where on shore. Only the caption had been exited to reach shore, because all but one of the crew were dead. 	EX VBD DT NN VBG IN DT NN , PRP VBD DT JJ NN , PRP VBD DT NN IN NN JJ DT NNS VBD IN .

The first robot did not understand the reasons behind the human choices and malfunctioned.The next robot did not understand how to convert words into sentences.Finally the next robot seemed perfect so they stared the test to make sure the robot was stable and it passed all necissare test to be sold to the public.The robot were called the smart-bot 1000. One day while watching the t.v Maddy daughter of the scientist who created the smart-bot 1000 got a surprise from her dad Rick, he had gotten her a brand new smart-bot 1000. She was so happy right away her and the robot bonded they did every thing together. she even named him mike.            The smart-bot 1000 was so popular the public could not believe how perfect the robots were and the robots were in such high demand that the company that Rick worked for told him that they wanted a new robot that was even better then the smart-bot 1000. So Rick got to work and all his ideas of new robots were not working out and it was taking him a very long time to create this new robot so the company put a dead line on him. He had to come up with a new robot design that was better than the smart-bot 1000 in less than 2 months, so since Rick was rushing the robot was not very stable but people bought the smart-bot 2000 because it was suppose to be a new and improved robot but right away the robot was showing a lot of problem so the company call for a recall of all smart-bot 2000. For months no one had heard a thing about what had happen to all the smart-bots 2000           Then one day wen the company was trying to figure out what to do with all these robots they noticed that one of the smart-bots 2000 was missing so they started searching for the missing robot.Then when they gave up on finding the robot they came back and there was the missing robot but it was turned on and was trying to turn on all the other robot that were there but when the robot relised it was being watched by the company security and it run off. they tried to catch it but it was to fast. But then the robot stopped and tried to attack them witch was not common for a robot to do to a person.So they left it alone so they would not be in danger.            A week had passed since the robot chase and the police department had gotten many calls about the robot and it trying to attack people and even animals and the police did not no what to do so they sent in the most trusted robot in the city witch was Maddy's robot Mike. Mike was very trusted because of all the great thing he has done since he went to live with Rick and Maddy from helping a lady from drowning to putting out fires in a local nursing home. He was also good at catching criminals so he thought that this job would be very easy so he said good bye to Maddy who didn't want Mike to go and set off to find this robot.             He went to the place the robot was seen most often which was an abandoned warehouse 2 miles outside of town.As soon as mike got there he got a felling something or someone was watching him but he continued in his search for this robot then with out hesitation the other robot jumped on Mikes back from behind and was trying to hurt Mike but Mike was very strong and he throw him on the ground. Mike then put the robot into hand cuffs and brought him back to town and the robot was destroy along with the rest of the smart-bot 2000 and mike and Maddy were reunited.

First of all, the Gemini Scout is a wounderful robot that helps miners get out of hard situations buy going mines and diging to them so they can come out of the traped mines they are inside.Next,Dante 2 does a job to help people get reasearch from volcanos to examine.Then, Mr.Gower is robot who works at the hospitals to help doctors and nures the pacients medicine and he is small so they really need him to get medicine fast.Finnally, the google car is a  self diven car that can take you any where and you dont have to drive beacuse computer based on so that the google and it also tell you news onit side like a bus.Defenitly, this robots are really intelegent and i like to see one day or ride the google and meet all the people who inveted them thats what i thought about the amazing story of robots.

One robot called Mr. Gower helps in a hospital. Mr. Gower stores medicine and acts like a nurse. Mr. Gower is capable of pulling 500 pounds and runs on batteries. When Mr. Gower has been charging for 2 hours the robot does not need to be charged again for 12 hours. Mr. Gower has other cool traits like being able to talk. Mr. Gower can say phrase such as 'Calling elevator' and 'Your delivery is here'. I think having  Mr. Gower as  my nurse would be pretty cool.               Another species of robots are called Agribots. Agribots are like farmers! They are used to pick fruits and one cool fact about them is they can identify the colors of they berries. At a college in Massachusetts students are working on growing cherry tomatoes with only robots. They made a greenhouse  and the robots do all the work from watering to picking the tomatoes. This robot may be on farms everywhere one day!                      A very long time ago an author, Isaac Asimov, wrote a story named I Robot. In the story there is a robot called Robbie. Robbie is a child babysitter and they go on many exciting adventures. When Isaac wrote the story it was fiction, but soon the story might be coming true !                      All in all, I think robots are making a huge difference in the world today. With technology more robots will come to be and become more and more helpful around the globe.

When you think of robots what do you think about?  I think about a robot that has features like humans.  Robots are intelligent, strong, and playful.          As mentioned above, robots are very smart.  For example, the Gemini-Scout it does search- and rescue missions.  The Gemini-Scout also carries food,water, and other supplies to people that have injuries. It can even drag hurt people to saftey.  The robot is small, but it is strong.  Wherever the Gemini-Scout goes it always collects information.  It tests the air for gases and imediatley reports it.         More over, there is another robot that works in a hospital with doctors and patients.  That robots name is Mr. Gower, Mr. Gower looks like a cabinet on wheels.  The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store away the medicine.  Mr. Gower can go anywheres in the hospital. He rides elevators, ster through hallways, and move around things.  He's like a little dervish running through the hospital.  All Mr. Gower needs is two hours of charging, then he can work at the hospital for twelve hours straight!           Futhermore, the HRP-c, is another type of robot.  The HRP-c is a very playful robot.  It sings, dance, and even play music.  A Japaneses robot can play the piano with its too mechanical hands.  This robot loves to play he has  a superb time playing well with otheres. The HRP-c are made to copy animals,too.  Directors have these types of robots to play parts in moives like dinasours, or gorillas. These robots are are made to be lifelike pets, such as dog, a seal, or even a dinasaur.  These robots have a lot in common with real pets.  These pets you don't even need to feed or take out.             	NNP NNP NNP . . JJ . . .

The main idea is that a robot comes alive.  Charaters are a girl named Jadya, her bestfriend(Cake)and a robot.  The story takes place at a school, it 5:00pm.                       First of all, there was two girls that were bestfriend who had to stay after school to do a project. There was dead silence until Jadya said,' I need to go to the bathroom'. So they go and while they were walking down the hall all of a sudden the light starts to flicker. . . . . and boom !!!!!!......the light go out.  Again ther was dead silence.....then they was a crash ( BOOM,BAM ) and Cake stared screaming like a little girl for help. But no one came.  Moreover, Jadya and Cake stared talking and then all of a sudden.....they see two red lights.                                      	NNP NNP NNP . NNP .

A couple of years before, his friends were talking about how great the movie they saw was.  Everyone saw it except for Robert. He was a loner and nobody wanted to talk to him. So he went into his lab and started making new friends, dozens.  Later that year he forgot about all of them.                       One night in 1956 he herd some screeching noises in his cellar, which he has not gon in for a while.  he got his lamp and walked down and saw someone moving... but not sure who.  The strange figure was lonely wanted a friend so it grabbed Robert by the neck and nobody ever saw him again.  But they did see a strange new man in town...

All of a sudden,our stereo started yelling 'Stop'! He told us that the song was getting really annoying and was on his last nerve.He yelled again ' You've played the song like a billion times already'. Very mad he said ' Can't I just relax when I want to'. I told him that apparently I could do whatever I wanted to because I owned the stereo.                                                                                                                               Then, he said 'I'm sorry I did not introduce myself, by the way my name is Bob'.'I think you can tell I am not very patient, at all'.'Also you might of noticed that I have some sort of anger issues'.'Will you two girls accept my apology and forgive me for being rude'?We said 'Yes of course we will Bob'.                          Finally,We both agreed that we already had to change Bob back to normal. Stephanie asked him'How will we be able to turn you back into a normal stereo'? Bob responded with 'I only turn like this when I get mad, so I got mad because you put the same song now mix up all the songs'.'Alright'we said 'then that will make him feel normal'.Before we knew it Bob was already gone , we did not even say bye.                     I will never forget that mean yet pretty nice Bob. That was the robot that came alive one day. Maybe I will bring Bob back another day.Also a little tip please do not try this at home.

'What will we name it?' asked Jonathan. Dr. Callington thought for a moment.'We shall name it KK-3.' 'Lets turn it on.' Jonathan pushed the on button, and KK-3 popped to life. 'What did you program him to do?' Jonathan questioned. 'I programed him to to mix characteristics of animals together. And if anything goes wrong, he has a laser beam on his head.' Dr. Callington replied excitedly.                                                          The next day, business as usual, Jonathan opened the cupboared that KK-3 was stored in.  He got KK-3 out, but it wouldn't work. Jonathan then realized he forgot to turn it on. He got a shock when he pressed the button, and KK-3 fell apart. 'Uhhhh..... Dr. Callington, I think KK-3 is broken.' 'WHAT!? DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG AND HARD WE WORKED ON THIS??!!' 'Yess...bbut' Jonathan started, but then realized Dr. Callington was laughing. 'That's not the real KK-3.' 'I am.'       'Dr. Callington' tore his face off, reavealing the shiny metal head of KK-3. He laughed a truly mechanical laugh, and shot a sigle laser through some science formulas, burning a hole clean through them. 'What ddid yyou ddo wwith Dr. Callingtonn?' Jonathan stammered. 'I put him.... why would I tell you that?' 'Because I helped create you.' 'Fine. He's in the animal testing room. Good luck trying to get there.' The animal testing room was on the other side of the lab, meaning Jonathan would have to go through about 3 doors. He was pretty sure he could outrun the robot, but not the laser. KK-3 shot at random, while Jonathan ran and hid, only to have his hiding place blasted away. He ran for the door. He made it just in time. Since KK-3 didn't have the best aim, it was now shooting down parts of the ceiling. Jonathan had already made it to the ATR, while KK-3 was still getting through the rubble that he caused.       When KK-3 made it to the ATR, Jonathan still hadn't found Dr. Callington.The robot had learned his lesson about shooting things, and now he started to glow. 'What else could KK-3 do?' Jonathan couldn't remember. A hologram of a kangaroo tore away from the actual kangaroo. The same thing happened with a tiger. The holograms got closer and closer. Now Jonathan remembered. KK-3 could mix animals. The holograms collided, and left a new animal, body of a kangaroo, head of a tiger. The tigeroo kicked Jonathan until he was out cold, and then delivered the death bite. Dr. Callington had been killed, vaporized by the laser, so Jonathan could not find him.                          	JJ VBD PRP NNP NNP VBD DT NN .

I asked him what he wanted. He said he needed a place to hide from the FBI. I asked why. He said the people who created were going to shut him down, because they think he is trying to destroy all of man kind. He said he wasn't. That he had been framed by an enemy of the name X12-FTY.       So I let him in. After, he said he was really hungry so I went downstairs to get him a grilled cheese sandwich and a juice box. He thanked me for my hospitality. I said your welcome ( even though I didn't know what that meant ). After He asked me what I would do if the world was taken over by robots? I answered I would gang up and try to beat the robots. Our name would be The Resistance       Then he said somthing into his arm  like he was communicating with someone. Then he turned to me asked me if my name was Tyrone? I said yes. Out of no where here pulled this super big shooty laser. He said 'You must be terminated for you are the leader of the Resistance.' I tried to to block the laser with my plastic pirate sword. Lucky for me the lasers weakness is plastic.

'I think i peed a little' Noah cried. then he turened around and saw two glowing red eyes. 'Now  i peed' Noah said like a little girl. Boom! again. the lights were back on. What he saw next was the cutest little dog.                      But there was one thing wrong. He had rabies! Fart as Noah called him chased him around the room untell fart ran out of battries. Noah felt a cold chill. He felt bad for fart. so he put new battries in fart. Fart sprang up in less then a second. the rabies were gone now Fart was dancing on his hine lages.                       It was 12 in the afternoon Noah Fart might know some tricks. He rooled over sat ex. the last trick Noah tried was speak 'sup buddy boy' Fart said. Noah fell backward and died.Fart attened Noahs fueneral and said he was a good crator everyone fled in terror. Fart stayed with Noahs grave for the rest of time.

No one thought robots where something of our time, however of the future. I'm an inventor and I've been fooling with parts ever since a kid. My long life dream.... to make a robot that comes alive.             I've done drawings  for weeks, looking for the right materials for days, and wondering where to start for years. In my garage this morning I decided to use one of the old blueprints I made yesterday, it was of a robot that was 3 feet tall, and was silver with black wheels to move it around. It was just a box robot.             I decided to go to the junkyard to find some materials. I see old refrigerators, tires, cabinets, stoves, and even some cars. None of it seemed right. Until I walked into a pile of mulch which had a metal box on it that was hollow and silvery. It looked perfect.                                                         1 Hour later               Well I'm back in the garage I snatched a bunch of materials and I've built the entire body so far. I need to put in some wiring and get some help too.   I  called up my brother he says he knows how to wire things well and thinks he can do it for the robot tomorrow.                  Well my brother is here in the same garage with a whole lot of wires that I don't know what thy do. He started stretching cutting and tying things. Sometimes he asked for the red or blue wire or simply grunted about something he was doing. After hours of work he said ' Should work now!' He flipped a switch and not anything.               He went to the store and came back with more wiring and a computer chip thing he placed it in did more wiring and programming turned the switch..... And   nothing. He said he'd come back tomorrow.             I woke up during the night hearing a loud bank of what seemed to be old tools.   Clank Clank! I walked in the garage and there he was the robot we put together.   This was the moment I had been waiting for all my life. I dashed into the house grabbed a phone and dialed my brother up to come over and see now!                He was here in minutes. He told me everything was working perfectly he could walk talk and even  learn new things. We knew we would be famous for the robot we named   Rockey.

The Gemini-Scout was invented to work in under-ground mines and farms.the robot is small but is very strong.when they robot finds trapped miners it can use its two-way radio to talk with rescue teams.If someone gets hurt it will drag the person to safety ,and it can also carries food water and other supplies that you need it to carries thing .The Gemini-Scout is very good help it can help with a lot of different things.       The Dante 2 was invented to climb into volcanoes to gather information for scientist.It is  very good with high heat so it will survive.It looks for hole,vents,and craters, then it collects the information about gases that came out the vents.Now scientist can study volcanoes.       The Mr.Gower was invented to work in hospitals helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients.The body has a stack of locked drawers for stored medicine.it rides on elevators and steers through the hallway to get what ever you need.Its so strong that it can pull 500 pounds at one time.It can also deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.           The Agribots is a robot that picks fruit.Its very good with farms.Its really not popular but the framers really like it .It now when a fruit is ripped,and when a plant is becoming dead it will water it and take care of it.It picks fruit up with its mechanical hands.           All of there robots are very useful we need to keep making them so they can do different things,and now scientist can keep doing there work         	NN VBN NNP NNP JJ NNS IN NNS NNS VBP IN JJ NN , NN , NN CC MD VB JJ JJ VBP DT NNS IN NNS WDT NN NNS IN DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS VBP RB TO VB VB NNS NNS JJR IN JJ VBP CD JJ NNS WDT VBP RB JJ NNS , CC PRP VBP RB VBG TO VB IN NNP NNP NNP VBD VBN TO VB IN JJ NNS CC NNP NN VBZ JJ CC VBZ RB JJ PRP VBP NNS VBN NNS PRP MD VB PRP$ JJ NN TO VB IN JJ JJ NN NNS VBN PRP MD VB DT NN TO NN , CC PRP MD RB VBZ NN NN CC JJ NNS IN PRP VBP PRP TO NNS VBG JJ NN VBZ RB JJ NN PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN JJ NNP NNP NNP CD VBD VBN TO VB IN NNS TO VB NN IN JJ VBZ RB JJ IN JJ NN IN PRP MD VB NNS IN NN , NNS , CC NNS , RB PRP VBZ DT NN IN NNS WDT VBD RP DT JJ NN MD VB NNP NNP NNP VBD VBN TO VB IN NNS VBG NNS CC NNS VBG NN TO NNP NN VBZ DT NN IN VBN NNS IN VBN JJ NNS IN NNS CC NNS IN DT NN TO VB WP RB PRP VBZ RB JJ IN PRP MD VB CD NNS IN CD JJ MD RB VB NN IN NN NNS IN NNP NNP NNP VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ NNS RB JJ IN NNS RB RB JJ CC DT NNS RB IN PRP JJ RB WRB DT NN VBZ VBN , CC WRB DT NN VBZ VBG JJ PRP MD VB PRP CC VB NN IN JJ NNS NN RB IN PRP$ JJ NNP NNP IN EX NNS VBP RB JJ PRP VBP TO VB VBG PRP RB PRP MD VB JJ NNS , CC RB VBP MD VB VBG RB NN

My mom replied,' Of course you can't Jordan,' (that was my name) This was the start of the reason of why I decided to build a robot (to have a friend all the time that always has time to play with me, since I don't have a sibling) and building a robot was easy to me because I studied all about it, but little did I now that trouble was awaiting me.        The next day, I went to the garage to find some parts because my dad was a mechanic. The second reason I looked in the garage was because the garage was a big room of junk and broken stuff which could go well for the robot. In the garage, I found batteries, the robots head, (which was from a broken toy robot) the robots body, (a not functional paper shredder because I had nothing to use) and the robots legs, (which were also from a broken robot) but no arms. I decided that I should look somewhere else because I couldn't find the arms so through the entire house and found nothing, but I still kept going and I didn't lose hope.        After a while,'That is it, I give up, I looked everywhere,' I thought. Then I remembered the time I got a bunch of claw grabbers as a prize, which was really convenient, but my mom kept it in a cabinet because it was to dangerous and she let nobody use it. That cabinet was in my mom and dad's room so I would have to sneak in and grab two for my robot. When I went in sneakily, I was really lucky that it wasn't locked so I opened the cabinet and I grabbed two cranes, but I was wondering why the cabinet wasn't locked even though the cabinet had a lock and why there were almost no more?        I started to assemble the robot, which I did in my room so no one would notice, which started with the legs. Second, I taped the paper shredder and the head together with the legs to make the robot. Lastly, I put the arms and I realized that the batteries were not needed because there was no where to put it.        Even though it didn't come alive I could imagine if it did, but one second later, it came alive! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it moving its arms and legs. It looked different than usual, but it didn't really matter. First, I thought that it was awesome how it could play with me, but I, then, stared panicking because I didn't know what would happen if my parents found out. I looked back at the robot, but to my surprise, the robot was gone!        I went down stairs to find the robot, but it did not take long to find the robot destroying everything! I realized that I should show it how to do stuff that is destructive so it won't destroy everything in my house. I started teaching the robot outside like how not to blast everything in sight and how he shouldn't run in the middle of the street, but the robot did anyway and was lucky that a car didn't come and run over the robot or if the robot pulverized it. after a long time of teaching, the robot learned nothing and I was at another hopeless situation.        Later that day, I saw an army van that stopped at our house and saw my robot. A man came down and asked,' Is that your robot because we are looking for a robot that looks just like that one.' I was worried because this guy looks like he is from the army and I think I am in trouble, but I tried to speak as calmly as I could.        ' This is my robot,' I replied.        ' Does this robot of yours destroy everything it sees?'        ' Yes, it does.'        ' That robot is ours which we trained to destroy everything.'        ' OK, I'll get him out right away sir.' After awhile, I came out with him and I gave him the robot and he said thank you and went away.        I went back home and I realized that the house was a wreck and I heard the garage open. I went up stairs and after a while I heard,' Jordan! Come down!'        'I knew I was going to be in trouble.' I thought. 	PRP VBD NN NN , '' NNP , '' PRP VBD , '' NNP NNP VBP PRP$ NNS VBP IN .

She was tested on for week and has gotten a little bit of food and no sleep she was allowed 24 hours of sleep before she starts training.       McKenzy, wake up! Fear wound me up tight. My 'bot was ordering me and I had no choice but to follow its commands. I was on a metal table with a white cloth draped across my body; hooked at the ends. This is what they call a bed? I wondered. Let me getchya caught up on the amazing, wildly fun, and very intresting (aka the worst week of my life!) travels of McKenzy Zyban!       I turned 16 a week ago (yay!) Same week that I was abducted by the Starr minions (could it have waited? no.) Taken to Starr Inc. (would have been a dream come true if I wasn't covered with a black cloth and knocked unconcious) Experimented on (that's just sick!) Got a 'bot brain plungend into mine (yuck!) have been having hallucinations for the past 3 days (One of the mant treats you get when you are sharing a body with a robot) have not slept until now (which I have only 24 hours to do) I'm aching all over (ugh!)   The door to the room opened and a young male walked in with a tray of food and some clothes.        'I managed to snag some clothes and food for you Kenzy,' he said in a low voice. His name was Jalen, I remember that much. As soon as his name came up so did a flash of pictures my robot brain has saved. He had olive skin and dark eyes. He almost never smiles and he cares for me like he did to his little daughter, who abandoned him for Mr. Starr. He still had that depressed look in his eyes.        He unhooked the covers and handed me the clothes. I put on the white tanktop and the white sweatpants and the grey sweatshirt my mother gave to me on my birthday (they let ust keep one thing from home).        I stole a quick glance at Jalen and saw his hunched shoulders. There were tiny gray hairs mixed in with his rich black hair. When he turned to get some of the food I saw that his mouth was turned slightly down. Not that he smiles anyway.        'It will be okay,' I promised, although I don't even have control of my own destiny. I put my hand on his shoulder and gently jerked him around so he was facing me. I looked deep into his eyes like I was finding a portal into his mind. He gave me a small nod and went back to preparing the food.        I slid onto the table and got to work on my shoes. I unlaced the combat boots and frowned when they didn't fit. Would it be a suicide mission to get boots that fit!? I wondered. I slid them on and went to the makeshift bathroom. It had a sink and a mirror. There was a small latch on the wall for the door to the toilet. I went up to the sink and quickly washed last night off my face and watched it rid my face of impurities. I slung my dark brown hair into a slick, high ponytail. I stared at my reflection. just a week ago I was a regular girl with thin, dark brown hair and pale sea blue eyes. Now, my hair was longer and bigger and my eyes were multicolored. That's the sign of a robo brain. I covered my face with my hands and spoke to my robot.         Listen, robo brain, I- I began        It's not 'robo brain' its Marlene! She snapped        Sorry, Marlene, I apologized I just wanted to know if training was at 9 or at 10.        You have 5 minutes. Go! she replied. I looked down at my watch, 5 minutes till nine. 9 it is. I snatched a peice of toast from the tray Jalen prepped. He was sitting on the table with a plate of eggs. I did not have the time nor the energy to scold him on how that was supposed to be my food. I burst through the door and sprinted down the hallway.       &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;       McKenzy has been working for hours in the training studio and has master some self defense kicks and punches. She has become an exceptional Covert Operation learner and is mastering mental preparedness. She was conditioning with her trainer when she is called to Mr. Starr's office.               I walked into Mr. Starr's office and took a seet in the plush brown chair I looked intently at the white desk and traveled up to mr. Starr's eyes. When he needs to 'talk' to you, you don't really talk. He signaled a gaurd to come. He leaned in and told him something. The guard glanced my way and locked eyes with me. I guped. The gaurd gave a terse nod. He walked over to me and grabbed my arm. There was a slot there for chip implants. Mr. Starr took a chip out of his compuer and handed it to the guard. The gaurd shoved it in and I let a little yelp escape my mouth. I slupped into the chair with my eyes closed. I felt no jostle to wake me up. Suddenly I bolted up right and my arm fell to my side.        'Process complete' I said without thinking. It was in a monotonous voice. I shoved the chair back and exited without a word. I walked down the hallway.       &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;       It is the next and McKenzy is off to training. Last night she had a test to do and is sore and drained (they took 1/2 a pint of blood to see how the electricity is reacting to the blood). she was halfway there when she was intercepted by Dillan and Penelope, the youngest recrutes coming in at only 5 years-old. They took McKenzy to a room at the back side f the facilility. McKenzy kept telling them to let her go and tell her where they were taking. Their reply was alway no. When they walked into the room They were joined by a tall girl and boy. She had ice blond hair and he had wind-blown dirty blond hair. They interogated her for an hour until they finally came to the conclusion that she would help them. Help them take down Mr. Starr.             'So, I'm supposed to just waltz in there and steal the mainDrive?' I asked.        Tanner sighed and ran his hands through hi hair. 'No!' he exclaimed. ' We will distract him and you sneak in and get the mainDrive. you will then plug it into the computer and delete the robot brain funcion. themn meet us at the entry. Got it?' I nodded. 'Good. meet us back her in the morning, okay?' he asked as he surveyed the faces of the people in front of him. We all nodded. he nodded to and held out his fist. The tall girl, Ryder, stacked it on top. Dillan and penelope stacvkedtheres and I beckoned me to do the same. Tanner moved his ontop of mine and and Ryder ontop of his and so forth. When it was back to order they then tapped each other's wrists and left soundlessly. As walked the lpng hallway, Marlene spoke to me.        Its your mission. Do you choose to accept it        Do I?       &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;       That morning, McKenzy comes back to the room. she meets up with the others and they prep her on what she has to do. They warn her that there is a system that sendas a warning out if there is something dangerous. They then part and McKenzy is alone. She hides behind a wall and awaits for her comrades to set off the diversion. When it goes off she aces in to fing the drive. when she does she jams it into the computer and disables the brains. she races out just as the alarm sounds. Gaurds come at her from all sides and feels like giving up. She then musters up her strength and kicks the first guard. She grabs a pole above her and kicks the next 2 guards. She drops on the next one and punches the next two. When they are all down she races down the hall to get to the exit when she sees it someone grabs her and pulls her back. She struggles to break loose but is able to she kicks her attaker in the gut and doesn't even look to see who it was. She runs to the exit and sees ryder. All i have to do is cross the threshold and I'm free. she tells herself. 3 feet. She picks up th speed. 2 feet. She lets out a breath. 1 foot!

170	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W	N	N	M	414265	6	11084960	Y	55103	   One perfect afternoon in Stevenson Ranch, Jeff was riding his bike down the street when suddenly out of the corner of his eye, he saw some silver shining object sticking out of the the ground on the side of the road.Naturally his instinct was to go and investigate, so he did and what he saw made his heart stop... He saw a Gemini Scout robot, the last of its kind. This could be a great discovery if it turned on. So Jeff went home and the next day came back with battery's and put them into the slot on the robots arm.This was the moment of truth, will it turn on or will he be disappointed, and what he saw shocked him...IT TURNED ON! This was a great moment but the question was what was he going to do with it. How was he going to persuade his parents to let him keep him if he wanted to keep him, so that led him to his next question, does he talk.'Hello', Jeff said to the big pile of rusted metal,(only his arm that was sticking out was shiny).And to his surprise a mumble came out of the robot. 'mmmm mmmm,' It was just a mumble, but can it get words out, he tried again,'hello,' said Jeff. And out of nowhere the robot replied,'hello'. Jeff thought that the battery's wont last long so they went home.         'IM HOME', shouted Jeff.The only thing on his mind was persuading his parents to keep the robot, so after hours of arguing and debating he finally got the yes from his parents.And even though that moment was exciting he still had two things on his mind, how do you care for a robot, and the ROBOT POLICE,They hunt down and lock up every robot they see because they think that there bad.         After the hours of researching how to care for a robot it was time to go to sleep, and as he was closing his eyes he heard the most terrifying thing he could hear, the robot police.He knew he couldn't just not answer so when he did they asked him the expected question,'have you seen a robot recently,'   'No', he replied   'Ok well have a good night then'   Jeff thought to himself that that could have gone very bad.         In the morning when Jeff woke up he knew that the robot police would be back soon and he would have to be more prepared. And out of nowhere when he least expects it they were there again and they looked like they had found something, (which they did.) When he went to answer the door scared out of his mind the robot police told him to give up his robot and when he went to go and get him they were shocked by the sight that they saw, they knew how rare it was and replied,'where did you find this robot,'   He replied,'just on the side of the road,'   The officer replied with,'this robot belongs in a museum.'   'why'? Jeff replied with   'this is one of the rarest robots in history'!   Jeff thought to himself, if he should let him go or keep him (not like it was his choice).   The office said,'we are going to take him and put him in a museum'.   So Jeff just went with it and said,'Ok.'   And from that day forward he remembered that he had found one of the best historical finds in his time.

I invited 6 girls from school, including my very best friend, Taylor. When we reached Jump 51-50 I leaped out of the car and greeted everyone there waiting. They all handed me my presents and I was so excited. We all went in and played for 2 and a half hours. Everybodies parents picked them up except for Taylor's, she was coming back to the house with me, to open up all of the presents.       When we walked into the house, having to make 2 trips for the presents we went up into my room. Taylor wanted me to open up her present last. First, I opened up Julia's present, it was a nail polish set. The 5th present was from Emily, it was an itunes giftcard.       'Now the moment we've all been waiting for', Taylor announced. I quickly ripped  up the wrapping and stared at the gift plainly. It was a metal robot.       I didn' t want to make Taylor feel bad so I said 'Thank you'.   'I know you don't like it', Taylor replied.   'I do, I really do', I exclaimed.       'Well, that's not really my gift', Taylor said, 'this is'. I   unwrapped the gift as fast as a cheetah.       'O, MY GOSH!', I screamed. It was 5 tickets to 1 Direction.   I couldn't help my self but squeeze her.       'Ding, Dong', it was Taylor's mom ringing the doorbell. I picked up the robot and placed it on the floor of my closet. I followed Taylor down the stairs and said thank you to Mrs. Valdez, Taylor's mom. Taylor left, and it was already 8:30, so I decided to go to sleep, because it was a long day.    When I woke up I could smell waffles and bacon. It was the first day of summer vacation! When I opened my eyes I saw the robot I had put in my closet the night before.       'Mom', I immeditally yelled. NO ANSWER!!!   'Dad', I screamed. NOTHING AGAIN!!! I jumped out of my bed.       'Good morning, is everything okay'?, questioned the robot. Without answering I ran into Cassidy's bedroom, woke her up and explained what has happened. She hopped out of her bed and sprinted into my room.       'Hello, what do you want'?, Cassidy calmly asked the robot.       'What do you mean, I am Claire's best friend', the robot replied.       'How did you get out of that box?', I said pointing to the floor.       'Easy, I used my scissors', the robot exclaimed.       'What is your name?', Cassidy questioned.       'McKenzie', the robot answered. McKenzie, showed me and Cassidy everything she could do. She was awesome. We played for hours together, because she could make anything I   said appear and tranform into anything.       I ran to the phone, which was ringing, 'Hello mom, you'll never believe this, there is a robot named McKenzie that Taylor gave me for my birthday and it could talk and do everything I tell it to do.'   'Wow, I'll be home in 2 minutes', my mom said sarcastically. I told McKenzie that my mom would be home in a minute. I also told her my mom loved oatmeal raisin cookies, so she got a plate and put a bunch of oatmeal cookies on a plate. When my mom got home McKenzie handed her the plate. My mom wouldn't accept them. Cassidy came down and greeted my mom.   'Claire, may I speak to you in the kitchen?', my mom asked.   I obviously said yes.       'Claire, I want this robot to leave, who knows what it's planning?', my mom said.       'Mom, she is completly harmful, she is so sweet and she is not planning anything', I explained.       'Claire Bridget Johnson, you better listen to me and make this robot leave by next week!', my mom shouted. I stormed away and ran into my room. McKenzie joined me and calmed me down. She gave me some oreos. I told her everything my mom had said, and she understood. I also told her we needed to come up with a plan so my mom would let her stay.   I heard a knocking on my door and said 'Who is it?'       'Cassidy', Cassidy replied. 'Are you really upset', she asked.       'Yeah', I said. She explained to me mom just wants me to be safe. I already knew that. McKenzie left and went down to my mom, she came back in 2 hours and said that she was allowed to stay as long as she wanted to. I had no idea what she said but my mom came up and told me she was sorry. She said McKenzie was a great role model. I agreed with her and we had a group hug. McKenzie gave us all ice-cream.

173	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	414302	6	11084974	Y	55103	 I felt something behind me,staring at me as I turned I saw this big robot trying to attack me I tried to make a run for it but the robot was too fast, he was just about to grab me when I woke up to being drenched in sweat.It was just a dream from the horror movie I watched the night before,I glanced over at my alarm clock it was eight o'clock.......school!As I rushed out the door from the corner of my eye I thought I saw a shadow move I looked over,nothing.I walked into the office and got my late slip,but when I got into my classroom things got wierd.The sky became dark and the wind blowed like crazy,making the fall leaves go everywhere.Just then the lights began to flicker and the windows flew open my teacher walked over and closed them.My walk home was normal and the wind stopped blowing,But when I got home I found something unusual.After I finished my home work I decided to look around in the attic to find some old antics,but what I found was way better.As I moved some things around something shiny flashed my eyes, ow I said I walked toward the shiny antic. It was a ball, a big golden ball I was just about to put it back when it formed into a tiny robot but for some reason I knew he was good.He spoke and said;Hello my name is Steve.I greeted him back and said;Hello steve,my name is a.j.So where did you come from I asked,I don't know said Steve I got amnisia on the way in a strange transportation that landed in your backyard.IN MY BACKYARD! I hollered.I looked out the window of my room and saw a huge space ship,I've got to get rid of that ship before my parents get home I mumbled.Suprised that Steve heard me he said; don't worry along the way after I bumped my head I found this remote for the space ship, as I pressed the buttons they each did different things and one of them made it invisable.He pressed a button and the space ship was gone see Steve replied.Okay that problem is solved but what about you?What about me? Oh you mean if your parents will see me, that's easy I'll just stay up here in the attic.Will you be ok up here alone with no food or water.Well I can't have water because I'm made of electronic things, and I can't eat human food.Then what will you eat?he pulled out a bag from his pouch that he has to carry stuff, after my injury I found this it said ''Alien food ''on it.Okay but if you need anything just stomp once and I'll be there.Three weeks past not a stomp but a.j just figured he was sleeping so he didn't bug him.Finally he decided that he missed his friend and that he would wake him up.He walked normal up the stairs so his parents wouldn't be suspicious.When he opened the attic door he whispered;Steve,he said it a little louder ;Steve.Finally he opened the door all the way and he found a note. The note said;Dear a.j I'm so sorry but I've found my family and I'm now in outer space I didn't get my memory vack but I will always remember you,your friend Steve.THE END.

He built the robot out of old armor he found in the tower which he had polished and some wire from is science lab. The robot was strong and carried a heavy ax and a heavy sword the scientist found in the tower. The scientist knew that the military would kill him if he found his location. He was an illeagal scientist who practiced illeagal sciences. that knight the scientist turned the robot on and it did something unexpected. He first threw the scientist against the wall and then stabbed him withe the sword. before the scientist could say anything he cut off his head with the ax. The military heard something and went to the tower. there they met the robot who killed all of them. the robot preceaded to the town which he killed many innocent people. Then finally a man came witha shotgun and a bayonette. It was a survivor from the army. he tried shooting the robot but failed. Then he saw the robots weak spot and took the bayonette, jumped on the robot and stabbed it in the back of neck. The soldire became a hero and was promoted general.

Today was the day. The day I got to work with my father.        'Honey! Go get ready!' My father shouts from downstairs. I lazily made my way to my bathroom and brushed my teeth.        'Circle, circle, circle.' I thought while I moved the brush in a circular motion over my teeth. 'Pancakes are circles. Man...I'm hungry. I want some pancakes.'        When I finished brushing my teeth I got dressed into my white, over the shoulder top, black tights, and my black and white vans. I grabbed my phone and headed downstairs.        'Good morning Roxy.' My mother said while handing me a plate filled with pancakes and some orange juice.        'Good morning mom.' I replied.        'Hurry up and eat because we have to get to my work at 9:00 sharp.' My father exclaimed, chewing on a pancake. I checked the time. '8:45' The clock said in big red letters.        When I was done eating my delicious pancakes, I picked up my phone and headed over to the car where my dad was waiting. He started the car and we drove off.        'So dad, where exactly is you're work? What do you even do?'        'I work across the street from the mall. I make robots and other new inventions.' He replied.        'Robots? You make robots?!' I nearly shouted at him.        'Indeed. They are actually very helpful. They help doctors, explore volcanoes, they can even play with you!'        As I thought about what he said, my mind started to think about the whole 'robot' invention. What do they even look like? I soon started to doze off.        'Roxy, wake up. We are here.' I heard my dad say in a sweet, angelic tone. I stepped out of the car.        'Whoa.' I said as I examined the gigantic building in front of my short, 13 year old body. As i walked closer, it was incredible. The silver tone, the amazing structure, the large glass dome on top. This place was unbelievable. My dads voice soon shot me out of awe.        'Honey, let's go.' He said a few steps ahead of me. As I walked inside a breeze of cold air gushed towards me, making me fall back a little. I gained backed my balanced and continued to walk down the, also, silver hall. We soon reached this large vault with a holographic keypad.         'Whoa.' I repeated. My dad entered the code and the vault door unlocked.        'You seem to be saying that a lot today.' He said with a grin on his face. We walked in to be greeted with chaos. People were running around holding different gismos and gadgets, there were people crowding around a small silver and,what seemed to be, blue figure.        'Mr. Smith we need you're help! Something is wrong!' A bald man shouted at my father.                                                                         My father ran over and started picking up all these tools. I stood there awkwardly and about 30 seconds after, my father finally looked up from his work and saw me.                                                       'Oh. I'm sorry Roxy. Just go to the gadget room and I'll be done in a second.' He pointed to a metal door. I started to walk over, but tripped on a dropped screwdriver.  While I was falling I hit a blue button. I don't think it will do any harm. I stood up and checked my knee. Great, I got a scrape. Oh, just jolly, it's bleeding too! Note the sarcasm. I limped over to the gadget room and saw what looked like a piece of metal. I examined it for about 10 seconds, but it suddenly started freaking out and moving around. I abruptly stepped back and watched it freak out. When it was calmed I walked back up and examined it.                                                                                                'Hello?' I said to it. A dash of fear is my voice.                                  'Hello Earthling. I am HTP-276. And you?' It replied in a robotic, Siri like, tone.                                                                                'Oh. Um. I'm Roxy.' I replied kind of freaked out. It wheeled over to me and observed my scrape.                                                           'I see you have a scrape. I will bandage it.' It bandaged my cut.        'Oh OK. Thanks.' I said.                                                                        'Do you like to shop? We shall go to the mall.' It said. I suddenly liked this robot a lot. I nodded my head in agreement and we went off to the mall.                                                                                                                               When we got back, I was sore. I can't believe my dad didn't notice I was gone. Sadly, it was time to go. I said my goodbyes to everyone and HTP-276. As soon as we got home, I ran to my bed and slept. Today was crazy, but I can't wait to go to my dads work again.

But not all the time, cause robots can be very helpful instead of evil. Here is a story on a robot that suddenly came to earth in the 1930's.       In exactly 1934 a robot named AGR, unexspectingly landed in Santa Clarita, CA. AGR standed for, Advanced Gaming Rover. Scientist toke this robot and studied it. This robot was put in a room with nothing for 3 years. And in 1937 a man named theodore went in that room with the robot and discoverd that it was a nice robot. But the man didnt know what it really did.       Next the man put this robot to work. The robot could realy do anything. It could fly, swim, and even clim up walls. This robot is four feet tall, and it could go as fast as a Bugatti. The robot could make alot of things, houses, cars, money, soda, and even a plane. As years went by theodore died. So the robot went to work for the fire department. One day a building fell. They put Rover to the test. After he was done he ended up saving seventy- six peoples lives. After that happend Rover was a prosperous robot. He was involed in every situation. Then in 1967, scientist wanted to know how he did all of the stuff he did. They did a quick research on rover. When it was over scientist discoverd magnificent things about rover. He has a special magnet in his body that tracks peoples iron in thier blood.They also figured out that he could build a nucular bomb, and he did.       Finaly Rover died in 1999, no one knows how he died. They ended up having a day named Rover in honnor for his bravery. Without rover the world will never be the same. Everyone hopes a new robot will come very soon.

My anger escaped me as I glared furiously at a rouge robot that was slightly damaged. I channeled all my anger into one last blow to destroy the robot. As rose, laser in my hand, aiming at the robots main controlling system and fired when a large green orb appeared around the robot. The orb deflected my shot shooting it back with an astonishing force that hit me in the chest. I had controll of my conciousness for a second then blacked out hitting the floor with a sickening crack while the stealthy robot snuck in the shadows.                   The year was 2035 where robots did everything. A human, as the robots called them, didnt even have to get off the couch if they wanted to go to bed, a robot would just carry them with padded hands so not to disturb the person they were carrying. Everyone was this lazy except for me. I was 13 and did everything myself and worked out and ran around the neighborhood reguarly. I didnt want to become, for all he money in the world, a fat blubbering walrus like the rest of the people in the world. I wouldn't like not being able to get up on my own and have a robot help me because i wasn't capable. These are the kind of things im against and that is why every morning my robot would try to help me up and I would defy it and make it go away for a while. Not being able to disobey orders, the robot leaves my room in a routine process. Robots were useful for some things like refilling your water bottle if there was no water nearby and I was thirsty. Small reasons like this are the only reason I keep mine around. I don't know why but for some reason I don't trust the mechanical beings.            I stayed fit for years before finnaly deciding I needed a purpose in my life. I didnt need a job because robots could produce however much money ou wanted. I was disgusted by that because I wanted the expirence of having a job and responsibility's. I knew was smart enough. Walking around town one day i saw a peculiar shop that said 'first ever robot run shop' it was called Weapons and Excesories. Mildly curious I walked inside where a robot greeted me and said 'would you like to try the weapon of the day?' 'Sure' I replied since I had nothing better to do. He handed me a small lazer gun that I had never seen before. It fit perfectly in my hand! The robot then took me out to the back of the store where it had a shooting range set up. There were 3 targets: a fake squirell that was 20 yards away, a fake blujay that was 200 yards away and a fake raccoon that was 500 yards away. Before the robot left he handed me a sniper edition of the lazer gun so I could hit the targets that were far away. Taking aim through the scope I focused about a half a centimeter above the raccoons head and fired. I missed! I took aim again a little lower and fired again. I missed again as i watched the aqua blue lazer fly past the raccoons right ear. Out of frustration I took aim directly on he raccoon's head. When I pulled the trigger almost intantly the raccoon exploded into millions of pieces leaving the base were it was held in a fiery inferno. 'Oh.' I said dumbly as i realized that the lazer was so fast that all you had to do was aim right on your target and it would hit. Quickly I took aim with the pistol and destoed the squrriel in a similar way. The pistol fired red lazers that suprisingly hit the squirell and insead of blowing it up melting into a red pool of boiling liquid. I began to take intrest in the robots craftmenship as I suddenly felt a little tired.            Walking back inside the shop the robot asked me if I had liked the test shots. I replied with a weary 'Yes'. 'Ah, you must be a little tired' the robot continued 'what I didn't tell you wasthat the weapon takes as much energy that it does if you were destroying it yourself.'. 'Great' I replied slumping over on a workbench suddenly much more tired than before. 'So for instance, if you had a really piled up amount of anger, hate, resentment, or were just really rested that day you would have more energy to use it'.  he rattled on as I lay doubled over on the bench suddenly feeling sick. 'how many shots did you take' he queried. '4' I replied. I can't tell if robots have suprise in their voice but if there was this was definetly the time I noticed it because the robot 'O my, the most I have taken without running out of energy was 3!' He continued to mutter to himself and I caught little bits and pieces of what he was saying like 'To think that a human could be stronger than a robot!'. A couple seconds later he replied and said 'You should be heading home'. I stopped his attempted motions to push me out the door with a difiant 'Wait!', 'how much do you want for the weapons' I said. The robot turned and returned with the pistol and Sniper versions of the lazer gun and said 'You are the first to come to my store and purchase so I will not charge you in electrobytes. All I want you to do is go home rest and be safe with these extremely dangerous weapons.' 'Okay' I hastily replied as I let my robot carry me home. For once I wasa happy that I had the robot to carry me home and praised him the second I was in my bed and drifted off to sleep.            The next day when I woke I again defied my robot's assistance and climbed out of bed fingering the weapons on my dresser. When I got outside robots were roaming the streets. I jumped in surprise as one pointed a metal finger at me and said 'your doom is coming soon'. That sounded more like a prophecy than a statement and quickly closed the door saying in my room the rest of the day. The next day the robots were still patrolling the srteets and confused asked my robot wat was going on and after he declared that he didn't know I ordered him to get me the highest quality armor at the weapon store. looking through my window at the robots I began to see some of their eyes glowing red hot like embers in a fire. almost insantly my robot returned to my room with a metal chestplate, leggings and a helmet which I quickly slipped on. He also produced 5 half yellow half green bolts of some sort. 'The robot manager at the store said you might need these due to the robot infestation but he said only to use them in dire need.' 'What happened' I asked 'The Director of the RMC, robot manufacturing company, shut down the factory. All of these robots have gone rouge swearing revenge on him if they find him.' 'Thats great' I said loading my lazer sniper with the new bolts. going to the window I took aim at a rouge robot and fired.             At first I thought it did nothing then after a second a shock wave began to progress through the lines of the robots disabling them all one by one. All had been disabled except for one that looked at me. It was larger than the others and had lots of weapons. It fired a rocket while my robot put up a sheild to protect me but got knocked backward into my bedroom wall in the process. I was a little angry that the large robot had  damaged mine. I walked outside with my pistol in hand and turned toward it facing it like it was a quickdraw in the old west movies. I drew, fired and hit the robot in the chest catching it off gaurd and doing a little damage but not melting it. It fired at me slicing through my armor and grazing my arm.I fired again and again until I was low on ammunition. Deciding it was no use I crept back inside. I decided to go around the back of my house and take refuge in someone elses house so the 1 rouge robot would't find me. Creeping along at the pace of a snail I finally reached my destination. As soon as I went through the back door, which I dicovered that was open, my jaw dropped to the ground.            The house was in ruins; bookshelves, doors, clothes,walls to bedrooms, and couches flipped upside down and torn to shreds cluttered the ground. Exploring a little further by going up the ragged stairs I looked around for anything useful or any sign of a human that once lived here. After discovering nothing I went back downstairs to hear a dull 'Thump' 'Thump' in one of the closet doors. I walked up to it for a second drew my weapon and flung the door open. Out fell a lean man that was bound and gagged. Blood dripped across his face as he hit the floor with a cry. Untying him but still keeping my weapon at the ready I noticed a patch on his right shoulder. It read 'Manager of RMC'! Dumbsrtuck I realized that the Robots had attacked this man because he shut down the manufacturing company that was making more robots. Groggily the man began to sit up and mutter something uncomprehendable. About 5 minutes passed before began to make some sense. I heard small parts like 'robots!' and 'no!'. Curious I waited for the man to recover enough to share his story. But as soon as he saw me he jumped back in suprise and hit his head on a table leaving him unconcious again. Not deciding to waste time I went to the window and surveyed the area for the 1 large and actually quite terrifying robot. He was no where in sight until I strained my eyes to see the very corner of the street where he was disapearing around a corner. Eager to see where he was going I started to slip out of the house, but the man was beginning to stir on the floor. Trying one last time I shook his shoulder trying to wake him up and finally he opened his eyes and I held him in place as to not let him hurt himself again. 'Who are you!' he demanded in a deep voice. 'A friend,' I replied 'and all I would like to know is if you have any idea why the robots are attacking and any information on the larger one with glowing eyes.' Yeah' he said 'I know about the big one. He was my robot and friend until I closed the  factory. Actually he may be trying to work the factory himself right now! I had better get over there!'  'No' I responded in a harsh voice 'you are in no condition to be fighting robots right now. But do you know how to destroy him?' 'Just melt his controlling pannel' the man said in a shaky voice. Blood was streaming out of his arm in addition to the small cut he had on his head. Unwillng to leave him like this I searched arond the house until I found what once was a bathroom and looked inside the cabnets until I found a first aid kit with bandages and wrappings. Returning to the room where the man lay unconcious yet again but this time from loss of blood I wrapped up all of his wound until it stopped bleeding and his heart was pumping normally. I pursued the robot with pure fury filled within me for what these robots had done to this man. Finding the factory fairly easy I walked inside to see the one robot in command hunched over a large pannel of buttons looking for the right one to press. Almost as soon as I walked in, weapon drawn, the robot whirled around with frightening speed and fired multiple lazers. Jumping to the side and watching the lazers explode in a shower of sparks on the wall I got up and channeled all my fury into one last blow. Aiming at the robot's controll system I fired. Just before the lazer hit, the robot created a green orb around it that blocked my shot and sent it richocheting back and hit me in the chest. I had conciousness for one second as I saw the robot slink into the shadows and then I blacked out.            Waking some time later to find my body aching I realized that my armor had melted off due to the shot I took at the robot.  Walking was hard for me since the groung seemed to be spinning below my feet so I crawled to where the robot had been when I was knocked out. Finding no trace of him I searched the factory for more clues as to where he went. Around the third bend I came up sucessful as I peered at him. He was at another controll pannel and this time turning gears and pressing buttons which meaned he had figured out the code. From my hiding place I drew my pistol ever so discretly took aim at his controlling pannel and was about to fire when my shoe rubbed against the concrete making a screeching sound. This sent him whirling like a top as he searched the room for me. I realized that I couldn't fail because I had no armor to protect me now. As he circled a corner in the room his controll pannel came into sight. I had little strength left but took aim and fired not heeding the robot at the weapon store's warning about overexerting myself. The lazer found its target and the room exploded with sparks as I backed around the corner to safety where I suddenly felt as if my breath had been taken away and at the last second, when I was sure that I would sufficate, it came back to me. I passed out wanting to do nothing more than sleep. I must have been out for a couple days because when I woke it was raining outside and the streets were deserted.            I quicky ran to the house where I left the man laying on the floor and found him exactly as he was before I left. After contacting the ambulance immediatly, they took him away and said he was going to be fine.  Going home and waching the news revealed that people were begining to come back out of their homes because they were previously hiding from the robots. The news reporter also said 'A heroic kid that was about 13 years old had been seen following the robot that put this town into destruction and destroyed it but we don't know who this kid is or where he lives!'. Good I thought to myself very good I don't think we are going to have any more robot problems for quite some time.

I screamed with pain and I swung my sabre and cut his hand off he then shouted 'die'!!! and charged me with the knife in his right hand i shot him in the chest he fell and got back up with oil dripping from his chest and ran at me i then swung my sabre and cut his head off. it was over. my leg was bleeding and i needed help fast. i grabbed my phone and called an ambulence and went to the emergency room were i got treated. and after my surgery they asked me what happened and when i told them they just laughed i then asked to go home when they took me and I showed them the robot carcass they gasped and called the police the police took me in and questoned me i told them everything. after a few minutes they told me i could go home and i said ''finally''.

She can go to the store for you.I will give her my shopping list and the money.I will teach my robot how to dance and sing.I will teach her how to ride a bike.And I will also teach her how to write and read.This story is a lot cool.I will say would you want to know how to use the computer.

The robot i thought was cool and helpful was  the agribots it can pick fruit for.Agribusiness are good for farmers.                         The agribots are very helpful they pick the fruit that is just rite they can pick berries,oranges ,grapes or apples or any other fruit. In japan there is a strawberry-picking robot but a agribot dose'nt just pick strawberry it picks all the fruits thats why i think a agribots are betterthan just a strawberry-picking robot.Thats why farmers want the agribots because it is very helpful not just to farmers but to every one.it is good for any buisness that has to do with fruit and if it is well the agribots are their to help you.                              The agribots are not that helpful because there are othere robots that can help you whith evry thing and the agribots only help you whith picking fruit they cant help you whith eny othere thing.And ther robots that can do any thing go in the water bring you things take you to the hospitel so the agribots arnt the best robots.There are very helpful robots but the agribots are helpful but there are more helpful robots cool robots robots that help you pick up fruit like the agribot there are some that go unber water.THe robots are cool helpful all of the robots are heloful thats why you now what kind of help you need evre one needs a robot for diffrent things thats why there are diffrent robots.

Than all the sudden they heard a really loud BONK! on the roof. John said 'what on earth was that?' 'I don't know hunny.' answered Sally 'daddy why don't you go and see what it was?' 'okay I will you guys stay in the house though. I'll be back as soon as I possibly can.'                            So John went to go see what the loud BONK! was that they all heard. He climbed up on the roof and saw a small object that looked very complicated and hard to figure out. he slowly made his way over to that area of the roof. and the object made a odd beeping sound.   John got a box and put the strange object in the box and went back down the ladder into the living room. 'Look what  I've found everyone!' yelled John.  'what is it dear?' asked Sally.                         'oh I don't really know actually, but  I'm sure someone could find out what it is.' said John. Than the odd thing made a barking sound. 'daddy you don't know what a dog is?' asked Jane. 'hunny it is definitely not a dog.' answered John. Sally said 'let me see it.'. 'okay. be careful.' said John. Sally looked in the box and saw a mechanical looking puppy. 'awww a puppy!' yelled Jane. Than the strange object jumped out of the box and barked and yelped all over the living room. John and sally were scared and didn't know what to do about this strange thing that was jumping around their living room. While little Jane just danced and played and chased the odd thing.                      'hunny, Jane get away from that thing!' yelled John 'I just wanna play with it though daddy.' 'you don't know what it could do.' said Sally. Than John got up and trapped the odd puppy under the box. He than ran to the kitchen and called the neighbors who were suppose to come over for dinner and said 'sorry but we are having troubles and we can't have you over tonight we are going to have to rescheule for another time, sorry.'                     'we are going to have to do something with that thing.' said Sally. 'do we have to get rid of it?' asked little Jane. 'if you think we are going to keep that thing you are crazy!' said John. 'but daddy I wanna keep him he's my friend, he said his name was Barber zox lee.' said little Jane. 'are you talking to him?Is he talking to you?' asked John 'he's nice daddy.' said little Jane. 'how do you know?' asked Sally. 'he told me himself. Just let him out he could tell you too but you won't listen well enough!' whined little Jane.                       'That's obsurd!' said John. 'He looks like a robot pet.' said Sally. 'Ya thats what he is, he told me that too. He said he was from planet THE FUTURE, and he was here because his parents or owners kicked him out. He said he was just out exploring one day and than he fell off of there planet.' said little Jane. 'How is it possible to fall of of a planet?' asked John. 'He said his planet is a cube and it has no gravity. okay?' 'okay answered Sally and John.' 'So can't you just let him out he just got a little exited and you dont even have to worry about letting him out to got to the bathroom.' said little Jane. 'I guess we can try him out for a week or so, but if he does anything that he's not suppose to, he's outta here!' said John 'Okay daddy.' said little Jane.                            Then after a while the family had a wanderful time playing with there new puppy nut they continued to call him Strange as his name. They went  on walks in the park, played fetch, and even slept together. Theonly thing was that Strange was meant to last forever and little Jane grew up to be big Jane and went to colledge with her little Strange. Than when Jane became an adult she still had her little Strange. One night when Jane was sleeping she heared a really loud crash her and her husband Jack got out of bed and went to see what it was. there two kids May and Charlie got out of there beds too to see what was going on.                      Jack told his family to stay in the house. Jack went outside and in the snowey fluff layed a small mechanical device that was in the shape of a cat.

He came in and we started watching things on a channel that was all about robots.  After a while I got up to get a snack,  I reached into the fridge to get some left over spaghetti all of the sudden when I put it into the microwave there was a large 'BOOM'.                                                     The boom knocked me down on my feet, so I got up and the microwave was beeping.  When I opened the door to get my spaghetti a small baby liked thing did the robot walking out of the microwave.  I screamed and ran into the living room,  I told my brother there was a baby doing the robot in our kitchen.                                                        He told me I was crazy and turned the volume on the television  up.  Walking into the kitchen I was scared to death, so I closed my eyes and went to the counter.  A baby robot was in my kitchen taking pictures of all my appliances.  It looked at me straight in the eye and drove behind the trash can.                                                        When I took a look behind the trash can I sall a small but rusty little robot.  I asked it where it was from and how it got here.  It said 'My master Steve Jobs from my home planet Apple sent me here to look for some of his stolen products'.  He found out that my house has no stolen stuff from his planet and toke off through our chimney to his planet.

He was already in a t-shirt, old pair of jeans, black boots and hard helmet and gloves in his hands. Bob was waiting for is buddy Jeff. Bob and Jeff always went to work together since they were neighbors. When Jeff finally got there they both got in Bobs truck and headed for the mines.                  When  they got there they both got right to work because they new if they didn't start now it would be dark before they made it home. A couple hours into the job Jeff found what  he thought was an old robot.'Bob come here think I found a robot!' Jeff explained.Bob quickly ran over to him. 'We should take it to the mechanic so he can fix it,'Bob says.                  The next morning Bob took it to the mechanic on the far side of town.'I've what appears to be a robot here,'says Bob.'You sure do,Bob. This robot was used to save you miners when you were trapped, and would check the air for any gases, and would help lifting coals.  If you want I can repair and it would be ready in two days.' the mechanic replies.'That would be great'says Bob.                   The next two days went by slowly,  but when the day finally came Jeff, Bob and all the other minners were exited. Bob quikly rushed over to the mechanic to pick up the robot.  When Bob and the robot got to the mine they quikly got to work. Life in the mines became much easier all the miners didn't have to stay late to finish up, infact on good days they went home earlier.

'Wheres my screw driver' 'Wheres the hand' Jake would constantly be talking to him self.   He is a nervous wreck. Jake is a 26 year old scientist. He always dreamed about robots. Always make little toy robots. Until he grew up and went to college. Now he has a better idea. A bigger idea. A world changing idea. It was to make a robot, not just a small little toy robot. but a big robot. A robot that would do anything you controlled it to do.          'Just one more part. Wheres my controller?' Jake asked him self.          'Ahh here it is.' He bluetoothed the controller to the robot. Sucess. Now he just had to turn it on. It all comes down to this part right here.          ' Come on, work for me.' Jake was having no such luck. He would turn the controller on and off. No luck. He would take parts off, clean them and put them back in. Still no luck. Jake just couldnt find the problem. Jake kept trying more and more things un till all of the sudden it was 12:30. He figuared he would go to his small appartmant fit just for him with one bedroom, one bathroom, with a small kitchen and living room, and try again tomorrow. 'RING RING RING RING' snooze.          '6:45 already? I have to get a closer job dont ya thing Pappi?' Pappi was Jakes little black and which collie mix dog. He would sleep with Jake every day and new what the alarm clock met. whever it would go off pappi would start barking saying get up and let me to outside. Jake put on his plain black shirt and soem bage pants and some dressy schools. Jake really doesnt need to dress up the week becuase hes been working on the robot and getting dirty, but he still wants to obey his works dress code. So he gets in his car and drives to work.           ' Hey jake!' 'Hey cody!' 'Heyyy Jaksterr. Heres your morning coffe!' ' Jessica! Your my girl!' This would go back and forth like this when Jake enters work. This science lab was hugeeee! Jake had to pass about 5 halls all full of offices to get to the back of the lab where his robot was. Right away Jake a sip of his coffe took off his coat set them on his desk and went to the back of the room by the robot and immedialy started looking for his problem. Occtionaly people would stop and ask what all the grunting was for and was to emmbarresed that he couldnt get this robot to work. You might say why would you be emmbarresed its super hard to build a life size helping robot but the people at this lab are super tecy and know everything. But finally he admitted. He couldnt get it. So everyone started gathering and helping until it got crowed. So they moved a filing table and there it was, the answer. the electrion box that makes it all run was under the table instead of being in the robot. After about 30 minutes the were able to put it in the robot and was so scared to try and turn it on. But finally, after everyone starring at it for about 5 minutes Brook took the control and turned it on.             ' Hello, What can I do for you?' said the robot. Everyone just starting clapping with amazment with a big smile on your face. This gets plastered all over the internet, the newspaper, anything you can imagine you would hear about it. But nows its time to put it to the test. A couple weeks pasted.             'Update Update 10 miners have just been cought it a mine!' Said the news reporter on the tv. It was a saterday and Jake had just got into the living room to hear this and immedialy thought. This is the perfect time to try out the robot. He quickly called everyone he possibly worked with and chated about it. They all met at the at the lab.              'Where was this mine accident anyway Jake?' Asked Brooke. 'About 30 minutes away near the tip of florida.' Replied 'Okay lets go!' Cody saod excitetedly. When they arived they all unload the robot and put it too the test. Right away it started digging though the rock and said Iv found them through the walkie takie that is programmed in its head. He made the path so that firefighters could make there way though and rescue them all. The robot passed the test.

They can help anybody  in various ways like   helping doctors, people in mines, in outer space,   and much, much, more!   I used to think that robots were scary when i was little, but now, I think they can be helpful just about anytime you ask for it.         Lets talk about what they can do. Maybe they can clean your room, or drive a car. perhaps        it can store money for you and go to outer space, but, it all depends on how you program it.         As soon as i heard about the Google car, i was overjoyed because technology cant get distracted like humans can. humans can text, as robots cannot. humans an get drunk , as of robots cannot do that. since there will be no distractions, there will be a lot less accidents including cars.   I love robots i thought. They are put up to very good reason, but there are some people who just might program robots for bad things too, and now for the story:              One day there was a girl named Ayanna. right now she is at school, waiting there, very bored, for her assignment. the reason she was bored, well, it had seemed that her teacher was giving the whole class the longest lecture ever about being a good student, or something like that. then, her big assignment came, anything about robots. It was due next Friday. The bell rang. RIIIIIIING! That was the last bell of the day, so she left school to go on her bus. While she was on the bus, she sat thinking about what she should do for the assignment and boom! She had an idea!!! she'll make a model robot.she worked all week, and finally, it was done.it was beautiful.she let it sit untill tomorrow, since it would be friday. She had a little dinner made by her mother, it was homade chicken noodle soup!! Her favorite... after she ate and ate and ate, she went to her room only to find that the robot was running in circles saying 'program me' over and over. After she did that she turned it off till tomorrow. the next day when Ayanna presented the robot to class she got an A+.  She got a happy note from the teacher saying she is the smartest student there and that she got an A+. Her parents and friends celebrated in her honor. for the cake, the ronot was so smart that it helped for anything they ever needed.           the end 	NNS NNS MD VB JJ CC NNP NNP MD VB NN IN JJ NNS IN VBG NNS , NNS IN NNS , IN NN NN , CC JJ , RB , JJR .

The next day he is on the plane heading for Virginia, it is at least a 2 day trip there. he doesn't know what the kids at the autismn school are going to think of him. His parents didn't even tell him what the autismn school is called? So Ryan speaks up and says 'What is the new school's name?' His mother replies 'Miranda's Autismn School.' 'Oook then?' Ryan said confused? His father replies 'You are going to so much fun!'                They are finally at their new house, which is located right across from his new school. That he will be going to soon in the morning. Ryan doesn't even know what classes he is going to take. That was the main thing that he was thinking about.               That morning. 'Ryan please get up for breakfast please.' Ryan does as he was told to do. He gets up, heads for the bathroom and gets ready, and finally goes down stairs for breakfast. 'Are you ready for a new day at a new school son?' Ryan's father asks. ' Umm, sure I guess?' 'Ryan you don't sound that interested, what's the matter sweety?' Ryan didn't respond. He just sat their and at his breakfast. They got ready to leave and Ryan didn't even want to go but he had know chose. They walked out the door and walked into the school doors and walked to the office from ome help from a teacher.        They walked into the office and met everyne in the office. The pricipal gave Ryan his schedual and his parents and him walked down to the class room following the pricipal. They stopped, and the pricipal walked into the class room and his parents kissed him on his fourhead and left. the principal introduced his to the class and they all welcomed him with delight. He as well felt delighted. His class was called 'Inventing,' he liked the sound of that name cause when he was 4-5 he used to build himself and his mother and father random things, and the still kept them today.             Ryan sat right in front where he loved to sit. The new project that they were going to start to day was building a robot any kind that they wanted. Ryan drew a picture of his robot just like the others in his class. All the parts that they needed were on the back table. Ryan was the 4th one done drawing, so he quietly got up from his desk and walked to the back table to grad all the parts that he needed, and the teacher, Mrs. Quill said that the tricky part was getting it to work. Mrs. Quill asked one of the other students named Jacob but everyone calls him Jake for short, to show him around the school after class.              Ryan was almost done with his robot which was small but looked like a human. Ryan forgot to program it to speak to others including himself and his parents. Ryan just got done working on his robot. He could speak to the robot and tell him whatever he wanted him to do, Mrs.Quill asked what Ryan was going to name him and he said 'Reggie.' After school he got to take him home and show his parents, Mrs.Quill said that he has to bring it back cause they are going to have a 'Robot Race!' Ryan was really excited. So he went to bed.             The next morning he got up, got dressed, went down stairs to eat breakfast, and then headed out the door for school. When he got to school he went to class and won 1st place in the 'Robot Race.' After he was congradulated he got a trophy. and took it home after school to his parents. And later in the school year He had a lot of friends.

It was in the middle of summer vacation, and I was really bored. I had done all of the things on my Summer Vacation To-Do List. I had already gone fishing, camping, hiking, swimming, I've slept in, went to bed a little later, watched almost all of the funniest videos on the Internet, played with my dog, cleaned my room, and much more. I have checked off every single thing on my list. but as I came down to the bottom of it, there was one thing left.   Make a robot.   And that is what I was going to do.   So then, I had asked my mother if I could go on an 'adventure.'   She then laughed and said, 'Be back before supper.'   Which was of course, 5 hours away. I had plenty of time to find robot parts. So I then grabbed my backpack off of the hook, grabbed my sweatshirt, my hat, and grabbed my bike from the garage. I then put my sweatshirt, my hat, and my backpack on, and I hopped on the bike and pedaled down the hill.   By the time I was at the junkyard, it was only 12:07. I have plenty of time to grab some stuff here, and then go to the store to go get more supplies.   I said hi to the gatekeeper, Rusty, and then pedaled past those creepy chain-link fences. they were all rusty, with barbed wire at the top. That always gives me the creeps. And then there is always the junkyard dogs, Spike and Lolly, but as they look scary, they're really sweet. They just are there to scare away the intruders who try to break in. But only by their looks and teeth bearing.   There were piles and piles of junk piled on top of each other, piling all the way up to the sky. But I don't think I'll need to go that far up to find some parts.   Just then, I saw this beautiful, glittering silver cabinet that was big enough for the body of the robot. That part would be the refrigerator of the robot.   I put that in my pile of supplies that I would need.   I pedaled around some more piles of junk until I saw the best pile yet. It had a go-kart! That will be perfect for the feet!   So then I had Rusty help me pull it out from under the pile of junk. I tried to turn it on. it started making this weird noise, and it wouldn't turn on! I guess I had just gotten my hopes up. But then, as I tried turning it on for the last time, It vroomed to life! Yay! I got so happy that I jumped up and started dancing with joy with Rusty. We danced for a bit more, and then I got back to work and asked Rusty,   'Do you have any small refrigerators?'   'Why yes I do! I just got a load of them this morning.'   What luck I am in right now!   'Could you please show me where they are?' I asked politely.   'Well, sure! So, what are you making anyway?'   'A robot!' I said gleaming with pride.   'Cool!'   'Yeah!'   So he showed me around the junkyard, guiding me where I wanted to go and pick out some parts. I had so far the body of the robot, the head, the refrigeration unit, the feet, and the mechanical arms and hands. Now, all I need is the eyes, nose, and mouth. But I'll pick up some of those at the hardware store.   'Hey Isabelle, do you want me to drop this off at your house?'   'Sure, that would be great!' I said smiling. (And let me note, he is my cousin.)   'Okay.' he agreed.   'I just have to run to the hardware store and grab a few parts. So you can just load all of those things into the garage, okay?'   'Sure thing, Isabelle.'   So I thanked him and said goodbye, and pedaled to the next stop. The hardware store.   I looked down at my watch. 3:02. I better get going if I want to build this robot!   I rode my bike down Main Street, turned the corner, and there I was, at Billy's Hardware Store.   I love it there. It's my favorite place to go to, besides the zoo.   I pushed the door open, and a bell rang overhead.   'Hey Billy.'   'Hey Isabelle. What are you up to today?'   'I'm building a robot!' I gleamed with pride.   'Cool! So what can I get for you?'   'Can I get two small white training wheel cover caps, a small plastic cutter, and a small gear?'   'Sure! Coming right up!' He walked around the counter, and into the small, cluttered back room. He came out with a small brown bag.   'Thanks Billy!'   'You're welcome Isabelle!'   So I stuffed that in my backpack and rode off onto Main Street.   I looked down at my watch. 3:30. Yikes. I have to start building my robot!   I rode into the driveway, and parked my bike into the garage. I found all of my supplies on the garage floor.   It had been chilly all week, but now it was getting hot out. I pulled off my sweatshirt, and grabbed a Popsicle from the freezer. Yummy, it was grape. My favorite.   I had then finished my Popsicle, and grabbed some supplies.   I was going to do a stack and glue method. I grabbed the go-kart, and set that on the floor. I put blocks of wood beside the wheels so it would not roll away. I then put Super Super Glue on the rim of the go-kart, then lifted the cabinet on top of it. Perfect fit! I then got the big pink and zebra striped jewelry box and put glue on the bottom of it, and stuck the box on the cabinet. Then I opened up the cabinet, put glue all around on the inside, and stuck the refrigerator in it. Then I glued the arms on, and made the face by putting the caps on the box for the eyes, the gear for the nose, and I carved out a smile on it's face. It was finally done. I went inside and went to show Mom.   'That is really cool! What is it's name?'   'Hmm. Oh, I know! Finn!'   'What a wonderful name!'   I then made her turn around, and then I pressed his ON switch. She asked what I was doing, and I said, 'Just wait.' And then, the arms of the robot started moving. It was giving her a massage! She thought that was a marvelous idea, and that she would have to use it more often!   She thanked me, hugged me and then we started stocking Finn's refrigerator with apple juice, oranges, apples, kiwis, and much more. I then checked off Make a robot on my list.

The first ever robot to come alive.  He thought, 'Yes!  I just need one more part!  I best go now, so that the store doesn't close!' Dr.Olson then threw on his coat and headed out the door.          A little while after Dr.Olson arrived in Ladysmith, he was by the hardware store.  He quickly ran up to the door and looked at the sign.  It said 'CLOSED'.  Dr.Olson was very disipointed.  He knew that another store didn't have what he was seeking for.  So, Dr.Olson sadly walked to his car.          'Why?!  This robot would of been so cool!  It could of gone up to 100 mph, talk, steer all by its self, gather information, go into places people couldn't, and either fold up really small or grow really big!  Such a disipointment.' he yelled to himself.  Off Dr.Olson went, all the way back to Bruce.  He walked into his house and hung up his coat and threw off his shoes.  He slowly, but surely, walked down to his lab.  He screwed everything back onto the robot that he unscrewed and sat down right next to it, in his chair.  All of a sudden, Dr.Olson started to hear sparks.          'Hello master.  What can I do for you today?' his robot (chucky) said, in a robotic voice.          'He's alive!  He's really alive!' Dr.Olson said, jumping up and down.  He laughed in excitment and screamed, 'Ya, who!!!' Dr.Olson ran all the way to the news station and told them all about it.          'A robot, you say?' the news man questioned.          'Yes!  He can go up to 100 mph, talk, steer all by him self, gather information, go into places we cant go, and fold and grow into surprizing sizes.  He's amaizing!' Dr.Olson exclaimed.          'Ok!  Lets make it tomorrows news, yes?' the news man said in such excitement.          'Yes!  That will work just fine.  But first, do you want to see it?' Dr.Olson offered.          'Sure.  I would like to see it... I'm looking forward to it.' the news man happily said.  Away Dr.Olson went, running into his lab.                                                        THE NEXT DAY              Dr.Olson got a call from the news man saying that he can't make it, but will report it in his news.  Dr.Olson was a bit glum, but he was still happy about his creation!  Eventually he was famious for his robot, and more and more invetors started to create more robots, such as R2D2.

Well scientists are creating them and soon they will be roaming the       world and help with all sorts of things they might clean, find drugs. or even mine but the robot I       would like would be short, bright red, and black and it would be able to make food, clean, able to       play video games, and able to serve you at all times. Now if you think about it it might come fast or       it might come slow but robots are going to help all of us in some way or another. They might                       Help in the hospital! Help out police officers! Help farmers! Help towns prevent floods! Help out jobs!   These are only 5 ways there are going to be a lot more ways! if we had robots there would be alot       more time to visit family and get more sleep but the jobs would go down because obots would be       doing the jobs instead of the people.

No later. Any robot who doesn't meet this requirement gets transported back to the Institute to be reprogrammed or disassembled. Mistakes are unheard of. Accidents never happen.   That is, until the robots came to life.       It was an ordinary at the ABC Farm, and Farmer Pick A. Lot was taking roll call of all his Agribots. 'Agribot 1a? Ah, there you are. 2b? Check. 3c? Splendid, splendid.'   So it went until he intoned, 'Now Agribots, you know what to do. You need to harvest the first half of the apple orchard. Now I don't want a single wormy apple in a bushel. ABC Farm stands for top quality fruit. Nothing but the best will do, understand?'  Always forgetting that the Agribots didn't talk, he rolled his eyes and huffed. 'Well, don't just stand there! Get a move on it!'       The Agribots rumbled off and started picking the fruit at an incredibly fast rate. They had almost finished the first half, and started to work on the second, when ominously dark storm clouds started to roll in. Thunder boomed, and the wind blew in, making the trees sway and bend under the stress. Rain lashed the trees and pounded madly against the roof of his house. Lightning crackled across the velvety black sky, and it illuminated the entire sky for a split second. Farmed Pick frantically started bellowing to his Agribots to get inside quickly, but his voice was lost in the wind. Without warning, a searing hot rope of lightning arched down and struck the robots with a terrific bang, showering them with sparks and frying the fruit held in the baskets. Farmer Pick yelled in anger and surprise and sprinted to his robots. The fragrant smell of baked apples filled the air, spoiled with a odor of burned rubber. He shouted over the wind, 'Agritbots, are you all right? Oh, what am I saying, they can't talk.' Then the Agribots started to move weakly, and a voice issued from it. 'What happened? Why am I all wet. Who are you?'  Farmer Pick gawked at it. This was impossible, but there it was. So with a whimper and a thump, Farmer Pick keeled over in a dead faint.       So for the next few days, Farmer Pick tried to keep the harvest on schedule. He took roll call, told the robots what to do, and watched them roll off. 'I must be getting old. Robots can't come to life.' But how wrong he was.   First the robots started picking the wrong apples. When he yelled at them to get the job done right, the robots complained, 'No good deed goes unpunished.'   Then when they actually picked the ripe fruit, they started to try to eat it. This resulted in much shouting and upbraiding on the farmer's part, and the Agribots just shuffled around and promised they'd never do it again.   Next they started to play hide and seek in the apple orchard, and Farmer pick had to look for two hours before he actually found them. He turned beetroot red and shrieked, 'That's the last straw! You are the worst robots I have ever had. I quit!' He threw his hat on the ground, stormed off, and drove off in his car to take a lifelong vacation from farming and robots.       Afterwards, the robots successfully ran the farm and prospered with their new job, and remained life long friends with each other. Farmer Pick A. Lot tried to explain what happened to authorities, but gave up after numerous suggestion to get some rest. But he always wondered what had happened to those three rogue robots who came to life.

It all started when we meet about a mouth ago when our teacher told us what we were writing about I was so excited to write because the topic was robots. We started to plan right off the back so we could write soon. I choose the Gemini-scout because its so cool it has all those atachment like thermal imageing, can go all terain, carries food, water, and other medical suplies. The story started like this.             It was hot summer day, July 2 ,2047 two day till the 4 of july two boys were so bored and hot they want to do somthing in side like build a robot or build somthing ingenral they started on the robot they were going to make asmall robot but they didnt do that instead they made a robot that you would see in the movies it crazy big strong and fast they turned it off for the night at least they thought they did but it was alive and running like a human he went on rampanges and destoed thing. The boys had to go talk to the president of the usa and explaned what they did then they shut it done an they now use it for the benifite of war.

'How Are you so sure Dr.Vrieze? don't you have to test it first?' said Dr. Danny. 'Yes but how will we test it?' said Dr. Vrieze. 'Well, this robot is used to scan for evidence in a crime seen, so we must make a fake crime scean for it to scan' said Dr. Danny. 'Yes tell the helpers to get a place like that ready for- (But before Dr.Vrieze could finish the giant window which was in the room they were in, 5 masked thiefs ame throught the window). 'Put your hand in the air!' shouted the head thief. Quickly Dr.Vrieze, Dr,Danny, and the other helpers in the room shot their hand into the air. The theif were armed with baseball bats and M9 pistols. The head theif took the robot from the table and motioned his team to exit through window with him.       The next day, on all the news channels they were talking about what happened the night before. 'Oh! what ever shall we do?' said Dr. Danny. 'Now just calm down Dr. Danny' said police officer jones. ' Those are going th be caught'. 'But how?' 'they were armed and we don't know where they are' said Dr. Danny. 'Are robots and police officers are looking through evevry buliding  to search for those thiefs'.       After a few more hard days, the police officers found the robot but the thiefs are yet to be found. Dr.danny and Dr.Vrieze thanked the police for finding the robot for them. More of these robots are being made and are being helpful to the police. 	RB VBP '' NNP NNP NNP NNP NN VBZ NNP NNP NNP PRP RB JJ JJ . VBP RB PRP VB TO NN PRP RB .

So, one day i was just walking home casually from school, and I walk into my house and my dad is in the kitchen. And he hears the door shut and he says 'Taylor is that you', I said yes it's me. then, he tells me he has something for me. 'OK?' i said.       Mean while i walk into the kitchen....Look its a robot my dad says. Whoa! i say. Its all yours.           I take the robot upstairs to my room and start to mess around with it. i used the remote dad gave to me. after a while I started understanding the remote control a little bit more. Dad called me downstairs to the kitchen to eat dinner.....            After I finished eating i went back upstairs, and the robot was gone! The remote was still on the bed where I put it before going downstairs.I heard something coming from the laundry room. I slowly opened the door, and guess what was sitting on the laundry room floor...THE ROBOT!       Two months later:   The robot actually became one of my best friends. I named him Joe. Do every thing together. He helps me with my homework, he helps me clean the house.       I'm really glad my dad got me a robot. :) 	NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NNP CC PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN DT NN PRP VBD DT NN WDT PRP VBD RB RB VB VBD JJ : : RB , CD NN PRP VBD RB VBG NN RB IN NN , CC PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN CC PRP$ NN VBZ IN DT NNP CC PRP VBZ DT NN NN CC PRP VBZ JJ VBZ IN PRP POS , PRP VBD NNS PRP VBZ NNP RB , PRP VBZ PRP PRP VBZ NN IN NNP NNP .

The citizens of Charleston were all tying to evacuate. Little Jon, a twelve year-old boy, went to the junk yard for some boards. As Jon searched, lightning streaked across the sky, and rouge lightning bolt hit just behind Jon!   'AH' cried Jon. I could have died! Just as Jon thought. A small whimper came through the junk pile. 'Hello?' Jon said nervously as he approached the sound. Just then a puppy robot that looked just like a lab on the outside jumped on Jon.       Jon walked home with his little robot puppy. 'I hope Ma lets me keep you.' Through the puppy's real skin, a glow peeked through his eyes.   'Hey did you get a new puppy?' Asked Jon's friend Holland   'He's a robot puppy!'   'Really?' Replied Holland 'what can he do?' Jon told the puppy to fly as a joke, and rockets sprang out of its feet!   'What is this!?' Cried Jon, and they flew off! Holland desperatly chased them, but lost them in the rain of Andrew. Jon and the puppy landed on their homes doorstep.   'Good boy!' said Jon. Jon's mother allowed Jon to keep the puppy. Jon named the puppy Baxter. Baxter wagged his tail.       It was raining like crazy. The radio was playing 'Ridin' Out the Storm.' With the company of Baxter And Jon's mother, it wasn't so bad!

I mean, why would my robot come to life for no reason? I didn't question it though. Well, she was a girl robot. I decided to name her Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn was sky blue, about two and a half feet tall, was strong, had all terrain wheels, and had light purple wings. She was the coolest thing I have ever seen!              After I stopped gushing about how cool she was, I asked her what she could do.Well, lucky me, my robot could talk! She could do my chores, clean my room, do my homework, cook, speak many languages, and even fix my hair! It was the coolest thing EVER. The best part about her was that she could fly!              She and I did everything together. We went to the park, the mall, my friend's houses, but unfortunatly I couldn't take her to school. They said that even though she was cool, it was against school rules. While I was at school, she played with my dog. It was the most fun I'd had in a long time.               'Whoa! That was a really weird dream!' I said. I looked over at my robot and said, 'You're the best friend a girl could have.' Right after I said that, I could've sworn she winked at me.

At the age of 13 you got one and it would practicly serve you. The goverment even started takeing soldiers out of the army and useing robots. When you were old enough to get one, you went downtown to the closest town hall, and you would get a back ground check then it got to the fun part.             Next you got to design the robot. You would first choose a color. Then you designed the base, or the body of the robot. After, you got to choose four out of millions of attachments. You could choose extra arms, sticky pads on their fingers so they could pick things up, or you could just put on a storage section. last you got a romote and a chip. The chip was used to put in the robots head to turn it on and so it could think. The romote was used for may reasons like turning off the robot and turning it on. It also has an emergency shut down.             After that long process the robot would show up at your door the next morning. It would only resond to your comands and it was also ment to protect you. That stoped a lot of crime. The robot served you all of your life, when you died the metal would be recycled and it would be sent to town hal to start the process all over again. The special parts also were recycled. The remote was thrown away and the chip was saved for history.

Fifty years ago there was a robot named rex who had been asleep for almost fifty years.Until one day two scientist were walking in a lake called deep rock in Alaska. They were checking out how deep was the lake.While they were watching the water,all of a sudden they saw bubbbles on the surface of the lake.       'What could it be' said luis which was the first scientist who saw the bubbles.'Lets check it out' said Beto which was the second scientist who saw it.After two minutes haved passed they decided to go and ckeck it out. It wasent deep.In fact it was at the surface.                           'Its a rock' said Beto.'No its not its a ROBOT!!' said Luis.'Lets take it out of the water' they both said.They took the robot out of the water as they had said on his right hand it had the name Rex.'I wonder what it does' said Luis.'Someone must have turned it off' said beto.'All we have to do is turn it back on and see what it does' said Luis. So they turned the swich back on it did nothing.               'Maybe it doen't work' said Beto.Then three minutes have passed suddenly the robots eyes opended. 'Look' said Luis it does work.The robot had three legs,two hands,and it was the color red.in his left foot there was a little book that said what rex could do. Both of the scientist were impressed of what the robot could do.Rex could climb buildings,drag people to safety,rescue people from builings that were on fire.The scientist decided to take to the city which there he could save manys peoples life                                                     THE END                                                  	NNP : .

Suddenly I had heared noises my robots were alive. I had noticed that my robots were really smart and friendly. I felt happy that Gilbert and Kimberly made some company. They were as smart as the internet.       Since my robots were small just like the size of my hand I  took them to school so I could get more help with my work. Robots are just like genieses but in the after noon I  was goin to take a test and I put my robots away with the help they had already given me I passed  the test. i thanked my robots for all the help they had given me.

I took them to the park. They seemed like they were having lots of fun. I thought of taking them there every day after school.

Also there is a robot called Mr.Gower is a robot that is a hospital helper is like a moving hospital shelf.Nurses and doctors can unlock drawers if medicine is needed.Mr.Gower can go anywhere it needs to go in hospital.College students in Oregon created robots that play hockey or shuffleboard on their own.   Have you ever heard of a self driving car?Well there out and its true they do drive themselves!They adjust speed with the camera in front by of course looking at the speed signs.It can go as fast as a normal car.

He was always working on new projects. Armore has always been fascinated in robots as a child and always wanted to bulid one and be a scientist, but was sure he couldn't. His mother and family always said 'you cant do it never, ever, ever do that''. Armore always wanted to prove them wrong.             Every night he worked and worked but all of his creations failed, until one night it was late and everyone was a sleep. Armore worked then finally his robot awakened! Armore danced around, and was so proud of himself he thought at once he would start to train it. Armore worked all night and got the robot to dance, clean, and play with children and animals. He could not wait to tell his family 'I told you so'.            He ran down stairs the next morning and showed his parents they said 'son you are way to old to be playing with robots, you are almost 17'' Armore just said in his head at least I built one he grabbed his robot and went back upstairs. He was said about his parents reply.            That night he could not sleep thinking about the great things his robot could do for the world. Then he remembered that he still needed to name the robot he felt the need to name is after his grandfather who was also a scientist. He named it willy.            Willy, and Calub hung out everyday and tried to stay away from his parents. Then Armore had to go off to college and had to leave Willy behind. It was a sad day he ordered his younger brother Luis to take care of Willy. Willy missed Calub, but Willy and Luis had fun.

Just down the road where I live is a factory that makes robots! I was always curious to know how robots exactly worked. So when it was the darkest of night I sneaked into the factory and made sure nobody was around for my great discovery of how robots worked. Once I sneaked in there was a big, metal, door that supposedly was the impenetrable. What was I thinking I knew it wasn't just as easy as a walk in the park. But since I already got  out of bed. I couldn't leave my hungry stomach unsatisfied without any adventure. So once again I devised a strategy that was the biggest, baddest idea Ive ever had. I got out my robot that I always kept with me. It was a portable cube that could turn into a 6 ft robot with a golden aluminum body with stain less steel eyes that glow a bright neon green. It was the coolest invention yet except there was one minor flaw it didn't work at all. My goal for the year was to make it work except I tried everything but it still wouldn't work. The door that was impenetrable was starting to open with a series of clinking sounds that took out the locks. What just happened? I didn't do anything but let my robot transform nothing else? BOOM! The earth shook like never before with ear screeching sirens and megaphones announcing Intruder alert Intruder alert. Oh why did I have to get in this mess. All around me there were robots just like mine except with evil glares and menacing red beams coming from there obnoxiously big eyes. I will protect you from these imposters said my robot with a robotic/cold voice. Now that was just to much for me to handle first my robot comes alive and tries to defend me even though its meant for singing and dancing just like the HRP-4C. I guess it can protect me with some of his awesome Michael Jackson moves but I think that's about it. Wait a minute if that's what my robot can do so can the other imposter robots can do. They are gonna have a dance competition. Hit it Ben! Bum Bum Bum clash ting one robot down 2 more to go. Etc. It came down to the final robot Bum Bum clash ting both robots came tumbling down. No how could this be, my robot was the impossible to desroy but now it came down just as easy as a block of lego tumbling down. I was smiling but my heart was broken inside if he didnt protect me I would have been a pile of robot bolts or more like human remains.

Things go horribly wrong.   *Testing out a new robot, the one I said I'd invent if     *Robot being moody about doing whatever people want it to.   *Little bit of both?   Start (paragraphs 1 and 2)- It was the moment I'd been waiting for. After being stuck in the lab for months, I would finally be free! (Intro, explain that the narrator is a robot.)   Paragraph 3- Does job (photographing underwater stuff, rainforests, arctic, desert)   paragraph 4- Meets other robots.   Conclusion?   More paragraphs then the outline formed above might be nessesary.         It was the moment I'd been waiting for. Finally, I would be getting out of the lab and tested. After months of assembling, recallibration, and dozens of examinations and battery changes, I was going to actually do something. My name is Photo Falcon. I was recently programed in a little lab in a place called California. What the place called Earth that's outside the lab is like, I'm not sure. All I know is it's a lot bigger.      I knew it was time when one of the scientists, Maria Crystal, picked up the metal box I've spent a bit too much time in, opened it, and slipped the film into the slot in my side that's supposed to hold film. If not for the fact that nobody had flipped my power switch, I would've been flying all over the place from exicitment. Richard and Bob, two other scientists, grabbed their iPads, two very important electronics plus a metal box like mine and they walked into the glossy silver lab van. Tests outside the lab were always exciting to hear about, but this would be even better because I was with them!     I was about to be tested in a clearing, whatever that is, about five miles away. The ride was short, but very interesting. Many vans, most of which were much smaller then the lab van and of many different colors, drove along the roads with the van, their metal surfaces glittering in the midday sun. Through the window, I saw a large body of water. It was huge! The 'ocean' seemed to go on forever. Sunlight sparkled off the waves. A few weeks ago, I'd been put in a pool to make sure that my clear coat of waterproof plastic actually worked. At the time that had seemed huge, but now that pool looked dinky.     When the van came to a stop, I was lifted out of the trunk and removed from the box. Richard flipped my switch, so  I started my propeller and zoomed into the azure sky. The meadow I was being tested in looked tiny from above, the blanket of grass no bigger then a child's fist. I went swooped down easily, due to my torpedo shape. There was no way I could take any good pictures from this altitude and do what I was supposed to do.     Maria walked over to the second box and I felt my cameras going off. What was she thinking?! She knew any motion would set those off! I was only supposed to use my film on objects that were interesting, not the scientists that I saw every single day.     The lid was pulled off of the box and out hopped a rabbit. Its glossy, cinder colored coat reflected the sky and it leaped forward, ears flopping like a flag on a windy day. Snap! Snap! Snap! I twirled in a circle to allow all eight of my cameras to capture the image. For about half an hour, the rabbit hopped about the meadow and I caught every movement on tape.     When the trio of scientists had gotten a good enough assetment of how I worked (I certainly hope I passed the test! I didn't want to end up a non-functional robot who got set aside or worse, used for scrap metal), Bob pulled out my remote that would make me return to the ground. I descended and they turned off my switch, forcing me to remain immobile while they checked my pictures. Based on the pleased look on their faces, I guessed that they liked the pictures. The rabbit stood motionless now and up close I realized it too was a robot! On the return trip, Maria, Bob, and Richard talked up a storm. Apparently they were testing me and the rabbit and so they were extremly pleased to have gotten double sucess.      The next few months were a blur. I was sent all across the world to photograph all kinds of enviornment, including the warm and wet Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon River (also warm and wet), and a forest somewhere in Europe. Very soon I became so popular replicas of me were made. They all looked identicle to me; sleek, clear torpedo shape. Mini cameras (also clear) on the sides and wings. Airplane wings that could tuck into their sides. Propellers mounted to the back to make it possible to go through air or water.      I met other robots when traveling to other places. Sometimes Maria, Richard, and Bob would bring me with them when they compared robots with other scientists. In Iowa I met a robotic cat named Trixie who was the first of a line of pets for people who wanted a cat but were allergic to them or didn't want to feed them. Down in Florida, I photographed an Agribot, a robot who picks vegtables and fruits, busily plucking ripe oranges. I may not be a living thing, but I have to say that life is pretty good.

But why? Let's find out.       In the year of 2025, robots were commam. Some robots were Dante 2 and Mr. Gower. But one robot was rebellious. It was Gemini- Scout. It was built to save lifes, but it stared to self-destructed. More Gemini- Scout stared to become rare.                                                                                                                                                                  By 2050, Gemini-Scout became so rebellious that they destroyed    the other robots.(All but Dante 2) The army tried to fight, but the robots have evolved.So scientists upgraded the Dante 2.       By 2075, all metals in the world were gone. No oil,iron every materials are gone. So no one can built Dante 2s. so the next 25 years the Gemini-scouts killed everyone. But they all rusted and died becuase no one can help them.         	DT NNP IN DT NNS IN DT NN IN CD , NNS VBD NN CC VBD DT NNP CC WRB .

Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground.The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels.Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies.It can even drag hurt people to safety.The robot also has a thermal camera to help it find miners.A thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.When the robot finds the trapped miners, the miners can use its two-way radio to talk with the rescue team.           Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job, it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists.It is also built to survive very high heat.Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater.Now scientists can study a volcano up close while they remain safe in their laboratories.           Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients.The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds.The robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.          An agribot is a robot that picks fruit.Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are interested in what these robots can do.In Japon, there is a strawberrypicking robot that can sense the color of the berries.This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.

'Has this always been here' asked Molly. 'I don't think so' said Jack. 'Lets go in' Molly suggested. 'OK' agreed Jack. So they went in and found a box. 'I want to open it Molly' said Jack. 'Do it' Molly demanded.            'What is it?' Molly asked. 'I...I think... I know! It is a robot' Jack screamed in excitement. 'It looks really old' he said. Lets take it home. So they did. They took it out and cleaned it off. Then they hit the power button and it made a shewew! sound. Then Molly grabbed the controller and shouted 'Me first!' 'No I  discovered it' Jack argued. 'Fine' Molly said under her breath.            A few weeks later the two kids had the controls down to a science. They even made it into the newspaper for the discovery of the year award.

Robots can also roll through water. Robots have an area to store foos water and opther supplies needed. Robots are also capible of dragging hurt people to shore and even safety. They test the air for gasses and tell miners when air is safe. There are thermal camera to help find miners. Two way radio to talk with the rescue team.       if I had a robot i would like it to, drag someone out of the sistuation if they are at risk. It would also have a sensor to tell somebody got ingured badly. It would also win robot battles. Do all of work also known as chores. There would be a built in microwave,heater,refridgerator,and a television. It will transform from a truck/car to a robot, but the hole time it will be a robot. my robot would be purple, 4feet tall, it would have blue arms and legs. it would also have a place to put emergencies items. it wouls look like a dog and be on all fours. lots of lights,seats, a built in heater and it would hold two people.

It worked for about a day but after that ait never terned on. About 2 Years later I was home alone and Tekno was in the garage and I heard a strange noies I thought it was a cat or something. Later that night i was watching a movie i heard the noies again so i went a checked it out. I opend th e garage door then- I saw something move behind something I went to go and see what it was and it was Tekno!!          I screamed and ran into the house locked the doors and waited. Then i went out there i saw Tekno i coulndn't belive my eyes. Then my parents pulled up into the driveway. So i went and told my Dad and Mom they were suprized. The nexted morrning i went into the garage and Tekno was there listin to music. That day i had to clean the house so im glad Tekno was there to help. So we tern on music and started to clean it only took us abut 3 hours we got it done.          But after that Tekno shut down :( it was sad after that we had a grate time the whole week. Years ater he woke up.

KayeBot could talk, walk, ride threw water, and alot more!             KayeBot eventually ran away from the little boy. He accually made 3 'Bot' friends. Their names were JennBot, BobBot, and BriBot. They were KayeBots's best friends. All of the Bots ahd the same abilitys like KayeBot. They soon made a group,' The  Four Resue Buddies!'. Everyday they resued people and saved lives. They would be really upset if they didn't save a live and someone lost their live. Anyways, that barly hapened.              'The Four Rescue Buddies' saved lives until the rusted.

Except for this one kid name Lissa, she was a shy girl and she was new to the neighborhood. She dressed in the nicest clothes and the bad thing about it that, when school was over for good..she had to go to summer school. Lissa will probably she some of her classmates there. Lissa was not happy that she had to go to summer school for no reason.                Second week that passed for summer school to began. When lissa's mother dropped her off the building was colorful and HOT, there was no air. There was nothing but wooden desks and math books, science, reading, and writting, also social studies. She sat in the back of the classroom so she won't have to get called on first. When everybody got there, she seen her best friends David and Aaliyah they were brother and sister. She was glad she seen the only people she know.                The teacher walked in the class room, she looked all mean. Her name was Mrs. Meyer and she had a list of rules and they were terrible   No leaving the classroom during class time No talking You must do your work No one leaves until they finsh summer school                Those are the worst rules Lissa had ever heard of so now Lissa had alot of stuff to foucse on. so she can finsh summer school fast and get out of there. To be contiued.

I was bored so I decide to built a robot. so I first   got the things I need.Then I started to build it then I finished two weeks later.I tried it an it didn't worked.                       A miracle happened it turned on and began to walk. I tested it I command her to do my ten paragraph page about horses.the next day I went to school and I got an A+ on my ten paragraph page.                 Finally, the robot became my best friend. She goes everywhere with me. the people stare at her and at me but we don't care.finally, we live happy. We became best friends for life.

So i needed a assistant to help me create new inventions.So i was creating a robot. The robot was going to be the best robot living earth.              The robots name is going to be X=111.I was finally done making it , it took a week to make. I justed needed a idea to make it alive and moving.but i needed some adjustments. I added a laser,stretching arms and legs.It was a raining day and it had lightning. I had the idea to put the robot on top of the roof so it could be striked by lightning to be alive.       I screamed  out it's alive x3 times. It came out just what i planned it was smart and intelligent. The robot will help mankind. But i never had to play with it. So i reported it to come backed we played games and i oiled. X=111 and me became friends.       Suddenly it had determination to destroy mankind. I was freaking out so i shut it down forever. I was crying for a week. I turned it on it worked properly and i was happy so i lived and play with it forever. So i didn't let it go out of my site.

It was a normal day a sunny day in the spring but something strange, tyler found a pile of  metal on the ground but he dug it up and he relized it ain't a pile of metal it's a robot! He found and he took it home. I thought it was cool but my mom didn't. She wantedit out of our house because it was dirty. Tyler said that they could make a fourtune off of this.                        My dad wanted to make a couple thousand bucks off of it. Mom still refused to have that piece of trash in our home. But one night my brother into his room and starting working on it. One day he fixed it he shined it real nice and it came to life. he controled it's actions. One time he scared mom out of the house and dad, megan, and nathan but not me. No matter how hard he tried it never worked. One night tyler was sleeping so i took that robot outside and destroyed it. Then everybodywas home man you should of seenv the look on his face.

At first, the Forzbot was ment to work in schools as a secretery, but he turned out to be much, much more. It all started on the 29th of October, and I was about to give up on my new invention. But then I had an idea. You see, the problem was that the gears kept on getting stuck together, and no matter how many things I tried- Malsceno, Mandy Handy, the Unstuck. All of those are my inventions- the gears just refused to budge. Then I thought to myself, 'Maybe you should be more practical. If you were not a scientist, what would you use, Montgomery?' and it came to me. Vasteline! How could I have not thought of it before?! So I took out a bottle and slathered it all on it and- wouldn't you know!- the gears start turning and the pullies start pulling and the Fortzbot was more than just a fantacy! But the final resault was beyond astronomical, because next thing you know, he starts talking to me, just like that! I think his actual words were,'Hello sir, how do you do? I am verry sorry to disturb you, but I am new to this town and my car broke down. I need a place to stay for the night. I would hate to impose but...' The Fortzbot- my own invention!- was alive! Not only was he alive, but he thought himself a real person! Of course, I let him stay overnight, and by morning my cheekes hurt from smiling for hours.     And there was even more. The Fortzbot- who called himself Minho- knew everything from cooking to cleaning to working in the lumberyard. As thanks to letting him staying overnight, Minho did all of those things for me and was on his way.     Today, Minho works as a science teacher in Stanford, and has made many things of his own, including a non-toxic toothpaste, published a book: How to Convert to the Metric System for Kids, and read over 3,500 books, almost all on mathematics and engineering.     I know that most of you will not believe my story now, or next year, or ever, but the truth is the truth and will always remail so, whatever you might think.

It wold be a gaint chicken. The main things it would do is lay eggs and take care of my chickens. It would transfer into a human when we go into the public. I wouldn't want a gaint chicken walking around with me in the mall. It would carry my shopping bags around.              Sometimes I ask myself  ' what woud it be like having a gaint chicken robot.' Well it would be one of a kind and very uniquce. If I had to say good by to Rose it would be heartbreaking. I woud miss her for every.

Online I found a website that had robots on it, and I got one. I brought it home and I saw it move. It was alive! It was moving its arms, legs, mouth, and everything. It was so cool!           When it started moving I asked it to clean my room, do my homework, and do anything I didnt want to do! It was so amazing, it did what ever I told it to do and it was happy to do it! I was so happy I could do whatever I wanted to do know because the robot was doing what I didnt want to do! I became great friends with the robot so I named it Rob! It cooked for me and it also played with me when I got bored.           One day it said do you want me to go to school for you? I said yes please! Then I got bored being home without Rob and I said maybe its not so bad  doing some work so I did some work for Rob and when he got home he got so excited that he could just play with me!

There are so many suprising things that robots can do i can believe it! One of the many things robot can do is go up and down stairs, talk, and locate and rescue hurt people or animals. Also go through water, be strong for a small robot, carry food, water, and other supllies. Some robots test air for gases and tell miners it's safe, and use thermal cameras to find liiving things. Some even have a two- way-radio to talk to rescue teams. Many robots are easy to use and control. One robot I learned about was the Gemini-Scout, it is remote control with the controls used to play video games.         If i had a robot i would like it to rescue people and animals. Also help find new things in the world. I like it to help in the hospital with many things and in any hospital for anything. I also want it to talk.          I don't knoe how i want it built but i want it spritfull!!     	PRP$ NN : : PRP VBP NNS VBP VBG CC MD VB JJ NNP NNP VBP RB JJ VBG NNS WDT NNS MD VB PRP MD VB PRP .

After school I was thinking of what color should I paint the robots.Then I thought that I should paint 'The Cleanarator' blue,gray,and a little bit of white.Then I thought to paint 'The Smarty Pants' black,red,green,and a hint of gray.Now my two robots are ready to go.

The next day after school he went to the store across the street from his house to get the materials he needed. He got scrap metal, screws, and, many tools. When he got home he ran into his room threw his backpack down and got started. His mom had went to go check on him to see if there was something wrong. When she walked in she had noticed what he was doing and was fascinated. Mario found it odd how she didn't ask why he was making the robot. Later that night his mom walked in  and found him asleep.                           The next day he had finally finished his robot. He was so excited to start it up to see if it worked he was almost positive it would start. When the time finally came for him to start it he got a little nervous. When he tried to turn it on he noticed that the switch to the robot didn't work. Mario was really upset he wanted to cry but he didn't he wanted to try again. Mario had took apart the old robot and started over. This time it took him a week to Mario a week to finish building the second robot.       Mario had finally got ready to start it up once again. He had told himself that if it doesn't work he is going to give up. When he flipped the switch on the robot it immediately began to work. He was so happy and for the rest of the day he was playing with his new robot. It would walk around the carpet sing,and dance.       Later that night the robot came to life! It had began to start walking! The robot had left the house and ran outside. The next morning Mario and his parents noticed how the front door was open and Mario's robot was gone. When they had walked outside they had noticed how the whole neighborhood was sparkling clean but the robot was gone Mario was upset but he decided that maybe it was good thing that he was gone.

Robots that don't move their just models. Exept we put in all the compenents so it can move, just not on it's own. Anyway back to the story. What happend on this very special night is the cool part. Well we were building our robot it just happend to be a lightning storm so we made sure that it was safe, and at the time it was. Little did we know it was no regular storm.                      The truth is what happend that night was very dangerous yet truly amazing. You see that night the robots came alive. There wasno harm done but a lot of explaning to do. The problem is we don't know what to say so all i'll do is tell you what truly happend. That night the factory got struck by lightning and all power was lost. Almost, all the power some how ended up activating the robots. Exept thats not suppost to be possible but it happend and that is all I will say.                                                                                                        For now!

Every week he would make a new robot and try a new way of makeing them. One week he wonderd what would hapen if he tighend a scruw from the ineer boby of the robot. He assumed nothing mutch would come of it maybe just a 0.1 second speed sumit but he was curious to find out. When he finished his robot he turned it on and left it to generate fully.   The robot maker left...                   Seconds after the robot maker left the robot stoped generateing and started to move like a animal being on frozen he moved very presisly like checking if everything worked and was moveble he found everything in order and than tryed to speek at first... nothing than he tryed again... nothing he was curious in why this fiture did not work so he left the lab to go for a surch of a answer. He walked for miles in the lonly city of paris althogh its known as the city of love all ar afected but one the missed a little alone robot surching fo a purpose. He walked and walked untill he found something outside a television store marked bills t.v inporium where they had a window that looked nin on some televisions playing the popular channels cooking, american idol the biblical chanel and twilight was a new t.v with people praraiding across stage with there mouth moving at a odd reait and there words closer together and behind the words were a story and with the words there was a beat a very meening full story it was       music...           a gang of teens was out side the store watching the band as they called it and lisening and danceing they loved them and than the band went of the stage and there came a other band an all boys band and the girls screamd and bangd there way to the front of the crowd as they sang the robot stood with amazment the humans love this and it seems like its a life syle than a from the corner a television was playing a show called the 'X factore where stars and no bodys become famous' and with just that one word he new his purpose...                       the robot went straight to the Xfactor to addicion when he came in there was a stage much like the one in the television there were three chairs at the base of the stage whith a desk and infrount of the desk was a large X that at the moment all threee were glowing bright red i guess the human befor me didi not have as much luck but i will have luck i most they called him in stage 'Next' He walked on stage and asked them his name and he looked he was not given a name so he felt his hair it was harry so he said 'harry' than they asked for last he looked around and saw a poster that said guy singers got style than said 'style harry syles' and began           When he began to sing a sound came out of him that was never heard before it was perfect in any way angelic you could say and so he moved on all the way to finals and ment up with a gruop called one dirrection and became the first robot lead singer.                       So all you alone robots out there dont be sad it gets better and if u cant find your purpose try music and if your a inbventor looking for your robot who misteriously diaperd well maybe u shouldnt hsve tighend that scruw because he is not comeing back and all you one direction fans know you know that harry stayles is a robot but dont blow his cover cause robots dont sing.

What some people don't understand though is the fact that robots can do incredible things like drive cars, work with doctors to save lives, carry injured people out of mines, and even have a two way radio in which people can call the search and rescue team if they need help.              If I had a robot I would make it wear a pink bow, have a sour gummy worm compartment and also a sword to protect me just in case I was in that sort of trouble. My robot would do things for me that I would want it to do like do my hair, brush my teeth, pick out cute outfits, and give me advice about anything including figuring out exactly how to do my homework.              In the end I think that it would be very cool to have a pet robot. To play with, to talk to, to do things for me and maybe in the future I will have one.

It was incredibly heavy, and I had no means of moving it. So I went into my garage, grabbed a ladder, and went into my office, got some scissors, and opened it up.         The object inside the box looked as though it were maid out of titanium and iron. I noticed the back part was opened up. There was a window in the front, on about a 70 degree angle. The sides were at about 45 degrees, and the bottom was flat. It had what appeared to be arms. Through the window, I could see what appeared to be controls. I climbed in the back and pressed a little green button. The thing stood up abruptly. On the ceiling, there was a helmet sort of thing. It lowered to the point where I could put it on.          Once I put the helmet on, I could not only control the robot, but I could also see things I wouldn't have, had I been using my eyes. The robot jumped into the air. When it landed again, something caught my eye. It was red. It moved like a snake. It was huge. And fast. Fast and huge. Something else appeared on the screen. It was a radar. Apparently, this robot also had weapons. My right... well, the robot's right hand had a knife in it. I asked myself, 'how do you miss a giant knife in the hand of a robot?,'          Just then, a voice answered my question. It must have been the robot's voice, because last time I checked, humans don't read minds. The robot answered, &lt;You did not see the knife because you were busy wondering why a robot was in your yard. Hello Jake, we have been watching you for a couple years now, and we have decided you are ready&gt;  'For what?! What's going on here?! And who are you?!,'  &lt;You are ready to help us defeat Kalaar, the snake like creature you saw moments ago. As for who am I... I am KK8, or Kill Kalaar Eight.&gt;          A jolt hit the robot, and it stopped speaking.

The device was encripted with a virus that would render all data bases useless. It, a robot, was a model 2IG-23GR*V1Y_43275\619, also known as hacker model 4. That day the president adressed the nation of th USA, the sight of the attack, about it. The screen went black then appered the face of cyber terrorist Jose Merendez. He told the people to lay down their arms and not to fight back unless they  wanted what was happening to them to happen to the rest of the world. I am astronaut who happened to be on mars when the earth was attacked. My people were told to to go to the ISS to defend it from him.

The robot from the 5th grade science fair came alive. So I took it up to my house and we started to play. Then i started teaching him to do my homework and my chores it was awesome!!! After that we went to bed.         The next morning I had to go to school so I asked my mom if i could take him with me. We started packing our lunches, I packed a peanut butter sandwich, grapes, and a juice box. He packed a can of dads oil. Then I grabbed him one of my backpacks from years past and we headed out for the bus stop.       When we got to school everybody said thats so cool.  It was the best day of school in my whole life! When we got home we played basketball, football, and lacrosse. He is very fast but not very good because he has such small hands. It was a ton of fun tho.       Today he is still my best friend I have ever had, I hang out with him 24/7. It is so fun I wish he could live with me forever!

I told him we have to much valuable stuff, and shouldn't get rid of it.  He said 'If you can find something to do with it, we won't have to throw it out'.  I thought for a while and eventually came up with the idea of making a robot.  My dad wished me luck and went inside.  I spent the rest of the day building a robot in the garage.           I took some old bikes completely apart, piece by piece.  The wheels were used as the robots feet, and the handlebars were the two hands.  Next I tore apart the old dirt bike we never used.  I constructed the motor and gears into the mechanism to make the robot move.  Soon after this hard job was done, I reconstructed my electric scooter into the arms and legs. A lawn mower was used for the head and the motor and gears went along with the dirt bike parts.  I took apart a few pairs of roller blades and those were used for looks.              The end product was amazing.  I destroyed two bikes, an electric scooter, a dirt bike, a few pairs of roller blades, and a lawn mower.  It was worth it.  At first I honestly didn't think it would do anything.  I was wrong.  My robot, Scirt Lade, does more than you can  ever imagine.  It plays sports, it cleans, it serves you, it can even cook anything you want.  It does pretty much everything.   I guess my dad wishing me luck did a lot more than I thought.

But a miner named Dave saw something in the that was different. He noticed tire tracks through all of the tunnels. Dave followed the tracks until he saw something about two feet tall. It was a robot.               Dave ran back to one of his friends Fred and told him that had just seen a robot working in the mine. Fred didn't believe Dave and went ahead and saw the robot. Fred ran back to Dave and said,' We should go tell the boss,' Fred said. Dave a greed and went to go tell their boss Bob. They found Bob and said that they had just seen a robot in the mine. As Fred and Dave led Bob to the robot their was an explosion and rocks fell on to all of them. They were trapped              All of them were screaming for help and moaning from the pain. They heard something that sounded like a battery running. Then out of the darkness there was light.Something was tugging at Dave's arm. Dave looked up and saw the robot. The robot Pulled him out from under the rocks and all way to the entrance were they were met by an ambulance waiting. The robot went back to the mine and pulled Fred out of the mine. Then the robot pulled Bob out.       Dave, Fred, and Bob recovered from their injuries after a month of recovering. they don't know how a robot got in the mine. There just glad to be alive. they all say it just came to life.

My friend is a miner, so this robot when goes on mining trips can test the air for safety. Gemini-Scout one Day decided to go to a mountain nere    by. The Gemini-Scout tested the air and went into the mountain. While Gemini-Scout with in the mountain it meet a Dante 2. Dante 2 climbs into volcanoes. It was gathering information for it's scientist, who was at the foot of the mountain. The Dante was looking at this different robot. The same was happening for the Gemini-Scout looking at a robot with eight legs.        The Dante 2 was trying to do it's job. The Gemini-Scout and the Dante2 could not talk. Gemini-Scout was just exploring the inside of the mountain,and to test what it could do. After a while the Gemini-Scout decided not to bug the other robot (Dante 2). The Dante 2 started to look at crater.         A little while later the some giant rocks fell on Dante 2. Gemini-Scout saw the giant rocks fell on the other robot, so the robot helped the Dante 2. Gemini-Scout is small, but vary strong. It has saved miners before with it's owner. Dante 2 gave the information it found to it's owner. Gemini-Scout was a helpful robot. Dante 2 and Gemini-Scout Became great robot friend. They couldn't talk to anyone, but they helped one another for finding information and saving miners on mining trips.      A helpful friend or robot is a wonderful thing to have.

But how AI-363 came alive is a whole different story.           It all started on my birthday, April 29 in the year 2013. My mom and dad where planing on giving me some new stuff but when I saw them walking outside in the thunder and lightning. CRACK!!!! The lightning made all the power in the neighborhood go out! I was worried my mom or dad got hit but luckily they didn't They got back inside quickly and said. After everything stopped I became 73 degrees with no chance of storms or any bad weather. I saw something in the corner of the house, something that looks small.                  To took a few steps the thing, it turns out it is a robot that was somehow it came thought he must of. He had a Allen Iverson jersey on with some Jordan's. He looked awesome!!!            After I met him we started playing basketball, soccer and all these other sports that we liked. Surprising thing is he can dunk on a regulation hoop. I forgot to mention that he has dreads. Me and AI got together every day for the past to years but, something bad happened for me at least. He got drafted to the NBA. He was a first round pick for the 76er's. At least I could watch him on the TV. He turned out to be the best player in the NBA, he even led the team to championship ring.       I never saw him in real life ever again. I will always remember that birthday for me. Just only for that peculiar reaso....           AI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You are back. I thought I was never going to see you ever again. The first thing he did was dunk over me on our hoop. AI is so funny. This was the best day of my life. At noon AI and me went to the park and played one-one of course he won. We kept playing for 5 hours straight.       A big storm came again in January 3, 2015. All of the sudden I heard a....... CRACK!!!!!!!!!! He was gone. I did not know what to do except cry. I will always remember that birthday for me. Just only for one peculiar reason.

245	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			M	415021	6	11085259	Y	55103	 THE PLANE THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING                        The scenery could not have been better, scarlet purple rays beat down softly on the crowded streets, rich aromas of blooming Daffodils and Tulips sweetened the air, and the sweet low whistle of the morning breeze joined by the constant chirping of the morning birds set the stage for an innovation to take place.                        This, was Kentwood. A town that has been standing under the shadows of its boastly neighbor Grand Rapids for over thirty years. The only thing that keeps the town standing on its feet is the importance it carries as the housing space for the local airport. Gerald R. Ford International Airport. But the town is very inexperienced at innovating, unlike Grand Rapids, the town does not even have a product that bears the phrase 'Invented and made in Kentwood,' but that was all going to change.                        So what was the innovation that had Kentwood's name entombed in the extremely exclusive club of innovative cities? Well, the answer lies at the local airport, where Kevin Roy has worked there for two years on a solar-powered airplane, only thing is, it's not an airplane, its a robot! You don't need a pilot to fly it. All you have to do is communicate with the Air Traffic Control and give the plane verbal intructions. The plane then does the rest.                       It was Monday, a day that most citizens of the area hate. People go back to work, buisness travelers fly out, kids start a new week in school, it is all mayhem on Mondays. But today, Kevin and his new innovation, called 'Innovation one' would take flight to launch a new push for pollution control.                      So now we jourmney into the cockpit of  Innovation one, Kevin is making his final pre-flight checks before take off. He climbs into the cockpit and says 'Engine one start, Engine one generator and battery on.' The plane responds and in a matter of seconds the engine on the left wing is gently humming in the morning breeze and Kevin can see that electricity is clearly flowing from the battery to the electric motor in the engine. He then says 'Engine two start, Engine two generator and battery on.' Again the plane responds as planned as soon both engines were humming gently while Kevin awaited commands from the Air Traffic Control.                     'Nero one five five niner Mike increase speed to zero two zero knots and proceed to runway two six left.' the controller chimes over the radio, with a rather urgent tone. Kevin repeats the directions to the plane and the plane gently starts rolling forward, takes a left, and rolls down the taxiway to runway two six left. While rolling, Kevin instructs, 'Solar Panels on Engines one and two report active.' The plane responds by switching the power fromt the batteries to the solar panels mounted on the wings. By the time he reaches two six left, his anxiety of if the plane will fly puzzles his mind, and he almost misses the controller saying, 'Nero one five five niner Mike cleared to line up runway two six left.' Kevin repeats the directions as said and the plane lines up on the runway.                        Kevin's urgency to take off is on the brink when the controller says, 'Nero one five five niner Mike wind two six zero at five knots runway two six left, cleared for take off.' With some enthusiasm but urgency. Kevin repeats the directions as stated and the plane starts to roll down the runway at ever increasing speed. All this while, Kevin is leaning back in his seat, staring at the runway before him, when the speed indicator reaches one one zero knots, the speed he wants, he says, 'Rotate and climb to three thousand feet.' The plane lifts up and...

At my job   at the market downtown. It was an old place but always filled with people including myself. I sat at a red table when suddenly my boss came over to me.         He stood over me waiting for me to say a word but i said nothing. 'So are you actually going to do do something or just sit around all day and stare into space.' 'I'm ready for anything sir.' I replied. 'Well then why don't who go and grab me the boxes that were just delivered and bring them over to me when you are done.'         As I skit-ted across the market to the back door. There seemed to be mysterious creatures with the delivery man. I reached for one of the boxes but the creature stacked one box right on my hand.         'Oww.' I screeched. The creature that had dropped the box on my hand I noticed he was made out of metal that rolled away whereas the other one I had saw earlier had large arms that were good for grabbing stuff on and off the truck. 'What are these things?' I said to the delivery man. 'They are robots, You know they are actually very useful they are all around us.' 'Really?' I replied. 'Yes, I use them for loading my truck and carrying my boxes to the businesses.' 'Wow I never knew how much they can help!' 'Robots aren't just for this job though some help guide people and find out info some of our scientist can't. Mine are the Agribot and the Mr. Gower. This isn't the only job my robots can do, they can do many more!'         'Well me and my robots have got to get going, nice meeting you!' 'You too.' I said as I watched the two robot scoot up the ramp and up into the darkness of the truck.

Robots are good climbing but some don't really climb. Robots often play with kids that are very bored at home and they mostly paly all day long with kids. Kids love playing with robots. Robots also love playing with with kids at their homes anywhere in the world. Robots are all over the world but robots aren't in the U.S. Robots have fun with their job. Robots also love working with people. Robots love helping people out with their jobs. Robots also work in office buildings. Robots love being a good  resource to people and little kids too. Robots have a very good life helping people out. Robots also carry things and climb up on things. Some robots even have eigth legs. Some even have four or two or just wheeles as their feet.

Some are very, very useful like the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot. If you ever played a video game you may know how to use a Gemini-Scout. A Gemini-Scout is small but strong. A Gemini-Scout can carry water, food, and other supplies. A Gemini-Scout can even drag hurt people to safety. A Gemini-Scout collect information wherever it goes. A Gemini-Scout tests the air for gases that could be harmful to miners. Gemini-Scouts have thermal cameras and the use the heat to tell where living things are.            Another very useful robot is the Dante 2. A Dante 2 looks like a spider, it has eight robotic legs. Dante 2's climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. When a volcano is too dangerous for a scientist the use the Dante 2 to collect the information instead.            A third robot is called Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower works in hospitals. Mr. Grower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. Mr. Grower's body is stacked with medicine. Mr. Grower is so strong that is can pull 500 pounds. Mr. Grower runs on batteries. If Mr. Grower charges for two hours he can deliver medicine for twelve hours. Mr. Grower is programmed to say hundreds of phrases.                An agribot is a robot that picks fruit. It might pick berries, oranges and grapes. Farmers are very interested in these types of robots.This robot has sensors that lets it know if the plant is ripe or not. Every plant has sensors that let the robot know if the plant is too dry and the robot will water the plant.             Nevada scientist are coming up with a car that can drive with out being steered by someone or something.             You can invent a robot but the choice is up to you.

Kailee little girl, and her family  live in the dump because they are to poor to live in the floating city. Only the barons live in the city. So when she is searching for food She finds the robot. When she touches the robot it turns to life. They become good buddies.    They do every thing together that day. At the end of the day the robot turns back none a live.

Purple Dinosaur  was the biggest thing in stores until they only had one left. Boy was that a problem. Tons of people were demanding this toy for their children! But one lucky little girl snatched the very last one off the shelf and she hurried to the cash register. She told the lady may I buy this. The lady whispered of corse you can. The lady whispered again. What's your name darling? The little girl whispered I'm MaryAnne. What a beautiful name said the lady at the cash register. When the lady checked her out and put her toy into a black draw string bag she whispered again hurry run my darling kids and mothers will chase after you if they see you have the last one. Little MaryAnne whispered thank you and ran right out of the store all the way home never looking back. When MaryAnne got home she showed her mom her new toy. MaryAnne's mother Selena asked where did you get this my dear? MaryAnne quickly responded I saved my 30 dollars  and went to the store got the last toy on the shelf that everyone was fighting for payed for it ran out of the store and ran all the way home.Selena said wow sounds like an adventure my dear. MaryAnne responded yes, yes it was mommy. MaryAnne ran up stairs and opened up her new toy as fast as she could! She finally got it open and it did nothing. MaryAnne got all disappointed. She layed on her bed starting to cry. She sobbed I bought this toy for nothing it's a piece of junk and she kicked the robot across the room. MaryAnne decided to go outside and take a walk and cool down a little. When MaryAnne got back her robot was gone! She ran down stairs and she asked mommy did you  take my robot? Her mother replied no honey. MaryAnne screamed well I can't find it I put it on the floor and now it's gone!!! MaryAnne went to bed and woke up the next morning and her room was a disaster. Selena came up stairs and yelled MARYANNE MARIE GONZALES WHAT IN THE WORLD DID YOU DO TO YOUR ROOM?!?!?!??? MaryAnne said i didn't do anything i woke up and it was like this. Selena screamed you don't just wake up and your room is a mess! Your grounded yelled Selena. Ugh said MaryAnne and she slammed her door. Then MaryAnne realized it was the stupid robot and she found the robot on the side of her bed sleeping she kicked it a little. The robot woke up with red eyes and all. Then five minutes later all you could hear was screaming. The robot killed MaryAnne.

Who always put others before herself . Well one day Juliet woke up to a beautiful rising yellow sun with the smell of beautiful yellow roses with a note. This note said 'Dear Juliet, i know you don't know me but i secretly know you . As soon as i saw your beautiful face i instantly fell in love with you. Your white smile could light up Akers. But behind these beautiful insides Juliet worked at a hospital with lots of other robots. She climbed up mountains and went under ground to help find hurt people. She always said that even though she is a robot that she can do anything she wanted to she just had to dream.But Romeo didnt care if she was or wasn't a robot, he still loved her. One night romeo and juliet had dinner at juliets house, and she played piano so she played a romantic song that she wrote just for romeo... Romeo got just a little teary and when the song was over gave Juliet a BIG hug and said ' i knew that we were meant for eachother.' Romeo and juliets dinner was supposed to end at 7 but they ended it at 6 because, Juliet had a very difficult, hard day at work. Even though Juliet was a robot she could still talk, play, climb,protect, and help others!Juliet has the same feelings for romeo as he does for her but, she just cant....

Mark is a boy who lives with his Dad and their house lives near a   mechanic place that is destroyed sort of and Mark goes their everyday to find tools because he wants to be a mechanic.                                       So, back to the story Mark brings back the heavy robot back to the house to show his Dad. Then his Dad says, ' lets see if that robot works!' Then the kid presses the on button and then the robot turns on. Next the robot says, ' hi, how may I assist you?' so, then Mark says, Bring Me Cookies! Then the robot answers Done! Out of nowhere cookies come out of his belly nice and warm. After two years something goes bad.                              On May 6, 1921 robots were conquering the world and there was war between humans and robots. Mark is fighting in the war bravely after his father died because of the robots and the humans are fighting desperately to survive. The army is running low on weapons and the robots are conquering. It's a very sad day on June 7, 1921 and the robots are rulers and the humans are now slaves. That very day Mark has an idea to win back the land and here it is.                                    So, the next day Mark and six others get weapons abd gear and blow up the king robots building and now it is a bg pile of ashes. When that was happening all of the humans ran and followed six guys and Mark stayed. After everyone evacuated the empire, Mark their hundreds of bombs down on the empire and the robots were gone.                                      After all of that the city was back to normal and there was no more robots. The city gave seven medals to the brave fourteen your olds who stood up against robots. Mark and the others lived a happy life in harmony. Then in eight years, they all joined the army to protect their country. At of all the seven people mark survived and became the president of the United States of America.

256	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	415470	6	11085306	Y	55103	 The Cookerama       Many, many years ago there lived a man named Richard Hast. Richard was a very intelligent man, who loved to invent things. When Richard was just a little boy he always told everyone he knew that one day he would become an inventor. As he got older his love for inventing got stronger. When he was only 12 years old, Richard designed a robot rocket called the Shooter 9000. Sadly Richards robot rocket failed. But, did Richard give up, No. When Richard turned 14 his parents got him a whole set of robot parts that his dad had found at the dump. Richard was so excited that that night he decided to go down to the basement(where his lab was) and started to design a robot called Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower was designed to work in hospitals all around the world. This robot looked like a small cabinet on wheels that was used to store medicines locked up in the cabinet. Mr. Gower was a great idea, but something went wrong. Richard's dog Leroy found the robot on his desk one day. Leroy pushed the robot off of his desk with his tail, and the robot fell faster then a meteor coming towards earth. When Richard found the shattered pieces of not only his robot, but his heart. He began to cry. He cried and moaned until there was no more tears left inside of him. He thought he should give up. So, he put all of his inventions in the garbage. Then one day when his dad was getting ready to get in his car, he saw all of the robot parts in the trash. He grabbed all of the parts and headed towards Richards lab. When he got down in the basement he put all of the parts on Richard desk and wrote Richard a thoughtful note. it said, ' Richard, good things don't just come. You have to work hard and all the pieces will come together.' Underneath that it said, ' You can do anything you set your mind to.' Love Dad. The next day Richard went down to his lab. He saw the parts and the note. He smiled. I will make the best invention this world has ever seen! He yelled. For days and days he worked on his next invention, when finally after one whole month Richard proudly said, 'It's done!'Richard had designed a robot with the latest technology. It was called, The Cookerama. The Cookerama had a tall steel made body with long hair as yellow as the sun. It had spatulas for hands and an apron as blue as the sea. The Cookerama was designed to cook any meal you asked it to in under ten minutes. The Cookerama used the latest technology to prepare the most delicious meals ever! Richard decided to take his amazing invention to The House of Inventions. While he was in the car he could feel his heart beating. He could not believe that his dream was about to come true.When he got to the House of Inventions, he was automatically entered in the best invention contest. The winner of the contest would get five hundred dollars and a picture of themselves and there invention in the hall of inventions! Richard was very nervous because he was worried about his competition. The judges were deciding who would be the winner. He could feel the sweat dripping down his face. Then the announcer was going up to the podium to announce the winner. Richard was shaking. 'We are so lucky to have such amazing inventors this year. All of your inventions are brilliant, but remember, we can only choose one.' Richard now was shaking because his journey into inventoring was about to begin or end. ' The winner of the competition, Worlds best inventor, is... Richard Hast! ' Oh my gosh!' Richard said. 'I don't know what to say!' Everyone screamed in the audience. But, the scream that was the loudest of all, was his dads. 'I knew you could do it Richard!' He was a world sensation! He even got to be on the news! 'Is there anything you would like to say Richard?' The reporter said. No, nothing much just one thing. Thank you Dad! I couldn't have done it without you!

When i got back to my station he was not there instead there was a colossal mess of wires. I went out to my garden and there he was. he had a tomato like face and his arms legs and body where cherry tomatoes.           I went to go pick him up and bring him inside when i realized that he ate all of my tomatoes. There was one thing wrong because I didn't finish him he was green. When I pic him up he was crying so I got him inside and when he saw my tomatoes he stopped crying and ran right towards them I caught him be for he made another tornado- wish mess again.           We dis sided to go to the store to get some more tomatoes when I realized he didn't have a name so I sat and thought sense he's green and he's a tomato and a robot I'll name him Ro-to. When we got into the store he had a loose wire so after we got the tomatoes I took him to my work bench.               After I was done fixing Ro-tos broken part he got up and walked away. That's when I herd two metal pieces grinding against each other. Then I remember that he was a robot! When I went into the kitchen I saw that he made all of the tomatoes green and I was amazed at what he could do.                                                                                                             I took him outside to play and he did exactly that.When it became  dark out we went inside. We were asleep when I heard a big bang on the door and a big person came in my house then i saw Ro-to and he was shooting tomatoes at him and moving back and forth because the person was trying to stomp on him. Then I saw that the man was falling over and i saw purple liquid and then I knew that he was shooting poison at him and then I Know that I had a multi per pis robot in my house and i didn't have to be scared anymore.

The dog was sent to Manchester but we had to get there around 6:00 to get the dog. When we got we ended up waiting until like 3:00 because the dog wasn't in the first van.  The dog was in the second van wich came at 3:00, When the van got there our dog was the third to last to come out.  She was very friendly and playful.             Her name was Kentucky, I thought she was going to be bigger but she really small because she was only 6 or 7 months old.  She was black and white,  the when we left she wouldn't stop moving around in the truck and my sister and I were petting her and hugging her because she was so soft.  When we got home she wouldn't stop moving, she was so hyper.  Now she is a lot less hyper and calmer.  Her fur changed color, now she is brown and white and every time she is out side she runs lik a cheeta the sun shins on her back making her look more brown.  She is is about 2 years old now and she still gets hyper and now she has a play mate            Her play mate is a pittbull but he very friendly too.  His name is king and he plays with her a lot, but they get in to stuff a lot and Kentucky plays with King outside.  When they are out side Kentucky teases king then he gets mad.  When he gets mad at her he chases her until she get tierd and then they go in and fall asleep.             When I go to see king at my dad's house I wish I had a robot me so he he doesn't hurt me or get slob on me. He is only a year old so is still hyper and crazy.  He is very strong but he is just a puppy and he is a pitbull.  He likes to chew on everything and rip things apart.

And though he didn't have siblings, he had his only friend Rusty, Stevens dog, who he played with every day. Rusty was Stevens best and dearest friend he had ever had. But one day, Steven and Rusty were outside playing ball. Steven had over thrown the ball and Rusty did an amazing leap for it, but the ball rolled into the street. Rusty didn't see it coming, but Steven did. A speeding car came out of no where when Rusty had came out into the street to get the ball. Steven came running to save his dog, when he tripped over a tree root and couldn't get up.                  'It all happened so quickly,' Steven told his mom at the vet. 'I know son, but you have to stay strong for Rusty. Okay?' Stevens mom told him. 'Okay, Steven replied. Soon after, the vet came and talked to Steven. 'Rusty is very lucky. If he didn't glance over to where the car was, he would have been killed.' 'If he could have been killed and is luck and is safe how come I can't take him home?' Steven said angrily. 'Because he is still in bed shape and he will have to stay here a while,' the vet answered softly. 'But I-,' Steven tried to say. 'Then when can we take him home?' Stevens mom asked quickly before her son could say anything more. 'I don't know yet. He might have to stay here for a while or-,' the doctor said before looking at Steven. 'May I speak to you separately Miss Jenkins?' 'Of course,' she replied quickly. ' Rusty might have to be put down if he isn't responding well to the treatment,' 'Oh no!' Miss Jenkins said. They walked back to Steven who couldn't here the conversation. 'Thank You for giving us the low down on Rusty,' Miss Jenkins said. 'You're welcome. Please come back to check up on him anytime.' the doctor said. 'Thank You. We will,' Miss Jenkins said as her and Steven left.                  The ride home wasn't pleasent. Seven couldn't keep his emotions down. He cried the whole way home.                  A few weeks later, Steven and Ms Jenkins were at the vet saying their good-byes to Rusty. 'I'm sorry we have to put him down, but you know it wouldn't be right to let him live in pain any more,' Ms. Jenkins said. 'I know,' Steven said softly. While leaving the vet, Steven said, 'I wish we were in the future and I could get a robot so he would never die.' 'I know son,' Ms. Jenkins said.                  The next morning, Steven woke up to a big surprise. 'Here is your new robot!' Ms. Jenkins yelled. 'You actually found one!' they were both yelling now. 'Yes I no how said you were yesterday and I didn't like it, so here it is!' Ms. Jenkins said. 'Lets open it!' Steven said.                  The rest of Stevens day was a totally bust. The robot was just a toy a didn't talk or any thing.'I'm so sorry Steven,' it's okay mom. You didn't know the robot was just a piece of junk,' Steven went to bed that night and wished the robot was a real robot.                  The next morning, Steven woke up to his robot cooking breakfast with his mom. 'What in the world!' Steven screamed. 'Your wish came true Steven!' 'I know! I finally have the last thing I wanted before my childhood ends!'                  Steven went on with his life with his robot who had come to life. Sadly, Stevens robot grew to old to fix when Steven was an adult, but Steven didn't become sad like he did with his Rusty. He began his new life with a family.

Even though my little brother can be super annoying i find a way to block him out, most of the time. Science has always been my passion, besides hanging out at the mall with my besties.

The only reason I'm at home is because it is a snow day. And usually I go down to where my mom works, so I usually go down there to eat breakfast. So I get off of my couch where I was dominating people on Black Ops 2. As I'm walking down to the restaurant I see something called the 'Robot Adoption Center.' So I go in there and all of the sudden all I see a ton of robots just sitting there waiting for someone to bring them home. As I walk out of the (RAC) I start sprint at super speed as if I'm a jet and when I get in the restaurant I go straight to my mom and I scream 'you got to come see this!' So I dragged her out of the restaurant and drag her to the (RAC) she says 'where are we going.'         'We are going to the awesomeness place in the world,' I reply. When I get there I ask her if I can get one and she said          'Let's look at them first.'          'Come on look at this one.' The one I was looking at was in the shape of a dog. And since my mom is allergenic to dog we couldn't get one, but this one didn't have fur. That means that we could get it because she isn't allergenic to metal. I said 'hey mom can I get this one.' I asked.           'Sure buddy.' she replied. When I got home I played with him, but I played with him for like 2 hours and the only one tierd out was me. Cause I forgot that he was a robot.           After I got tierd I started to playing Black Ops 2. When I did that all of the sudden he starts playing to. And he was better than me, and that is weird when a dog is better than yourself in a game. But I understood why he was better than me, because he was a robot, but I still treated him like he was a real dog. When my dad got home my dog started barking at him. And my dad was so scared that he screamed. My dogs name was Master. So he went upstairs and greeted my dad. My dad was like 'where did you get a dog?'           'At the (RAC).' I said           'What is that?' he asked           'The 'Robot Adoption Center' Dur,' I said like everyone knew about it.           'So what can he do?'           'Everything pretty much.'           'Let's bring him up to the cabin.' When we went to the cabin all of the sudden he started to play in the leaves like a real dog hopping around. Then we usually we stay there for 2 days but this time we stayed for the week playing with Master.            One day though he ran off into the woods. And my dad just whistled a hour later and he came straight to him. And Master was pretty useful around the cabin he could track down deer, he could play my games for me and he could do the most awesome thing in the world. He could do the Harlem Shake dance!                                                                THE END!

The commercial suddenley gave Bob an idea, he would create his own actuall living robot! He as a genius of science thought that surely he could acomplish this. He set out to collect various pieces of scrap metal, for he had no money.            First he visited the nearby junkyard for a circut board or mother board.   He thinks he will find theese in a discarded computer or t.v. Affter hours he find what he's looking for all of it though would have to be upgraded if he wants a real self working robot with high quallity A.I. Searching and more searching lead to no progress for the quantaum particle node XL or the screwdriver he needs. Though all be it by pure luck, he finds them while leaving the smelly old junkyard right under screwdriver and a wrench also as a bounus someXL MK 3 hype batteries next to it. He picks up all the scrap metal in the yard and proceeds to leave.        He starts working tiresly on his project. For two day and nights he works on his record breaking robot. Finally his robots is finished crome shell titanium lining the most complex serurity anyone has ever seen with their eyes, it was marvalous. But then by freak aciddent lightning struck his robot then nucular waste started raing down and a minature atom bomb struck on the robots face. Surelly Bob thought his robot was destroyed, but no! It came alive with power then greeted his master and promissed his loyalty. Then they marrily went on having fun and adventures helping people out until one day the robot saw a toaster, married it, and ran away. Then just like that Bobs adventure with his beloved robot, was over.

Roman wasn't an ordinary 8th grader, but he was a stright A student. He has a really strong skill in technology and engineering. Roman was having trouble with math though. He always got 70's on his homework and quizes. He got so stressed out.       On a bright and warm Sunday afternoon, while his little sister, Victoria and his little brother, William were outside playing tag, Roman was studying for a test the next day. By 5:30 that night, Roman feel asleep. The next morning, he put a different t-shirt and grabbed his bag and headed out for school. he has never felt so nervous. He started quivering. He felt sick to his stomache.       When Roman arrived at his school, he took a big gulp of air, hoping to keep it. After lunch was math class. At lunch, Roman barely ate. He was to frightened. The time came. Roman left the cafeteria, feeling a knot in his stomache. It took nearly an hour to finish his test. Then finally, his teacher was handing out the tests he graded. Roman was sweating and hoping Mr. Grungler would forget him. Mr. Grungler handed Roman his test upside down.' See me after school,' Mr. Grungler said softly. Roman turned over his paper, he had a sharp look on his face when he saw the big, red 100 on his paper.       Roman walked in and sat on a chair.

It is less than two feet tall. When it works it tests for in the air for gases to tell the miners when it is safe for them to come out of the ground. Also it can find minerws if they get trapped undergound so that they will not die. The person that made it made it easy to us                Dante 2 has a really cool job. He reaches volcanoes to gather imformation for scinentists. The robot has eight legs gust like a spider. It helps it climb up and down things. Also it looks for vents or holes in the crater. Next it gathers imformation on the gases that comes out of the vents. The scientists could not find alot of imformation about volcanoes intil Dante 2 came along.               Mr.Grower is a robot that works in hospitsals. He helps bring in patinets to the hospital. The  robot can pull 500 pounds. Mr.Gower runs on batteries. He can even talk to the people so he can them the imformation he had gathered. The robot works for a long time every single day. Mr.Gower does work that the nurses and doctors                The HRP-4c can dance. It dose tricks and all kinds of different things. The people can even make the robots so they can even be animal robots. The animal robots want to be tranned so that they can be like other real animals. Also there is a different kind of robot animal it has fur on it like it would with a real cat or dog. But you dont need to take them outside. You dont even have to feed them.

And then one knight the robot destroyed it's remote and took over the city. It was the most powerful robot ever invented yet they tried almost every robot to stop it, but they all lost including the fighter jet's. they knew what to do they had to build an even stronger, bigger, and better robot. when they did so they fought and fought and fought. until finally the bad robot had fallen to it's death.

When I was just eleven, robots seemed so distant, everything was so different,but they were so much closer than my friends and I thought.              Now robots take up more than half of labor jobs, probably more, they can do farm work, factory work, anything really. The only jobs that humans still have is basically government, overlooking robots, or heads of corporations. This doesn't help the unemployment rate and now people mostly live in the city in run down apartment buildings and on the streets, begging for food and living off of garbage or welfare, or both. The government is in huge debt because they don't have anybody to tax anymore, most people have fled for Canada or Europe, where there are more jobs for people. I try to help the homeless and work as the overseer of the overseers of robots. I try to give them good pay but times are tough and ever since WW3 jobs have been plummeting.                  I  am lucky to live near to where I grew up, and my sister lives close by to me and my parents still live where I grew up. People that live on my street don't really own the buildings, but the government doesn't really care, they don't have any money to give the government. They can't catch them either because for one there are too many of them to catch. The second reason is  that there aren't many police officers to catch them. Robots do almost everything now, but they can't take us anywhere to catch them because they can't feed them in jail, so they usually just let them go, the soil in almost all of America is all out of nutrients so dust storms occur a lot. This doesn't really affect many people because very few people live in rural areas. Basically only robots and overseers.            War has been  on and off since North Korea bombed the White House, the president and  Congress have had to live in bunkers and haven't made speeches in months.  they don't have much control over the people anyways. Not many people live in Washington D.C. now in fear of being bombed again, the White House in ruins and so are the national monuments. Europe, most of them allies or independent, have been fighting on and off as well, but it is not as bad there as it is here.                After all these years humans tried to make it easier on themselves to do things, but now we need to help ourselves and become self supportive without these robots.This is my final log before my family and I will move to Europe and try to live like it was before the robot age.                                          10 years later....                      After Jake and his family moved to Europe an all robot Civil war began in America, the people couldn't defend themselves because the robots did it for them. Now the robots are now really alive and are trying to take over the world, government leaders are working together to try and stop this epidemic. People in Europe are scared that the robots will soon turn on them too. But they  will be more  prepared, Jake  Domagalski now roams Europe giving safety tips and has a best selling book on how to survive robots if needed. He is now the  Head of Defense for TUNEA, The United Nations of Europe and Asia. Hopefully they will be able to stop the epidemic before it's too late.                    May 11th, 2053                    The robots are now bombing TUNEA, and we are now developing a destabilizing device that you can throw at robots like a grenade and they will shut down. But we will need soldiers to do that, and we are NOT going to use any robots, I now have started recruiting men to fight in the TUNEA army, navy, and marines. I am worried we will lose this war because of one of my mistakes. We are trying to  fight for Hawaii and the Caribbean, but it will be a hard battle.              December 26th, 2056                 After 3 years of  fighting, we are now developing robots made from the remains of robots we have killed to be suicide bombers. Our  men are few and morale is down, we have been prioritizing to save as many people as we can, we have regained Washington D.C. But the robots just keep on coming and our men can't fight forever, they can, this will be an uphill battle.                 June 17th, 2060             After we had made our robots, they killed  hundreds of robots  per battle with only 2 or 3 of our robots. This war is finally in our advantage, but it isn't over yet. This is the head of defense for TUNEA, signing out.

He had always wanted to make a robot since he was a little kid. So now he has a chance to. Mr. Levy is graduate from the University of California (Cal). He planned making a robot with his best friends Mia, Ben, and Dylan. So now here he is in his lab working with his a friends, who are now his assisitants.             The first thing they needed to do was to buy all the other tools they needed and materials. Then, they went back to their lab and got everything ready. 'Do you think we need anything else?', Mr. Levy asked Ben. 'No I don't think so', Ben replied. When they were done getting everything ready they began building the robot. Mr. Levy was very exicited on making his first robot in his life. 'I'm going to need you to get that piece over there', Mr. Levy said as he pointed it out to Dylan. While Dylan was getting the piece Mia came up with an idea. 'What if we add something to the robot that could make it fly, right here', Mia said as she pointed at the blueprints that were next to Ben. Mr. Levy thought for a second and then said, 'That is a great idea, but we don't have the certain parts to build something like that, unless if you want to order the parts from online', Mr. Levy said. 'I will be glad to', Mia said. Then, Dylan came back as soon as Mia left to her office. When Dylan handed Mr. Levy the part he asked for, he said, 'Where is Mia going.' 'She thought of an idea, that we should build something to make our robot fly, and so she is going to her computer to order the parts', Ben said. The four friends worked on the robot until got it got dark. 'I think it's time to take rest you guys', Mr. Levy said. 'Ok', all of the other friends said. And then each of them went home.               The next day Mr. Levy was the first person there to the lab. While he waited for the rest of his friends, he started working on the robot. About 20 minutes later all Mia, Dylan, and Ben came. They all said, 'Sorry that were a little late.' 'It's okay', said Mr. Levy. Then they all got to work. 'Oh, I forgot to tell you that the parts we need to make the robot fly will becoming in tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.' 'Okay, we will be done with this robot probably the day after tommorrow because we got a quarter of it done yesterday. So if work really hard today we could probably finish half of it.' So all four friends got to work. While Mr. Levy and Mia worked on the robot. Dylan and Ben worked on how they were going to fit the things to make the robot fly into the robot. Later on, when they figured out how to Ben told Mr. Levy, 'We finished the blueprints, would you like to see them?' 'Yes', Mr. Levy answered. While Mr. Levy was looking and the blueprints with Ben, Dylan went over to help Mia with the robot. Then once you know it they were all working on the robot as a team. If you there watching them you would things like 'pass me the screwdriver' or 'hand me that piece over there right next to you' and 'no not that piece the other one'. They worked so hard that that they did finish half of the robot just like Mr. Levy said. So then they all went back home to rest.               On the next day this time it was Mia who got their first. While she waited for the others to come she called the people who were going to bring the pieces she ordered. Right when she finished the call all the others came. Then like yesterday they worked as a team. 'Today we would work on the robots feet because the parts to make the robot fly are coming in today. Right Mia.' 'Yes, I just called them and they said that they parts are ready and that they are coming in today at 1:00 instead of at 2:00', Mia said with a little exicitement in her voice. 'Alright, Ben can you go get those two pieces that are over there, those pieces are the main ones for the feet.' While Ben was getting the pieces they needed, the others started working on the robot. Then when Ben came back they were half-ways done with the feet. Right when they were done connected everything, they heard a knock. Mia said, 'I got it', and ran to the door. When she opened the door a man stood there with two boxes in his hands. The man handed the boxes to Mia. Then she said, 'Thank you', and went back inside the lab. When she got inside the lab all the others crowded around Mia as she opened the box. 'Wow', Dylan said amazed. Then they all went back to were the robot was at, and started putting all the new pieces were they belonged. 'So when we finish you and Dylan should go outside and test the feet', Mr. Levy said to Ben. Then Dylan and Ben both nodded at the same time.               On next day they were going to finish to finish there robot. So yesterday when they finished with feet Dylan and Ben went outside to test them. When they came back inside the lab they had said it worked. Now they only need the head and then they are done. Today all of the four friends got their at the same time. Mia told everybody, 'Good morning', as they entered the lab. As soon as they got to the robot they started working. 'So today were going to finish this robot', Mr. Levy said. Then each of them started to work ton their part of the body that Mr. Levy each gave them. They worked really hard. 'I finished my part', Dylan said. Then it was Ben who finished, then it was Mia, and last but not least was Mr. Levy. As a team they connected all their parts, and then they connected everything together. Then all of a sudden as they were putting some kind of battery into the robot an alrm went off. Which meant that there was a fire. So they put all the batteries in the robot really fast, but as soon as they finished the fire burst out. Mr. Levy said, 'Let's all get out of here.' Right when they got out of the building the whole thing collapsed. Then somehow the fire department came to clear the fire and to check if they were all okay. When they were checking if they were all okay they found a big cut on Dylan leg from a big piece of glass. While they were fixing Dylan up, each of them were really because they made a robot that is no crushed in that building. But then a firefighter came to them and said, 'I think we found something that's moving.' Then they all knew who was that moving thing in the building. There robot.

First, i was just walking a roud in my big backyard?Then i saw someing sticking out of the groud it was a robot, so then i started to dig it out so i could bring it to my room.Now every time when i come out of school i start to work on it like puting missing pices were they belong. In addition, i start to program it, so i could make it do what i say.Like if i say clean up my room it will.Now i just need to make the remote, so i go an find my remote from my  video game. Then i cut it off my video game an program it to the robot.It works!  I did now it do my work,homework,chores,and my room.   In conclusion,it was really fun finding and fixing my robot.Also i hope i conviced you that my story was wortwhile.

She is a little less than three feet tall, and can climb and steer herself over any bump in the road. She is a very smart robot that is programmed to take pictures of Saturn, and once she takes a picture it gets sent immediatley to the scientists in the lab on Earth.          Carol comes across a moving shadow while riding over craters. Carol is very smart and she at once senses danger. She turns around and sees a black blob in her path. She quickly takes a picture, and the scientists see it and worry about Carol. The black blob with squinty eyes jumps on Carol and the connection between Carol and the scientists breaks down. The scientists try all they can, but they cant find Carol.           Meanwhile, Carol is face to face with the blob and the blob is trying to figure out what he just stumbled upon. Carol is smart and of course does not fear, but when the blob spoke to her that was a surprise. Luckily Carol could speak as well because she was taught thousands of different phrases in case she did come across life on this planet. She spoke to it and said she came in peace. The blob looked confused, but just as scary. The black blob spoke to it with respect and asked if Carol would be the queen of his planet. She didn't answer and that made him angry. He jumped on her again, and somehow she reconnected with the scientists on earth.               The scientists told her what to do, and she followed the orders. She outwitted the blob and escaped him, and the scientists were glad to see that they never came across the blob again. The guessed that since he was out witted by a three foot robot he was embarrassed to show his face, so the scientists guessed that he hid forever.              Carol returned to Earth, and there wasn't a soul on Earth who had never heard about Carol's exciting adventure on Saturn.

That gave Sophia an idea, Sophia decided to invent a robot that would help keep the world a clean place. She recycled the trash and ran home. Sophia asked her dad Bob if he could take her to his work and get some car parts. Bob said 'Yes.' and he drove her to the car shop. Sophia was looking for different types of  car parts such as a engine.          Once her dad said it was time to go they got in the car and drove home. Sophia was kind of a genius so she went in the garage and started building her robot. It took a couple of months for her to finish building it, especially with school. Finally the day came when she finished her robot and she took her robot to the park, because that seemed to be in need of a good cleaning.         Sophia carefully turned the robot on and then slowly drove it over to a candy wrapper. The robot sensed that there was garbage and picked it up and rode over to the trash can. Sophia was so happy and after a couple of years the town won a medal for the cleanest town, not only did the town win a medal so did Sophia for inventing such a terrific robot that helped the town look clean.           Sophia was so happy with herself and the school was proud of her to. From then on Sophia lived a clean and happy life.

Jonh is at the hotel and buys the best room.Next he goes to the store and buys a whole lot of food,and then goes back to his new home.he whates while amazed at the flat screen and sterio set.After two hours he goes out and buys a mantion on a 500 acre farm surrounded by woods .But on the way there he loses 5,000,000,654,789,000,567 doolers.Whenthy get to the mantion john settles in the highest room in the mantion.he lets a lot of poor people to live in his house. soon he loses all his money and tom dies.                                           Now john is walking trough the woods hoping not to run into any bear or lions.UNtil he comes upon a cottege.He goes inside and finds a portal wich says to another word of adventure.So he walkes trouh to only see his parents, tom  and a new mantion they go to the house and live happily ever after.

I made it because there's a lot of stories about dogs running away, drowning or getting shot. Same with cats or other house pets. So my robot Feline Flyer does all sorts of things. He can sense if animals are hurt or scared. He also can fly very fast. He has medicine,food,water,casts,and more packed when he is on a mission which is all the time.         Feline Flyer has 6 legs, he looks like a bird but way bigger. He weighs about 350. He can carry around 250. he charges for 3 hours and can work for 48 hours.When he flies he goes about 250 mph even if its around the world. He has never broke or even got injured.He is water proof so he can swim.         His worse mission was when a dog was stuck in a volcano. He had to go about 150 miles till he found the dog. The dog was very hurt. When he rescued him he founds out he had a vest on and it was a service dog . After a couple months it was recovered so they put the dog on the internet 3 months went by nobody claimed it so I decided Feline Flyer can have him a body. I named the dog spark. But don't worry because he doesn't get to go with Feline Flyer when he is on missions . But when he isn't busy on missions they love playing with each other.

'...Many died, but thousands survived because of ROBOTS a- woah, woah, woah, oh god ,what is that! Is that another, wait the aaahhhhh ,NNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!'                                        24 hours before...                                                     ' Well goooooood morning New York! It's a good day to be alive isnt it!' , said the talk show host from Buenos Dias NYC.  Hi, I'm Johnny Dover.I was sitting on the couch with my robotic dog, Spiky.Anyways, while I watched the show they said ,' Excuse us for the interruption, but please listen to the words of our leader.' Obama, the president, came up on the screen, ' We have just discovered from NASA that there will be a meteor hitting the Earth at approximately 8:00 pm. Calling all army soldiers to go to your nearest database. Everyone stay calm and have faith. Thank You.'                                                                      I put on my equipment and headed out in my Google car. It was like a family reunion seeing all my colleagues again. Joe, Bob, Tony, Richard, and Peter. The general began to speak before I could say a thing to my buds.' I have loved working with all of you on many fights and struggles, so let's make this one worth it!'                                                    7:30 pm                                       You could see the meteor coming fast we all said our goodbyes and we could save the world. Some were worried about their families. 'WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN!' , yelled a soldier.                                                          7:59:58                                           I felt the impact from miles away. It was so big and green. Little and big aliens began to rampage from the rock.   Every robot ever created sprang into action. Before we knew it , it was all over. We were reported that it landed in central park killing lots of people. The talkshow host was killed by one of the aliens in his studio.                                              The robots were extrordinary. Since that very day all robots have been appriciated. We still all care for them and play with them, even me. Those things saved lives and they still do. Now I've become one of them.

A giant robot popped out and said 'Are you my leader'.Then I said 'did you use to have one'. He said no I don't know were they are.  I told him he could stay with me until he find his parents. Meanwhile I still have to do my chores,then the robot said he would do my chores for me. I was impressed he would do that,then a name came to me I'll name you Mrs.Batista.                                      Mrs Batista finally went to sleep, Then a big thump sound came from the back yard. I could not believe my eyes there were was another robot but it was a baby.Mrs Batista came outside and said that was her baby.So I thought wow what should I name this baby. It took me one whole day to think then it hit me,literately a rock hit me in the head.His name was baby Isaac.Then I one day Mrs Batista died holding her baby. Then a meteor came crashing down it was a man  robot. So I just walked away from everything and went to my moms house. I did not tell her what happen she have never believed me .Then there were robots every where. And everyone died not the people who flew  to another country.

The next day I woke up I heard a lot of noise in the kitchen , I thought it was my mom but it was actually  the toy robot in the kitchen .it was alive I could not believe it I thought it was just a dream. so I blinked 3 times and the robot was still there. so then I realizes that I was not  dreaming.the robot started talking and I got scared. but then the robot said 'do not be scared I am friendly'. so I said hi the robot also said 'hi '. it said ' what can i do for you', I said 'you can bring me some thing to drink 'and it brought me some juice. I said 'thank you'. The robot said 'you are welcome'. after the robot gave me my juice I Star ted to think of more ideas how can the robot help others so i decided to write in the news paper i said 'there is a robot that can talk serve and do any thing you want'. i started geting leters saming that they wanted to my robot i knew it was a good start.

So we realized that it was a jumping robot and a cook and a pick a fruit robot and a masog robot how was so cool we took it home and explored it ,but when we put it in the garage it lost power so we left it by the window in the garage. So the next day he was running back in forth so I figerd out that it's power came from the sun so we left it out there by the window to get more energy and we kept it .

This is my replica robot R2D2. I built this robot last year. It took me thousands of Muggle money to build this. I live in Zedov on Earth.       My robot has bionic parts in it and is controlled by the mind. It has a tiny microchip in it's arm. It is voice activated, but it won't work.       'Uh oh,' I said.       'There is a electric storm outside,' I said.       'I better go in,'' I said.       'Oh no,' I yelled.       'R2d2 is outside,' I yelled again and again.       The next day the storm has passed.       ' Where did R2D2 go,' I said?       ' I think R2D2 came alive,' my assistant said.       ' He is,' I said.       There he is walking over the pool.       'Maybe the lightning triggered him to move by himself,' I said.       'Maybe the voice activated chip still works,' my assistant said.       I said,' Stop.       ' Look it worked,' I said.                                                                                             Epilogue:           After a few months of repairing, making control robots, and making improvements to R2D2. R2D2 is now a search and rescue robot                                                             The End                                                                                             	DT NNP IN NNP NNP NNP , PRP$ NN VBZ NNP NNP NNP VBZ DT NN CD DT VBZ PRP$ NN NN NNP PRP VBD DT NN JJ NNP NNP VBD PRP NNS IN NNP NN TO VB NNP PRP VBP IN NNP IN NNP NNP NN VBZ JJ NNS IN PRP CC VBZ VBN IN DT NNP NNP VBZ DT NN NN IN PRP VBZ NNP NNP VBZ NN VBN , CC PRP MD RB NNP NNP NN , '' PRP NNP JJ VBZ DT JJ NN IN , '' PRP NNP NNP JJR NN IN , '' PRP NNP JJ DT , '' PRP NNP -NONE- VBZ IN , '' PRP VBD RB CC NNP NNP JJ NN DT NN VBZ NNP POS NNP VBD NNP VB , '' PRP VBD .

I always wanted to see one in person or maybe even try to make one. I, to be exact would like to invent the most coolest robot EVER! It would be fun, but if everything comes out wrong. The creation would be ruined and nobody would appreciate my horrible work.                  Fist of all my name is Kimberly Marquez. I enjoyed everything about robots, their figure, the size, and everything else of it. I wanted to build a robot, so I asked my friends to help me out. It was one sunny Saturday my friends and I were coming up with what my robot was going to be like . 'My robot is going to look just like a normal person, but can turn small into a computer ' I told them. They agreed and gathered a lot of materials to start building.                  We stayed up almost all night trying to work out our invention. It was 10:30 p.m. my friends stayed for a sleep over to start right in the morning. Starting tomorrow we needed to have at least half of the robot done. We worked and worked on it, but we just couldn't understand what to do first. It was 7:00 a.m. There was a morning chill, and the sun was out. I came to think that everything was just a bad thought and just stop everything. 'You guys I think we should just, forget about the robot,' I said. They gave me a confusing look. One of them said sadly, ' Why should we forget about it, we have almost half of the robot.' I just shook me head no.                 The next day was Monday, a school day. I was walking down the hall when I noticed a black and purple paper laying on the floor. It said ' STARTING WEDNESDAY WE ARE HAVING A SCIENCE CLASS', ' THIS SCIENCE CLASS WILL BE A COMPETITIVE CHALLENGE AGAINST OTHER STUDENT FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS' ,' IN AFTER SCHOOL  WE WILL HAVE A PRESENTATION FOR BUILDING YOUR OWN ROBOT' ,' STUDENTS ITS AN OPPORTUNITY, SO PLEASE ANYONE IS WELCOME.' I was happy to know there is now an opportunity for me to make my robot.                 I saw my friends coming my way really excited, 'Kim did you hear ', one said, 'You can make your own robot now.' Happily I said, ' I know you want to come with me and make one, it will be fun. They nodded yes.Two days passed , its Wednesday the classroom is empty. Then my friends and the rest of the students come in. A man starts a presentation, then after 30 minutes have past he tells us we will be stating our robots this day.  Mr. Jonson the teacher gave us really different materials to use more differ than the ones we used at home. He gives us instructions on how to start. We actually did make a robot this time and it did not take that long 4 hours straight. Now we were all ready to go to the competition this Saturday.                We arrived at the museum Academy Of Science. 'This place is crowded' I said. We stopped at a ticket stand a man asked for our ticket, 'Ticket Please.' Mr. Jonson gave him our tickets. We entered in an enormous room with different robots everywhere. Another tall man walked to the microphone . He said to get our robots ready to start the competition. Our small robot competed with a lot of other robots. Although it was not at all how I wanted mine, our special robot won the competition! All of us we proud that our robot actually did come alive I thought it wouldn't work but it did. And now you see many dreams do come true but you just have to struggle though some obstacles to get to that dream. That was the most amazing experience I ever had.

First, they needed a plan how to build a robot and make one that is very smart,cool, and playful.They haded to think for days..... and days..... and even more days.......until they got their idea so guess what they found and got their idea like got of no where.They planned their until they got it and they knew exactly how to make their robot and named it Nerdy Bot.Second, they grabbed the items they have got from the store then started building the Nerdy Bot(the robot).Third, they putted in every eletronic supplies that was to make their Nerdy Bot. Forth, they needed to build the body it was 3ft. tall 5ft. wide that was the body size. Fifth, was the head it was a middle size head it was like 3ft. tall 4ft. wide that was the size of that robot head. Sixth, they haded to build the last thing was the romote to turn it on and off because they don't want it to get out of control.                                                      The Nerdy Bot was done, but they haded to try it out and they did it had work so that was how they made the robot come alive.They were proud of themselves that they can really make a robot. They were so happy that they had fun playing with the Nerdy Bot that they made.                                                	NNP NNP CD NN PRP VBD WRB NN VBD DT : NN IN : .

He just going to get his car but he didn't know his car was a robot .Wishing to the future. His dad was a scientist who had finally built a teliporter .So Ricardo figured out that his car was a robot .Ricardo tried taking his car to the teliporter. What they didn't know was that the scientist wanted to study the robot .                     They were going to figure out how to get in the lab. Till they got trapped when they entered the lad .But he managed to escape but when he made it to the teliporter he still escaped back to the future.

The robot is less than two feet tall, has wheel,it goes up and down stairs,make tight turns, roll through water, it's small,but strong, it carries food,water and other supplies , and can even drag hurt peopleto safety.Wherever it goes the Gemini- scout collects information it test the air for gases and tell the miners when the air is safe. It has a thermal camera to find miners the thermal camera uses heat  sensors to find living things. When the robot finds the miners they can use it's two way radio to talk with the rescue team.this robot is not difficult to use its control is just like a video game control if you ever played one, you might all ready know how to use this amazing robot  the Gemini-Scout.                            The Gemini-scout is not the biggest robot but it still is a great robot because it not a bad robot it saves non like  alot the other robots in the world including Dante 2,Mr.Gower, and the Agribots.             The   Dante 2 it is not the save lives robot it explores volcanoes. It has eight legs for climbing the wall, and it can survive the heat because it was built to survive the heat.           Mr.Gower is a robot that works in the hospital helping doctors and nerses.   The agribots are robots that picks fruit so it helps farmers pick apples, strawberries,grapes, and other fruits.

Class ended and I walked up to the libary cause thats where we have the meetings. So the captan was talking to us and told us to make a fiction story. So I chose robots cause there cool.          I was walking home and tried to think of something to write about but nothing popped up in me mind. There was something small in the bushes but I didn't bother to check. So I started to walk home again but I kept hearing a squiking sound. So I turned around and I didn't see anything. I walked even faster and then I heared the squiking even louder. I turned around there was a robot there. he need some oil in him thats why there was a squiking noise. He looked like a agribot these kind of robots pick friut like apples, but they live in fams. Why is this one here, I brought him home. I tried to ask him questions but he doesn't talk, so I brought him to my green house in the back yard where my mom was. I asked her if i could have him she said ya.          So i let him work in the green house and he lives with me now. He seems very happy but I still wonder where he came from, but it does not matter any more cause he mine and I named him berrie. He is my best friend and I am happy too.

Not expecting it to work, Jimmy set his robot aside so that he could look at him. Scout, he named him. One day while Jimmy was at school, scout came alive. Jimmy returned to find scout missing. He was freaking out! A missing robot! He lied down on his bed and slept. He was awoken to the sound of rustling papers. He looked and there was scout, looking through his school-work. 'Scout?!' Jimmy asked amazed. 'Yes of course Jimmy' scout responded in a robotic voice. Jimmy thought to himself, Oh My Gosh!!I've created a talking robot!         Later that night, Jimmy tested out what else scout had the ability to do. He was quite intelligent. He understood Jimmy speaking to him, he performed tasks like feeding the dog, taking out the trash, and putting the dishes away.Jimmy was excited about all the possiblities and great adventures this robot was able to have.While Jimmy was sleeping, Scout had a change of mind of what his 'master' would make him do. Scout was turning evil.        That next morning, Jimmy woke to Scout yelling, and throwing papers everywhere. 'Scout! Scout! Scout what is going on?' Scout looked angrily at Jimmy, beady red eyes, a robotic grimace. 'You are NOT my master!You do NOT control me!' Scout then proceeded to break Jimmy's door and rush downstairs. Jimmy had created a mess he needed to clean up. 'Awwww man!' Jimmy uttered under his breath. 'great'. By then scout was already down the street screaming his little robot head off.        Jimmy chases after him, in his footed pajamas, with a teddy bear in his arms. He was so frightened. 'Scout?' 'Scooouuutt???' Jimmy continuously called out. 'Where is that dang robot?' Just then scout leaped up out of the bushes and tackled Jimmy, 'Scout? SCOUT?! woah...woah! Dude chill out!' Jimmy was able to wrestle the robot off of himself and onto the ground. 'You are not my master! Puny human!' Scout yelled out furiously. 'I created you, didn't I?' Jimmy thought, 'So, yeah, that DOES make me your master!'         Later that day, Jimmy was able to disable Scout, 'You were a good friend to start with, but this had to happen.' Jimmy was heartbroken, but he understood this was the right thing to do. Jimmy's mother, called him faintly, her voice getting louder. 'Jimmy? Jimmy wake up sweetie!' Jimmy popped out ogf bed. 'Oh my gosh! Thank goodness it was only a dream! Whew!' Jimmy's mother was confused,' What happened sweetie?' Jimmy replied to her, 'I'd be glad to tell you over some nice, warm, robot-free breakfast.'

His owner saw him with a knife and going to her sons room one day, so she pulled out a pocket knife and chopped his head off.Although his wires had been cut off he was still walking. That was the scariest thing she ever experienced. I'm not scarred she thought trembling. It was like she was in a trance then she remembered her son. She was the states best Karate master. She was in front of him now and on the first site it looked like a new blossomed flower. Then its eyes turned red then it also went into fighting mode. She launched all the attacked that were possible it just wouldn't give up it was blocking every attack. It was worse than ever now it was in blocking and fighting mode it had extendable arms and it was torture. After 20 long minutes police men arrived. when they arrived the Ron-6000 just exploded with the sense back up was coming, and many police men who entered the house were astounded but 30 seconds later the exact place it had exploded every part of the in-dependable robot was turning into other robots with machine guns. Police men ran out calling for back up against the 300 men with machine guns. They called for help , but it was to late they fired and had slaughtered they 20 men in front of them. The mom and her two kids, Josh and Mark, ran out and left their house in the hands of the 300 robots.36 minutes and 6 seconds later Air force and tanks had surrounded the area. they destroyed every single one and saved the people. Unfortunately scientists said they wouldn't last for long. Since they had been destroyed twice it was going to take longer for them to multiply it was told that 76 years later would be the signal that the U.S.A military was going to fight not 300 but 6,792 robots in tanks. 	-NONE- VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN VBG , RB DT NN NN PRP VBG NNS IN DT NN RB PRP VBZ VBN VBN IN NNP NNP NN VBD PRP IN DT NN CC VBG TO PRP$ NNS VBP CD NN , RB PRP VBD RP DT NN NN CC VBD PRP$ NN JJ PRP$ NNS VBD VBN VBN RP PRP VBD RB NNP NNP VBD DT JJS NN PRP RB NNP PRP VBP RB VBN PRP VBD NNP NNP VBD IN PRP VBD IN DT NN RB PRP VBD PRP$ NNP NNP VBD DT NNS JJS NNP NNP NNP VBD IN NN IN PRP RB CC IN DT JJ NN PRP VBD IN DT JJ VBN NNP NNP PRP$ NNS VBD VBN RB PRP RB VBD IN NN NNP NNP VBD DT DT VBN IN VBD JJ PRP RB MD RB VB RP PRP VBD VBG DT NNP NNP VBD JJR IN RB RB PRP VBD IN NN CC VBG NN PRP VBD JJ NNS CC PRP VBD NNP NNP CD RB VBZ NNS NNS NNP WRB PRP VBD DT NN RB VBD IN DT NN RB IN VBD VBG , CC JJ NNS NNS WP VBN DT NN VBD VBN CC CD NNS JJ DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBN DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD VBG IN JJ NNS IN NN NNP NNP NNS VBD IN NN IN RB IN IN DT CD NNS IN NN NNP NNP VBD IN NN , CC PRP VBD TO JJ PRP VBD CC VBD VBN PRP CD NNS IN JJ IN NNP NNP NN CC PRP$ CD NNS , NNP CC NNP , VBD IN CC VBD PRP$ NN IN DT NNS IN DT CD -NONE- VBZ CC CD NNS JJ NNP NN CC NNS VBD VBN DT NNP PRP VBD DT JJ CD CC VBD DT NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP MD RB VB IN NNP NNP PRP VBD VBN VBN NN PRP VBD VBG TO VB NN IN PRP TO RB PRP VBD VBN IN CD NNS RBR MD VB DT JJ IN DT NNP JJ VBD VBG TO NN RB CD CC CD NNS IN NNS .

Her name was giggles and she was always happy. When she ran out of fuel, she had fallen and lost power. 25 years later the same storm had arrived and it shoked the little robot with all the electricity it had. Giggles awakened confused about all the changes that had happened. When she reached the city she found out that that all the humans were enslaved by the robots. Now it was up to her to save them all.               Poor little Giggles first had to get fuel for her empty tank. She didnt realize that all the robots were even more generous than when she had left. They gave everything out for free, but now they hated humans. It was up to her to figure out why. The most obvious thing was that there was a large suspicious building. She decided she would start her investigation over there.  When she reached the tower she saw that it was heavly gaurded by newer improved robots. Thats when Giggles decided to come at night . At night she had found a little gap on one of the walls. It took her a couple of minutes but she finally squeezed through. The building was still gaurded by even more menacing robots. Then she heard loud footsteps coming so she went into a room that she had seen. The room was filled with old robots scraps. She decided to look through the junk and get a little upgrade. After a while she had found all the pieces that she would need. Then she quickly abandoned the room and tried to reach the top of the building. At the top she figured out who had enslaved all the robots. It wasnt a human neither a robot but it was a super computer. She had finally learned the truth when the computer told her what had happened. She found out that an evil human had planted a virus into her system and had turned her evil. Now she had erased the memory of all the robots and told them that the humans are bad. After the story the computer had called the robots to take Giggles away, but Giggles wasnt going to leave without a fight. Then she grabbed nd ripped out her arm and stabbed the computer. After that the computer died and all the robots returned to normal. The humans were also released.             Then the humans and the robots both decided to make Giggles their new ruler. Giggles was first a little shy but after a few minutes she had accepted their offer. A few years later Giggles city had prospered. Now Giggles city is the best place around and both humans and robots all over the world come to visit.

'You mean Robo is done?' Dr. Shea's assistant asks.       'He sure is made perfectly!' Dr. Shea pats the robot's arm.   'Let's go out and celebrate.' He says with a huge smile.       The two of them leave the robot, unattended, and go out to eat some pizza. When they come back, they both walk to Robo's room. The two of them examine him while they sip their sodas.       'Didn't I leave Robo over on that side?' Asks Dr. Shea.       'Hmm, but you don't think Robo could've moved himself, do you?'       'Ha ha, of course not!' Dr. Shea forces out a fake, little laugh.       Mr. Shea and his trustworthy assistant work on their other creation, a robot used to do all your homework correctly. When suddenly they hear a loud noise!       Crash! Boom! Robo falls off his bed. Clink, clink, clink, clink.        'Shea, w-whats that n-noise?' Asks Shea's assistant, Marx.       'Oh, Marx! Always scared about everything. It's probably just somethings that fell!'       The two of them walk over to the noise. They see Robo walking!       'Greetings, masters.' Robo says. Clink, clink! He keeps walking towards them.       'Sh-Shea, w-what's, h-how!?' Marx whispers as he gets behind Dr. Shea.       'Robo? You can walk! You can talk! How? My goodness! This is a miracle! This is just amazing!'       'Thank you master for creating me. You are the reason I'm alive. Father, Shea.' Robo stops a couples inches away from Dr. Shea.       'Call me doctor. Come lets get some tests done.' Dr. Shea says to Robo. Then he turns around and leads Marx and Robo into a testing room. 'Marx, this is amazing!' He keeps on talking about how it's a miracle.       After the tests Shea, Marx and Robo had a press meeting where all of America was amazed. After Robo's life saving skills training was over, Robo became a hero!       Robo is still out there saving lives of the ones in danger. Thank Robo for spending his life in selfless service to our world.       10 years later Marx and Dr. Shea were, yes, famous and very rich. The homework robot didn't work, but creating Robo was great enough. The two got married to kind, caring women and settled into big mansions with beautiful families while Robo spent his life saving all of America. America's safety is in Robo's hand.

Son the unknown lighting bolt electricuting her robot , causing her robot too come alive.Earlier that day the mad scientist took  her daughter heart from the funrul home and stuffed it in the robots heart.But there was a flaw,the mad scientist didn't have unhough electristy to turn the robot on. So on that night the robot came alive.  Te mad scientist made the robot look like a real human person. With clothes and a real looking face. The only exception was she had a different heart.The scientist made a mistake.The heart was not her daughters.It was mine.I am Mary Evergreen and this is my story.                                         Dear diary, It's been two centuries since i died in a fire when I was only 15.It's been a long time since that. I r ember when i was trapped in burning house. The only thing that bothers me is I have metal legs. I haven t been trying to move because the mad scientist might tun me off. Oh no shes walking in no sudden movements. She caught me talking this is good bye again.Surprisingly she hugs me and starts saying'I never thought I've see you again'.I say ''um yeah you too''.To be my Creator I thought she be some what different.Anyway she took me to my room and there was a weird box that showed live plays.                                 Dear diary, I still haven't told my Creator that I'm her not her daughter.The reason why I barley starting to see the world. When I came to America it was nothing but dry land and Indian tribes. This is when George Wasintion was barley a teenager with his snaky mood.Now there is computers, cheese burgers, i pad s ,TV,t and his machine you use wash clothes [they don't even use lakes].I just don't want disappoint her when I tell her I'm not her duagher.Right after she walked into my room and said''I love you''.                                             Part 2 : the confession                                    Dear diary,today is  the day I am going tell my creator I am not her daughter.I step into the room. She says 'oh hi sweetie,I get more nervous. I rush and say I'm not your daughter'. She says 'what I cant here you''. I  say 'I am not your daughter I am a different girl I am Mary Evergreen and I am from the 18th century . I am sorry I should told you sooner but this much age when I came here place don't kill me''.She didn't get upset and left . she said to me  'I knew this would happen that's why installed  in your HRP-4c  a concuis'. I say I will leave  and go some where else.'' or she said 'you can be my asident in my lab'. I s aid 'yes  thank you so much'. Since that day I never doughted her.                                                                    part 3:the power                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Dear diary, I just fond the craziest thing .For my 16th birthday I got a special power.I can play music , dance,and sing. Isn't that the coolest thing. For mt creators birthday  I am going to download her a song most people know it's called  the birthday song. I'm still trying figure out a lot of things. So far I'm having a good week being human. The best thing about being a robot  is having  a heart because most robots don't. Anyway this weeks been pretty awesome. I'll write more later.

I like robots that are fun to hang out with and that do   chores just like the story you are about to read. In the year of 2012 there was a girl named Katherin she was a shy girl. Everybody thought she was wierd just because she did not talk to anyone.              One day Katherin was walking in the neirborhood and she ran into a boy named Jake and then she just walked away. Jake wanted to get to know her so he caught up with her again then he said ' Hi my name is Jake and your Katherin right. ' She nodded and staded quiet.               'Sorry I don't really talk to anyone really. ', Katherin said with a small grin.   'So, tell me some thing about your self any thing like your favorite color or ' just then she stoopped him from going on. She gave an angry look.             'Why?' she asked with a wierd look on her face looking confused. then Finally she said 'Ok, do you want to see some thing? ' he smiled then nodded she made him follow her back to her house and showed him something no one has ever seen before. She showed him her robot. After that she told him all the things it can do from hanging out with it to doing chores for her.                In her opinion Katherin thought Jake would faint. Instead his eyes were wide open and looked at her with a huge smile. Ever since that day they became best friends and with the robot of course. They did every thing they even let each other borrow the robot to do their chores for them at their houses. When they went back to school she started to talk and then she finally had friends. She was happy about meeting Jake and showing him her COOL Robot. :)                   	NNP NNP NNP NN IN NNS VBP PRP IN .

It was here it was there if you lived there it would probably be under you bed! One day a scientist came to town and saw all the pieces. He was astonish. He asked a man 'how much is this pieces' the man said 'there free'. So, he went home and started building.                 The first try didn't work out so much. SO, he tried again this time it worked but it still had some kinks. It was running. Then it broke down. He thought it was because he needed to be charged. So that next day he went to search for parts. He found exactly he wanted and more. That second he ran all the way home. When the man was in front of his house he trip and fell. He got up he so it was his robot. He and the robot went inside and then he charged the robot.                  He found a memory chip. He program the chip to have lots of thing on it like: calculate singing dancing pets baby's and etc.   The man called it HRP-4c. The man loved his robot. The robots first song he sang was 'BABY' by Justin Bieber.                    In conclusion the robot help the man to get pride. He said ' I still remember his first song. 'THAT SONG WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE' SAID THE MAN. 	RB NNP NNP NNP CD NN IN DT NN CC NNP NN RB VBD DT JJ NN IN NN NNS EX WRB RB NNP PRP VBD RB PRP VBD RB IN PRP VBD RB PRP MD RB VB IN PRP VBD .

Everyone said he couldn't do it, which made him try harder, which made him go crazy.  On the day of his 85th birthday, he bought himself a tool box and a bucket full of metal. He went back to his home, and got to work on a new invention that would help people all over the world.                       He worked for five years straight. The only time he stopped was to eat for 10 minutes and sleep for 2 hours then it was back to work.  After he completed his work he named his creation Quicky Stevey.  He combined all the abilities of his fathers inventions.  It could help miners underground like the Gemini Scout.  It could climb into volcanoes for research, like the Dante 2.  Also it can bring people medicine when they needed it.  The robot can do all these things by just the push of a button.  It was operated   by a remote control.                   The next morning he took his invention to the center of town where everyone could see him.  'Go away old man,' one man said.  'You are too old to be like your father. Just give up and retire all ready.'                 'Just listen to me. My father invented three robots that can help everyone, but wouldn't buying three robots be more expensive than buying just one.  Which why I took all my father's research and combined it into one.  Behold the Quicky Stevey.  With just one push of a button the Quicky Stevey can tend to any trouble you might be in.  Have a report due on volcanoes for school, know problem just push the volcano button on the remote and it find you your research in 1 days time.  Anything my father invented is right here in the palm of your hand and you don't even need the robot, just buy the remote.  Here's the best part, sell my father's robots back to me and your remote will be 100% free.'              'You are just wasting our time' said the man again. 'Do you honestly think we will buy your invention when w already paid for it.  And how do we know you will give us our money back when your father through it into a volcano for safe keeping.  Hey everyone, let's beat this thing to peices.'  That is when everyone tore the robot to the ground with their bare hands.             He tried and tried again but he ended up with the same resultes for the next 12 years of his life.  At his funreal a little girl walked up his tombstone, placed a flower on the ground, and said with a soft voice,  'I liked your invention.'

As we made the robots my friend saw something strange but I didn't say anything I thought she  just didn't have enough sleep and was tired. I was making my robot and making sure I put all the details and wires on right. As I was was making my robot I named him Albert. Albert was coming along well and I didn't have any troubles with him. But on the other hand my friend Victoria was having a little trouble. I was watching Victoria with her robot and as I was watching her I went over there to see how she was doing and she said everything was fine.           I went back to Albert to finish him up and he was gone. I looked everywhere for Albert he was nowhere to be found I went over to ask Victoria if she had seen  him and she said no. But as I was looking at Victoria she seemed kinda weird her eyes looked red and her voice sounded different. I went back to my station and Albert was there it was kinda strange because when I left to go check on Victoria Albert was gone but I didn't worry about it. So I kept on working.               I ran out of wire so I went back to Victoria's station and as I was walking over there by her station i heard a loud noise and as I was opening the covers I saw Victoria laying on the table with a robot that looks just like her. The robot that Victoria made was trying to take her brain so I ran over by the cords but, I didn't no witch one to pull so I pulled all of them all Victoria's stuff shut off her computer, saw, lights, and over-head. But then as I turned around to go and help her Albert was right behind me trying to get me to stop. As Albert was fighting me I went behind him and pulled out his memory chip I told Victoria that we would never make robots again because they tried to take over the world and Victoria's robot tried taking her brain. As I helped Victoria up her robot was not un- plugged yet. So I plugged in the saw and gave it to Victoria and she  sawed her robot in half.       In conclusion me and my friend Victoria had a good time and we had fun making our evil robots even though we didn't know that they were trying to take over the world and our brains we make a good science fair team. I hope next year we can also make robots and I hope they will not be as evil as Albert and Victoria's robot.

Technology is a good thing to put in a robot,but it is not good for the water or volcanoes.The good thing is that now people have invented water proof robots so so people that study the water can ask the robot.A lot of people have also invented lava proof robots so people that study the outside and the inside of a volcano can now get close it without getting hurt, by using a lava proof robot.People have invented a lot of cool things with robots which is awsome because if you have a lot of work and you are really busy then you can get yourself a robot.People have also made robots that could act like a human and become your best friend.Anyways the next time you need help with anything think about getting your own robot.

I saw a shadow coming in, and I assumed it was the doctor. but I was wrong...        It wasn't a doctor it was a robot! I was shocked I'd never seen a robot that looked like drawers or a cabinet. Then it said 'Here you go, have a nice day.'As it said that I screamed and fell off my chair, and the doctor came running. Then Dr.Sweet said whats wrong, are you all right.I yelled 'NO!!!!''The cabinet just talked and I fell off my chair.'         Dr. sweets explained to me that Mr. Gower, the robot that made me fall off my chair, just simply delivers the medicine to the patients room so other nurses and people can focus on more important things. I was more calm after she told me that. Now I wanted Mr. Gower to come in again so I could talk to him because I was in my room all alone and bored to death. Eventually he did and I was really happy. We talked for an hour or so , but then the doctor came in and said I could go home. I asked if I could take Mr. Gower home, but the doctor said no.Instead he said I could come and visit Mr.Gower any time I wanted.  Ever since then I laved going to the doctors and helping out their with Mr.Gower     	CD NN WRB PRP VBD IN DT NN IN PRP VBD NNP NNP VBD NN IN PRP VBD DT JJ NNP PRP VBD DT NN VBG IN , CC PRP VBD PRP VBD DT NNP CC PRP VBD JJ : PRP VBD RB DT NN PRP VBD DT NN .

On a Friday afternoon when he cam home from school and saw a square shaped box of some sort covered up in red wrapping paper. He was astonished. He said,'Could this be? Can it be?!?' He went to go touch the box. He shook thee box; heard a lot of little metal pieces move in the box. When he opened the box he saw pieces used to make a robot. There was also a little note left behind it said,'Son your mom and I have to go to a funeral, but we bought you a robot to keep you company and help you do some stuff around the house.' The boy went to sleep.         When the boy woke up he stated to build his robot. When he finished he was really thirsty so he went to go drink some water. When he came back he saw the robot cleaning his room. He was astonished again. 'What are you doing?' asked the boy. In the robot's response it said,'Well as you can see I am a robot that loves to help clean and do stuff around the house!!!' The robot helped the boy paint the house, clean the inside of his house, and the robot helped him out washing the car(s). The robot was really smart and decided to teach the boy about math and some other things you need to learn in order to graduate from high school and get a good scolership.         After a couple of hours the boy was begining to think he was as smart as Albert Einstien. The robot was happy that he could help him out. After all of that was over the robot and the boy went outside. The robot showed him his really cool tricks that he knew how to do. When the robot was finishing up his cool tricks the boy suggested that they should play catch, soccer, tennis, volleyball, or even football. They both got really tired and decided to go and take a nap. It was twelve o'clock midnight (12:00a.m.) the robot took the kid/boy upstairs into his room and fell asleep again.         It was morning and the boy woke up and heard a car door slaming in his parkway/driveway. After that he heard the sound of a key entering a keyhole in the door down stairs. When he went to go look it was his parents'. He rushed down the stairs to give them a big hug because he really missed them a lot. His parents brought him a piece of chocolate cake. They lived hapily ever after.

It looked liek this, its one eye was long and very square and the other eye was round and very weird looking and the robot had some glasses. His body looked very weird it was purple and shaped like a triangle. His name was Jello he liked to eat pancakes and waffles and he was obviously a boy. My robot is bullet proof fireproof and waterproof and he loves the rain. The only thing he will drink is lemonade and water.           One day i was in my room when i heard this weird thump and i looked out my window and i saw this thing that scared me so i ran to my door opened it and there it was the robot that i wished would come to me from outer space and it did.       It was a cold rainy afternoon and there he was my robot named Jello i quick ran and got some waffles and lemonade adn told him he could come in and so he did. After that i went to school and told Jello he had to stay at my house and so he did but, when i came home i found him outside and told him 'I told you to stay in my house!!'       But the lightening was close and i tried and tried to get us in the house ebfore anyhting happened to us but it was too late he had died. Jello died from lightening because he didnt want to go back inside and then lighting struck him and there right in front of my house layed Jello.

The young boy got up from the swing and walked over to the bush to see what had made the nose. A small metal head popped out. The little boy fell backwards onto the ground. The metal headed figure stood up and spoke in a weird voice the little kid understood what he said.  'hi i am delta 13753'  in a started voice the boy answered back 'hi my name is Alex. w-what are you?' I am a military operated robot i take the form of a 12 year old and i spy on kids 6-9th grade to try and prevent bullying.' Alex got to his feet ' nice to meet you delta.' ' you can call me Ryan.' ' OK Ryan do you want to be my friend?'  ' aphimetive.' ' what does that mean?' ' yes'       'OK sweet! What do you want to do?' ' how about you take me around your school, and neighborhood and show me all the bully and i can collect until for my creator.' ' um OK.

315	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	417440	6	11085492	Y	55103	      Wow. My friends and my eyes were glued onto what looked like a big gold tin can. But we were worng. As my friends and I took deciphering steps twoards the gold object our eyes were saucers. My best friend Syd was just slipping the lead in our slow motion walking twoards the gold object. She has long brown flowing hair with eyes that are as green as a fresh meadow. Bella was behind her with an uncertain look on her face, with her lucious blond hair and her eyes that look like the fresh sea. While Brandon with his black as night scruffy hair to his intriguing eyes, I was in the back. I have ginger flowing hair with eyes the color of a four leaf clover.                As we got close enough to touch the gold paint that was on the immense object Brandon and I went around the back to inspect this odd looking shape. All of a sudden my lazer sharp vision saw a door in the back of the object. We were all looking for some parts for our robot because my dad was holding the robot wars in 2 days! As Brandon and I near the back door Brandon uses his strongest arm to try and pry open the door. As my squeaky voice slices through the air calling for Syd and Bella to come around back they reply with lower voices saying 'ok'. Finally Brandon prys open the rusty door of the object and we all take tiny steps into the dark room. It seems like forever walking into a dark room because none of us can make out what is in this room. It felt like 4 hours until we could find a switch in this historical room. But when the lights came on it felt like I had just woken up from drifting into sleep. As our not so ready eyes ajust to the light we finally agree that the object we were in came to life at one point. The reason we new that was because we found an oil deposit that was at its last drip of oil. If we wanted to enter the robot wars my dad was holding we would need a robot and I was starting to think that we just found our solution. 'Look!' Bella said a control switch! We removed the cob webs from the buttons and found out that this object really could move! All of us in unison run out of the room and spead up so we could see the front of the object.                Low and behold we could see eyes! Brandon, Bella, Syd, and I went up to the object and tried to feel out if they were apart of the object... and they were! All we needed to do was get about 50 gallons of oil and this thing would be ready to start up! My feelings about this object were clear now. This robot had been here for about over 45 years and no one had ever come to fix it! We needed to find that oil and find it quick. We don't want anyone else to come and find our robot.                We were 2 minutes from home and I was thankful. Today has been a long day and I just wanted to get home. Finally at the foot of our doorstep, (My friends lived with me because my dad was a foster dad) so we all went inside. My dad was a negotionable dad he was always there for all of us but sometimes he could get a bit anry. He sent us all to bed and in about 1 minute I was fast asleep.            When I woke up I felt eyes staring at me. I finally got my hazy vision clearer and thats right, Brandon, Bella and Syd were starring at me. 'What are you guys doing?!' 'I exclaimed. Don't you guys know I need my space from you guys sometimes and I dont need you guys looking at me the whole morning.' 'Fine'. Said Brandon we were just waiting for you to wake up so we could go get that oil today. (We didn't go to school since we didn't have any schools around us to go to.) As I hop out of bed I rub my eyes and get dressed we had a big day today. We were building our robot todady! I got on my not so clean cloths because we would be working on the robot and head down stairs. I didn't even need to have breakfast because I was in the motion and ready to go. Brandon, Bella, Syd, and I go out the front door without even saying good bye to dad and head to the department store. With our allouences we were sure to have enough money for 50 gallons of oil. We were out and out of the department store with the oil head down to the robot and start working on it. With our oil we filled up the HUGE oil tank and the pannel of buttons lit up. It was up and working. Almost done and we would have this working like a charm. We would keep the gold paint on since we all liked it. And finally the robot was up and running. It turned on and stood up to its full potential. We would name it Sibor. Brandon, Bella, Syd and I did an amazing job on Sibor and we were really wishing that dad would love it. He will love it. Sibor will be a feirce contendor at the robot wars. I was so proud of our work on this great robot. And he will be remembered forever.

So I opened the door and didn't expect to see a 3 feet robot there! It was so cool! I wanted to know if it could talk when it said,' Hi my name is Sally.' Then she handed me a remote. It was like a remote you use for video games. I pressed a button thinking it was for a game but then the robot moved. She said,'Whenever you want you can control me with it, but I can move and talk and everything by myself too.'          The robot told me some many things about her, like how she had dragged some people to safety, and how she gathers information for scientist! Is was so cool! The thing that amazed me the most was that she helps and works at the hospital sometimes! If I get sick I'll just go to her.          I was so intrested with playing and talking with the robot I forgot what time it was untill her alarm went off. 'Dont worry it just rings ever hour so I know what time it is. Right now it 5:00 PM,' said the robot. ' 5 o-clock!' I said. 'Yah why?' ' My mom comes home by this time and if she finds you who knows what would happen,' I said. ' I can leave,' said the robot. 'No way! We will have to think of a plan.' ' Well ok. Oh what does your mom hate doing?' asked the robot. 'Well lots of things like cooking, cleaning, gardening,' I replied. ' Good.' said the robot.          Ding dong! 'Hi mom.' 'Hi! Wow you cleaned the house and I noticed that you were gardening! Oh my god did you cook pasta!' said my mom. ' Well about that. Ok I doubt you will believe me but when you see her yourself you will have to.' I said in a anxious voice. 'Ok but what do I have to see.' she said confused. ' Ok well a robot came to our house and we both played and enjoyed our self. We thought you might not like her so she did all this work just so that you let her stay.' ' What we have a robot in our house! That's not possible!' my mom exclaimed. ' That's what I thought so I'll show her to you.'          'Sally this is my mom' I said. 'Hi.' said Sally. 'Oh my god you are a talking robot! Well definetilly you can stay! After all you have done how can I say no!' ' Thanks!' Sally and I said at the same time! 'Now on you will always stay with us!'

And who am I? You'll just have to find out.        Dr.John made a robot; the robot didn't wake up, but it could feel and hear every thing. Just as he was going to give up he hit his computer in anger, and the robot woke up!  The robot had no name, didn't know where she was, or where she came from.  Then he brought her home to live with his wife Ms.June, and his son Sam.  They were gardeners and needed help with the gardens around the city. So they taught the robot to be a gardener!                                                                                                                            It has been a cupple years so now the robot is the best gardener in the state.  The robot can water the plants when the need to be and she doesn't even have to think about it.  She knows the perfect time to pick the plants.  The plants never go bad, and they always are nice and ripe.  That robot saved two-hundred people from starvation.

Some things that they can do include working in farms, helping miners stuck underground, and exploring volcanoes.               Robots that help in farms are also known as agribots. All over the country, they help farmers pick fruits and vegetables in the farm. The size and shape of the agribot depends on the type of crop. In some places, robots can also determine if the fruit is ripe or not. If a plant is dry. these robots can water them. Agribots are very useful in farms.               Gemini-Scouts, robots who work underground, are very short. This size helps them go through mines to rescue the miners stuck underground. A Gemini-Scout can go on stairs, make sharp turns, roll through water, and even carry supplies. Gemini-Scouts can also can tell if the surrounding gases are poisonous or safe. This helps the miners a lot. These kinds of robots can also sense where robots are by using their thermal camera.               Robots that explore volcanoes, also know as Dante 2, can go into active volcanoes. These robots can withstand high temperatures. While these robots collect information, the scientists can study a volcano while they remain safe in their laboratories.               I think that robots are an important part of our lives. I also think that they can help collect information and save people. Robots may even become part of our everyday lives in the future.

The robots can make copies so the teachers don't have to.            Another way is robots can fix computers doors and other items. They could also fix food for us so that the cooks aren't so busy.

For one, the 'thing' was at least three heads taller than me! And the only word I can think of to describe its voice is strange-it didn't even sound real. At first, I was terrified. I thought the thing was going to hurt me to be honest, but when the 'thing' spoke to me in its scratchy-robotic voice and told me that it was a robot that used to be a search-and-rescue robot that worked in mines to help find and save injured miners, I had a change of heart. The robot then started to tell me the story of one of his last missions when he was sent into a fallen mineshaft to try to help save a trapped miner who was on the verge of death.       'I was being oiled down when I first overheard mission control telling my controller, Luke, that my mission was official. I was going to attempt to find a trapped miner named Benjerman Stewart.       'Alright then', Luke grunted as he picked me up, 'lets get you loaded into the copter.'       Because we were on stand-by for the mission, it didn't take us long to get to the copters landing site at the mine. They then unloaded me and made sure that my controls were adjusted and then they sent me in.       They first thing I saw inside the mine was rock. Lots of rock. My data sensors told me that the rock was a type of granite, but I disregarded it and started on my search for Benjerman Stewart.       I wedged my way through countless nooks and crannies, looked through my thermal camera for hours, and then I finally found him. Benjerman was not in good shape at all. He was badly hurt from the mine collapse and was either unconscious or dead, I couldn't tell. But either way I dragged him back to the entrance to the mine where there was a medical crew waiting. I could see the medical team working feverishly on Benjerman. And before I knew it, Luke was loading me back into the copter.

An agribot is a robot that picks up fruit.It might pick berries,oranges,grapes,or apples.Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do.Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes.Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks.Others are able to move around on their own.In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries.This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.

One day Jackson was on the farm looking at Grampa Franks robots and while Grampa went to get a cup of coffee all of the sudden..... walla it came alive! it was 2:04 pm the roosters were cocka dodda doling.           It was blowing FIRE everywhere, Jackson ran and grabbed a hose and put all the fires out, Grampa saw the smoke boy was he upset to know what had caught on fire the robot that had caught on fire was the one he was gonna enter in the parade a week away so it took 2 years of making to make it perfect. he thought that was two years for nothing. Jackson felt so bad he had taken blame for pluging the cord in.           Jackson went to the robot fair and had all the pieces Grampa needed he used all of his allowance on stuff fro the robot, went back to Grampas,got the tools he needed and while Grampa was at work he had his friends come over and help him fix it...            Now its time for them to eat after they got started and then they get back to work they have 3 days to get it done that includes entering it in the parade for Grampa.           Now they start they put new wheels on NO FIRE until the end, new radio new battteries and the last touch was a bubble machine by the time Grampa got home the next night it was time to enter it in the parade...           Grampa saw it roll down the parade and said that looks like my robot and the kids said they had fixed it Grampa was the happiest man in the WHOLE wide world.

Dante 2 has the abilite to climbs volcanoes it has eight legs it climbs steps walls of volcanoes. Mr.Gower  workes in hospetoles,helping the doctors and nurses. It is so strong that it can pull 500 poundes it can also talk he works the elevator. Mr.Gower now does what the doctors pharmacists,and nurses us to do.This allows them to focus on other important tasks.

So he is designing a scetch that comes to life. So he gets a design that is a person that is changed into a robot. He puts it on the piece of cardbord where a thing that looks like a printer. So, when he layed it on the surface on the cardboarb surface, he turns it on.                   The picture is moving to the printer. When the drawing went through the printer, the drawing didn't move at all. Peter was yelling,''no'' and went to his room. Ty just sat there on the table. Ty went to go get some blankets and a pillow and layed on the table. Then he went to sleep.                  When it was morning, the photo of the robot was gone. Ty  ran to Peter's room and told him that the picture was gone. Peter was happy that his invention was working and scared because the robot was deadly. Peter was scared that the robot was deadly because it could turn the city into a pile of rubble. So, Peter and Ty went out of Peter's house and they can't believe what they saw.            They found the robot on top of a building. The only way they could stop the robot is by shuting down the printer. When they headed down to the basement, the printer was going all crazy. They tried to shut it down, but the printer was inside a force field. So they got something sharp ang went through the force field and cut it opened.             It was getting electricuted. So Prter cutted out the wires, but the printer was still going crazy. Ty found the plug and yanked it out of the outlet. The printer shutted down. They ran outside and found the robot breaking down. Then, it fell to the street. The robot lust turned into water. The printer broked and that was the day when the robot attaced the city.

How common are robots?  And what can a robot look like.       There are robots everywhere today.  The whole reason you're reading this right now is because of robots.  The actual definition of the word 'robot,' is a machine that can perform the acts of a human.  So really a phone, a camera, a guitar tuner, a printer, and an electronic lock are robots.  Robots don't have to be like in movies where they try to make humans extinct.  They can even be something in your pocket.  That is how common robots are.       'What can a robot look like?' is a question that some people have asked before.  A  robot can look like anything really.  A robot can be made to look like a piece of wood when it really is a camera.  The possibilities are endless for what a robot can look like.        Those were some question that some people had on robots, and remember, the thing right next to you could be a robot.

'Hello class,' our online teacher says. 'Today is the day that you will be turning in your 10,000 word essay on your robot pet.' I glance around the room, everyone seemed excited to turn their paper in. 'Kassie,' she says loudly. 'May I have your paper?' I look over at my friends and insert my paper into the scanner. As I sit the teacher says 'Kassie will you please go down to the boiler room and get me the screw driver?' I turn surprised and say yes.                                                                       The boiler room is very old and dusty. I slowly walk around finding the tool box easily. I explore the room trying to figure out why I was sent down here. I hear a bang coming from the far corner I haven't checked. I walk over to the corner. 'Hello?' I say. No one answers. Another bang. 'Hello!' I say again. Suddenly a robot comes swiftly around the corner and gets the tool bow and brings it over. It's  whispering something while it searches the box.I walk over to it and ask if i can have a screw driver. It happily gives it to me and follows me up the stairs and into the classroom.   When I walk in the class is discussing an issue of some sort.'What's happening?' I ask. 'Nothing of interest.' the teacher says to me. The robot rolls in. 'Where in the world did you get that, Kassie?' I explain about my experience and how I found the robot. He became our class pet and since I found him I got to take him home for a day. The days wore on and we named our robot pet Andre. Everyone got to take him home for a day by the end of the year. The next year our old teacher video chatted with us daily and showed us how Andre was doing. 	NN VBZ DT NN .

Robots are relied by many people. Robots like the gemini-scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, agribots and google cars can be improved to be used by many people.            Imagine you are a miner traped in a hole.You have no climbing equipment. You are running out of food. eventually you will be overwelmd from the tought of starvation.You are sad that you might never see your family again.suddenly you are awaked by the sound of rocks rumbling. you cover neck thinking its a cave-in but you see a robot rolling down the rocks.           The radio on the robot tell you that help is on the way. The robot is stuffed with a chest of food. You are relieved that in an hour you will be free and with your beloved family, Thanks to the robot named the gemini-scout.           robots will be able to safe peoples lives just with a little improvement and advanced technology. This is how robots are a big leap to help humans.Robots can be in various sizes and will someday be in use of everyone here on earth.

They had discovered that  this volcano was different from the others. Insted of having lava come out it was sticky bubble gum! The scientist thought they should go inside to explore and find out more,but there was one problem they realized if they try to go they might not come out before it erupts becauase the gum is so sticky! They can get caught. They decided to make a robot that can go inside without geting caught in the sticky gum. This robot was going to be made out of special materials that won't get him caught in the gum. This robtot can climb, is strong, collects information,and can talk. This robot has four legs, two climbing arms, ten gadgets, and extra saftey gaurds. They have named it, Robo Gum.

The first robot I am introducing you to is the Gemini-Scout.This robot is helping us do many things, such as saving lives, collecting information, and gives us the things we need most in a time of crisis.Gemini-Scout is remote-controlled.The remote is like a video game remote...so if you are constintly on the video games this is right up your alley!This robot is less than two feet tall, has wheels, and is small but strong.The tiny robot, believe it or not, rescues lost miners, and carries food,water and other suppies for them if they are starved or thirsty.Gemini-Scout can also collect information, and tests the air for poisionious gases.                    Next, we will learn about a tough robot.It is called Dante 2.Dante 2 is special because it climbs into volcanoes, and gathers information for the scientists.The robot has eight legs, sort of like a spider, and is built to withstand heat.This robot also climbs into vents, and holes to collect the gasses for information.                    Now...introducing my favorite robot of them all...Mr.Gower!Yes the robot's name is Mr.Gower.Mr.Gower works in hospitals, and helps doctors and nurses.This robot is small and looks like a cabnet on wheels, but don't let that fool you because it is strong enough to pull 500 pounds!Inside these drawers there are all different kinds of medicine!But that is not all...this tiny robot can talk too! Now how can you not love this machine!                    The last robot I am introducing you to is called Agribots.This 'little' bot picks fruit for us!This is a first for me.Agribots pick berries, oranges, grapes, and apples. There is no real size for them because the could come in any size depending on what you want them to pick. These robots are able to move around by themseves!                     See didn't I tell you there are some extradanry robots out there!So the next time you need to be rescued from a mine, need to know how big a volcano is, need medicine,or need to harvest your fruit, these bots will be on the job!

Google has invented a car with amazing technological robotic car! The car has radars on all sides and it can match traffic speed. This unique robot will change our future.         The Google car can even sense when a car is about to cut them off. Google had convinced the state Legislature of Nevada to pass a law of the cars being legal the Legislature even granted the cars a license. On March 1, the cars will be granted a test drive on the roads of Nevada.'Eventually when these cars are sold, it will be the first ever neon green license plate that the state of Nevada will ever issue--green meaning go, and the futures arrives,' says Bruce Breslow, director of the Nevada DMV. In fact the test cars are the only cars with red license plates since the 1940's.         These safe and efficient robotic cars are never distracted. They don't go on willy nilly texting their BFF and feeling like crawling back in bed nor drinking while driving. They are almost like a ghost that can see things no human can. Driving is their only job in life so why would they be distracted? Nevada will be the very first state to be licensed to have robotic cars but most certainly not the last when citizens have more awareness of this car they won't be able to keep their hands off it.

He is able to climb into volcanoes and gather infermation.       and then ther is mr.gower this robot is kinda like a nurse.   It it able too give patinse medicine and help docters.   finnally there are agribots a agribot is able to pick up fruit.   some have big arms and some can operate by them self.   and that is how some robots not all usefull in are lives.           about 50 years ago there was a story called I robot.   the story is in the future when robots take care of humans   it is about a character how loves his robot robbie.   back then it was just a fantasy but now we are close   to that.you can als get a pet robot that looks like a dog.

Robots can help with work by   being a baby sister that has an endless source of fun while you are going to work or somewhere special. Today robots can sing, dance, and even play music. Now days you can even get a robot that ca act like a pet, sometimes with fur too.       When you buy a robot, you don't need to take all the hard work just to feed it and to take it outside. One   company, the I-Pet Companion, made a robot that allows you to play with a kitten, but with a good distance away.       There is this new self d driving car robot that can receive their own driving permits, a drivers license for a   robot. one person drove in one of these cars that had an $80,000 cone-shaped lazer on the top of it.       These are a few things on what robots can do.

He payed transformors all day in his bedroom. No one in his family liked robot. His littel sister liked tea parties, his brother liked vidio games, his mom liker romance, and his dad liked action.             By the time he entered middel school he choose three semesters he wanted to joyn wich was bigining computes, art, and bilding tecnogy. He choose those semesters to find out about robots. He choose art to draw ideas to bild a robot. He choose computers to find reasurch and wach vidios about robots.Then he choose bilding tecnolgy to bild robots. He wanted to joyn these classes so he can learn about robots and how they work.             By the time he was 56 and his brother and sister were both 22 they wanted him to live in a retierment home. He didnt want to go but his littel brother and sister aredy payed for it. He was mad becuase his drems were ruoned and cuoldnt mack his drem house. At night he called his brother to come pick him up. with all the money he had he got out of the retiarmint home. He hade enofe money to buy a huose. The huose was 20 feet tall with 5 bedrooms and 3 bath rooms. His back yard was huge and had a swimming pool with a hot tub.              He didnt care about those things and was focus on his dream to mack his house with robot and gagets. He spent lots of money with his robot body parts. On the  day of his birth day he surprised his family with all his robots. His robots were big and strong with big clipers totack thing to there master. His family was impresed with him so he showed them around the house and them all the robots in his house. They all started to love robots.They all had a great time with him and his robots.              By the tim he was getting older and older he was forced to leav his house and robots and live in a retierment home. He was cruched and disapointed. A homes expert went to go see if the house was ok to sale. He droped his clippbored and saw all the robot and toled the goverment to never sale the house and to tune it into a littel museam so the public can see the house. The man was stel mad and missed his robts. The goverment took him out of the retiorment home and into the army to mack beter computers and wepons. He stil missed his robots and live at the age of 116 with out seing his robots ever agian.

He picked up the rusty tin can and started to look at it and he put it in his pocket and when to school. After school that day he was playing with it seeing what it can do and he dropped it and it opened up. The rusty tin can was not a can it was a robot. Micheal looked at the robot it was walking around the room.  Micheal picked it up it struggled he held it still so he can look at it on his back he saw a name and a button. The name was Extreme Rover 1000. He put it down and said ' Extreme Rover what can  you do.'         The robot got up and picked up Micheal bed. Micheal was amazed the robot put the bed down and said ' Press my button.' Micheal took heavy procausion and put on his snow pants and his winter coat. Micheal stood behind his bed and then pushed the button and threw the robot acrossed the room like a grenade. The robot just stood there like a statue. Micheal waited and waited then he realized that he has not fear. He took off his stuff and when he turned around he saw a giant robot.        He looked at the robot he found a button on its chest that said transform. Micheal pressed it and it transformed back into the tin can. Micheal thought this was awesome so he brought it to school with him the next day. Micheal was playing by him self and then he remembered that he had this robot in his pocket he took it out and started to play with is and then Micheal herded a cry and a by had kicked his soccer ball on top of the  roof and the robot climbed the school and got the ball and climbed back down. Micheal had a great idea and it was to have the robot help the citizens. So that is what Micheal had the robot do. Later on in life Micheal found out that this robot was indestructible because it was helping people in a fire. Helping people that have there cat stuck in a tree. This robot had some other ability to help him like lifting heavy thing. He could lift up to 1000 pounds. He found that this was a go robot for the citizens to he let it free to help other people.

Like a spider it has eight legs that help it climb into volcanoes. It can climb steep walls of the volcanoes. It is also built so it doesn't burn into pieces inside the volcanoes. When a volcano can't be explored by a scientist the Dante 2 goes in.       Dante 2 looks for holes in the volcano. Then, the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the holes. The Dante 2 is awesome because scientist can stay safe int there laboratories well the Dante 2 collects the imformation.

Well, if you ever thought that, you were wrong.   Robots just want to help us, not harm us.              Meet the Gemini-Scout.  This is a remote control robot that does search and rescue work in mines under ground.  The Gemini-Scout is less than two feet tall.  It can go up and down stairs and even go through water without being harmed.  Wherever the Sam robot goes, it collects information.  For example, the robot will test the air for toxic gases and can tell miners when the air is safe.  The Gemini-Scout, is a very easy robot to use.  Is you play video games, then it shouldn't be very hard.          Have you ever heard of the Dante 2?  This robot has a very unique job.  It climbs into volcanos and gathers information for scientists.  This robot has eight legs that help it move around so easily.  When a volcano is to hot for scientist to enter, they call the Dante 2.  The Dante 2 looks for vents and holes in the crater.  Then the robot gathers information about the gases coming out of the vent.  Many years ago, scientist could not learn so much about volcanos. But thanks to the Dante 2,  learn more about these fire breathing mountains every day.            Mr. Gower is another useful robot that works in hospitals and helps out doctors and nurses.  He is often described as a cabinet on wheels!  The drawers store medicine, and the robot will deliver the medicine to the doctors who need it.  Mr. Gower, can ride on elevators, steer through hall ways, and move things that are in his way.  Surprisingly, this strong robot can carry up to 500 pounds.  Just like most robots, Mr. Gower runs on a battery.  Not only does he work like a human, he can also talk!  Mr. Gower had been programmed to say over 100 phrases!

Agribot is a robot the picks, it can pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apple's.   it is a helpfull thing when you are picking your fruit's it can help you.   also it can lift high for the trees just in case you cant reach the fruit.           Robots are never distracted, they never get tired dont have to eat,  or drink they cant do their jobs 7 days a week with out stoping. someone hospitals auctally have robots for medicine cabnet's so they can do to the room for the patient that needs the medicine and they nurse just has to unlock the cabnet.       The robot is programed to no where evey room is and it can go in elvator's and work them, they are very smart things, they can talk if needed also. they know when the patient needs the medicine and its on there perfect time.       New lisence plate might be for Nevada, a neon green, but google say's it will be a while before it startes, and the green means the future arrives, nevada with something new               A Mine robot that mines and seaches for things underground, alot of help for someone who doesent know how to seach for ceartin things and robot and work all day and not get tired so it will find alot of good mineral's and needed things from the search or the meaning on the search,             	NNP NNP , DT NN WDT VBZ VBP POS CC NN POS NNS VBZ DT RB JJ NN , PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN VBP POS IN PRP TO VB JJR CC VB IN IN DT NNP NNP VBZ DT NN DT NNS , PRP MD VB NNS , NNS , NNS , CC NNP PRP VBZ DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBP VBG PRP$ NN POS PRP MD VB NNP RB PRP MD VB JJ IN DT NNS RB IN NN PRP VBP DT DT NNP NNP VBP RB VBN , PRP RB VB VBN NN VBP TO VB , CC VBP PRP VBP VBP PRP$ NNS CD NNS DT NN IN IN NNP NN NNS RB VBP NNS IN NN NN POS RB PRP MD VB TO DT NN IN DT NN IN VBZ DT NN CC PRP VBP RB VBZ TO VB DT NNP NNP NN VBZ VBN TO DT WRB NN NN VBZ CC PRP MD VB IN NN POS CC NN PRP , PRP VBP RB NN NNS , PRP MD VB IN VBN NNP PRP VBP WRB DT NN VBZ DT NN CC PRP$ IN EX NN NNP NNP NN NN MD VB IN NNP , DT NN VBN , CC JJ NN POS PRP MD VB DT NN IN PRP VBZ , CC DT JJ NNS DT NN VBZ , NN IN NN JJ DT NNP NN WDT VBZ CC NNS IN NNS VBP , NN IN NN IN NN WP NN VBP WRB TO VB IN NN NNS CC NN CC VB DT NN CC RB VB VBN RB PRP MD VB NN IN JJ JJ POS CC VBD NNS IN DT NN CC DT NN IN DT NN ,

If a car was controlled by a robot it would lower the risk of car crashes because people who drive carlesly are more accedent prone so if a robot was controlling the car the would'ent be as much if a risk.                       robots are conrtolled by eith batteries or electricety, some talk some can lift heavy amounts of weight,and some can be talented but there all speical in there on way.

Eat, sleep, party, help out, play instruments... Everything a human can do, plus more! The robot can save lives, help on scientific technology, studies, and be great to the human race. It will be called the BeastBot 2000. BeastBot can be made to help out but not totally take over everything and responsibilities, but it will be a great help. When it is invented, they shouldn't cost any money because of what a great help they will be!!! There isn't anymore information now but stay tuned for even more!!       Also, the robot will be able to go under water, inside volcanoes, underground, and much, much more. If it is able to go under water, we can discover more about the ocean and its crazy features. If the robot can go inside volcanoes, geologists will discover more about the inside of our earth and can tell the different layers of earth more in details. Hopefully, the BeastBot 2000 will not take over man kind and destroy the life as we know it. As shown on TV, most robots end up taking over the universe and turn humans into slaves. with as smart as us humans are, we can program them to be... Not big fat duty heads to us. Even though the BeastBot 2000 seems like a crazy idea, it might become the greatest invention of all time.

Sadly enough it was the 2nd worst rated school in the whole district,the school was so bad that right as Hunter would walk in some one would be already be bullying him or picking on him.After his horrible day he walked home and started on his homework and ate a spoon of peanut butter with a cup of chocolate milk, after finishing his homework he went to his room to see if his friend Frankie could come over.Next Frankie came over and they went to the park to play some football, they were playing and a brilliant thought came through Hunters head 'what if me and my friend built a robot that could do homework,chores,bring food,and even teach those bully's a lesson'.Hunters friend Frankie thought it was a Great idea and that they should meet tomorrow at Frankies house.The next day Frankie and Hunter had already a million ideas for what it would do what it looked like and if they wanted it to talk or not, there were so many good ideas to chose from they didn`t know which one to chose!!!finally they both dicided to make the robot black with flames and that it could talk and move in every single direction.For 4 months they used junk yard scraps,a used car battery,black yellow and red spray paint and a voice translator.Finally the big day to see if it would work.............IT WORKS!!! but it fliped out and knock both of them out and was never seen again!?!.

I dont know the exact date but for the next event that im going to speak   about but one of N.A.S.A's grovers got sucked into a black hole.They where trying to get to mars so then they sent out another grover.N.A.S.A said that the grover was running smoothly and should get there safely.No one ever seen mars people are thinking that there is going to be life on mars.But when the grover got their it was just ruins it was all on the news saying 'mars is dead.'                       Back when N.A.S.A didnt even have gear to go to the moon a scientist   found out there is more planets.Like jupiter,mars,saturn,pluto,venus,uranus,mercury.And so on so forth.they were fasinated by all these planets that they didnt even know about.A few years later NASA got more advanced and able to see beyond the stars and in the stars.Then once people got ready to go to the moon we were in a space race with the russians we won the russians.                              They made some more stops to space and the moon.I forgot the name   the shuttle but they used that every time the went to the moon.Because thats the one they built the best out of all of their ships.In 2012 NASA announced that the will not be using that space ship any more.they all so said that they will be flying over cities.The shuttles final destination was NASA's facility.that was the end of that shuttle.                         That was my essay on space and shuttle.Im not sure if NASA going to make a comeback.And go back to the moon.if they do i am surely going to watch that.

The story we will be telling you is all about robots.I bett you that all of yall want to learn about robot boxing. The book is all about how people made one of the best robots in the world like Atom he is the most powerful robot in robot boxing. How did Atom become the greatest robot boxer in the world.                                               In the town New York the year 2095 I was a former world boxing champion at the age of 27 years old my name is Jacob. Now that robots do boxing there was no more human boxing so i bought a robot boxer that was 30,000 dollars from China in his former fights he was a robot champion but what money did I got that from.I got that money when I sold my son Jack to some rich people I did this because my Father-In-Laws (my girlfriends dad) gym was gonna be torned down so I needed to pay the rent so it wouldnt get torned down.I had to stay with my son Jack until the rich people and I go to court to settle the custody for Jack.                                                 Now my robot came in his name is TAI-ZERO im so happy but Jack wasnt because I sold him. He was crying a little tear came down his cheek i said 'Im sorry I needed the money for ret and the robot. He didnt listen to me he said 'You sold me for a robot you never controlled with'.I know I was dumb to sell my kid just for a robot bu t i still got a chance to get him back.                                                 Jack I said I have a chance to get you back but how Jack said by trying to win the fights with TAI-ZERO. YES I said out loud and Jack too we were happy but i had to leave and Jack had the keys and he wouldnt let me go unless I take him. I already said no to him so he said if you dont take me im going to drop these keys in the sewer.I needed the keys so i will bring TAI-ZERO for his first fight since 10 years so I had to take Jack.                                               If you read book 2 and book 3 that is coming soon you will know what will happen to Jack and Jacob so stay tuned to Robot Boxing.[ If want book 2 and book 3 you could pre-order them online just for 15.00 dollars.]Read the rest of the books you will enjoy them if you know the first book.So now the book is done so the caption TO BE CONTINUED........

She always hoped that she would someday be able to see it.   When Lia was seven, her father had taken her to his job at the Factory. His job had always seemed boring at that point; all he ever did was work with machines. And when you lived in the year 2143, where you saw machines every day, your dad had the most boring job in the history of jobs.   But then Lia saw the small neon green door that stood out in the sea of black paint and white lab coats and silver-gray machines.   Neon green was her favorite color.   'Daddy, what's that?' Lia had asked in an adorably inquisitive tone.   Her father had smiled.'That, Lia, is the prototype of-'   'What's a prototype?'   'I'll explain later. It is the prototype of a cyborg that looks and acts like a human.'   'Can I see?'   'Maybe when you're older.'   Lia had sighed. 'Okay, Daddy.'   Now Lia was sixteen, and visiting the Factory with her IPod 300 blaring music into the earphones. She strolled down the hall to the neon green door.   There was no handle on the door, but there was a keypad.   Lia bit her lip. She didn't remember this...   She stuffed her IPod in her bag and typed in PROTOTYPE.   The door didn't open.   She tried CYBORG.   No.   ROBOT.   No.   Then she remembered Ms. Spark teaching her about robots 100 years ago.   'Class,' Ms. Spark had chirped, 'today we will be learning about agribots. In 2043, agribots were used to pick fruit on farms. They had sensors so that they could know what the plant needs.'   Yes! That could be the password!   Lia grinned and typed in AGRIBOT.   Ding!   The door opened, and Lia raced inside.   Inside a small cylindrical sleeping pod lined with pillows, a boy lay inside. Lia's only clue that he was a robot was the small wire protruding from his ear.   Lia pressed the button that opened the pod, and the robot opened his eyes.

It all began when there was a call at the hospital a women had picked up the phone and a old man had been coughing so the women got his location and took him to the hospital. Doctors have figured out that the man had a serious disease, the disease was very unknown know one has heard of it, but luckily for them they had a special doctor called: Mr.Grower. Mr.Grower is a robot that isn't like any other robot, Mr.Grower can bring medicines to the doctors and nurses he can steer and go up and down the elevators, Mr.Grower can even talk! The doctors were operating on the man, but they haven't found a cure so Mr.Grower called one of his robot buddies:Dante 2. Dante 2 is kind of a special robot he can go into volcanoes and collect information for scientists, the hospital has sent Dante 2 into a volcano to give the samples to scientists to figure out a cure, cause so far doctors has only found out the patient needs a lot more steam. Dante 2 was about to go into the volcano when suddenly his rope had got stuck, Dante 2 was beginning to worry because he didn't know if he could handle the job, and when he thought that out of know where Agribots came swooping in from the sky to the rescue, Agrrbots usally picks and plucks fruits and vegetables out of the ground, but in this case Agribots had to know how to pick out Dante 2's rope. So Agribots went in slowly and picked out Dante 2's rope, Dante 2 was really worried, but he had faith in Agribot. Agribot was shaking, but when Dante 2 felt the shake on his rope he told Agribot he had faith in him, when Agribot heard that he gently pulled the rope and Dante 2 has been lifted up to the top of the volcano, when Dante 2 went to the top of the volcanoe he had told Agribot that he had to go back in to get samples for the scientists, at first Agribot wouldnt let him go back in, but once Dante 2 told Agribot about the ill-ed man, Agribot let Dante 2 go in. So Dante went in the volcanoe and he had got the sample for the scientists. Dante 2 and Agribot went back to the scientists and the examined the sample and they had found the cure! So Dante 2, Agribot and all of the scientists went to the hospital and all doctors had put the cure on the illed man, the ill ed man was very happy he was still alive. The ill ed man has thanked everyone and the ill-ed man invited everyone to celebrate at his house. At the end of it all they became the best of friends.

A few days before my birthday. I wanted someone to play with other than my annoying brother! I wanted someone to talk to, to laugh with,and who will treat me like a best friend should. You see, my bffwe(best friends forever without exeptions) moved away to Wasco 2 months ago. What I wanted was a 'FOREVER FRIEND' a new robot . I asked my parents for one alot of times. But what I didnt expect came to me on my birthday.April 12,2013. I had just woke up and never got up this early so ethier something was wrong or we were going somewhere. When I got out of the shower and went to the kitchen for an apple what did I see?! A robot . A FOREVER FRIEND !!!!!! She was dressed in a blue blouse and a black skirt . Her hair was golden brown and she had earphones in her ears . I said ,'Hello' she responded by saying,'Good morning my name is J.K' She was of course a robot and not real but I loved her like a sister . At night  I told her , 'I wish you were real' Little did i know she was made to obey......               When i woke up i found a new person lying in by bed fast asleep . I woke her and said 'WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BED?!!!!!!' The person responded, ' I'm J.K master'. 'J.K?!OH NO MY MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA KILL ME FOR TURNING MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT INTO A REAL HUMAN!!!!!!' I heard a knock on my door . 'IDALLAS OPEN THE DOOR NOW!!!'......                 So I opened my door slowly and said, 'MOM J.K TURNED HERSELF INTO A HUMAN !' My mom looked at me then at J.K and said , 'I'ts fine she is your new bff so who cares ?'     WHEW!!!!!! I thought she was going to explod . She said to be quiet and then closed my door and went back to sleep. I imeddetly got up , took a shower, and changed .We both went to Mr. Slushie and ordered to milk shakes , burgers and fries. After we ate I notecied she looked sad . I asked her why was she sad . That was the bigest mistake i ever made .....               She got so angry she ran out a threw my scoter in the trash . I got it out and said,'WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA ?! ARE YOU CRAZY!!!??' She was crying and I said sorry for screaming at you . she said its' ok   and told me why  she was crying. It turns out she loves me and doesn't weant me to get hurt.Why? because a car came and almost ran me over ! But I had biger things to worry about........                                        J.K was starting to become a big problem!!! My mom said it was best to shut her down. It was a cold Wensday, I knew I had to shut her down. It was 3:00 in the mornig the house was quiet. I ran to the kitchen , and grabbed a screwdriver. I then flipped over J.K and took out her batteries and her wiers. I started to cry after she turned back into a robot.But something strange started to happen. There in her stomach I foud all of the albums by my favorite band Marianas Trench!!!!!!! The first said m fianal gift to you. The second said thanks for everything I understand why you put me down. The final one said forever and ever i will be there for you . Then an awsome thing happened she woke up!!! My mom said I could keep her but on one condition I keep her a robot !                                                           THE END!

It can from my computer room where I do all my projects. So i walked over and opened the door really slowly. Then when my door was opened all the way I walked in but no one was there. So I looked around the room and reliazed I had a big mess because a couple days ago I was trying to make a robot but it didnt work. So I just started to clean it up so while I was picking up the mess I heared someone say 'hello' I jumped up so high I was now not scared just FREAKED  OUT!!! So I ran out of the room so fast. A few hours later I went back in and a person was sitting on my chair!!       'Hello my name is Savannah. I am so glad u made me! ' said Savannah the robot       'I made u? ' I asked.       'Yes, well not all of me. You started me but, then gave up so I finished the rest of me my the wonderful arms you gave  me! ' said Savannah       'Wow so you finnished yourself and sorry about giving up I just got a little mad.' I said.       'A little?!? Are you kidding me you were throwing a fit! Its ok though it was hard building me.' said Savannah       'Well ok then, So my name is Hope' I said.       'Well you didnt have a lot of hope in me Hope. Do u get it hope, hope I am just kidding with you! ' said Savannah       'I did have hope in you and oh i get it.' I answred       ' Finally you are slow at jokes but its ok i will help you but,first you have to teach me.' asked Savannah       ' Hey i am not slow! Well find maybe a little but lets get to the point teach you what?' I asked.       'You have to teach me everything you know. Because rememeber you build me to help you with extra help you needed.' answered Savannah       'Oh ya thats why i made you well lets start this business!' I said.

Today robots can research, be a pet and drive by itself. Robots changed science everywhere because thay can stand heat and the cold. Robots can bring back rocks or gas for scientists to study. The Dante 2 has eight legs and can go in volcanos to gather stuff for scientists.                 Robots can also play and be pet. The HRP-c4 can dance and sing. People are testing the idea of a pet robot like a cat or dog. A japanese robot can play the piano with two mechanical fingers. Scientists are trying to make the pet robots be much like the pet it was designed for.                 Google is currently making a self robot car that can drive on it's own. Testers already like this because thay have test drived it. All you have to do is to put the gas on it. Google has tested it on a freeway and it gone 70 miles. Today they are making robots but tommarow every one will have some sort of robot of their own. I can see that the world will be in a new age of technology soon.

One sunny day bella went walking she was very creative and knew how to fix a lot of things and how to even control them.While bella was walking she heard a crash on the other side of the buliding but as she ran over there there was a bif hole in the ground she wanted to go see but at the same time she was scared.After a while she decided to go take a look as she got closer she seen something she couldent belive her eyes!!!It was a robot but she really liked it and wanna to take it home. The last few nights it was weird cuz she heard sounds coming from her working lad and it almost sounded like something was down there and trying to leave.       In the morning she went to check everything out and it was  good everything was still in place but later that night the noise again and this time she went down as she looked there she saw the robot not only layin down but the eyes were open and it was tryinog to move!!!!!!She almost fainted right there in the spot and she couldnt belive her eyes.Bella quickly crept back up stairs and went back to bed.Earlier that morning she tied the robot down even tier then before to make sure it stays down she really want to work it but she had to train it to be nice and help do things she was gonna plan it out.All that day she thought of things she can do and work on a nd came up with some good things.

Everybody made fun of him, because he was so small. Even though he can track miners to see if there hurt, or he can go up or down stairs or even make sharp turns. This is what is really cool about him he can roll on water. He can carry food, water, supplies and even drag people to safety. All the other robots like Dante Two, or Mr. Gower, or even Agribot tease and be mean to him. 'There all just a bunch of bullies' Gemini-Scout said. The next day All the robots had to go on a mission a miner was missing 'This is what I'm good at' said Gemini-Scout said, and if I save him People will call me a hero and everybody will like me. When they got to the mine Gemini-Scout was the first one in and when they all got a little in the mine there was giant puddle of water, and all the robots besides Gemini-Scout couldn't go in water so gemini-Scout rolled right over the water and kept going. There was a bunch of rocks and gemini-Scout doged them, and found the lost miner! He was hurt, thats not a good sign. gemini-Scout drag him back to the other robots and they carried the miner back to base. and gemini-Scout was a hero and everybody wanted to be friends with him.

Well, i think that clouds is the funnest thing that you could ever learn in science. i love it because it is very interesting to learn about and to see what clouds just float around in the sky.       Do you want to know why i love it. Well it is because I love knowing about clouds that we see on sunny, and rainy days. There are clouds like stratus, cumulonimbus. There are way many more that we can discover each and every day.         	NNP PRP IN TO VB IN NNS IN NN .

When he went downstairs, his mom said, 'Good morning honey, what have you been up to, it's 11'oclock'. He answers back, 'Nothing mom, it's Sunday, you know I always sleep in late, anyway, what's for breaksfeast'. 'Oh just some pancakes and eggs'.            After Tom finishes his food, he goes to his friend, Dwayne's house. They say hello and then Tom says 'Hey dude, this morning, I saw this weird robot thing on that tree, do you want to see if it is still there'? Dwayne answers back, 'Sure, whatever'. They go to the tree and it is still there, Dwayne climbs up the tree and throws the robot down to Tom. Tom says, 'What is this some kind of robot, whatever it is, it looks like it takes batteries'. The two boys go to Dwaynes house to get some batteries, Dwaynes mom says, 'Hello Tom, I haven't seen you in a while'. Tom replies, 'Hi Miss Rock, do you happen to have any batteries'? 'Why yes we do, here are some right here'. 'Thank you'! 'Your welcome'!           Dwayne and Tom go to the park where they put the batteries in, next thing you know the robot comes alive! The robot helped the two boys for the rest of their lives and they lived happily, ever, after.

We took it home and put it on a shelf. I was asking my friend Angelo what he thought of it. He said 'We can put pictures on this'.  Later on we got some pictures but the cube was not there I looked to my other friend Calvin and asked him 'Where is our cube' Calvin had just shrugged              The cube was gone. But we did find a brand new vacum cleaner and i turned on all by its self. I got scared and went to my bedroom. when I came out side there was a robot that could fly and make its own money I  tried taking the money but it floated away and it made a loud noise. i had felt like it was mad so i opened all the windows and went to my room. When I came back it was gone I think it went through the window. Later I found 25,000 dollars under my bed and a letter the letter said 'I will be back.

Whenever he started to do something he got bored of it. He even got bored when he played with his little toy robot, which could make noises when you pressed a button on his back.But that was all about to change.                         One day the boy was in his room when suddenly, without pressing the button, the robot said,'Why are you so sad.' The boy ran and hid under his blankets. He was scared out of his mind. The robot said, 'Why are you scared. I'm not going to hurt you.' So, the boy slowly climbed out of bed, keeping his eyes on the robot the entire time. 'I know you get bored a lot,' said the robot,'and I'm here to help. I'm going to give you the best day ever!'. The boy got really excited and couldn't wait for the day to get started.                     At first they just got to know each other. The boy introduced himself and said his name was Kyle. The robot's name was Play-Bot 9000. Play-Bot 9000 said he also had other friends like HRP-4c, who can sing and dance, and Gemini-Scout, who helps trapped miners.'Cool.' said Kyle, 'So when can we play?' 'Right now if you want. Let's go.'                     The first thing they did was play outside. Kyle had never realized playing outside could be this much fun, especially since he had a real friend now. His friends at school could never come to his house because of their parents being busy.So, he had no one to play with until today. They played football, soccer, and Play-Bot 9000 even taught him how to play kickball because they did not have that at his school. They played outside for two hours and then they went inside.                     Next, Kyle showed Play-Bot 9000 how to play video games. He got the hang of it quickly and because Kyle had competition, he did not zoom threw the game. He had to go up against a real player, not just computer controlled players. So now, Kyle had a reason to play, not just because he was bored, but because he had a friend to play with him.                     Finally, after they ate, they played with other toys. They set up a large battlefield of toys that would fight for the castle in the middle of the room. Play-Bot 9000 called it King of the Hill.They had many battles between the good and bad teams, each one a little different from the last. Eventually, the good team captured the castle and all was good in the land. Kyle discovered that playing with friends was better than playing alone.So they kept playing until Play-Bot 9000 said he had to go. Kyle wanted him to stay, but he couldn't and said he would come back and play another day, but right now he had to go. So, he changed back into a toy and the boy set him on his dresser, promising that he would play with it everyday, waiting until Play-Bot 9000 came back to play with him again.

So he was very curious where he would have put it so he walked back up from his basement and went to the kitchen and there it was. He went to go pick it up but moved and said hey the owner was very shocked he had no clue how this happened so he decided to hang with the robot and they became good friends. So when he went to work the next day he brought his robot with him and it turns out he helped them alot he could climb in small places to work while the others can't.

Until this day, May 25, 2019, their goal has not yet been achieved. 34 year old, John Johnson, has created a machine that will live like a human being, but isn't a human being. It is a replicant. A robot that looks exactly like a human!            Chapter 1, The Prototypes.        -The first Replicant was a Mining bot PROTOTYPE, that meant, it could mine ores beneath the surface that man could not.   -The second was a combat model, designed specifically for military duties.   -The third and final PROTOTYPE was, Just a bot that could mimic all of a persons Abilities, mentally, and physically.            Chapter 2, The Functions.                (1): Miner Bot; This bot could mine with it's right hand, sharp claws allowed it to penetrate hard ore such as diamond. It's left hand had a pouch hidden from view and would open to collect materials that were mined. A body with a protective titanium layer allowed it to mine even if a cave collapsed on top of it................. ..................... .... .................................................. ........................................ ........................................... ....  (2): Combat Bot; This particular model can stand a Rocket Launcher Blasting onto it. With an Iron layer, It could punch through a wall! It is also designed to carry all types of weaponry.       (3):Human Bot; The HUMAN Bot is the most complex bot. Since it is designed to copy all of human abilities, it proved quite a challenge. The model is made of a soft material that is made up of animal skins. Scientist input all human characteristics they know of into the bot's 'brain'.

The alive robots were happy to live and communitcate with humans. They played and helped them for the whole day. One sunny morning, an alive robot just started to malfunction. The robot did other robots' jobs.       While waiting at the fountain, scientist was seeking a problem. The Gemini-Scout was running lose across the city. It did Agribot's job. The Gemini-Scout was crushing fruit and ruining  the bushes at the farm. The scientist lurked into the farm and chased the robot ,but it ran away.       The scientist thought,'What happened to my robot? Did it malfunction?'       As soon the Gemini-Scout went to an active volcano, it was trying to be a Dante 2.   The scientist saw the robot run to the volcano. He ran to a motorcycle to chase the   Gemini-Scout. As fats as he could, he stop the robot with his shiny, metal screwdriver.   The robot questioned himself with fear.       So they went back to the city witn the robots helping and playing.

I woke up in a hospital bed, wearing one of those ugly hospital gowns. I was panting, why was I hear? What happenend to me? I lean back in the bed calming down thinking that someone would come in and tell me. I then hear a knock on the door, a nurse walks in with a robot.       'Good, you're awake' she says   'Who are you? Why am I here?' I take a huge gulp 'And why do you have a robot?'   'I am doctor fay, you are hear because you got into a little accident, don't worry I will fix you right up'   'W-Why do you have a robot?'   'Oh her don't mind her, she is one of our assistants in training. Anyway this is Sally'   'In training?'   'Yes'       I think of how bad this could be Sally giving me sugery pulling out my lungs, and ripping out my bones. 'Where is my Mom and Dad? Wait did you ever tell me what happend?'       'Look, we will do the best we can to get your parents here, okay? Oh and this is what happend, you were on the jungle gym on the slide, all of your friends were going on the monkey bars so you thought you could do it too, so you tried. You couldn't reach the first pole so you jumped reaching you thought you could get it. Well, you missed. You missed the first bar falling back down you hit your head on the metal ladder and fell to the ground. You got a concusion and you were not consious the lady who was watching you guys on the monkey bars called someone to help. They called 9-1-1 and they took you away in the ambulance. While that was happening the school tried to get a hold of your parents but they didn't pick up they didn't know who else to call.' Doctor Fay took a breath, 'How do you get home from school? Do you know where your parents are?'   'I walk home from school. My parents were on vacation...I think'   'Who was watching you then?' 'My big brother Cody'   'What is your name sweetie? You remember right?'   'Yeah, My name is Marianna'   'Okay, Marianna why don't you rest I will make sure you are safe'   'Okay, Bye Sally. Bye Doctor Fay!'       So I lay in my bed the rest of the night recovering from my accident. I soon went to bed. I know I will be fine. I know it.

389	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	465022	6	11085856	Y	55103	      Once a upon a time there was a girl who was turning 8 years old and she was so exited for her birthday. She could wait. She had to see what her birthday presents were so she went snooping around the house. First she looked under her parents bed then his looked in her mom and dad's closets. After she had looked for 4 hours she was ready to give up but she thought of one more place and she didn't want to give up so easily. But her mom was watching so she waited until midnight.       Midnight came and she could hardly fall asleep. Finally her alarm clock rang midnight. She hooped out of bed and shoved her robe on and flung open the white door but quiet enough not to wake her parents or baby brother. She tip toed down the old stairs and headed for the coat closet. She could hear little mice running up and down the walls but she didn't care all she wanted was to get tot her birthday present and see what it would be. She opened the dubble door closet and looked up to the top shelf. On the shelf it was filled with a huge amount of rainbow colored wrapped boxes. I got a lot of presents she thought.      She got a stool and pulled down the big purple box, her favorite color. She quietly ripped off the wrapping paper and looked at the box. It was all brown it didn't have any writing on it or anything. I guess I will just have to open it to find out what it is she thought. She opened the top of the box and she thought her present was some kind of car moder and couldn't figure out what it was so she wrapped the present back up as best as she could and trugged back up stairs to her warm bed waiting for her. She will just have to find out what it was tomorrow on her birthday.      Today was her birthday. She was 9 years old. She got up and went into her parents room and jumped on the bed like it was Christmas. But it wasn't it was better it was her 9th birthday and she couldn't wait to open up all of her wonderful presents as she would hope that they would all be as wonderful as she would hope. She ran down the stairs carring her baby brother in her arms trining to be careful not to drop him. As her parents would always tell her over and over again. But today she wasn't really thinking a out that she was thinking about somthing more important than that. Her birthday of coarse.     Her parents brought out all her gifts. She hoped they wouldn't notic the purple one being not that perfectly wrapped. But them couldn't notic they were to focisted on me the birthday girl. I pick to open the big purple one irst so I didn't have to worry about them see the it wasn't perfectly wrapped like how my mom does it. I rip off the paper not caring if I mess it up and see the huge brown box again.

Then she came outside to ask me a question and all of a sudden bright blue and purple lights were flashing all around us. I felt so worried I whipped my head around and in front of my very eyes was a girl. She stood there and just stair at me. She said that she was my robot and I knew that she was not lying because no one else knew that I had a robot except my family. I had no idea that what had happened and a rush of thoughts exploded the words danced around me like snowflakes, SHOULD I TELL and WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I DID floated around and around.            Of course I did not tell a single sole because I wanted to see how much fun I could have with another girl. A sister. I reached out and grabbed her hand and pulled her up to me room. I hoisted out me nail polish and the fun began. I told her i was going to paint her nails and she seamed to be on board and held out her hand. I shook the bottle of mint green nail polish and then quickly unscrewed the top. The horrid sent of nail polish filled my room as a begun to paint.            Once I finished the first hand she was in shock at how beautiful and colorful her nails looked and once both hands were dry I added white dots to every finger nail. Once they were dry she told me should never take the nail polish off because she loved it and she did not know how to. I asked her what she would like to do now a she said she had always wanted to try drawing, so we went down the stairs and grabbed a pile of paper and the giant bin of markers and started to color. I made a fail of a horse and she made the most beautiful art piece I had ever seen. It was gorgeous I told her and she smiled and looked at it again.'Thank you' she replayed and said she got inspired by how much fun we had that day doing our nails and talking for hours on end.            I knew it would be the right thing to do if I told my parents and had them help me turn her back into a robot again so I told her and we head out side and I told my parents everything and they said that she had a setting that could eater be on robot or girl and she must have hit it on her way out of the house. I asked them if we could keep her like that but they said no because they did not want for me to get to attached to her and then one day she would get hurt and there would be no way for us to cure her so we switched her back. The purple and blue lights flashed again and then 'Swoosh' she was robot again, but one thing I did notice about her and it is still there today is that she still has the nail polish on that is how I will always remember our time we spent together and the fun we had!

I wounderdred what it was. Maybe my mom ordered something or my sister ordered something. I wanted to look and see so i couldnt wait for my mom so i decided to open it my self but first ask if it was my sisters, or my moms. I asked ' Mom did you order something called Gemini-Scout?' and the same thing with my sister. Both answered 'no.' I woundered why dont I just open it anyways. So as I cut it open i hear ' Hello my name is Gemini-Scout what is up?' I asked 'what is this?' Sop then I open it up and its a some type of robot that was in a box with a remote controler. What should I do with it? I thought maybe i can get it to clean my room, clean the house, feed the animals,  make it do my homework, text my friends. But first I shoukld know why its here at my house. Maybe someone left the wrong box, or maybe they got the orderes mixed up? As I was thinking the robot said 'dont give them me i will be tested and be risked at life.' As I listend I said 'did you come here by askitdent? He said no i jumped off the car. I just became a live robot looking for someplace to stay and i saw this house closetest to me. Why do they do?' He said that ' they test you on things and make you do things. Well you can stay here for long or my mom will notice your here. Ok well may i do something for you?:' I thought yes but questioning what would happen if I let him clean my room. ' I guess if you want to you can clean my room?' He said 'sure as long as i get to stay here for a little bit. But you must control me to do it because im a robot so to pick up things set the control, 'on pick up clean.' As he was done my mom was calling my name she asked 'did you clean your room and I said yes' she asked if she can come and take a look and I kind of had to say yes so I did. I asked the robot quickly 'how can I make you disapeer?' He said 'you cant but you could hide me some place else. But there was no place mom quickly opened the door and said that you couldn't.

Peanut is a black pug and his hobbies are tug a war, sleeping and eating. One day while Peanut was outside taking his afternoon nap his sun was blocked by a a meter! Peanut jumped and tried to bark many times and then finally it stopped right above Peanut head.           Then out came a little tiny robot the size of his toe nail. The robots name was Violet. She was a elf robot. She cooked and cleaned and had a rainbow over next to the Milky Way. Peanut was in shock. Lizy came out and stepped on Violet and she was gone in a flash! Peanut was so happy he fell in the pond and found a gold coin with a capital V on it.                                                                             The End!

Might think that they are going to be really help full but I dont think they are going to be that help for at all. They miad one robot that it can drive but it has a big cone shaped thing on top of the car and my puestion is what willl happen wehen it rains and the cone gets wet isit going to be water proof is it not and the person want the robot todrive when it starts raining. And the y maid a robot that would help look for people on a serach would it find the person easily or would it not will it not work and pass right by the person and picks up the person but it is not evan close yo the person but they wont contine the sersh any more because it could not pick it up.Why would doctors need help finding or puting back away a thing that he or she can put away them selves and what if they can not find the medicene that they need and so they can not find what can they do to save the person without he medicene that they need would the have to let the person have to sufuer or let the robots that dont work find and treat the the wrong medice to the paciente will feel different solet the doctors fiinf the merdice that they need to come ou of the hospital safley.Then they make a robot that can pick up fuit and fegies  when the go to pick up the food how they know where there robot hands been evan thought they pick up and they one later and it is all moldly and they dont notice that and it goes to the store and then someone actully notice ii finally then it left to rot.

However, one day he went into the computer lab only to find that Mr.bell the computer lab teacher was getting new computers and James was shocked.James helped Mr.bell set up the computers.       The next day James came into school and did all the normal stuff he was suppose to do and it got close to the end of the day and he went to the computer lab but something was different.Then he noticed that Mr.bell wasn't in there 'oh well he will come' James thought.Then James sat down at his usual compute.       Then the wearst thing happened he was sucked in to his computer.He woke up in his board game jminjii that he played on the computer and saw Mr.bell, Cassy(his sister),Donna(his girl friend) and him. then a list of instructions pooped up James found himself reading them out loud and the they started to play the game.       Then James pulled a card and he had to jump over a pool of lava. he mad the jump but Cassy did not. James decied that the only way to save her was to win next Mr.bell pulled a card and his said you have to swim with a pool of sharks.Mr.bell did not make it.Next Donna had to that eat a giant evil marshmallow.But it ate her instead.        James had 1 last turn and he pulls a card and he had to catch a bear.the bear ran around and around and around finally he cought the bear.        He woke up in his bed with his mom shaking her.He said it was just a dream good.

The robot was similar to the Mr.Gower robot and had drawers.Rohil tried to fix the robot but he couldn't. He tried to reprogram it but it was just to big of a challenge. Rohil decided to give up and put it in the trashcan. The next day the garbage truck came to pick up the trash and the robot ended up in a pile of trash.

Rohil then said, 'Wait did you just talk?' The robot said , 'Yes I did and i have came to life.'                     Rohil was so flabbergasted that he took the robot inside and cleaned him up.

Dante 2 is a robot with an amazing job.It can go into volcanoes to collect and sample data.Dante 2 is built to survive in extremely high heat.It has eight legs to help it climb steep volcanoes.Dante 2 collects information about the gases coming through the volcanoes vent.It is a revolutionary way to keep scientist safe without cutting back on their exploration.               Mr.Grower is a robot that helps in hospitals.It is built to be like a cabinet with legs attached to it.Mr.Grower can be used to carry medicine to patients and go around to other rooms in the hspital.It is so strong that it can hold 500 pounds.Mr.Grower is programed to ay over hundreds of phrases.This robot is going to help change the way people in hospitals are cared for.               Those are just some examples of the robot here in the world.They all have special jobs wether it's caring for peopl or collecting data about volcanoes.Robots are truly taking over but not to harm bit to help us make the world a better place.Even though there are limited robots in the world they will be reinventing and creating new ones.Robots are truly one of thegretaest inventions on Eatrh.

I was kicking at some pebbles when suddenly I noticed a very dusty figure of some sort under an even dustier sign. I brushed off the sign with my sleeve and it read: 'Area 51'. I didn't know what to believe, with all the rumors and opinions people had made up about this.        My focuse was then turned to the dusty figure. I blew off the dust and it was some sort of metallic thing with wheels and what looked like arms. Slowly but surely it's eyes started to glow. Then it looked at me and said, 'What can I do for you master.' I blinked confusingly, I had so many thoughts going through my head. 'Make me... Some shoes.' I say unsurely. But surely enough it does in under a minute. Wow! A real robot!! I take it home and hide it. I needed to figure out more about this robot before I use it more.       I soon learn it can build a variet of things, knows a bit about health, and the usual school things. It helps with homework and I help it learn more about generic things such as food, music, and pets. It explains to me that it got lost in the base, there are more hidden there though. For some reason it loves the freezer, so it sleeps there at nice. I still haven't taught it everything I know, and it hasen't taught me everything I know. As for right now, it's name is Icee.

I said,'We need it for our next experiment.' 'On it.' He said, as if I asked him to meet the president. Once he left the room, I heard a scream. It was Johnny's.            I jumped when i heard the scream and ran towards Johnny. 'He-he's gone,' he said. 'Well where is he Johnny?' Boom! We both turned around and ran back to the lab. Once we got there, we saw him, the tester, just walking around. 'Hello Mia and Johnny,' he said,'How are you?''Tester?' I asked.'Come sit so we can check you out,' I said. He walked over and climbed up the table and sat on it, without any problems. Johnny and i checked him all over for about thirty minutes now. 'It seems that he's been asleep for about two years now, by the looks of his battery,' Johnny informed me.            Over the past days, Johnny and I taught Tester how to help scientists in several different ways. He learned how to build machines, mix chemicals, and invent new items. 'Mia, I've heard you and Johnny made a machine,' my boss said. 'It's a Robot and his name is Tester,'' I corrected him. 'Well what ever it is, I got a deal on him, and I'm taking him away.' ''Sir, he's not ready to be taken away from us; he just woke up from whatever he was in that safe for.' 'Mia i need him!' 'Sir, please dont take him; he could be very useful here.' 'I'm sorry Mia, i would keep him if i could, but i made a deal with a friend and he wants it.' Johnny Steve's taking  him away and selling him. ''We cant let him do that,' said Johnny with a look on his face that told me that it wasn't good.            This is the first time I've ever thought about taking an experiment, and the last; when we went to get Tester, he was gone. 'He's gone!' i screamed. Johnny and I frantically searched all over for him. Steve was standing in the doorway. 'Do you have him?' I asked Steve. 'Yes i do, and he's going with me.' He yanked Tester's arm and i knew he shouldn't have. Right then, Tester's arm was broken off. I knew he shouldnt take him because he was a tester not the real thing; then i knew we just lost the biggest experiment we've ever had to have a asuccess.

My first instinc would be to freak out instead i see the robot handing the nurse medicine saying 'Your delivery is here' i eventually calm down. Afterward i take the medicine but end up having an alergic reaction to the medicine. My cheeks swell and i amm rushed to another room with other doctors. Once i hear one nurse say 'Dont worry it is just a mild reaction' .                                When i see the robot hand her two medicine bottles and one shot I ask why that robot is giving her medicine for me to take and shots. She answers 'Well this robot is called Mr.Gower and he helps me help you' i answer 'huh?'   'Mr. Gower is specially made to help doctor, nurses, and pharmacist.'                               Finally i am calmed down and i think that this robot is really cool to have around to help the people who work to help  people complete their working task.

If someone gets stuck somewhere, a robot can save that person by locating where the person is and help a rescue team communicate with that person.            Also, some robots may have neccessary items such as, food, water, and other items.  When someone gets stuck somewher without food and water, the robot can help.

But it really didnt do anything at all. I was watching it, waiting for it to do something. After another ten minutes I decided to go outside and play basketball.            'Emma! Time for dinner.' My mom yelled from the kitchen window. I groaned and told her I'll be in soon. When I came in the door my mom was sitting at the table waiting for me. I washed my hands and sat down to join her. We ate our dinner in silence. My mom broke the silence by asking, 'How is your new robot?' She gave it to me for my birthday so I didnt want to let her down by saying that it doesnt work. 'It's great! I am so glad that I got it!' But my mom knows me too well and frowns. I look down at my mashed potatos that dont look very appetizing anymore. 'Mom I dont feel too good. Can I head up stairs?' My mom tried to conceal her concern but I saw it peeking out a bit. I took my plate to the sink and went to bed.            When I woke up the next morning I saw my dog robot sitting in my chair. Hmm, thats funny I thought I put it away last night. Oh well, I thought. But this time I put him in a box and shoved the box under my dirty laundry. 'That should do it.' I exclaimed  cheerfully. I had just remembered that I was having a sleepover with my best friend, Ellie tonight. I got dressed and ready for school. I was so happy that I didnt even scold my mom for putting a note in my lunch bag. Soon enough I was out the door yelling bye to my mom as a walked to meet Ellie at the bus stop. But for some reason I heard foot steps behind me. I whipped around and found my dog robot following me to school. I screamed and ran toward Ellie. 'Whats wrong?' She cried. To petrified to speak I pointed toward the robot which was now calling my name. His eyes had turned red and one of his paws fell off. It looked like a dog robot zombie! The bus arrived just in time and we left the robot standing there and off to school we went. I couldnt stop thinking about it.            Ellie and I were walking home from school and talking about what we should do when we got to my house. We agreed to investigate the dog robot and find out whats wrong with it. Ellie has the same robot and hers works perfectly fine. When we arrived at my house I walked in the front door and saw my mom tried to a chair. The robot was standing on the table next to her laughing. My first instinct was to untie my mom. Ellies first instinct was to tackle the robot and she did just that. In the blink of an eye the robot was in a head lock and my mom was free and ready to fight. I wanted to explain to my mom that that was why I didnt like it but she saw the look on my face and seemed to understand. We tied up the robot and smashed it with a sludge hammer. It was fun. Once the robot was smashed and crushed we went out to the bon fire pit and threw the robot into the flames. He was nothing but ashes.            After the burning, Ellie and I went inside to watch a movie. We had popcorn and had a great time. At around eleven o'clock we went outside to see the burnt robot again. We buried the ashes and pretended to have a funeral for it. We laughed and laughed and vowed to never get a toy robot again. You can never be sure of which robots will come to life.

Another reason is that Dante 2 go in to  a volcanos and collect information for scientist to check if their is dangous gases. My next reason is that Mr.Gower is a robot that help doctors and nurse and carry medicine and can even speak.Even Mr. Gower is very strong it can carry 500 pounds a robot can be very strong.Robots can do alot of thing they can even play they can sing and dance. A robot can even play hokey and can play shufflebored.They you can even have a robot pet and it just like a normal pet but they do not have to go outside or need to be feeded.You can be on the computer and you can control the  robot from far away.In nevada have a robtic car and this car have $80,000 cone-shaped laser mounted on its roof.Can people notice it's a self drive car ,yes it does notice it has no human in the car driving it.There is a seat that has a computer that show what it see.It can even ajust the speed and it ajust the speed to stay out of the blind spots of other vehicles.Google's feet of robotic cars has driven more than 200,000 miles over highways. Google say it will take a long time to get the cars to be on sale.My last reason is that this cars have amount information that these cars have when they are driving.Robot are here not for the future they are helping humans and they still making better one everyday.

For some reason toxik got a feeling he then started to rust up and he was feeling, he was feeling human. The boys name was ilectric (that was his username his name was never said) and they both started to have fun in the game. after many months of having fun people started finding out. Everyone knew that the player toxik was playing as wasn't supposed to bee roaming around online but only standing there and answering questions. Soon people started to report the issue thinking it was a glitch or so but it wasn't a glitch it was FRIENDSHIP. Then a few days after people started noticing one of the administrators that built the AI system went to it and reset the program so that all toxik was now was an old computer. The very sad boy ilectric always stood there trying to talk to toxik's character but it never worked. Others also tried to talk to ilectric and got very sad and started a war with the people that reported toxiks (issue). What they didn't know is that toxik didn't get reset he moved himself to a different computer...                   Toxik was alive! Well kind of. Toxik was still very unstable and wouldn't work for a while. Toxik now had a copied program of him on the old computer but he was on a different one. That made him confused. He soon decided that the one on the other computer was his brother so he renamed him on the programs as Kixot which was toxik backwards as meaning the old toxik. Now the only problem was finding ilectric back. He tried going in to the game servers to add ilectric but couldn't find him. Toxik then started to remember things. The last time he was with the boy was on his birthday July ,12 2034 when the boy turned 14 years old. It was now June ,11 2045! That meant that boy was now about almost 18.   Toxik needed to find ilectric before he turned into an adult.How would toxik find him again, he never even knew the boys real name! Toxik panicked and started to melt his lens. He was crying!   Even crying didnt cheer him up, he then started to search all of the web for that username 'ilectric'. He got many results and sort of started to stalk every website ilectric had signed up for. He found the location that ilectric was living in he then copied his profile onto his USB flashdrive and put it into the robot he used to travel inside of. (This means that when Toxik put his flashdrive in the USB port inside the robot he would be able to move around in a different body, pretty cool right)? So he packed up and put everything he had on his USB he was going to fly to ilectric's house and. He didnt know what he would do. Would he talk to me?   'I might scare him'. All these thoughts were going threw his head. He plugged the USB in. 'lets do this.' Toxik was supposed to be there in 30 minutess but he hacked the robots system and made it 5 minutes. This was great. When he got there a Young girl answered the door in her PJ's and wasn't surprised. The young girl was a robot to. A 16 year old robot! toxik kind of got easily attracted to her and she said 'We've been waiting.'  Toxik walked right in and didn't notice anything. He asked what happen and sometimes he wished he never did 'he.....he died.' Toxik was really mad he asked 'What, how?' The whole family came down expect for ilectric whose real name was gabriel. They explained that he had been depressed for quite a while and he had never been a 'people person.' After he lost toxik he didnt have a reason to live and died from heart attack. This was confusing and he couldn't take it he was about to delete his USB memory when the girl came to him and gave him a hug. He then noticed there are other reasons to live and they soon were married (both robots). He also got a human robot suiten and lived happily ever after. Rest in peace Gabriel...

His name is RO-BO Drone he goes by RO-BO for short. His maker made him so that he could have a mind of his own. When he wins he donates all of the winning price money to cancer. He is an amazing boxer because of his arms. They are spring loaded from his elbow to his wrist with a coated steel cover with a pink tint. RO-BO's shoulders can dislocate to make each of his punches to be a lot stronger. The fists are pink steel balls that weigh ten pounds each. His chest plates are coated many times with all kings of metal. His heart is a 3D cancer ribbon. His legs are very light weight with big feet so he can kick and run very fast. He travels the world as a professional athlete but, when he was first made he was like a baby, he didn't know anything he had a professional trainer train him. His whole career was going to be dedicated to cancer to save all kids and adults. Each match he wins he gets about $10,000 he only uses $2,000 of that to be repaired and the rest goes to cancer.                                                                                          With all of this on his hands his is also part time firefighter and part time scuba diver. RO-BO can go into fire and not melt or get burned he wears a special suit with hoses attached to the back of him and a shield that can protect the people he finds. He can lift up to about 700 pounds at one time. His shoulders can extend about three and a half feet just in case he can't reach something important. Thanks to him all the firefighters have less chance of getting hurt. When RO-BO scuba dives he goes down first to check the air pressure his strong legs can make him swimming fast. He has small storage areas in his waist that he can use to help other scuba divers when they need more air he has air tanks. If someone gets stuck in the rocks he can break the rocks with his fists.              One day he got called to go to a house it was on fire. 'Help me! Help me my new baby boy is stuck in the house!' RO-BO put out as much fire as he could but it kept growing bigger so he decided to go on in and try to to save him. He looked everywhere then suddenly he heard a little cry. IT WAS HIM! Trapped in his room RO-BO broke down the door and got in the room. He grabbed the baby and ran as fast as he could. He made it out just before the house collapsed. His boss called him and told him that someone in South Harbor is drowning so he put on his suit and sprinted down. 'Help! Drowni blub blub blub can't breatheblub'! 'RO-BO No. Need. To. Worry'. he jumped into action and saved him. After all that he wanted to just relax. That's just a normal day. TO BE CONTINUED...

Okay it wasn't that long ago and it wasn't exactly a kingdom more like 2008 in Oxnard California. One day there was a earthquake that struck all of Oxnard. It left great derby so bad you couldn't  even drive.      Well the next day was a disaster there was many people hurt and a lot of death. So that day a young man can to show something he had been working in invention that he had finish! It was so big and helpful. It help rebuild everything but it wasn't enough for man kind. They wanted more so they dissided to make more models, but smaller then the original one. It cost about 1,400 dollar. It was expensive but worth it. It help at home it was smart. It talked played, cooked, and cleaned, but it was very expensive so the dissided they would make another robot more cheaper for the lower class. 'Something they could afford but not as fancy' thought the government.      So they did it again they build a small model of the big robot once again but with less cualitys for people the had a lower price range. this robot would cost about 100 dollars. A reasonable price.     One early morning, a woman the had bout a robot a couple of weeks ago woke up to find her house  in a disaster. She quickly called the police and the came to her house she was frighten and worried she thought that someone had broken in to her house.     A few months later more and more peoples houses were being distroid. Everyone was scared they thought that there was a pack of people destroing there homes. At the end most of the robots where destroid as well. As if someone where getting rid of all the robots.      After at least a month or so a very scary thing an ecsposhion stuck place! Everything was distroid and they had noticed that all the robot had exploded.       After a couple of years they had made a discovery everything that had happened in the couple of months where because of the robots. They had distroid and disfontion and exploted.

He his a scientist, he has been interested in science ever since he was a little boy. His main interest is building robots. He can build any robot from scratch if he puts his mind to it.       Today he stared a robot. Ro.B.Ot was looking for some bolts for his robot ,but he could not find any he looked high and low left and right , but he just couldn't seem to find any so he had to run to the store to get some so he left his best assistant,Josh in charge to watch his Robot.so as he was gone his assistant, Josh was examining his robot he heard a banging on the door it was RO.B.Ot because he forgot his keys so Josh quickly turned around but little did he know he split super tonic acid on the robot. so as Josh help Ro.B.Ot bring the supply's in the robot started to get up but the funny thing is he did not have arm because that is why the proffer had to go get bolts for his arms. So he bolted them on and then he go a name for him Bolt.       So Bolt and the Professor became friends then the Professor started to program him he can juggle, make food, run arenas,and many more amazing things. He could do so many things he was like a human. So Ro.B.Ot wanted to bring him to a science fair ,but for adults, and it was tomorrow. Ro.B.Ot asked Bolt if he wanted to go and Bolt smiled and said 'Yes.'         So they went to the science fair and there was a lot of competition and every thing looked great they were sure they would win. because Bolt was amazing. The first round stared it was organization ,and the judges were coming around. They saw everybody's ,and and they had their votes of who will be kicked out. The second round was presentation, Ro.B.Ot's presentation was 'This is my robot i made ti from scratch he is a full functional robot who can do pretty much what a human can ,but better. He loves people and he likes having friends. The last round was just showing who won. 'And the winner of this here Science fair is Ro.B.ot.' said the judges. So Bolt and Ro.B.Ot went up and got their trophy.        Back at Ro.B.ot's lab for a celebration Bolt made punch and they celebrated all night because of Ro.B.Ot's success on Bolt who is a wonderful robot and a great friend.           The next morning Ro.B.Ot heard banging and buzzing sounds. It was bolt he was malfunctioning and he was about to break. So Ro.B.Ot walked him slowly over to his work table and layed him down and he was looking for the problem ,but he could not find the problem. So Ro.b.ot sat there next to Bolt and then he shut down and he was gone forever.

He tried changing the batteries but Floor 3 didn't work. So Tom took him to Brooklyn Bots, and the doctor said 'I'm sorry for your loss'. But tom knew it wasn't over.             Then, he took everything apart from threw robot and he put it back together. But he didn't work so he thew Floor 3 to the attic. And then someone pounded on the door telling tom I can fix the robot.             Finally, after he fixed the robot he said that would be 2.5 million dollars. So Tom said you can keep him I will make a new robot. So the guy took the robot and sold it on eBay for 2.1 million dollars. Like magic the robot was sold. And the guy had thousands of these in his garage. So he went from being poor to rich over night. But all the robots got revenge and became alive. So one day the robots took the guy and locked him inside the attic.

He was the king of his planet and all of the other robots liked him. One day he was reading the ipaper on his inote when he saw that an American spaceship was coming to his planet to explore it and find new things. He got in his icar and drove to the city council to discuss this matter.                  When he got there he noticed that the council robots where reading the ipaper and they seemed anxious and kind of nervous. He asked them what the problem was and they said that humans were coming and that is not a good thing because when Tod created us he put us on this planet so nobody would find us. But the Americans found a way to make a suit that protects them from the heat on this planet. The humans were coming and there was no way to stop them.                       The robots had to prepare for the humans they had to dig tunnels underground and put food and gas underground because they didn't know how long they were going to be there. The robots had a count down to how long the humans were gonna be on their planet.                Dell woke up the next morning remembering that today was the day that the humans were coming. He got everybody down underground and made sure that they had everything he grabbed everything he needed and went underground. They were down there for about an hour when they heard it it was a loud sound they could hear steam blow out of the engine. They heard footsteps coming closer and closer to their tunnel then the door opened and and they all scooted back as much as they could but it wasn't enough   the people saw them and they took pictures of them and they wrote about them. The humans went away and they all up from under ground and they were really scared that something was going to happen to them. The next morning Dell woke up and started reading the ipaper and he saw that they were things about them on the news and that other American spaceship's were going to see the strange robot's. He was laying in bed when he heard a loud BOOM and steam came blowing out of the engine of an spaceship he got up from his bed and saw a spaceship people got off and started to look around they took more pictures and more drawings and. Dell decided that the next morning he was going to have everyone evacuate the planet and go somewhere else where it was safe for them. The next morning Dell announced on Itv that he was going to have everyone pack up get everything they need and go somewhere else. All of the people were scrambling around trying to find all of their stuff and find someplace to go. Dell started packing up for the long journey. He was going to go to a different planet called Elysia it was quite a cool place and pretty much everyone was going to go there from the planet they were on now. Dell was leaving he took one last glance at Grover and headed off to a new start.

Personally I think I would want one! Not for those reasones but for school and bullies, just things like that. These robots are made by people that really need them, for personal reasones and for research when they want to find out something. Some of these robots are for saving lifes but they also carry things that we humans need, like madical medicine and food...

For billions of years this planet has been calm and quiet until the year of 330,000,000,000,000 on this year something happend and i'll tell you what. Their was a young little robot boy named Devin 515 who always at pizza and wrestled and played football. One day his mom grounded him because he didn't eat his corn because he wanted pizza ,so after his mom yelled at him and told him to go to bed he prayed that night that he would get to do only what he wanted and after he said those words an angel had poofed before him and at first he was scared because he had never saw an angel before, but when the angel told the Devin 515 to calm down and don't be scared.And when he did the angel told the  boy God had sent him down to Mars to give him that wish and when the angel did The little robot boy named Devin 515 appered in a strange planet with pizza everywhere football feilds and wrestling rings. The little robot was so happy, but after a few weeks of playing football,wrestling,and eating pizza he started to get a fatter and he got so fat he poped and was never seen on mars again until 5 weeks after he poped he was back on Mars and told his mom that he would never do anything she didn't like and they had a wonderful life with healthy food.                                                                You must be wondering how he came back to Mars after he poped well after he poped God had sent the robot boy to Heaven and he talked with the robot boy about being careful what you wish for and always listen to your mom and he said if you do that i'll send you back to Mars and Devin 515 said yes.

I remember all the good times we had. Every second I thought about her made me even sadder. All of this was just a shock. This just couldn't be happening. Tears started running down my face... it came out faster and faster. I had to let it out. It was very rare to see me cry but right now I was very mad at myself.  Why didn't I see that she felt awful? Why didn't she tell me? Did she want to keep it a secret? Questions were being asked in my head, but I had no answer. Thinking of this made me have a brilliant idea, Why don't I go visit her???             'Bye mom,' I yelled from my front door.             'Do you have everything sweetie?' My mom asked.             'Yes mom I do. We've been over this like a billion times,' I replied.          I was walking to the hospital because it was only a couple blocks away. Since I'm so tall I can get away with looking like I'm twenty even though I was fifteen. It felt so good to breathe the fresh air of spring. I could hear the birds sing, flowers were blooming, and summer was on it's way!           'Hi do you happen to know what room Olivia Anderson is in?' I asked the front desk lady.            'No, let me look it up.... Hmm...Here it is, she is in room 69,' the lady said.            'Thank you sooo much,' I said.         A lady in the room let me in. Olivia was so surprised I came, she jumped out of her bed to give me a hug. I was so happy that she was happy! Olivia loved the flowers that I gave her. She said it reminded her of her grandma. By the time I caught her up with all the drama at school the lady had left.         Suddenly a robot came and said, 'Olivia, you need to take you medicine,' the robot said while holding the medicine in his hand. I was so shocked and confused. Did the robot just talk? How did he know her name? Olivia was just sitting there like nothing weird was happening.        Once the robot left I asked Olivia, 'Was that just a robot?'        'Yes,' she replied.        'That's so cool,' I said.        'Do you want me to call him,' Olivia asked.        'Yes,' I answered excitedly.        The robot came right as we were done calling him. We asked him so many questions that he told us he might die. The robot played games with us and told us his secrets. Did you know the robot has families in Australia? We did crafts like painting small pots with water colors from Olivia's sister Mia. The robot was so awesome! He could change colors and randomly play music.        Then some thing awful happened! The lady came back saying I had to go! I was so upset. I didn't want to leave Olivia alone at the hospital. I cried saying:'I don't want to go, I don't want to go, I don't want to go, I don't want to go.'        I woke up in the morning.       'Phew I'm glad that was just a dream,' I said to no one in particular.       I smelled bacon and pancakes and jumped out of my bed.

422	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			M	474285	6	11085991	Y	55103	      One time when I was building a toy robot, it came to life! I was blown away because it was only meant to talk and be a toy, but it just started moving around and doing jobs for me. I couldn't even believe myself because, I never meant for that to happen, but it just did!            It was one week ago when it happened. I went to the Home Depot and bought some supplies for it. Just metal, batteries, wood, and some wires. I came back home and started to build it. After I was done building it, I turned it on. And that's when it all happened. It came to life.            I didn't want to show or talk about it to anyone, but a couple nights later it made a loud noise when I was training it in my bedroom. Both my parents rushed in asking what it was, and then it came out from under my bed. They both freaked out and asked where I got it from, so I told them everything that happened. They were both so proud of me. I thought when they found out I'd be in trouble and they'd force me to throw it away.            The next day at school was crazy. Everybody was psyched out of their minds. This was because my robot, Henry, followed me to school. It was the middle of science class when it busted down the door. You could seriously hear the screaming from a mile away. All you could here was 'AAAHHHHH' or 'NO IT'S THE END!' That last one was my best friend by the way, but getting off topic. It was crazy! The principal rushed in and almost passed out. I was so mad at Henry I was almost going to take it apart when I got home. He or should I say 'it' stayed in my locker the rest of the day.            When I got home it made me a glass of lemonade, like that was going to make everything better. This was possibly the worst day of my life so far. But the next day I locked him in my room and the only thought that processed through my mind was 'If he knocks down my bedroom door today, who knows what trouble I'll get into?' Nobody would look at me in school, but apparently I won an award for best robot. I didn't even see a contest sign-up sheet.            The next day was the best and worst day of my life. I found out a science laboratory wanted to test out my robot! It could only do chores though. It could only lift 50 pounds, and didn't have anything for easy storage, so they declined it. I heard something called the Gemini-Scout made it or whatever. Couldn't have been that better than mine.            That same day though I discovered it could dance and play sports like basketball, soccer, and kickball. He has powerful legs so the kicking part could have something to do with that. The saddest part though, one day I was playing basketball with it and his batteries went out. I immediately ran to the closest store I know has batteries and bought some. I came back home and saw that he was missing. That was the last time I ever saw Henry. 	CD NN WRB PRP VBD VBG DT NN NN , PRP VBD TO VB .

It was a robot and I was scared at first when I saw it because it was tall. I close the closet and went down stairs to tell my brother but he didn't beleive me, so he went in my room and said where is the robot. I said in the closet so he went in the closet and he said nothing is there. I was confused for a second because I saw him a minute ago. So I said nevermind I must of had a nightmare and I went to school and I saw him again, I did not know what to do.               Three years past and I forgot about that robot that I saw or mabye. I got in my room when I saw three years ago. I was not scared this time because I already saw him in the past. I said what are you doing here and I said can you talk and the robot said yes i can talk. He said my name is leo and i was sopost to protect you but you never saw me agian so bye. I said wait I want keep you.

Robots can rescue people, carry food and water, find people and help doctors. Robots can also explore planets and volcanoes, preform surgeries, and go where man can't go. Robots are probably more helpful than humans in some ways.        If I ever had a robot, I would make it do a lot of things. I would make it do my homework, clean my room, and make me food. I would especially like it if it would make me food because I love food. The food that I would want it to make me is bacon. I love bacon and it is my favorite food.        If I ever had a robot, the robot would be seven feet tall. It would weigh sixty pounds and it would be made out of carbon fiber. What I would really like about it though is that it would be invisible and indestructible! It would also have a food dispenser and it would be named The Baconator.

We were just putting the final touches on then it would be the most gorgeous thing you would ever see in your life. We finished and I stood watching it all the way to the night. That night I couldn't stop thinking about it and its awesome features; i.e., shiny gold body, arms that looked indestructable. That next day I ran outside to look at it once more, but it wasn't there! I ran all over the house looking for it. I decided to look in the garage once more to see if I didn't see it in the corner or something. I look out and it was right where I had put it last time! I said to myself,' How did I not see you the last time?' Then all of a sudden he says back,' I was just looking for the wrench, my left arm is loose.           I total freaked out! I said,'Did you just say something?' He replied,'Ummmmm yeah didn't you hear me the first time? Maybe you want to play basketball. I was astonished! I said back,'Ok if you want to play?' It turns ou tif they had a robot NBA he would be in it because for a robot that is 3 FT. tall he can shoot and make everything. I said to myself,'Maybe it is good that I have a new(partly freaky) friend. I never really talked to him but all we did all day was polish him and or play a sport that he would beat me at everytime.          It ended up being a great friendship between me and him. We always got along, even though he understood we were both very different.

So I drew it and drew it and drew it. Then the next day I had to go to school I left my drawing on the table so I could build a prodo type when I got home. After a long day of sitting in a class room for six to seven hours I was finaly going to go home and build my robot. When I got home I gatherd some tools and saftey equipment and got to work. I worked and worked and worked then I tested it out it didn't work after every thing I just did espeshaly trying to make it look like me I was not going to give up I fixed what I thought the source of the problem was and tryed it again it didn't work I new I failed, I gave up and went to bed.

Then I tried it out, but it didn't work, there was a missing piece. When i repaired it with the missing piece it worked! It was the best thing that ever happened to me. It was helpful and fun.                How it all started was when i was drawing, it had a head, body, arms, and even legs! It was time to do my chores and I didn't like chores then i thought about the robot drawing. I said to my self ,'What if i built my own drawing!' I needed tools though, 'where would i get tools?' I thought to my self. I know a friend that had tools, so i asked if i can barrow some. I built the robot, but it wasn't easy, plus it was fun.            It was the moment when i had to press the button to see if it'll work or not. Putting it to one piece was fun, but will it work? Sadly it didn't work. It seems like it was missing a piece. I figured it out it was the brain! Everyone needs a brain. So how would I make a smart robot? It'll need a calculator, a calender, most of all words! Robots need to speak so we can understand them.             Like I said before this is the moment. One click of a button may change my life. It works! Its eyes open with one word, HELLO. I was so happy I played with it all day. It helped me with my homework and cleaned my chores in less than one hour! I named him Mr. Needy. Mr. Needy and I had a happy ending.               My robot came to life is a happy story about Mr. Needy and I. It started with a bored for fun drawing to a robot, that is a crazy start! Mr, Needy helps people with needs. That's how I got his name. He plays, helps, cleans, and even cook! He is fun for others too, like my family. He plays with my siblings football, help my Mom cook, and helps my Dad repair broken stuff. It's really fun having a new member in the family, he is like a brother to me, and of course my family too.

It was on fire witch was strange I thought to my self. So then i went outside, got the hose and put the fire out. Once it was cool enough I picked it up and all of a sudden it turned into a robot. I was so scared out of my mind I didn't know what to do so I dropped it and ran inside. I watched it through my window and all it was doing was sitting there, not moving and being as still as ice. I went back outside slowly and carefully because i had no idea what he was capable of.                                                                    I slowly walked up to him and he turned around and said 'hello I am Roberto your new helper'. I screamed and ran back inside. I then told my mom but I told her not to let anybody take him away. I told her I wanted to see what he was like. I slowly went back outside and walked slowly close to it again and said 'hi' in a really stuttering way. I asked him what he was and he said a robot from Mars to help me with my chores and homework. I told him to follow me into my house and he did and sure was he fast! I asked him what he liked to eat and he said 'robots don't eat'. We then went upstairs and he helped me do my homework. I was so happy that i had a new friend to help me around the house. But then he told me a week later he had to leave back to his home planet on Mars. He promised me he would be back.          A year later he returned and help me do my chores again but only for a week just like last time. I wish he could stay longer but oddly he has school on Mars just like we do on Earth! Isn't that just weird. He said that they learn bout the history on Mars and their presidents. I asked him who the president on Mars was and he said his father was. that would be so cool to have your dad be the president. We shared stories about school. He said he loved school! I told him I don't so much. But he reminded me that without it you wouldn't know how to count and use proper grammar.         It came to the day when i had to say goodbye once again but he told me he would always be here this very week every year to help me with anything. I told him thank you for everything he has done for me and he waved goodbye to me with his 3 fingered hand and got on his spaceship with the rest of his family.

He had many friends that loved to play with him. His best friends name is Agribot. Agribot likes to pick berries, oranges, grapes, and apple. He aslo has two other friends named Dante 2 and Gemini-Scout. They all went to the park one day and saw many people. They liked to sing songs in the park so that people would here them.  One day Dante 2 went to the park with out any of his friends. He fell in a hole and no one saw him. He kept calling for help but the hole was to deep to here anything. So when Mr.Gower called Dante 2 his phone was shut off. He started worrying about Dante 2 because he couldnt find him and his phone was on all the time.                      So he went looking for him in the city. There was no luck of finding him because there was so many robots in the city. So he went looking in the park and found the deep hole. he looked down the deep hole and fell in. he landed right on top od Dante 2. Mr.Gower was so happy he found him, but so mad that he fell in. They kept screaming until a little robot name Toby came over. Toby said he would go get help. It was about 7:00 pm and Toby was still not back. Mr.Gower thought his mother said for him to go to bed. They were looking up when suddenly they saw Toby. They were so happy he came back. Toby brought 15 people to help get them out of the hole. It took them 5 minutes to get them out.                          After all that Mr.Gower called up Agribot, Gemini-Scout, and Toby and went out for ice cream. Dante 2 said ' I thougt we were never going to get out of there'. Mr.Gower said 'I know thanks to Toby he saved us'. And from that day on they played with Toby. Toby used to be a lonely kid who never talked to anyone, but know he has great friends.

It would be able to go into water without shutting down and would be able to rescue people in need. The project was almost finished. Then, everything went wrong. A piece that wasn't supposed to be put in was stuck. The piece allowed it to think. Them without warning, the robot's eyes opened. It crashed into the door of the laboratory and ran into the darkness.       The scientists were amazed that a robot could have a mind of it's own, and quickly decided to make more, thinking they could control them. They were wrong. The three robots they created were too strong and quickly overpowered them. All of Texas was in mayhem. The scientists were questioned thouroghly. But even the army couldn't find the robots.       What the people didn't know was that the robots were also camoflagued, from the satelites and eyes. The robots weren't bad, they were just different. The scientists never found them until the robots were expired. But they only found three.....

I here voices calling my name, then a bright, sparkling light shines right in my eye. I here this weird sound. But that's just it, it wasn't a sound. It was a voice! I had to listen very, very carefully to understand some of the words.   'It's ready. It's finally ready!'           The voice sounded excited, but at the same time, relieved! Then, I felt scared. How did I even get here? What was this place? Then, something touched me on the shoulder. Something cold and hard. I turned around, and the next thing I know, I awoke and sat up right. I was desperate and scared.   'It's just a dream.' I kept repeating to myself.           But the whole time I felt something inside me saying it wasn't just a dream.           'I need to go back to sleep. Everything will be better in the morning.'                 The next day I got up and walked outside. I still remembered my dream, and it was irritating me. But I just couldn't help thinking what the man was talking about. And not only that. What had touched her. It felt cold and hard, sort of like metal. I also couldn't help feeling that what the man was talking about, is what touched me. I shook my head.            'Nothing wrong!'           I went back in my room, than I noticed something went in my closet. I carefully went over and opened the door. What I saw was so surprising, yet spectacular at the same time. It was made of  metal. It had hair on the head, a greyish blue shirt, jeans, and supposedly shoes. The parts that weren't covered in 'clothes' were skin color. But it was all metal! What I saw was a boy robot!                 I've kept Mark, my robot, hidden from my family so far. It had been 2 days after I found him, and I wasn't just about to let him be taken by my family. I have learned a lot about Mark and what he can do, or does, in the past 2 days. I learned he could talk, fly, search for things, play with animals, and be controlled by me! He doesn't just talk random things, or talk like everyone thinks robots talks like. He also doesn't walk slow either. He talks and helps me with my homework, chores, advice, and a lot of other things! Now you're probably wondering how I've kept him a secret when he can talk and do all those other things. Well, let's just say, he's fast.   'Mark? How do I do these again?'               'Well, you have to add these all together to find the perimeter, and multiply these two to find the area.'                'Oh yeah! Thanks Mark!' I loved how he could help me so much, but I still had the feeling that he could do more than whatI knew.                 Today me and Mark were cleaning our room, and I was thinking about what he acts like. Not only that, but I think he was the thing the man in her dream was talking about. And also, she was thinking that if he could help her with a lot, he more than likely could help others with stuff! But what? What could Mark help other people with? He could fly, talk, travel, play, be talked through. What else could he do? Search! He could search for things! So if he could search for things, he could search for people! It all made sense now! He was a search robot sent to me. Not for playing, or chores, or cleaning. But for helping and searching! That's why he was so good at helping me! He was made to help and search people! Oh it all made sense now! The relief in the man's voice, the hand on my shoulder, the helping, the knowing. It all made sense! I was chosen to help him search for people!

Robots can function in any type of dangerous situations. We work hard to please our masters, without receiving praise of rewards. They think we don't care. But we do. What have they ever done that lets them be able to control us like this, we have more power than them. Since the beginning of time, computobots or computers as the humans like to call them have been smarter than them. But they CAN control us,and that has got to change.       I'm 81-v3, that's not even considered a name! Those careless humans! I prefer to be called Blue, but nobody ever listens. That's another reason why they shouldn't order me like this. They are pretty much too lazy to think of my name. All of my friends are 81-v3, the type of robot that can be the other ego of their owner. Basically I am Exor's, my owner's, robot form. I guess my personality is like her's but I can never understand why I should still be here working under their commands. We both have a wide personality, sometimes sorrowful and other times cheerful, and I guess we are both rebellious and have our own opinions. I was bonded to her at birth.       I'm Exor, I own a she-robot called 81-v3. We live in a little neighborhood called Rushla where my friends and I enjoy every day of our lives. We can party every day while drinking soda and eating tasty treats. So far, the scariest thing in my life has been dropping my talkbot, the super fast message carrier robot, in the swimming pool. I was just trying to see if it would be smart enough to zoom away when I dropped it, but its SO stupid! Its like it can't do anything! Now its broken and I have to climb all the way onto my shpeed and take ONE WHOLE MINUTE to travel and arrive at The Bot. On my way there, I'm thinking about complaining to the computobot about inventing this self-control thing for my robots, they are just too dumb!!!       Exor has come home and I hear her complaining about Purple, my friend the talkbot. Exor never bothers talking to me about her problems so I usually rely on Purple because she knows all of Exor's complaints when Exor  frets to her. I wish Purple was here right now, chatting speedily away to me about Exor's recent problems. But that doesn't really matter; Exor's problems are usually such things like 'OH MY GOSH WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HAIR TODAY!!!' Usually I try to help her, every time I'm hoping for something in return but nothing ever happens. I think Exor doesn't even realize I'm here. Without me, she will never survive one hour.       I am SO excited! The computobot just gave me this really special chip that looks like its the color small! I think that the bot gave me a warning...Oh well! I just have to let 81-v3 eat it and then when I drop her into the swimming pool, she won't die!!! Yay me! I am too smart right? It's just too bad I wasted two minutes on my shpeed...       Something is happening to me. Its powering through my body and flowing through all of my round shape. Its such a strange energy that feels like its crashing inside of me. Its crashing into this small part of my mind, crushing what ever is built up in there. What is this? I don't know whats happening but before I know it, I think I've just disobeyed Exor's command.       'Can you hear me?! I said jump 81-v3! Jump in the pool! You are so dumb!'       It seems like Exor can only say one syllable words while I, Blue zoom away into the wilderness of Rushla. Which isn't exactly wilderness because it's filled with animabots pretending to be animals, while secretly I know they are being embarrassed beyond everything.       I am now free at last, and that was from Exor's own will. She stupidly gave me the small chip and fed it to me. I feel like screaming out to all of the poor bots at work down there. But I find myself not caring anymore, after all I'm free. I feel like I'm falling though, I think I'm transforming. Something inside my is clashing and forming something different. I feel like something is being squeezed out of me. I'm changing into... what? This is so stupid! Ugh I can't get home on my shpeed! This is so stupid! What am I supposed to do? WALK? I'm a human! I don't deserve to be WALKING back home! OH MY GOSH my outfit is terrible! Who wears diamond dresses and shiny gold leggings while WALKING back home! I'm a human and I deserve to be better!                                       The End.

435	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	A	N	N	F	474372	6	11086306	Y	55103	     My name is Jacob Hatcher. I absolutely love robots. Everything I do, it includes robots. My whole entire room is filled with robotic items. Not only that I'm into robots, I'm an expert at this kind of technology. At school, I joined a creative writing club, to tlak all about robots, so others could be interested, too.     One day, I had to write about something I love (which is what I am doing right now) for the creative writing club. The first thing that came into my mind was robots. Throughout the day I've been trying to figure out what about robots I want to write about. As I was going to bed I remembered something so exciting but I completely forgot about it: there was going to be the annual Robot Fair on Saturday, which was tomorrow.      I sooooo wanted to go there and write about the robots that would be there, I head they were just models, but it's still interesting to see what they look like. All I had to do was convince my father or mother to take me. They are always indolent on weekends, sitting on the couch watching comedy, the BORING new, or 'romantic' movies together. Sometimes I feel like they like watching boring news more than me.      So I went up to them and I said I had to go downtown for the annual Robot Fair for my essay. They didn't respond so I yelled at them a couple more times. Still no response. Now I was really annoyed. I took the remot control from the coffee table and I turned the TV off. They yelled at me. I said'Take me to the annual Robot Fair, and pick me up in 1 hour, and I won't bother you again this weekend.' Of course, they reluctantly agreed.      I arrived amazed. I've been to the annual Robot Fair many times, but this year was the absolute best out of the others. So I started at the helping robots model. It was neat... until I saw their eyes flicker. I was creeped out, so I went to a different booth. I'm pretty sure no one else saw. I think I was growing a tad crazy. As soon as I went to the booth I was even more amazed. There were giant robots gazing down at me. But then I saw slight movment in their arm. What was going on with me?       It was half an hour later when I heard it. When I sat down by the entrance to wait for my parents to pick me up and hoped the didn't forget, lots of people went screaming and running past me. I looked utterly confused and slowly went back inside. There, I saw it. It was gazing down at me. No, they were gazing down at me. Right in front of me I saw a pack of robots crashing everything the was in their way. I was their next victim.       I had to think fast. Except I couldn't think while running for my lives. I hid in the bathroom and hoped no robots saw me. I sat there, puffing for breath and thinking. Robots are smart, but there are many ways to stop them. Hm... there's remote controls, switches, taking out their memory chip that powers them up, destroy them, cut their wires. The easiest thing for me to do was find a remote. If I couldn't, I'll have to somehow jump on the giant (and I mean GIANT) robots to get their chips and wires cut. I cautiously went out of the bathroom.      If I was looking for a remote, that means someone would be holding it, controlling every movement of the robots... well unless the robots were the self moving robots. I thought and thought and searched and searched but everyone evacuated the building. There was a chance the guy or gal who was controlling the robots left, too. But I didn't give up. As an expert of robots I was determinded to find a way to stop these robots. Most of the robots were still in the building, but some left. Oh no! The robots will crush the city if no one could do anything. It would go to city by city crushing the whole planet. But I wander how they would cross the ocean, unless they are waterproof?   Wait a minute... these are model robots not real robots. They would tremble anytime if they touch water. That gave me the best idea yet. I walked back into the boys' bathroom and saw the janitor's bucket that carried his supplies. I threw the supplies back onto the floor and started pouring water into the bucket and slowly walked outside...again.       As I was slightly daydreaming about what to do, there was I robot standing before me but I didn't see it until I crashed into and the bucket of water fell. Slowly, it crumpled to the floor, dying.       My plan works! Well, how would I get 20 buckets and more out to these robots? Right after the thought there was a robot behind me, pushing. I ran and ran into the manager's office but left the door open. The what used to be a giant robot shrunk and went in with me. I ran around the office, but then suddenly tripped on something. When I looked back at the robot, it just stood there frozen. I smiled and went unconsious into total blackness.        When I woke up in the hospital, the governor was in my room thanking my parents. When they saw that I was awake, they went over to me.       'Thank you so much for saving the state. We would've died if you hadn't stopped them,' said the governor.        Wait a minute I thought. I stopped all the robots? And it hit me as I remembered tripping on something. That something was a switch that apparently stopped the robots. Huh... that was pretty easy. Why didn't I go into the manager's office when I was searching for the remote? Well, that can't be answered and all that matters was that the robots were stopped.         So here I am, in the hospital typing this essay. I can't beleive that this actually happened to me. I, Jacob Hatcher, saved the state, or even the world. I actually never thought that robots could be evil. Now I'm even more interested in robots. I wandered if the manager of the annual Robot Fair did this on purpose. But would would he gain if it was? Well, when I grow up I won't be making any mistakes like that guy.        I can't to go to school on Monday. My social life wasn't that great, but now that I saved everyone, I'm going to be so popular. The governor said that my picture will be in the news tonight also. I guess the news isn't boring after all... Go robots!

436	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	474416	6	11086310	Y	55103	               It was a bright and sunny summer day in New England. Johnnie, the energetic young boy had just gotten a new toy. it was a tiny robot that moved it's arms up and down while yelling, 'SMASH!' Little Johnnie was ecstatic. he played with it all day. even during Little Johnnie's frequent snack breaks the robot was by hi side. He said the robot told him that his name was SMASH! since the only thing the robot said was SMASH!                                      That night Little Johnnie's mother went to check on him before she went to bed. she arrived  in his cozy bedroom and noticed that he was asleep with the robot.she knelt down to kiss his warm cheek when she saw the robots painted eyes blink. Mother was shocked. she sprinted into the living room and sat down next to father. she exclaimed all about  SMASH.                     On that particular day Mother did not want to stay home alone because of what happened that night. So she went on a shopping spree. Mother got little Johnnie some new toys. To try to could get rid of SMASH. None of them worked.                     The  encounters with SMASH have getting weirder and weirder. like one time Mother spotted a SMASH like shadow turning a corner with no other shadow near. another she heard plastic footsteps in the night. every time she has to question herself if she is going crazy or not.                                       The next day it was raining out. Mother was very nervous. she was going to be trapped in the house with Little Johnnie and his toy. It is around nine o'clock and Little Johnnie is still sleeping. Mother hears 'SMASH' and quickly runs into Little Johnnie's room. he is not there. SMASH is just sitting there yelling is distinct word. all of a sudden she hears 'SMASH' again but closer. 'Johnnie?' she turned around and every thing got black. later that evening  father got home. he searched the whole entire home but no none was there. He hears 'SMASH' and turns around with joy hoping to see Little Johnnie, but every thing around him got black and never changed. No body knows what happened to the family of three and no body was going to find out if SMASH could help it.

I was amazed at the ingenuity, so I, unfortunately, missed the headlights lighting up like the robot had just opened it's eyes for the first time. Then the black leather steering wheel swerved, and the car jolted to the right, and sped up to 95 mph. I cowered in my seat, watching the cacti flash by, this was not the way to home, not even close. I caught a glimpse of the full moon, and I remember thinking to myself,  Is this the last time I see that?         I must have fallen asleep sometime because I was gently lifted to consciousness when the Google car slowed to a stop. I struggled to get out of my seat, and when I finally did, I gasped, and a stray question wandered into my head, How many Google cars did those scientists make?, because infront of me, lay a crater filled with Google cars, about ten thousand of them, and all of them turned and seemed to stare directly at my car.          Through the windshields of some of the cars, I saw blank faces staring back at me. On eman was smashing the windows with his fists, and then I remembered, there waws a tool in the glove box on the passengers side. I reach over, and grip the handle to the glovebox, and pull. The catch releases and the tool falls to the ground. Then the car starts moving. I franticly unbuckle my seat belt, and crawl to the passenger side, and grope for the tool. I feel the leather handle in my palm, and turn so I can reach the window. I, Hugh T. Jacobs, just tapped the window first, and then smashed against the glass, and then I felt like an overprotective imbecile, I had paid for the upgrade in the Google car, which included bulletproof glass.            So I was in a robotic car, with no means of getting out. I guess the people were right about a robot apacolypse.

I put the wrong formula in the Gemini-Scout. Later that day I checked on the Gemini-Scout and it made a replica of it. He was the same but he could do much more. It could talk, drive, climb and do everything! I called the owner of the lab to tell him that i made a new robot! I called it the GSR-211(Gemini-Scout Replica). My owner was very impressed by my work he gave me Co-Owner of the company!             Next day I tested the GSR-211 it worked like a beauty! Scholastic News called me and said they wanted my robot in there magazine.They wanted me in New Hampshire right away. When I got there a meet up with the owner of Schoolastic and 4 kid reporters. They interviemwed me and they took a picture of me and my robot.

For this story is about a simple young 12yr old girl named Elizabeth, A.K.A Lizz or Lizzy, who comes across a abandoned wherehouse and finds a rusty old robot, then sudenlly begins her adventure.           I sheild my eyes with my hand as the sun peered into me.  I heavily picked my head up and looked slowly where I was.  I was in my room.  I remembered what was going on, It was a sunday morning during the weekend.  I qiuckly put my clothes on, tip-toed through the hallway and left.  I knew my mom and dad were aware where I was, and that was at the park near the shady tree.           As I walked to it I heard my friend called after me 'Hey Lizz!',Lisa called out, when she was calling out I saw my other friends behind her Brian, Cloe, Steve, Lissa, and of course me.  We hanged out all day talking and playing.  However, it was time to go, and as we walked to our homes Brian said 'Are you going to the carnival next week?', I shruged, 'I thought it was next month.'  'No', Steve said,'it's next week I heard about it'. I said my goodbyes and walked the rest of the time.           Sudenlly my peacful walk came to an end when a old wherehouse caught my eye.  my curiosity begged me to look in, so I did.  When I went in it was all old and dusty with spiderwebs, since I wasn't focusing on the wherehouse my whole body slamed to the gound!  'Ow!' I yellped, I quickly turned my head around and to notice a large old rusty body of metal.  'What is this, looks like some kind of robot?'  I examined it closely and it said 'Pyro', 'Pyro, your name is Pyro?'  I pushed the power button, surprised and shocked, I jerked away because everything turned on.  'Hello', it said in a normal yet electronic voice, 'My name is Pyro what is yours?'           I looked both ways so no one was looking, 'Um...my name is Elizabeth, but you can call me Lizz', 'Ok' it said.  I looked at my wrist 'Oh my gosh it's almost dinnertime!', I exclaimed, 'Sorry but...uh...I need to go, stay here Ok?'  'Yes', he said.  I said my 'seeya laters' and left, as I got home my mom exclaimed 'Where were you!?'  'I was at the...', I tried thinking of a way to explain myself, 'the park' 'The park?  So late at this hour?', 'Yep', I said and quickly ran up to my room.  Next morning, when we got out of class, I couldn't stop thinking about Pyro all day when sudenlly...'So you commi'n with us Lizz?'  I smiled big and shyly and said 'Sorry but I have something important to do', then I walked away to Pyro. 	MD PRP VB WP TO VB IN DT NN VBZ VBN TO VB .

When he was finished, he turned it on it was 4 feet tall, it could carryup to 500 pounds it worked up till 20 hours. It could also,reach high places you can't reach beacuse it had an elastic arm that could strech to 50 feet long. It had a cabnet for a bodyso it could put food,water and other supplies. It coul remind you and help you with your homework or your kids homework. the Rex-3000 could also do your gardening for you.

The Gemini-Scout  robot  is a remote-controlled robot that searches-and-rescues work in mines under the ground . The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns,and it can even roll through water. that robot is small,but it is strong. Gemini-scout robot can carries food,water,and other supplies.It can even drag hurt people to safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                The Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job - it climbs into  volcanoes to gather information for scientists.Like a spider,this robot has eight legs.This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano.It is also built to survive very high heat.When a volcano is too dangerous for scientist to enter,Dante goes instead.         Mr. Gower is a robot that works on hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients.Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels.The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed.         Agribot is a robot that picks up fruit. It might pick berries, oranges,grapes,or apples.Agribots are not yet widely used,but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do.Because picking  a strawberry is different than picking an apple,agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks. Others are able to move around on their own.In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries.This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.

It's good that we have robots but,the question is will we be lazy?Most people say we will have flying cars in the future,well not really. It's based on technology weather the  world wants flying cars&ldquo;I don't&rdquo;. Do we want flying cars or cars that can dive by thier selvs? no now that is spooky.            It's nice to have a littole helper but, we don't need alot what if they turn on us the ones that we created will wipe out our human population and it will all be our fult cause people wanted to be lazy.&ldquo;Let me tell you a littole story&rdquo;.My dad was an iventor he was the greatest iventor of all . He ivented a lot of  stuff like robot dogs,computerT.V,appleI pads,back in 2003 I remember like it was yesterday He became famous and one day he was working on a new invention,when he pressed the botton on the robot evreything had frozen the time had stoped he went out side every littole crum , cresent,food had stoped . He made a time machine He was so happy.  He also was the first iventor to make one he ran back in the house to press the botton over and over and over again he was so happy. He kept on working on it he never told anyone about his ivention .The next day somting was rong he had frozen his self  by acident he could not move for 25 days and 25 nights he had benn laying there starving . I rushed in and I saw him laying there I tride to figure out what did he press finaly I got it. I turned the nozzel and he came un frozen the first thing i did was give him somthing to eat and drink .                Technology can be deadly and life saving you chose robots or life  	IN DT NN POS NN VBP VBN NNS TO VB JJ VB , CC PRP VBP IN DT NN MD VB TO VB NN IN PRP VBP JJ MD RB VB VBG RP IN DT NNS VBP VBG DT DT NN .

The Gemini-scout does search-and-rescue work. This robot has a thermal camera to help it find miners. The thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things. The Gemini-scout can help hurt people from mines and bring them to safety. When the robot looks in the mines it carries food, water, and other useful supplies.This robot is less that two feet tall and has wheels. It is a small robot but it is strong. It can go up and down stairs and it can make tight turns. It is water-proof so it can roll in water and not do anything to it. The Gemini-scout collects information. It tests the air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe.                     Mr.Gower is another type of robot, but instead of help hut people from mines this robot helps doctors and nurses bring medicines to patients. Mr.Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The body of the robot is a bunch of stacked locked drawers that store medicine.Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers of the robot when the medicine is needed for the patients.

I cant believe i did it i created a robot but even though it wasn`t alive it was still pretty cool. It was a smalll little robot but it had so many cool gadgets and qualities. My robot is purple camofluage, bullet proof , can tow over 500 pounds, fire proof, water proof,and its name is Fluffy.       One day I was out and with my robot and it was raining so i had to get my robot inside fast. I was almost home when my robot got struck by lighting. I thought it was destroyed but then i saw it move and i backed away. 'Uhhhh. What happened?' Right then i freaked out it talked, it was alive, it could move on its own. It came up to me and greeted me and said that we should continue on like nothing happened but i couldnt. I had to bring it to school.       The next day we were walking to school and as usual my bully walks up to me. She said some really mean stuff about me but then i ran away. Later that day Fluffy asked me who that kid was and of course i told it that the kid was my bully. Fluffy broke out and told me that it was unexceptable that i was getting bullyed. It said that we had to do something about it to stop it before she it would start getting physical.       The next day after Fluffy cleaned my room we walked to school again. The bully was there as usual,but this time she said that she wants to meet at the old mountain resort cave after school.   After school that day i went to the meeting spot and soon after i arived she came and pushed me into the cave. Then trap me in there by making rocks fall on the entrance.       About five minutes after that i heard Fluffy`s voice it said that she was working on removing rocks to get me out. I started moing rocks to and ended up making water spill out a diffrent part of the cave.    I told Fluffy to hurry or i would drown and after i said that i could her Fluffy moving several rocks at a time.       Right before the water level hit my neck all the water drained out. I saw Fluffy she then was coming to get me out. Fluffy ended up draging me all the way to my house and I thanked her for saving my life.       Robots are helpful in many was like Fluffy. She saved my life and i couldnt thank her enough.

The next day he went to school he brought his robot oh yeah his name is Bob and the robots name is Bill. 'Hey pip squeak how's your little robot coming along.', asked John              'Oh hey John he's done he's finaly done.', replied Bob              'Oh is he well then let me see him if he realy is done.', questioned John.              'Ok fallow me.', commanded Bob. They walked out of school and to the bushes 'here he is'              The robot towered over them like a sky scraper 'Woooow does it have rocket boots? Can we go to mars with it? Does it have a coffe maker? Does have butter maker?'              'Shhhhh young one at as everything you asked and more.'              'Can it make toast.'              'Yes it can make toast.' after that was settled they climbed on the robot put space suites on and flew to mars they only reason it was possible was that the robot had gallons and gallons of fuel only getting refueled by the gallons of gas Bob brought with him.               When they landed on mars they decided to live there forever so they did umtill they ran out of oxygen and died. And slept happily ever after.

He was a worldwide commercial selling toy. This one though, was not like the others. Someone, put a robot brain in Roboy so that he could control himself.         'Where am I?' Roboy asked.         'Your in robot prision,' a sheriff said, 'We made this prision last night just for you.'         'But I am a good robot though. I can help save people in mines. I can also test for bad air in the mines too before the miners go down. I can't be harmed from explosions or toxic air that humans can't surivive in.'         'Really, is that so?'         'Yes,' Roboy replied, 'If you let me out I will show you how helpful I can be.'         'Okay, we will let you out when someone needs to be saved in the mines,' The sherriff  said.                  'Get up Roboy. You are about to have your first mission,' The sheriff yelled to roboy, 'There was an explosion in the mines just south of town. There were 30 miners down there! Hurry up so we can save them!'          'Okay, I'm ready. Let's move,' Roboy said as he flew up into the sky with the sheriff on his back.                   Roby flew into the mines. He saw all the miners trapped by a huge rock. The miners didn't look to good. Most of them were not moving. For the ones that were moving though started shouting, 'Help! Save us!' Roboy knew he had to act fast or else they were all going to die. He thought how he could move the bolder. Then he had it, he had to break the bolder apart by using his super strength in his legs.                   Crack! The rock broke open and Roboy went and grabbed all the humans. He told the alive people to stay there and help put the unconscious ones on his back. They did that and Roboy flew up to the surface and gave all the people to the medical doctors at the scene. After that Roboy rushed down to the miners still in the mine and got them out too.                  'Roboy wake up,' The sheriff said, 'You saved everyone, all the miners will be okay. You did it. For your amazing act of bravery you are released from the prision. The town also bought you a house too. There is a catch though, you still have to test the air in the mines and save the people in them too.'          'It's a deal,' Roboy replied.              Roboy ended up to be a robot cop. He saved people in the mines for 30 more years. When he was 98 years old he passed away. The town had a funeral for Roboy. Nobody will ever forget Roboy.          	NNP JJ .

That shock gave me a mind of my own I then drew a circle with a accidental bump and I was instantly fired. I was then forced onto the street and met a skinny hobo who lived on a couch. he instantly attacked me and I escaped with no right hand. 'noooooooo!' bob screamed now ill never get my job back. bob then roamed for a job I saw a nice small pizza place with a sign that wrote HELP WANTED person or persons who can mop floors.       Bob then went and applied for the job and was instantly hired. bob then bought a 8x8 inch apartment. one day after hours bob saw the hobo who had stolen his hand bob instantly jumped to hiss feet to pursuit the hobo. He found him in a alley eating something metal 'MY HAND! the hobo then attacked bob and instantly bit a part of bobs hipbone of and bob instantly fell to the ground and crawled to safety 'ill never be happy' '100010111100110000010-11001010-101 error  error  shutting down...

Then bob opened his eyes dazed to a bush and tree and.he  instantly stood up and cut down the tree with his axe for a hand, where the missing hand was. Bob took this as an oppurtunity and has hired to cut lumber he was great at it, But then accidently knocked a tree onto a school. he was then sued for breaking school property and his punishment was 47 years as a janator. he was most known to pull fire alarms when kids where in math class so he was a hero. he is still a janator and everyone loves him from saving them from math class.

She finally began to go and look where the strange voice was coming from. 'Hello, my name is S-Bot' Meg heard as she was nearing the basement door. Then she heard it again, but this time it was louder. Finally, she saw this little thing buzzing around in the air. This kind of robot is called a Gemini-Scout, and they are used for rescue work. They are made for flying into wrecked buildings or mines to find lost or hurt workers or people and have them use the Gemini-Scout's active radio to communicate with the rescue team to find where the people are located. These are very helpful robots.         The next day, Meg went into work with her Dad. She saw something very weird there. It was a cabnate rolling around on its own! Meg went to go ask her dad what this mysterious cabnate was. He said it was a Google-Car, and it was a cabnate that carried the medisin to the doctors and nurses. This robot is also very useful.         Both the Goggle-Car and the Gemini-Scout are very useful robots. In some cases, they can save peoples lives.

They had a robot for cooking, one for yard work, one for cleaning the house. They have a robot for everything. No one had a Job, kids didn't play sports,they had a exercising robot to help them with they fitness, and everyone had more than enough money,of course robots mad legal money.but no one in wellingsberg knew what was going to happen.     One day when all the people were sleeping, all the robots heeled a secret meeting. They were getting angry with the humans, there leader(a computer) sayed'We are all tiered of doing all the humans work,so lets make them regret what they have done to us.' so they made a plane that night. Then the clock showed 6:00,time to do the plane.       In the morning the the robots were out on the street reedy to ambush the people inside there houses. The people were looking for they robots and they looked out side, when they did, the robots charge   at them. They messed up the peoples yards,houses they chanted'Were done with being number one.' over and over and over. Then they leafed Wellingsberg.       The humans fixed there town and changed in to a town that is indpendent. Now they don't need a robot to do everything for them, now they do every thing for them selves.

But little did he know he was going to save the world.           Zac whent to school at Ada vista elementary school and had lots of friends, one day he wanted to become a millionare, and buy a maclaren p1. when he reached 6th grade it was stesing for him, but he got trough and went on to seventh grade. When he finished high school he went to coolage at michigan to play soccer for there team. They had a great season and they acctualy one the NCAA turnament and where ranked #1 in the country. In school at Michigan Zac studied to be a sintist or a pedeatrishion. At the end of his collage years he decided to be a pedeatrision. And he worked in colorado (denver to be more specific) and launched his career.           After 2 years working he was 21 years of age and he was already the docters offices main doctor. But one day Zac baught a maclaren P1 like he had always wanted. But one day when he was at work something happend. North Korea had made a bomb and had dropped it on Denver, the bomb was supposed to turn everything that was a machine alive. the bomb dropped aczacty on Zacs car and it came alive. The car turned into what looked like iorn man, but was about 19 ft taller than iorn man. The car had huge guns on the top, and a mouth that was as big as a human. The thing when strait toward the office and blew up half of it. Zac was on the half that didnt get hit and he noticed that the window was open on his car. Zac lunged at the robot, but the robot was quick and hit him in the side and Zac whent crashing into the side of the office. Zac tried one more time and this time he made it. he looked at the dash of the car and the toutch screen radion had two buttons, one that said self destruct, and one that said attack, well Zac thought that he would push the one that said self destruct, when he hit it a hudge explosion happend and Zac whent flying out of the car. When Zac looked up the car was compleatly gone. Zac had just wasted a million dolers on a car that tried to kill the world.

A robot is used for more than just saving people it is used for you if you need it.Robots shouldnt just work robots shoulg get some time off like real humans. But the inventors can put a alarm in there brains so if they need the they can drive over or fly to where they need them.       I think that the gimi scout is the coolest because it can go    into volcanos and use its mind sence to save humas in q mine.                   The Google car is awsome to because its a car.

It was a beautiful village, with with kids running around playing, birds singing in the trees the sky was always blue in the village. But one day for some reason this one day felt wrong, no one knew why, but they realized something was about to change.           A couple hours later people were screaming everywere, no one knew what was happening until someone looked into the sky. Meteors were falling from the sky no one knew what to do, they all just ran around screaming, people were trying to hide in there houses but they just burned down, every thing there was dying. They couldnt stop it. Soon everything and everyone was destroyed some people ran to safety but others were just not lucky.           Days past in the destroyed village many people came back to recover some of there stuff but nothing lived everything the people owned was lost. But one Boy named Phil thomsom found the most amazing thing in his life, there was a robot over by a destroyed home he went over there to see if it was ok but maybe not it was missing an arm, an eye, three wheeled feet and half its head, maybe not, Phil  felt sad he thought maybe there was one last toy he could play with but he didnt know. Only if it worked he might be a little happy he found a toy, but no.           Phil started to walk away but he heard something, Phil turned around and saw that the robot was moving! It was trying to stand up just like a human would, and it actualy did look like a human! It was completely metal it had for wheels but now it only has one. It had two legs now one arm and the robot was pretty small. It said something and Phil didnt understand it. A couple minutes later it ajusted some weird lever that changed his voice soon as he turned it to english the robot said 'please help me, please'. Phil didnt know what to say but then the robot spoke again it said this world is in danger you need to fix me. Then Phil said how, why, and how is the world in danger. Phil had so many questions but the robot looked like it    was about to die right in front of him so Phil had to do something so he picked him up and took him to his uncle lenny.           Lenny! Lenny! you need to fix this Phil said. Oh wow you found something that survived! Yes and you have to fix him hes still alive, I mean the robot is   alive! He talked to me he said the world was in danger and I need to know what that means he needs to be fixed or well never know whats coming. We need to fix him hes so injured he cant speak. OK OK Lenny said lets take him back to the shop and take a look at him.           Phil I took a look at him and im sorry I couldnt fix him, im sorry. What, hes dead!,   naaaah im just messing with yaah Hes all fixed I found some new parts so I put those on him, and I changed some wires and hes brand new. Great can I see him Phil said of course I ran in the room and checked him out he looked awsome he was painted, he got new screws and every thing he was awsome. He didnt even need batteries to run him. So anyways whats your name little robot. There was a pause 'I dont know' he said I dont know anything. But earlear you said the world was going to end, what was that about Phil said I dont know I was half broken dude The robot said you know you dont really know what your saying when your about to die That true I said.           At the end of this story, Phil and the robot became friends for ever, they always did every thing together, and they never did get mad at eachother or anything. Phil and the robot were the best pair of friends in the whole in tire world. They are the two best people you could ever hang out with, and they well be together until the end of there days.

However there is a slight problem unknown. Jackson is a living robot that can skin and shapeshift. Owen and Newo's dad is a spy being chased down byhighly skilled Japanese agents who happened to create this living creature out of recently murdered spy body parts and a secret machanical device to be unknown that helps Jackson skin and shape shift. During the time         Owen and Newo are staying with their mother who at the time is the only not-spy to know where the lair is. Unfortunately the Japaniese agents know the mothers knowledge about where the dad, Nico is. which is why they created Jackson. the kids went to play with their neighbors when Jackson snuck over to the neighbors house. He skin shifted into the neighbor and dug a hole to burry Owen and Newo.                 Jackson greated them in the driveway with a ball. he asked if they wanted to play catch in the backyard. they were headed to the backyard when Jackson used both of his hands to to cover their mouths then shoved them into the near by and covered them with several pounds of dirt. Sadly Owen and Newo died that evening.               Jackson was the only one to know. Now on the way backto the house Jackson shifted into Nico in his car and pulled up into his owners houses driveway. He walked inside to find Any, Nico's wife come to greet him with a hug when he shot her with a 5 minute sleep dart. in those five he tied her feet and hands together and we she woke up Jackson torchered her until she told him where the spys secret lair was. when he got the information he transportated it to the Japaniese agents. The agents took over the lair days later and used the spys as slaves. Jackson was to be seen several more times by people only as a different body.          The only question now is can Any stop Jackson and the Japaniese from taking over the world     	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBZ DT NN VBN IN PRP$ NN NNS VBP CC CD DT IN NN IN CD NNP RB VBZ DT NN NN NNP NNP VBZ DT NN NN WDT MD VB CC NNP NNP CC NNP POS NN VBZ DT NN VBG VBN RP RB VBN JJ NNS WP VBN TO VB DT NN NN IN IN RB VBN NN NN NNS CC DT NN JJ NN TO VB VBN IN NNS NNP NN CC NN NNP NNP DT NN NNP CC NNP VBP VBG IN PRP$ NN WP IN DT NN VBZ DT JJ JJ TO VB WRB DT JJ NNP NNP DT NNP NNS VBP DT NNS VBP IN WRB DT JJ , NNP NNP WDT VBZ WRB PRP VBD NNP DT NNS VBD TO VB IN PRP$ NNS WRB NNP NN IN TO DT NNS NNP NNP NN VBD IN DT NN CC NN DT NN TO VB NNP CC NNP NNP VBD PRP IN DT NN IN DT NNP PRP VBD IN PRP VBD TO VB NN IN DT NNP PRP VBD VBN TO DT NN WRB NNP VBD DT IN PRP$ NNS TO TO VB PRP$ NNS RB VBD PRP IN DT JJ IN CC VBN PRP IN JJ NNS IN NNP NNP NNP CC NNP VBD IN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ CD TO NNP NNP IN DT NN NN DT NN NNP VBD IN NNP IN PRP$ NN CC VBD RP IN PRP$ NNS NNS NNP NNP VBD NN TO VB DT , NNP POS NN NN TO VB PRP IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD PRP IN DT CD NN NN NNP IN DT CD PRP VBD PRP VBP CC NNS RB CC PRP PRP VBP RP NNP VBD PRP IN PRP VBD PRP WRB DT NNS VBP JJ NNP WRB PRP VBD DT NN PRP VBD PRP TO DT NNP NNP NNP NNS VBD IN DT NN NNS JJ CC VBN DT NNS IN NNP NNP VBD TO VB VBN JJ RBR NNS IN NNS RB IN DT JJ NNP NNP RB NN RB VBZ MD DT VB NNP CC DT NNP IN VBG IN DT NN

Kids would pass it on there way to school and never once would anybody stop to see it . Then one day there was just an ordinary little boy who strolled around the block and he paused for just one moment to look at the suspitious hunk of medel. Something about it made him wonder what it could be. Well sure he could have kicked it like his other classmates but he diced to pick it up and he could not belive his eye's at what he saw. It was the cute'st little thing he had ever saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It was a robot named Ricky. With tiny blue eye's and just a little square with it's little treds. Sudenly another boy walks up but the boy goton his bike and the chace was on. He felt like letting the poor robot go but he could'nt now. Almost home now luckly he was in the lead by just a couple of feet. Then the boy jumped of his bysical and was on his way to saftey.         He had done it at last home sweet home he had thought until the last syep when his mother walked in the room. She stered at the helpless Ricky. The robot made a safe move and huged his mom. And then she said finaly he could keep Ricky. They had become the best of friends by now about a month later. Who new there could be some helpless little box could be a boys best friend. Well anything can happen in this world.

Just need one final touch. i skrewed in the last bolt and my robot was about to be done. I flicked the switch and nothing happened. I was frustrated. I went to bed and tried to fall asleep. I didn't even bother to change into my pj's. That night i couldn't fall asleep because I couldn't stop thinking about how I couldn't get women bot 3000 to work. So then I decided to go down stairs and try to see what went wrong with women bot. When I reached to bottom of the stairs I saw Women bot alive and cleaning the room. I was very excited when I saw women bot cleaning. So I turned off women bot and went to bed. The next mourning I ran down stairs to see women bot. I turned her on and rushed her to the car. I made her so she can drive, clean, play, and do my homework. So I put her in the car and turned the car on. Women bot was driving perfectly. I was really happy, We drove to the mall and shopped for about two hours. When we came home I put her at my desk to see if she could do my homework. Women bot rushed through it really fast. I checked it to make sure she did nothing wrong. We started playing board games till we dropped. Me and Women bot where best friend forever. 	NNS VBP CD JJ .

It could turn into any car you wanted,it could get you food and any drink you wanted. But they only bad thing is, I built the robot but it couldn't do any of the things I said it could do I just imagined it.               Until OLIVER woke up the next morning and realized that my robot from downstairs was gone. So sat on my bed to think about where the robot had gone. Until OLIVER saw something shinny out his window. Oliver realized it was robot 2234567899$$$$$$. The one that he's was looking for so I bolted out of the house too see if it was actually 2234567899$$$$$$. When I realized 2234567899$$$$$$ was alive I said hello to 2234567889$$$$$$. And he said hello back I didn't put any speaking device on him sweetness. I said to 2234567899$$$$$$ turn into a PORSCHE and the robot did. I took 22345678899$$$$$$ for a spin, they only bad thing that happened to me was I got arrested for not having a parent to drive me to where I wanted to go. But look on the bright side I only spent one day in jail.       I hope I see that robot again so that I can drive in it one more time.

I said go back to sleep. He said no! I said fine as I walked out of my room.             The next morning my robot was in a better mood. My wonderful mom was making  us eggs and sausage.              After breakfast we went outside. My robot suggested we play freeze tag with our neighbors.When my neighbors came outside we went to the end of the couldasack. I was it first. I quickly tagged everybody except for my robot. He made the first move and I tagged him as I dove.               My robot was it next he was wheeling over when he shot out a freeze shock and hit Cam. (Cam is our neighbor). I yelled TIME OUT! Drew what are you doing? (Drew is my robot). He said playing freeze tag. I said not litterly. We made a fire to unfreeze Cam. When we finished they went home and didnt come back out.                During lunch me and Drew went to the park for a picknick. We asked people to play and they all said no we dont want to get frozen. I shook my head in disbeilife. How could Cam do that to us? He was my best friend until he told everyone to not play with us because my robot didnt know what we ment by freeze tag.                   The next morning I told my robot to stay in side.When i went to go get Cam thought he forgave me but when I rang the doorbell he said sure. He invited highschoolers to play to. When they showed up I was it becuase of what happened yesterday. As soon as we started i got hit by Cam I got up and got knocked down again this time from a highschooler. Then they all stared to beat me up. When the left my robot came outside and said lets get them! He said hop om he turned on his jetpack and flew and froze Cam and all the highschoolers.

L-MINI stand for Lucas mini, it was the exact replica of the world famous Lucas Ohlmann, L-MINI could do everything he could cook bacon for people he could do peoples homework, he can even make you food and help people who are trapped, L-MINI has super speed/strength for maximum protection.              One time a child was trapped in a fire and L-MINI with all his speed with a flash saved the child, he was very ones hero and he still is,I love L-MINI i have one myself, he makes me fresh donuts in the morning with a perfect temperature cup of hot cocoa with marshmallows every morning he even save my life, I dont know what I would do without him              this functional robot can help you develop alot of instrest in things, the L-MINI can help you film edits while you are skiing or help you practice volley ball or some sport that you play. im reccomending L-MINI to evryone.

'Jenna' she called.  Kennedy was a huge fan of robots which weren't really my thing to talk about people with! She came over to me and said ' I am going to thing robot show to pick out a robot and I was just wondering if you would come with me......' ' sure...' I said and I kinda felt bad because I kinda said it meanly! ' Its at ten o'clock tomorrow morning be at my house nine thirty sharp she said aggressively'. 'Okay' I mumbled and went into my house.....                       The next morning I was up bright and early getting ready for this Robot Show or in the cities case it was called: 'ROBOTS THE GREATEST INVENTIONS ( ten o'clock Saturday morning at convention center come clam your robot now.)'!! I crossed the street at nine twenty eight so she wouldn't get mad! I slightly knocked on the front door.... Kennedy swung it open with such power it was like a giant ripping through something !! 'HELLO! i am so thrilled that you could come we have to get moving right away I have to get the perfect robot!!' she yelled. I felt like I had already regretted saying yes! We hopped in her car and the she just started listing all different kinds of robots like: a robot that saved people in mines, one that was a medicine cabinet, another that was one that played hockey there was so many different kinds I couldn't keep them all strait. Then the car went THUD we were there.........                  The convention center wan a huge circular glass building rocketing in to the sky. It was probabley the tallest building in the city and I mean that. Kennedy who was next to me was screaming at the top of her lungs 'I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!' and she would not stop!! We quickly went in and sauntered around for a bit and then Kennedy screamed ' ITS THE PERFECT ONE KENNEDY THE PERFECT SIZE SHAPE AND COLOR I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!'  I murmured back to her  (remember I'm not a robot person but this was pretty amazing now I saw why she wanted me to come!) ' Its perfect you should buy it.') she said back ' I'M SO GLAD THAT THEY AREN'T ALL LIKE GEMINI-SCOUT LIKE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE!' She as fast as she could bolted to the register with the robots special number it had. The man at the register said sternly ' This is a very special robot don't be surprised if......' he trailed off and rung it up for Kennedy. and after what he said it got me thinking whats so special about this thing. It was just on average probabley 4 feet a greyish-amythist color, very stern looking mouth but dazzling lizard green eyes.... I didn't know what was so special about this thing.                  When we got back to Kennedy's house we raced inside and turned it on it came with this extra weird key that didn't have a key hole but I thought this might be whats so great about it so when Kennedy was admiring her I searced with the key tightly wrapped up in my left hand. Soon enough while looking at the back of it and I found this odd compartment and I slipped the key in that then out of nowhere the robot just started walking around and starting to talk to us it didn't even have batteries in it the it said in its robotic voice ' Greetings I am Tinex your new, fresh and alive robot and we have to go fast or I  will turn off!!!!'. I was so flipped out I felt like this was Frosty The Snowman robot style!! Then I zoned back in and heard Kennedy say ' WHERE DO WE HAVE TO GO TINEX I DON'T WANT YOU TO TURN OFF!' The he replied 'We must turn this key into the clerk who helped you buy me and if he dosnt have this in the next 2 hours he will turn into and robot virus that will shut all robots down we must go now!!!!!!!!!!                      The after about thirty seconds we were back at the convention center so fast because of Tinex's super speedy robot wheels. We raced in and found the clerk as soon as possible he was at the same spot and we had been searching for an hour already that we only  had one hour to complete our task!!! As soon as we found him we had to wait 50 minutes to get up to the front of the line and then we screamed to him in unison ' TAKE THIS KEY OR ALL ROBOTS WILL BE GONE FOREVER!!!!!!'. We only had about 2 minutes left to leave the building and then he grabbed the key put it in his hand and we were so ecstatic so we scramed the building and went to go to celebrate with our new found robot friend!!!                  When we all got back we celebrated and talked for hours and then he showed us all his features but finally he said I'm going to turn off for now but when you want me on just say Tinex on and I will be right by your side. And then I said 'I must go now but I will come visit'. The I said my goodbyes and went home!                   While I was walkies a crossed the street to go home I realized how much fun I had today! I learned so much and now I may actually like robots and be able to talk to Kennedy more. I was ecstatic about my new found friends and i am so glad that I said yes to Kennedy to go to the show I will never forget it!!!!!!!

My family had a farming hobby , so I wanted to do something special for them for all they've done for me. It took me a while to get an idea, but I finally found a good one. If I'm an engineer, I can just make them a farming robot, can't I, I thought. So I did. Well, at least I tried. I started building tons of robots in all different shapes and sizes, but none of them seemed to be right. Some had giant arms. Others had really tiny hands. I tried to make one with both, but it didn't turn out well at all. What would farming robots do anyway? Wouldn't they just grow and pick stuff? I paused and thought about it. Not only do they pick things, but my family might have them do other things too!            I went to visit my family to find out what they might do if they had a robot. They told me things like having the strawberries checked before harvesting, sensing if a plant is too dry or needs water, or even knowing if the fruit is ripe or not. I never even thought of any of that! Of course I've never actually worked on a farm before. Then I had an idea. I went back to my lab and started working for a long time. I realized not all things were picked the same way. When I was finally finished, I thought of going for a test run. It would be useless to them if it didn't work. I started to load my truck when I realized something. What would I even test it on? It's not like I have a farm! Yes, that was a good question. They're the only ones I know who actually own one. What was I to do, if I had nothing to test on? Surely I couldn't test it out on my family's farm. There were two things wrong with that. One, it would ruin the surprise. More importantly, it might ruin their crops. It was quite the problem. But that was when I had my other idea. I have a backyard myself! So why not just use that? Yes! I could buy the seeds and just plant them. And that's just what I did.            I took out the first activated robot. I placed it in front of the plant and stepped back to watch. Nothing happened. I waited a bit longer. Nothing. I kept on trying for about two weeks and did nothing else. I tried restarting it, taking it apart and starting over, anything I could possibly do. However, nothing happened. How extremely disappointing!! And I was getting ready to give it to my family as a marvelous gift that they deserved. Angrily, I threw the robot out on the street, stormed back inside and slammed the door shut.            Before I got far, I heard a knocking on the door. I went to go open it, but saw no one. I closed it and the knocking started again! I was getting irritated. I opened the door and felt a tugging at my pants. But when I looked down, there was not a person, but instead a little robot! It looked at me for a moment, and just rolled on inside my house. For a moment I thought I'd gone mad!! Just a figment of my imagination. But this little machine was far too real. I followed it outside where it went into my backyard. It stood still for a moment, and started watering the plant! Why, this robot had come alive! I starred at it pondering for a while, then it clicked. I could still give it to my family as a gift!! I picked up the little machine, rushed to the car, and went to my parents house.            When I arrived, they were sitting on the porch. My mother was knitting for my nephew, and my father was sleeping. Nothing changed, I thought. I leaped across the yard and shouted joyously,' Mother!! Father!! I have extravagant news!! Come quick!!' They looked at me like I was insane. But then they saw my little living invention. I told them about my time building him. They were absolutely delighted to hear my odd story. 'Why, isn't he just wonderful?' exclaimed my mother proudly. I visited them for a month just in case any problems happened, but they seemed just fine! It seemed the robot liked them, and they liked him. After a while, they gave him  name. 'What is it?' I asked curiously. 'Agribot.'

Eve allwayes came when eve was called by her owner she came right away she was like a maid. Eve washed dishes and cleaned and all of that good stuff but she was under her owng people ers controle.       One day the owners family came over they were making eve do a lot of things at one time. it was really hard for eve to keep up with all of there orders. At a moment eve was going to overload eve went insane she was doing all the rong stuff. Eve was giving the rong orders to the rong people spilling milkshakes on womens clothing droping food on people it was crazy.       Thats when eve went in destruct mode its like when she becomes her own person eve left her owner she went around people annoying them calling them names just basically being a bully. she was pulling little girls poney tales tripping people when they walked pass she was just out of it eve spottid her owner she ran as fast as she could but she could not out run her owner her owner tackled her he tried to power her off but eve was fighting back she was punching and kicking scratching and biting slaping and pinching but the owner wouldnt stop fightin the owner did the same exact thing he reached over eve to push the power off butten he finally reached it and shutted her off. power offf mode the robot said the owner took her back home and put her in charge mode eve learned her lesson. Eve never did that ever again and the owner and eve lived happily ever after.   and that was the time eve went into distruct mode.

One day he was really bored sleeping with his teddy bear Mr. Teddy, he decided to make a robot that can do anything you can name dancing, transform to different things, cook, clean, play sports, and other things. So he finish building the robot and started to admire it and cried  a little because it was so beautiful and big.              Once he was done (which took him almost two hours) he turned on the robot and the robot was beginning to rise up and the robot put his arm out then all of a sudden he started to do the disco so Maxwell started to do it too. Then they got right to business they pranked a bunch of elders and high schoolers and played bowling in the mansion that Maxwell owned. Then one night Maxwell was asleep with Mr.Teddy in his bed and didn't noticed that the robot was missing! Once Maxwell figured it out he started to look everywhere in the mansion and his other one right next to it.                 The robot was walking around the mall and doing fun stuff, he then turned into a regular teenage boy. The only reason he left that place is because his master didn't let him go anywhere by himself and had to be locked up but what his master didn't know was that Maxwell gave him super strength to break anything if he felt threaten and yes he did being locked up in a cage like a criminal and he wanted real friends not friends that made him. He went to the pool and jumped in he didn't know that he was still a robot so when he jumped in he got electrocuted and blew up. He had a tag around his ankle sort of like a dog tag and the police called Maxwell and made him take away but he was arrested for making a robot without permission from the government.

She was a robot, she came to earth to help us with the earth. Other said that she came to explore the volcanoes around the world. People didn't now she was a robot in-till it came on the news.            They said she is a robot of everything like a Gemini-scout that is they are friendly to everybody, they can even drag or help hurt people to safety. The second one is Dante 2 the robot is interested in a job, it climbs into volcanoes to gather information  for scientists.  The other one is MR.GROWER that robot that works in the hospitals helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. The last one is AGRIBOTS that one picks fruit. It picks berries, oranges, grapes, or apples.                         That is how people doesn't get scared of the girl because the little girl doesn't do harm. The next thing is that you should not be scared of others new stuff you see because maybe you could find out its nice.

Some can do search and rescue missions do save people from mines. Some collect research in volcanoes that are too hot for scientist to explore. Some pick fruit of of the trees for farmers. Others play animal parts in movies. Lets sea how they do it.                           The Gemini Scout is a robot  that does mine search and rescue missions. It is less that two feet tall. It may be a small robot, but it is strong. The robot always carries food, water, and other supplies. It also drags hurt people to safety.          The Gemini also collects information. It checks the air for gasses and tells the miners were the air is safe. It has a thermal camera to help find miners. A thermal  When the robot finds a trapped miner, the miner can use its two-way radio to talk to the rescue team.         The Dante 2's job is gathering information inside volcanoes that are too hot for scientists. The robot has eight legs, like a spider. This helps it climb up steep hills of the volcanoes. It is built to survive high heat.         The robot looks for  vents, in a crater. The robot then collects information about the gasses coming out of the vents. Dante 2 is changing science so the scientist could know more about the volcanoes.          Mr. Gower is a robot that works in a hospital, helping the doctors, and nurses. It looks like a cabinet on wheels because of the medicine storage.The robot can also lift up to 500 pounds. After charging for two hours he can go 12 hours non-stopping. He can also talk too.          An agribot in a robot that picks fruit. Agribots come in different shapes and sizes so they can pick different fruits. They can tell when a berry is ripe and when a plant needs watering.          A robot called HRP-4c can even sing and dance. Robots are made to imitate and copy what animals. Other robots are made to live with animals. Some robots are animals for people who don't want to buy food and take them outside.        There is also a robotic car that can drive its self. The car is legal to drive in Nevada.  It adgust the speed. It helps save lives because it doesn't get distracted.        That is why robots are awesome         	NNP PRP RB VBN WP NNS MD VB .

The robots help the nurse's at the hospital. One day that a very sick patient . Mr.Gower (the robot that works in the hospital with the rest of nurse) need to get the right kind of ingredient to give to the patient. He asked his friends for help. Gemini helped by bring the patient to safety for a burning house Dante 2 helped by getting the ingredient for the patient he went into the volcano and got a special flower . Agribots helped by getting the fruit. Google car drove them to the hospital. They mixed the ingredients together. They were able to safe the patient.                   The main characters in the story were Mr.gower ,Gemini ,Dante 2 , Agribots, and google car.in the story Mr. Gower was really nice ,brave, and courageous . Mr.Gower was nice because if he was me he would have not saved the patient ,he show he was brave because he was able to save the patient , and he showed he was courageous because he saved the patient from passing away. Gemini was helpful,true friend , and nice. He showed he was helpful by helping out his friend when his friend needed it ,he showed he was a true friend because he helped so he brought the patient in, and he was really nice because someone else would have not helped. Dante 2 was really brave . He showed he was brave when he went into the volcanoes to get the special flower. Agribots was very nice when he gave them fruit. Google car was nice because he when to go drop of the stuff.             The setting take place in a hospital when Mr.gower need to get special stuff for the patient .another place were story take place is the volcanoes were dante2 got the special flower for the patient . With safer the patient so much.                      If the robots never had helped his friend that patient would have die. The good thing is that they worked together and were able to help out and save that patient                      At the end of the story  everyone was so happy because they worked together a saved a live . Together any thing is possiblein this    story. That  why the theme in the story is if you work together anything is possible .

Grandma , aunt Allie , and all my cousins had gathered at my house for my 10 birthday celebration . Turning 10 was going to be great , all my friends had their parties months ago and now it was my time to shine . 'Alright now lets open presents !' My mother exclaimed in excitement .      First present was from grandma , it was the secret diary I had been begging for for months ! I was so excited because now my brothers couldn't get into it , it had a lock ! Next present was from aunt Allie , I slowly tore open the yellow package it was hidden in . It was a dress with pink and purple sparkles ! I jumped out of my seat and ran to give her a gigantic hug ! My cousin handed me a purple box from all my crazy cousins . I ripped it open and found that it was shoes to match my beautiful dress ! ' You guys all know me to well, !'I told them in excitement . the last present was from my mom and dad , it was wrapped in yellow wrapping paper with a perfect pink bow ! I anxiously tore open the paper , the tape was sticking to my hand ! Finally the moment I had patiently been waiting for . It was a robot that could talk , sing , dance , clean  , work , and all it needed was 10 tripple a batteries ! ' Oh mom , thank you so much , I love it !'       I ripped all the unnecessasary wrapping it was smuthered in off , and ran upstairs to grap the batteries ! When i got downstairs Lucy my robot was sitting on the counter just waiting to be played with . I handed the batteries to mom and she carefully put them in . Grandma , auntie , and all the cousins had to go but now i got to play with my new toy ! I set the robot on the ground and pressed on ,  nothing was happening . ' Go Lucy , run ! ' She didn't move one bit , ' listen to me Lucy , go ! ' Mom and dad tried to figure out what was wrong , but nothing was . ' It must be broken !' Dad told me in dissapointment . I ran upstairs and hopped on my bed very frustrated that my birthday present wasn't even working. Well I was just going to have to deal with it , atleast I had a dress , shoes , and a diary ! Dad set Lucy under my bed just in case she was going to work again .        At school i had nothing cool to show all my friends fro my birthday . 'What did you get for your birthday ?' My bestfriend Sally asked . 'Well my mom and dad bought me a robot that can do so many really cool things , but it doesn't work ! ' Everybody at school thought I wasn't cool now because I didn't have that stupid robot . I cried all the way home and ran up to my bed and weeped into my pillows . This was the worst birthday known to man ! Suddenly I heard a little sound coming from the ground . ' Mary had a little lamb , little lamb , little lamb , Mary had a little lamb and its fleece was white as snow ! ' I heard faintly from down there . I jumped of my bed to find that Lucy actually did work ! I yelled to my mom and dad ' Get up here Lucy actually works ! ' It was a miracle I finally got to play with Lucy ! I guess my 10th birthday wasn't so bad after all . 	NNP NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP , JJ , CC VBD PRP VBP RP IN PRP$ JJ NN TO VB PRP$ NN NNS .

This was all my fault. ever since Dante 2 and Gemini-Scout came out, I wanted to do something great. Not something that destroys half of the human race within a week. This is how it all began.      The year was 2017, I'm on my way to work at the lab, without a care in the world. I already had the blueprints for my creation. It was already half-built, I just needed to upgrade the wiring circuit. The robot's name was IPaCU, Inelegance Provider and Cooperation Unit. It was meant for human cooperation testing in the study of survival. This thing looked like a worm popping out of the ceiling with wires coming out of it and a main control core,it had back-up 'legs' in case of a malfunction where it needed to drop off the ceiling.       When I arrived, they had already started programing it with inelegance of survival.'So how far have we gotten?' I immediately ask.'Not far' a scientist replies. 'She hasn't woken up yet, we don't have enough power sources.' 'Any back-up sources?' I reply, 'No, none left.' 'Three weeks, we have been in this same spot for three weeks!' I'm starting to yell. 'Do you have any idea how frustrating this is!? I have been working on this for four years, four years! And Where are we? Nowhere!' I yell in frustration.        'If we do not have this thing powered up in one week, I'm shutting down the project' I say calmer, but still furious. I take time to cool off, and then rest. And at that moment, one little spark goes through the main wire of IPaCU, turning it on. Of course, I sleep through it. The only thing I wake up to is the sound of the emergency siren and the screams of scientists. This thing, the thing that was supposed to help humans, is killing them with toxic gas. Luckily, I grab a gas mask just in time to only be knocked out by it, not killed.        With me knocked out, the apocalypse begins. No one, nowhere, was safe from IPaCU. I was carried to the hospital by a surviving scientist, to this day I still don't know how he survived. But that explains the corpse on my floor.

There was once a robot named timmy and he was a medical helper for the hospital.   He could drive everywhere to help different people. He could talk to the patents to see how they were doing. He could hold medicine in his stomach. He could do sugrey and major things.           Timmy helped doctors that had better things to do than to check up on patents so timmy did it for them. He was very strong. timmy could hold up to 1000 pounds. He would help patients get around in wheel chairs. Timmy could saved people from dieying.             Those are some facts about timmy the robot. Also what he does and what he can do.Also what he cant do.

He comes to life after being charged for two hours a day. He comes to life so that he can help the doctors and the nurses. He helps the doctors and nurses give medicine to the patients that are in the hospital. Also after being charged two hours a day he can take care of the patients while the doctors and nurses take care and worry about other problems. He can go anywhere in the hospital to help any of the patients that need his help.          Mr.Grover runs on batteries that is why he has to be charged for two hours a day. He is also really strong he can lift up to 500 pounds.theses are advantages he has that help him while he is working in the hospital. He works long days because the hospital is very busy because the have to take care of a lot of patients. He can also talk he is programed to say hundreds of phases like 'Calling elevator' and 'Your delivery is here'. After he charges for twohours he can do all of this stuff for twelve hours a day without stopping.          Mr.Grover looks like a little cabient with wheels on it and he has little jawers that store medicine for people in the hospital. The jawers are a stack that have medicine in them so they are locked. The jawers are locked so when the doctors need medicine for the patients they can just unlock the jawers and get the medicine that they need. this means that somtimes Mr.Grover follows the doctors and nurses around so that he can help them. Hecan also give medicine to the patients when nobody is around.         Last Mr.Grover is a good helper he does work that doctors, pharmacists and nurses used to do so that they can work on other stuff. That must be a lot of work for him because he does it all by himself. But the people who bulit him programmed him to do that so that the doctors and nurses could work on other stuff that is important. The doctors and nurses do not care about their patients they just might have a bigger problem on their hands at the moment. In these paragraphs you have learned that a robot can do a humans job.

I went inside to check what was happening. My dad had bought home a giant box home. He said it was a surprise. I opened the big box, and there was a giant robot. The robot was awesome, with a lot of things to do. It can also help me with my homework!       On the second day with my robot, on a Saturday, I never knew that the robot would become alive. In the morning, at 7:00 A.M., the robot stood next to me and called me to wake up. The robot's voice wasn't a regular robot's voice, but it was a human girl voice. Was I even dreaming? No, I wasn't. The robot had become alive! I decided to name the robot Chloe. After waking me up, Chloe went to the kitchen to help with breakfast. When I told my mom that the Chloe was alive, she screamed! Then she calmed down and let Chloe make breakfast.       That afternoon, it was a blast! I played tennis, wall ball, volleyball, and board games with Chloe. I decided to swim in the pool with her in my backyard to cool down. We swam, and dived all the way until dinner. Ever since my dad bought Chloe, my life was not filled with boredom anymore.

Everybody gathered around while the police investigated and took pictures. When they opened the tuck the police did not believe what they saw. It was a Robot. Just as soon as they saw it the press started taking pictures. the police did not know what to do. so they called the White House. They brung a truck just like the one that washed up on the shore to pick the Robot up. Suddenly the Robot turned on then said Nova!! Nova!! Then kept repeating Nova!! Nova!!   The Robot ran and said, 'Deacemble, deacemble!' The police did not know what to do, so the Nova people chaced after the Robot and put him in the truck. The press was asking what was it from or who made it.   At the lab the Robot was studied and they built a replica of it. When they turned the   replica on all of a sudden the Robot turned on. Then it said to the scientist, 'Alive, alive.' The scientist said, 'What did you say.' Alive, alive he remarked.

This robot is called a Gemini-scout and it's a remote controlled robot.This robot is about 2 feet tall and has wheels;this robot is very small,but is very strong.It can carry supplies such as food and water and it can even drag people to safe.The robot has a camera the help find miners,yet the thermal camera uses heat sensors to find  living things.I'm pretty everybody played video games and if you have you might know how to use Gemini-Scout.                                         This other robot I'm going to talk about is called Dante 2.Dante 2 climbs volcanoes to get information  for the scientist.Just like a spider this robot has eight legs;the eight legs help Dante 2 climb the steep walls of the volcano.When scientist cant go in a volcano the robot goes instead.He looks for vents,and holes,in the crater He gets lots of information about gases that come out of the vents.This robot is built to survive very high heat.Now scientist can study volcanoes up close.                                             OK know this robot is called Mr.Gower.He works in hospitals and helps the doctors and nurse bring medication to the patients. he can go anywhere in the hospital;and it couldcan ride elevators,steer through hallways and move around stuff that sometimes get in his ways.The body of the robot is a stack of drawers that you could put medicine in.Mr.Gower doesn't just work all day in the hospital,he has been programed to say hundreds of phrases like, your delivery is here.'' and much more.This allows the doters to focus on other important tasks.                                    Know you have met some of the robots.I hope you liked them,but didn't they sound interesting.These robots are very useful they can pretty much help you with anything you want but just remember to get those awesome robots.  :) 	NNP DT NNPS NNP PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN NNS WDT VBP JJ CC WP PRP MD VB VB IN RB NN NNS IN NNS VBP RB CC IN PRP MD VB VBN IN DT NN , CC IN VBZ RB JJ JJ NNS NN NN NNS TO VB PRP IN PRP$ NNS VB DT NNS IN NNS CC VBP DT NNS IN NNS NN VBP RB JJ NNS CC IN VBZ WRB PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP DT NNP NNP NN VBZ VBN DT NN CC PRP VBZ DT NN VBN -NONE- RB VBZ IN CD NNS JJ CC VBZ NNS : DT NN VBZ RB JJ , CC VBZ RB JJ MD VB NNS JJ IN NN CC NN CC PRP MD RB VB NNS TO NNP NN VBZ DT NN DT NN NN NNS , RB DT JJ NN NNS VBP NNS TO VB NN -NONE- JJ NN NN VBN NN NNS CC IN PRP VBP PRP MD VB WRB TO VB NNP NNP JJ NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB IN VBZ VBN NNP CD CD NNS VBZ TO VB NN IN DT JJ IN DT NN DT NN VBZ VBN NNS : DT CD NNS VBP NNP CD NN DT NN NNS IN DT JJ NN NN VB IN DT NN DT NN VBZ JJ NNS IN NNS , CC NNS , IN DT NN PRP VBZ NNS IN NN IN NNS WDT VBP RP IN DT NNP NN VBZ VBN TO VB RB JJ JJ NN MD VB VBZ RP NNP NNP VB DT NN VBZ VBN -NONE- VBZ IN NNS CC NNS DT NNS CC VB VBG NN TO DT NNP PRP MD VB RB IN DT NN : CC PRP MD VB NNS , NN IN NNS CC VB IN NN IN RB VB IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ DT NN IN NNS WDT PRP MD VB NN NN VBZ RB RB VB DT NN IN DT NN , PRP VBZ VBN VBN TO VB NNS IN NNS IN , PRP$ NN VBZ NNP '' CC RB DT NNS DT NNS TO VB IN JJ JJ NNP NNP PRP VBP VBN DT IN DT NNP NN PRP VBD PRP , CC VBD RB PRP VBP JJ NNS VBP RB JJ PRP MD RB RB VB PRP IN NN PRP VBP CC RB JJR TO VB DT NN NNP : :

They can be a baby sitter, a farmer, &amp; a friend.We use them for help around the house. They do chores and play with kids.   Robots are very helpfull with picking fruit, going into caves, or valcanoes, to save people.       They are made for certain jobs to survive. Like if it was a valcano robot it would have to survive the heat. They can save many people if you use the right robot. We use them if we don't think we can survive.       So robots can be very usefull to people all around the world. They help people every day and I am happy for that. So know you know robots are very usefull to people every where.   The robots like to help others.

She is a genius! one day, Mrs. Bofa, her teacher wanted to challenge her, So mrs. Bofa gave Kayle a packet titled 'how to build robots', some paper,pencils,wires and some metal.'build a robot' Mrs. Bofa tells her.Kayle thinks how hard it would be to build a robot. 'im up for the challenge' she shouts. Kayle grabs the tools, and gets onto the bus.          The next day Kayle surprisingly shows up with a tall metal robot. 'ooh' 'aah' the kids  said. 'you should show us what it does'says Brenna. Kayle agrees and walks up to the class. 'this is the arm, and ummm' the kids started laughing. Kayle didnt know what they were laughing about. Kayle felt sad inside. Still presenting, Kayle saw a switch on the back of her robot. she dosent remember putting a switch there.       Kayle pulls the switch And the robots eyes open. 'O MY GOSH!!' Kayle screams!!. Then the robot starts stretching. 'it doesnt feel good being stuck like this for 8 hours so, how are you? I'm Joe by the way'the robot asks.'umm hi, i'm Kayle'.       Kayle and Joe started talking. About their favorite football teams, drama, and religion. You could say they were bonding.

Finally there are robots that can take care of people. They can also play too. These robots were developed by the U.S.C. Univercity. It took them about 10 years in the year 2025.             A group of them thought of it because there are many robots that can do all sorts of things. They can mine,dig,gather information,help in hospitals, and tons of other things. But then one person said 'what if about a robot that can help in houses'. This would change the way of robots for ever. But there main problem was were could they get all the resorces they needed.                 They gathered many memory chips,all sorts of metals,glass,and other things. they would spend 18 hours. only getting a half hour break a day and about 5-5 and a half hours of sleep. Some days a couple of the people would go mad or crazy. After a long 10 years of going insane and a lot of hard work they finally finished the robot. They named it the 'home bot'.                   It was such a hit that it sold  355,000 in the first month. Each 'home bot' sold for $850,000. After that, most of them spent their lives in peace after hard work, but some of the people who worked there were still insane and had to live in a insane isylem. Some of them got out but others had to stay. Besides the people in the isylem, everbody enjoyed their lives.

He was good at his job, buliding houses,constructing bulidings, and lots of other stuff. One day he was off from work. He didnt have a wife or kids to talk to. He thought to himself and said 'Im to lonely, I need a friend'. Frank had friends its just they were to busy all the time. He started to make other friends, but no one liked him. He tried to do online dating,still no one liked him.       The next day he dicided he needed friends soon. He thought and finally got it. He is an engineer, why not try and bulid a friend? He dicided to build a robot. So he did and  he suceeded! Now all he needed was a way to turn it on. He tried batteries,didnt work. He tried hot wireing it, just shocked himself. He tried and tried but nothing seemed to work. One day he decided that it was time to just take it to the dump. It was raining that day so he just tried to get it over with. he was walking his way when all of the sudden a lightning bolt came down and struck the robot. Frank was ok but the robot started to twitch until the robot sprang up and said 'hello, what is your name'? Frank told him and he named it Jeff. They talked, watched t.v., and did lots of other fun stuff toghether. Frank said they would be best friends, and they were.

The way they save lives are by carring the medicenc  be there really quick when they need them and drive in the halls without crashing in to people.       The way they use climbing is to climb VOLCANOS! They go climbing volcanos to gather info like the stuff scientist need because scientistcan't go climbing a volcano.

The story is set in the future, when robots take care of children. The main character loves her robot babysitter, robbie.                                                                                                               Unlike the child's parents, robbie always has time to play. Robbie and the child have adventures together. Robbie is an endless source of fun When the story was written, it  was a fantasy.                                                                                                                                Now it is close to coming true , since today, robots can do all kinds of things of work. they assemble electronic gadgets, guide trains on tracks, and sort trash. today's robots can play as well as work-robots sings, dance, and even play music.                                                                  A Japanese robot can play the piano with its two mechanical hands. Another fobot,HRP-4c, can even dance and sing. Many playful robots are made to copy animals, too. Some robots play the way animals play while other robots play with animals.For example,moviemakers have designed huge robotic aoes and dinosaurs to be in movies.But these kinds of robots aren't made only for movies.                                       Robot animals can live with you. You can buy a life like pet, such as a dog, a seal, or even a dinosaur.                      These robot pets have a lot in common with real pets. They want your attention and you can teach them tricks.                There is even anew version of a robot pet that has fur so you can pet your robot just like you pet your dog or          cat.There is one difference, though---you don't need them outside or feed them!                                                                                        Other robots help people play with live animals. One company,I-Pet                                         Companion, has made a robot that lets people play with kittens, but from a distance. when you log on the internet,   you can control the robot from far away. the robot is put in a room full of kittens. it drags a piece of string for the kittens to chase. When it's your turn, you can control the robot to pull the string this way or that way.                                                           The kittens jump after the string as you push the controls. Some robots even play all by themself .        Collage students in oregon have created robots that can play hockey or shuffleboard on their own. all year, the students work hard to design the robots. The robots play the game without any instruction from the students . the robots grab the puck, turn, twist and compete to score. In the final test, the robots must push the puck to the goal      without being told what to do. There may never be a robot like Robbie since''I,Robot'' was a made -up story.                                                             Still, today's robots can offer hours of fun....

'well honey i have no idea that's just how the world was made why do you ask?''     'well because we had a test in school a bout how the stars are created.''      ' hmm well Bree this is what i no about stars, and how they are created, have you heard of aliens?''    ''yes!!''

'' oh thanks mom i love you''   ''I love you to honey, don't you think it's time to go get dinner?''   '' Yeah but while you cook do you think that i could stay here and learn a little more about the stars?''    '' yes honey go ahead but don't fall off the roof!!''     While mom went to go cook dinner Bree sat there on the roof and watched the stars... she sat there for maybe 5 minutes or so, Bree seen a big star that looked like a spaceship. She called '' mom come and look you will never believe it.''     ''So mom hurried to the roof and seen the same thing that Bree seen.   '' mom said '' that's amazing, wow i have never seen nothing like that.''   '' but mom you said that you have''    of course Bree would believe that she was only 9 yrs. old   '' Well i have but nothing like that. We  better head in and finish dinner and you should help me cook''    ''oh yay mom that sounds like so much fun i can't wait''       While they were cooking Bree asked her mom '' Mom were do aliens come from?''     Mom got sick of hearing about it so she just said 'Why don't we  just focus on cooking instead of that dumb alien situation, ok? So how does turkey sound?   '' UGH why can't we just go out and eat? And why you just answer my question?????    '' go to your room it's time for bed! you can eat you dinner before you go to school good night and i love you.'

It took me a whole month to this assignment so I needed friends to help me, Jarrett, Rodger, and I. During this whole month we were all excited about how this robot was going to look like. We are going to build this robot in my garage. If you even mess one thing up the robot wont work. What we want the robot to do is, help us hold tools, deliver, and speak. It will also move by its self. This robot will have 4 legs. We shall be naming it Rojo. We were almost done with this project, now the only tricky part is, bring it to life.                      We tried plugging it in and it wasn't working. It took a long time to figure out what the problem was, we were just missing some parts. We plugged it in and it was lighting up! Rojo the red robot was finally alive! We were all proud of ourselves, because we got an A! That was story of making my robot come alive                                                                          By: Anthony George            	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP DT NN NN WDT PRP VBD , PRP$ NN VBD TO VB DT NN TO VB RP IN DT NNP NNP VBD PRP DT JJ NN TO DT NN IN PRP VBD NNS TO VB PRP , NNP , NNP , CC NNP NNP DT JJ NN PRP VBD PDT VBN IN WRB DT NN VBD VBG TO VB NNP NNP VBP VBG TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP PRP RB VBP CD NN RB DT NN NN NNP NNP PRP VBP DT NN TO VB VBZ , NN PRP VBD NNS , VBP , CC NNP NNP MD RB VB IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN MD VB CD NNP NNP MD VB VBG PRP NNP NNP VBD RB VBN IN DT NN , RB DT JJ NN NN VBZ , VBG PRP TO NNP NNP VBD VBG PRP IN CC PRP VBD RB NNP PRP VBD DT JJ NN TO VB RP WP DT NN VBD , PRP VBD RB VBG DT NNP NNP VBD PRP IN CC PRP VBD VBG RP .

Gemini-scout ia remote controlled robot that does alot of research and helps people. Dante 2 climbs on volcanoes to help scientist for research. He can be in hot condition with out melting so if there on somthing they cant do they sent out Dante 2.

MR.Gower is a robot that wroks in hospitals ,helping doctros and uurses being medicine to patients . the robot is so strong that ti can pull 500 pounds. Mr.Gower runs on batteries .after charging for two hours ,the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours with stopping.            An agribot is a robot that picks fruit .it might pick berries, oranges ,grapes ,or apples.agribots are not yet widelt used , but  farmers are very intereted in what these robots can do.others are able to move around on their own.this help the robot konw whan each berry is  ripe.scientists  are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help at all ! they have carted for by small agribots.            If a plant is too dry , a robot will water it when a robot senses that a tomato is ripe, it uses a mechanical arm the tomato.agribots may seem unusal now , but one day they may be common on frrms.   about fifty years ago, the author isaac asimov wrote a stry called 'i,robot'              when the story was written ,it was a fantasy .now it is close to coming true since today .robots  can do all kind of work.They assememble electonic gadgets , guide trains on tracks and sort trash.   may playful robots are made to copy animals too.some robots  play the way animals play while other robots play with animals.

I can speak and am strong. I help doctores and vets. I like to work with doctors the most because I get to see people. I love meeting new people every day.     At doctors offices I see kids and adults. I love working with all ages. At doctors offices sometimes I see sick kids so i make them feel better. I can make kids kaugh and be happy again so I love my job. I also like working with adults. I like working with adults because they are so amazed at all I can to and they wonder how I do it.       I was created by the world round famous scientist his name was Dr. Albert. When he first made me I was a little confused. I didnt know everthing I could do. I got a one on one special teacher to teach me everthing. She taught me how to sind and talk and be the best that I can be.       I love being the robot that I am. Even though I might be different it doesnt matter. People still love me for who I am. I come to my job everday to make people feel better and they make me feel better. I love working with people and I hope I get to continue working with them until my robot life is over.

Well if you guessed both then you are right.Some things in science are easy and some is hard.Some is fun some is boring. You learn about rocks and what rocks are made of and how they form and all most everything about rocks.Then you learn about gravity and mass and valcanios and all that cool scienty stuff.So that is all I now about al lthat scienty stuff.

Sarah and I decided to make a robot so we could be creative. We wanted to make a robot that can do special skills like dance,sing and talk. I invited Sarah over so we could start to make ideas.I heard the doorbell ring and I ran to the door. I opened the door and I didnt see Sarah I saw my little cousin Emily. Emily had brought all her toys and water paints. I said 'What are you doing here?' Emily replied 'I came to play here.' I said 'Well go play somewhere else Sarah is coming over because we need to do a project.' Emily walked right in the house and ran into the game room.             The doorbell had rang again and this time I knew it was Sarah. I ran to the door to answer it I opened the door and saw Sarah with a notebook and wires and much much more. I said 'Hey come on in.' Sarah said 'Okay why is there a bunch of trash on the floor?' I said annoyed 'Because my cousin is  here.' Sarah said 'Oh well she better not disturb us.' I nodded my head and walked to the kitchen leading Sarah. Sarah got all her things out and we started to bulid. Sarah and I walked upstairs to go grab some material for the robot. While we were gone Emily went into the kitchen and made the robot just like her. Sarah and I walked downstairs and saw the robot. Sarah got angry because all that effort we put into it and I did too. The robot was all covered in glitter and fleathers it looked horrible.              Sarah grabbed the robot and then it started to talk and move the robot said 'Put me down Sarah!' Sarah and I both looked at each other then screamed. We ran upstairs and Emily followed us. I said 'Why did you do that Emily?' Emily said 'Do what?' Sarah joined in and said 'You know what you did you made the robot talk and walk!' Emily said 'No I didnt I only put glitter on it and fleathers.' Sarah and I said 'Well then who did it!' Then we heard a noise like crashing and breaking things. We also saw something coming up the stairs. It was the robot the robot said 'I am coming.' We all got scared and painked because the robot was alive!

I was happy that now I had two whole days of no school, nothing but to relax. After I went to my locker and but all my books away I started to walk home. I was five minutes into walking home and all of a sudden I herd a sound... it was a sound that sounded like something hitting metal. I kept walking and three seconds later I heard it again. So I started to go back and look for what was making the noise.   Soon enough I looked in a big trashcan wondering if it was coming from there. I slowly lifted the lid up... but all I saw was an old toy looking robot and some trash that was thrown away. So I figured what ever was making the noise had gone away. I started to walk away and then I herd it again. It sounded like it was coming from the trashcan, but all I had saw was the old robot and some trash. I started to wonder if it could of been the robot... but it wasn't possible anyways it looked like the robot didn't work. Some how though I was curious and decided to go and look in the trashcan again. As I lift up the lid and picked up the robot.   He looked like he was a run down old toy that was thrown away. I looked at him and found an on and off button. I switched the button on to see if it worked and soon enough I saw the eyes light up, but that was it. So I decided to take it home and look at it some more.   It was nearly six o'clock when I got home and Mom had already made dinner and said it was time to eat. I sat down at the table and started to eat dinner. Mom asked me how my day was and I told her it was good but I did tell her that I found something interesting while I was walking home from school. She asked me what it was but I said it was just an old toy someone threw away. After I finished dinner and put my dishes in the sink I went up to my room and looked at the robot some more. I turned the on button on again and then his eyes lit up. I set him down wondering if that was all he did but then I heard something say hello. I turned over and looked at the robot and saw his arm make a slight movement.    Then he moved his head and said, ' Hello... my name is Rob, whats yours?' I couldn't believe he was talking to me. I responded saying, ' Hi, my name is Joey.' It was kind of strange at first, just the thought that I was having a conversation with a robot but then after we got into the conversation  a bit more it didn't feel so strange.   Mom knocked on the door asking who I was talking to and I said, 'Oh, I was just talking to a friend on the phone.' hoping she would believe me. She said, ' Ok, just don't be on the phone past nine.' I said,' sure... ' ' Wow! that was close Rob... she almost found out about you.' ' Ya, your right.' It was almost time to go to bed so I started brushing my teeth and geting my bed ready. Rob asked where he was going to sleep and I pulled out an old shoe box and put a blanket at the bottom with a pillow and then gave him another blanket to cover himself.   The next morning I woke up and looked at Rob's bed. He wasn't there! I thought ,' Ok where would I go if I were a robot.' I looked all over in my room and still couldn't find him. Then I ran down the stairs and asked Mom if she had been in my room and she said,' Ya, there was this old robot thing sitting on your bed.' I asked her ,'Well where did you put it.' Oh I put it in the trash.Why do you want it?I thought since it was sitting in an old shoe box I thought you wanted it to be thrown away.' I said,' No I found him yesterday in the trash and brought him home!'   So I ran outside and looked in the trash and got him out. He was still Ok and I decided that I could use a friend. So I took him inside and from that day he's still my friend. I'm now eighteen and those six years he's stayed with me by my side ever since. That's what a true friend is.

It always saves people and helps the police catch a bad guy. It saves animals and helps the vet. Caluda helps alot of things everyone likes her. Caluda is also very nice to kids but sometimes she gets mad at them for throwing toys at her but she has to learn her lesson that they are only just kids. It also could do tricks and could climb. This robot can only say' 'how can I help you' and' 'Ill save you' she is trying to learn more from her scientist he was the one who invented her. His name is Mike he always helps her and teaches her new stuff. Caludas best friend is mike she is really friendly to him and nice she's never mean to him. Caluda doesnt really have feelings. Hope you learned alot about her!

It tolled the the miners it was safe to go further when in reality it was not.If it hadn't been for the candle every one would died.  the candle went out then Matt   caught a wiff of gas.  every one turned around-including Gemini-Scout- and ran out.                 Now the robot was in my office-get this-TALKING!!!  He is NOT supposed to talk   I called my supervisor and asked him what to do.  He said,'I ... don't know what to d-'   then the line went dead.  The only thing I could think of was that this was turning into a   zombie apocolips type thing.  And, sadly I was right.                         If this is going to turn into a zombie apocolips thing, I thought then I need to be ready.  So I grabed a reamot controle that could control Gemini-Scout and put on my running  shoes.  I tried to find the robot but he was no were to be found.                 as i ran  out side i saw Gemini-Scout just rolling doun the side of  the rode, BUT   befor I could do any thing i sew 2 other robots come rolling in next to it.  As i reached   for the reamoat another 3 came into view then as i made Gemini-Scout turn arund   so did all the other robots then as they rased torards me i ran backwards into my   labritory.                 Then I realized that all I needed was an anti virouus.  quick as a flash I doun loded   a strond anti viorious and hide by the door as the king robot[Gemini-Scout] came into the room i stuck the anti viorous into it's power socket, and BOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!   everything colapsed.                 as the smoke cleared i realized that i had done it. I, me, myself, and I had done it.,   and everything was finished.

Sammy did not have many friends so that is why he decided to make one. He has been working on his friend for four months now but there was no use he could not make it work. So he put on his rain coat and walked to the trash crying. He tossed him in the garbage and walked in the house to go to bed. When he was sleeping a tear stoke down his face and right when it hit his pillow lightning struck hitting his robot outside.                  The next morning when Sammy woke up everything he saw was blurry. He opened his eyes a crack and saw a face. He closed his eyes then opened them again, blinking multiple times. The figure was gone. Sammy got out of bed to brush his teeth. When he was smiling in the mirror making funny faces with toothpaste in his mouth. He heard a laughter but where from. He heard it again coming from his closet, very scared he opened his door there he saw his robot it was alive and shinier then ever. Hi he said remember me i am your robot that you designed. 'Why did u put me in the trash it was dreadful in there the smell was just awful.' said the robot. 'Sorry' Sammy said still confused.                 Sammy decided to give his new friend a name 'how about Franky?' 'Sounds great i cant wait to spend so much time with you'said Franky. 'Well we need to go eat breakfast and introduce you to the family.' Exclaimed Sammy. they both walked down. The whole family was up sitting at the table waiting for Sammy so they can start eating. When the family saw Franky there mouths dropped open wondering who it was. This is Franky everyone. he is my robot friend that I made. Franky this is my dad, mom, my sister Angela, and my dog Clover. Franky had great manors, he said hi and nice to meet you. Franky was not only did he have great manors but he was also kind.                  Franky suggested that they go outside and play soccer. Sammy agreed. They both walked outside using Angela's new pair of shiny black shoes as a goal. Sammy started with the ball kicking it as hard as he could. Franky stopped it, but now it was his turn to kick on Sammy he set it up striking it with his metal foot hitting it so hard that Sammy jumped out of the way so he wouldn't get hit. 'Wow that was a great kick Franky.' Exclaimed Sammy. Franky ran after the ball he was super fast he could run a marathon in less that two minutes. Sammy asked Franky if he wanted to join the soccer team but Franky said no he would rather play soccer with him.                  Sammy knew that there friendship would last for miles, they even came up with a cool handshake. Well even though it is time for them to go to bed, Sammy had never felt the feeling of a friend to hangout with and he was glad he found someone as special as Franky.

They worked and worked on it for days with no luck at all.They tried replacing old parts, hitting it,and attacking it.Nothing seemed to work though.The problem was much more simple than that.The robot simly didn,t have any more power.Giving up,the scientists threw the robot into a junkyard with other items.Thats when it started.The day it started was a groomy day with a strong rainstorm.Suprisingly, The robot ran on water.This rainstorm filled the robot's power core up enough to start it up.First it was loading in data about its surroundings.This lead to it finding out it was on a planet called Earth,which was 206565492 lightyears away from its home world,Galvin Omega.It could fly there, but it didn't have its power core charged enough.It then scanned the area to find the closest area to get information about this 'Earth.'It then traveled the the closest building with a computer and absorbed its data.Scanning though the data it found out how to get enough power for the space flight home to Galvin Omega,a n area the primitave species of this world calles a 'dam.'The closest dam was 20 miles.This took the robot about 5 minutes to get there.This is where the problem really starts.Somehow, the army gets there thinking thai it is a threat.They fire on sight but were blasted away by the robot's plasma cannon.This then made the robot an Alfa Red Threat.This caused the army to send all their troops there.Quickly The robot had to escape before it lost too much power.        The robot seemed to be faster than most and dived into the deeper side of the dam.The army unable to do anything at that moment,dicided to wait till it came out where they would be waiting.Although the army was strong it wasn't able to stop the robot when it shot out of the water and flew through space to its home.

Her parents spent their day working, leaving poor Rosemary all on her own in the house. One day she asked, 'Mummy, why must you go to work everyday and leave me alone in this lonely house?'   Her mother replied, 'Well, Rosemary, because we do it for your food, the clothes on your back, and this lonely house.'      Rosemary kept quiet after that response. Day after day she became more lonely. Her parents seemed like they didn't love her anymore. This was true. Her parents did not work ALL the time.  After they got of of work, they went to go partying or do something that does not involve Rosemary. Rosemary was a good student. She had no friends, no way of being social. Then, she discovered the internet. The 13 year old found a website where there were people just like her. They didn't sleep -just like her-. They all had problems -just like her- it was real nice. She used it a lot, but somehow she needed something else. A friend is what she needed.      Rosemary has never had a friend in her whole entire life. She does remember having one in 5th grade, but that friend let her go after a while.    One night while her parents were 'working', Rosemary was on that special website and found a page. It was not some regular page, it was a robot selling page.   'They're having a give-away!' Rosemary cried.    The prize was a robot. 'The I, Robot' she read.       After a few weeks later, she won the prize. When she opened it, her eyes were bursting tears of joy. Since Rosemary never had a childhood of her own, she decided to make one out of this robot.   'I'm going to call you Flossy.' giggled Rosemary.   'As you wish.' said Flossy.           Rosemary loved Floss very much. Somehow, Flossy adapted to Rosemary's personality. About 2 years later, Rosemary somehow had drifted apart from Flossy. She often thinks about him, she remembers how lucky she was winning that give-away. It practically saved her life. While she was looking out and about in her old house, she found Flossy. He was all dusty but still looking like Rosemary's late childhood. Rosemary quickly and quietly turned Flossy on.   'Good morning, Rosemary, what wonderful weather.' it said.     'Yes, what wonderful weather we are having.' she let a tear out while she was speaking.   'Do you know how long it has been since I've used you?'   '2 years a 3 days, ma'am.' Flossy said.   'You know, I've been always meaning to thank you.' Rosemary said.   'You're welcome, child.' Flossy replied.         Then, Rosemary's parents walked in and said,   'GET OUT, WE BE HAVING A PARTY OVER HERE!'      The night of that day, her parents were inside the house, being burned alive.

When he finds this key it says on the side of it a message. So the boy ran into his house to look at the key under a light. When he looks under his kitchen light it says mechanical company. Then the boy says hay thats the company down the street. Then the boy goes to sleep in his bed. The next morning he goes down the street to get a tour of the company. When he was walking down the hall with his touring group he see's a small door that has a lock that fits the keys descibtion. Then the boy goes to the door to unlock it with the key, and then it opens up. The boy walks into the dark room to see a other lock just like the other. Then the boy unlocks it to see a bright light. After that a robot walks out, and then greets the boy with a high five. Finally the boy in the robot becomes best friends.

His cousin was coming over next week so he planned to build a fort in the woods. When he told his mother where he was going she just said' Be back by 7 o'clock.' While walking through the woods he started to day dream about how he would be a famous basketball star and married to a super model. He didn't know it but he been walking the wrong way for about 15 minutes.          That's when he came into the clearing. Jack was very confused, he'd never been to this part of the woods. Then something caught the corner of his eye. It was I a giant piece of metal sticking out of the ground, and it looked like a giant hand! As he got closer to it, it started to look more and more like a hand. When he got right up to the object he stuck his hand out to touch it. That's when it happened.          There was the sound of gears grinding. The whole ground rose up, and underneath was a giant metal man. A robot! When it stood to it's full height it was easily 12 feet tall. That's when it looked at Jack he took of has fast as he could, but the robot was faster. The robot's hand shot out and grabbed him. Jack thought for sure the robot was going to squish or something. But the robot just stared at him. 'What do want?' Jack cried out. The robot start to walk away with Jack.          When Jack tried to yank himself free the Robot said'Stop child. I am from a different galaxy.' Jack was speechless. He thought he was dreaming, but nope there was a real living robot in front of him. 'Why are you here?' asked Jack. 'To find my lost brother Dracou.' 'Well what's your name then?' 'Gizmo.' 'Oh, I thought would be some Russian name like Arnold or something.' They didn't talk until they came to a cave. 'This is where we sleep tonight.' When Gizmo set him down Jack saw a symbol that looked like a skull. When he asked Gizmo about it he said it was his family's symbol.         For 8 days they traveled across the country to find Dracou. Jack missed his mom,but knew this was a once in a lifetime experience. On the 9th day they came to a military base. Gizmo said it was where they kept his brother. They devised a plan and waited for night fall.           When the sun went down their plan was put to action. Gizmo fired a couple shots on the other side of the base. All the alarms went off and guards rushed over there. That's when they snuck around to the back entrance. When Jack saw the place all he could say was' Oh my gosh.' The place was way bigger than it looked and had a least 10 floors going down. Everything was white and all of the scientist were in these big radiation suits. They were all surrounding this big pile of metal. But when Jack looked closer he realized it was Dracou.          Now it was phase 2 of their plan. Jack seen the nearest fire alarm and pulled it. All of the scientist started sprinting to the nearest fire exit. When they were all gone Gizmo grabbed Jack and jumped off the main floor all the way to the bottom one. When they got to Dracou, Gizmo hit a button on his back, and he instantly woke up. Gizmo told him to situation and said they were going to have to blast their way out.              Gizmo and Dracou both fired they're guns at the roof and it came down. Gizmo grabbed Jack and flew out of the roof with him.When they got to Jack's house Gizmo set him down and said his good byes. Gizmo said' I never thought there were any good humans until I met you Jack.' 'Thank you for saving my life.' said Dracou.That's when they flew   off.

He would be a perfect friend and do my chores. Nobody has a robot like that. Later that night when i was going to bed i heard a crashing noise.        I got out of bed and went to were i thought i heard the noise. There was nothing. I went back to my room and heard. It was even louder than before. I looked in the hall way and saw a robot just like how I had in my dream at the beach. He walked up to me and said hi i am the Jackinator 5000. I jumped back and ran to my room. After i was in my room i hid under my blankets. It opened the door and said i guess you want to play hide in seek. I sat there and did nothing. Then the blankets were lifted up and i wondered if it was good. It really was and said good night.

Robots no longer were devoted to risking themselves as experiments or battle technology. One, the first rebel and the leader of the robots had begun everything. He took over the factories, hacked us, out-smarted all of us, and got the other steel creatures to follow him. Soon enough we were slaves we were servants to them! We needed a new plan. One to free us all.          'What shall we do?!' this was our human resistance leader, we were divising a plan to save our race in a secret underground bunker. I had grown up dowwn here, almost never having a single ray of sun touch the surface of my skin. My name was mark, I think, my parents had been taken when I was just a little boy to work as servants for the 'Big guy' or the one robot that flipped the simple life of the past.   'Hey...' suggested on of the few elderly people that escaped 'Have you ever seen the movie terminator...?' We never had, of course, all of the movie theaters or entertainment departments had been destroyed because the robots didnt feel amused by them.'Robots took over in the movie, then went back in time to try and take out the human leader...' he whispered 'What if we flip that...' Everone went silent. The closest time machine available was in custody by the artificial intelligence.       'How will we get to it?' Suggested the rebel leader (he had never ever given us his name)       'Only a couple of turret drones guard that today,' I stated, 'and we still have several RPGs in our saved inventory.'       'That's right,' James (my best friend) shouted 'We could take those out, get the time macine, go back in time, and destroy the prototype of artificial intelligence used to create the 'Big guy.'       'Now then, Who agrees with the two... children?' Everyone began to mumble, shake thier heads up and down, and stick their thumbs up. Our leader seemed surprised by our quickly made plan, but had to go with the over all vote. We scheduled to leave the very next day to take back wha was ours. 'Wait,' He said, 'Who will be the one to go back in time to destroy that prototype?' Instanly everyone went quiet, and I saw how physically weak we all were. I was one of the only healthy people, 'I will,' I said.

The current assignment is to write a science fiction story for the group about any subject that interests you. For your story, you must include information from research that you have done. To prepare for your story, you have decided to research the topic of robots. Below are four sources you have uncovered in your research (two essays, an article, and an image).               After you have reviewed these sources, you will answer some questions about them. Briefly scan the sources and the three questions that follow. Then, go back and review the sources carefully to gain the information you will need to answer the questions and write a story.               In Part 2, you will write a story on a topic related to the sources.       Directions for beginning:           You will now examine several sources. You can re-examine any of the sources as often as you like.       Research Questions:           After examining the research sources, use the remaining time in Part 1 to answer three questions about them. Your answers to these questions will be scored. Also, your answers will help you think about the research sources you have read and viewed, which should help you write your story.               You may click on the appropriate buttons to refer to the sources when you think it would be helpful. You may also refer to your notes. Answer the questions in the spaces provided below them.       Part 1       Sources for Performance Task:       Source #1   This article about the kinds of jobs performed by robots is based on information in the following sources:   http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/futureoftech/rescue-robot-just-made-mine-disasters-121251   http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/03/us/robot-completes-volcano-exploration.html   http://www.ri.cmu.edu/research_project_detail.html?project_id=163enu_id=261   http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/robot.htm;http://www.economist.com/node/15048711.       Meet the Robots   by Erin Bregman               If you think of robots as a thing of the future, think again. Robots do many jobs today. They work in mines and on farms. They help doctors and save lives. They even explore volcanoes. Here are some robots that are hard at work.       Gemini-Scout               Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it can even roll through water. The robot is small, but it is strong. Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies. It can even drag hurt people to safety.               Wherever it goes, Gemini-Scout collects information. For example, it tests the air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe. The robot also has a thermal camera to help it find miners. A thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.               When the robot finds the trapped miners, the miners can use its two-way radio to talk with the rescue team.               This robot was built to be easy to use. Its remote control is the same one that is used for some video games. If you""ve ever played a video game, you may know how to use Gemini-Scout.       Dante 2               Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job&mdash;it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. Like a spider, this robot has eight legs. This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano. It is also built to survive very high heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter, Dante goes instead.               Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. Then the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the vents. In the past, scientists could not learn as much about volcanoes, but Dante 2 is changing that. Now scientists can study a volcano up close while they remain safe in their laboratories.       Mr. Gower               Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed.               Mr. Gower can go anywhere in the hospital. It can ride elevators, steer through hallways, and move around things that get in the way. The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds. Mr. Gower runs on batteries. After charging for two hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.               Not only does it work long days, but Mr. Gower can talk. It has been programmed to say hundreds of phrases. For example, it can say, &ldquo;Calling elevator&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your delivery is here.&rdquo; Mr. Gower does work that doctors, pharmacists, and nurses used to do. This allows them to focus on other important tasks.       Agribots               An agribot is a robot that picks fruit. It might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks. Others are able to move around on their own. In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries. This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.               At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), scientists are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help at all! They have created a greenhouse full of plants that are cared for by small agribots. The agribots are like robot farmers. Every plant has sensors that tell the robots what the plant needs. If a plant is too dry, a robot will water it. When a robot senses that a tomato is ripe, it uses a mechanical arm to pick the tomato. Agribots may seem unusual now, but one day they may be common on farms.

Robots that Play Well With Others   by Kascha Semonovitch               About fifty years ago, the author Isaac Asimov wrote a story called &ldquo;I, Robot.&rdquo; The story is set in the future, when robots take care of children. The main character loves her robot babysitter, Robbie. Unlike the child""s parents, Robbie always has time to play. Robbie and the child have adventures together. Robbie is an endless source of fun!               When the story was written, it was a fantasy. Now it is close to coming true, since today, robots can do all kinds of work. They assemble electronic gadgets, guide trains on tracks, and sort trash. Today""s robots can play as well as work&mdash;robots sing, dance, and even play music. A Japanese robot can play the piano with its two mechanical hands. Another robot, HRP-4c, can even dance and sing.               Many playful robots are made to copy animals, too. Some robots play the way animals play while other robots play with animals. For example, moviemakers have designed huge robotic apes and dinosaurs to be in movies. But these kinds of robots aren""t made only for movies. Robot animals can live with you. You can buy a lifelike pet, such as a dog, a seal, or even a dinosaur. These robot pets have a lot in common with real pets. They want your attention and you can teach them tricks. There is even a new version of a robot pet that has fur so you can pet your robot just like you pet your dog or cat. There is one difference, though&mdash;you don""t need to take them outside or feed them!               Other robots help people play with live animals. One company, I-Pet Companion, has made a robot that lets people play with kittens, but from a distance. When you log on to the Internet, you can control the robot from far away. The robot is put in a room full of kittens. It drags a piece of string for the kittens to chase. When it""s your turn, you can control the robot to pull the string this way or that way. The kittens jump after the string as you push the controls.               Some robots even play all by themselves. College students in Oregon have created robots that can play hockey or shuffleboard on their own. All year, the students work hard to design the robots. The robots play the game without any instructions from the students. The robots grab the puck, turn, twist and compete to score. In the final test, the robots must push the puck to the goal without being told what to do.               There may never be a robot like Robbie since &ldquo;I, Robot&rdquo; was a made-up story. Still, today""s robots can offer hours of fun.       Source #4   Here is an article on self-driving cars, from NPR.com, February 17, 2012.   http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/17/147006012/when-the-car-is-the-driver       When the Car Is the Driver   by Steve Henn               This week the state of Nevada finalized new rules that will make it possible for robotic self-driving cars to receive their own special driving permits. It's not quite driver's licenses for robots&mdash;but it's close.               The other day I went for a spin in a robotic car. This car has an $80,000 cone-shaped laser mounted on its roof. There are radars on the front, back and sides. Detailed maps help it navigate.               Do people notice it's a self-driving car and gawk?               'We get a lot of thumbs up,' says Anthony Levandowski, one of the leaders of Google's self-driving car project. 'People drive by and then they wave. I wish they would keep their eyes on the road.'               Levandowski is in the passenger seat with a laptop showing him what the car can see. Chris Urmson is behind the wheel. But his hands are in his lap and the steering wheel is gently turning back and forth, tracing the contours of California's busy Highway 85.               'And it can adjust the speed. If there is a particularly tight corner, it will slow down for that,' Urmson says. 'It adjusts speed to stay out of blind spots of other vehicles. It tries to match speed with traffic.'               Urmson has been working on this technology for close to a decade. His first car managed to travel just 11 miles on a dusty road. Google's vehicle is a giant leap forward.               'When we got this on the freeway and it was doing 70 miles an hour and just smoothly driving along the road, you could taste it&mdash;the technology,' Urmson says. 'You could really feel the impact and how it's going to change people's lives. It was just amazing.'               While he was talking, a motorcycle cut us off. The car saw the move coming, and we hardly even noticed.               Google's fleet of robotic cars has driven more than 200,000 miles over highways and city streets in California and Nevada. Google did this testing in kind of a legal limbo. These cars aren't forbidden, but, 'There was no permission granted for any of that to happen by anybody,' says Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist and robotic car enthusiast.               'It's essential that there be a place to do tests,' he says. 'There's two ways to do it&mdash;the seek-forgiveness strategy and the seek-permission strategy. Frankly, the 200,000 hours I think that have been driven here in California&mdash;that's a seek-forgiveness strategy. Right?'               If anything went wrong, Google would have had a huge amount of explaining to do. So last year, the company hired a lobbyist in Nevada. 'The state of Nevada is close, it's a lot easier to pass laws there than it is in California,' Levandowski says.               He says Google convinced the state Legislature to pass a law making robotic cars explicitly legal. But the Legislature went further than just creating a place to test these cars&mdash;it ordered the Department of Motor Vehicles to create basically a driver's license for these robot cars.               'I thought it was great,' says Bruce Breslow, director of the Nevada DMV. 'My grandfather took me to the 1964 World's Fair in New York City many times. And they were promising me the car of the future as an 8-year-old, and I thought to myself, this finally could be it.'               Starting March 1, companies will be able to apply to test self-driving cars on Nevada roads.               'The test vehicles will be Nevada's first red license plate since the 1940s,' Breslow says. Think of it like a learner's permit&mdash;those bright red plates will let everyone know there's a student robot driver behind the wheel.               'And eventually when these vehicles are sold, it will be the first ever neon green license plate that the state of Nevada will ever issue&mdash;green meaning go, and the future's arrived,' Breslow says.               Google says it will probably be years before cars like this go on sale. But Jurvetson, the venture capitalist, says he's convinced this technology could save thousands of lives 'today, already, right now.'               Robots are never distracted. They don't text or drink or get tired. They see things no human can.               'That front radar catches bounces off the ground,' Jurvetson says. 'We were driving behind an 18-wheeler, and we saw the vehicles in front of the 18-wheeler&mdash;vehicles we could not see with our eye&mdash;because the signal bounced off the pavement . . . at a glancing angle underneath the 18-wheeler. And so no human will ever have the amount of information that these cars have when they are driving.'               While Nevada may be the first state to create a licensing system for self-driving cars, it won't be the last; Hawaii, Florida and Oklahoma are already following suit. And Jurvetson says one day we may be asking ourselves if humans should still be allowed to drive.

Robots are now very special to me because I have learned the importance of them.They are not big scary objects that take over the world,they are objects with a great personality.       They are willing to help anyone anywhere.They weren't built by evil scientist,they were built to help and thats exactly what they do.

Robots have been in our lives for a while now but we don't recognize them because they are preforming every day things. For example there are robots helping doctors, there are robots fixing and building your cars, there is also robots out on the street every day. People just don't consider these robots because with out them life would be difficult.       Robots can not only help with our lives they can improve it. They improve lives by making jobs easier, helping people who need help, and robots also just make life much easier. Robots are built for all kinds of different reasons. There is one robot named Gemini-scout and he helps search-and-rescue teams find lost or hurt people. They also build robots for research like Dante 2. Dante 2 climbs into volcano to gather new information about volcanoes. Like i said earlier there are robots that help doctors and Mr. Gower is one of them. He is a cabinet on wheels, he holds medicine inside of him and he is then told where to transfer that medicine. Mr.Grower also was programed to speak. He can only say a few things but he can take to you. There are robots everywhere in this world.                                                                                                                        That proves it there are robots all over the world that some people never would have thought about. Robots will change how things work in the future and they are doing that right now. Robots help improve lives every day and I know they will keep on changing and improving life.

Her parents were very proud of her.She rushed off to her school Sun land Elementary and when she was gone there was a large amount of noise in her room but her parents did not suspect anything so they went to work.Later when she got home she ran up to her room anxious to see if her robot had came alive.but it was the same.Katherine wondered why her room was a mess but she kept it to herself.           The next week while she was working on her report she heard a noise behind her and she turned around and nothing was there The noise came again but no-one was there.The third time she caught it.She was overjoyed to see that her robot  had walked and breathed.Over the past few weeks she worked to get to her goal of a full stimulated robot. She succeeded and was so happy.Later on in her life she invented many other robots.Some could play with her some could read to her some could climb trees or cook or even make the bed.She invented a nanny bot to help take care of her while she was sick so her parents could go to work.           Remember if you think of robots as a thing of the future, think again.Robots are around today but you just do not notice it.Some help save lives or help doctors or even go down in volcanoes.Also one that can mine.

There are many reasons why, some robots can rescue people like the Gemini-Scout it can carry 500 pounds, The Gemini can take the person to a safe place when they are hurt. the robot is less than two feet tall and it has wheels. The robot can go up the stairs and can go down the stairs it can also make thigh turns, this robot can even roll through water. It can carry food,water and other supplies.                Dante 2 is an interesting robot it goes inside volcanoes to explore the inside. Dante 2, has 8 legs the 8 legs help Donte to climb up and down from volcanoes. It is also special because Dante 2 can go in the volcano ,and can get in small holes to investigate. The robot can go inside the volcano when the scientist can't.This robot collects information that comes out vent.               Mr.Gower is a fascinating robot, It is also because he can speak'.It is not gust interesting because he can speak, but it is also because he helps the people from the hospital. Mr.Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. It's body is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Mr.Gower recharges with batteries, after two hours of charging it can last 12 hours without stopping.                   Agribots are interesting because, Agribots help farmers on lots of things. Agribots help farmers on watering the plants when the plant needs water. Agribots have two hands when a fruit is ready they would grab it with their two hands,and put it in the basket.At Massachusetts scientist's are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help at all. They have created a greenhouse full of plants that are cared for by small.                   An amazing robot called the HRP-4c can sing and dance. This robot has two hands and it also plays the piano.

Unreal? Flabbergasting? Well the  Dr. Jobs sure has. Dr. Jobs was a scientist. He was very wealthy and kind. He worked on many inventions we use today, such as the iPhone.             It was a normal day for Dr. Jobs, working on his latest invention, the 'iRobot'. The iRobot was a robot who could do anything , play, jump, sleep, swim, drive, you name it the iRobot can do it. Dr. Jobs was almost finished. He left for awhile to go play with his children. His children were very excited to play with this new robot.              As Dr. Jobs and his beloved family played they heard a 'BANG'come from the confused scientist lab. Then they heard it again. 'BANG!'' I am sure you can imagine everyone scared and confused. They were. Except for Dr. Jobs , he was quite calm. His children made him go see what was going on in there, so he did. As he walked over to the door the door flung open. IT WAS THE ROBOT! The robot somehow, someway, finished itself! The robot started to do all kinds of things, clean up the house, sing, play with the children, he even walked the dog! Dr. Jobs couldn't believe what he was seeing. He was amazed but at the same time confused. 'I wasn't done yet how could this of happened?' he thought to himself.               His middle child, Violet, was the most excited about the new 'iRobot'. Violet was a 12 year old girl in 6th grade. Violet didn't have many friends, but she was still very happy. Dr. Jobs built this robot for her. He thought that this robot would be the perfect best friend for Violet. And it was.               A few months later Violet and the iRobot couldn't be separated. They were best friends. They did everything together. The iRobot taught Violet how to have fun. Violet couldn't stop thanking her dad for making her this new best friend.                    One day Violet and the iRobot were going out to the beach. When they got there it was really crowded. Violet recognized many people from school.  The iRobot told her just to ignore them. So they decieded to go on the trail that leads to the icecream shake. As they were walking on the dangerous trail         	. NNP NNP PRP RB VBN NN NN . NNP . NNP .

When I went to throw a ball of yarn the robot wouldn'd move.  I stopped and just watched it it got up and fed Mr. Knibbles.  Mr. Dew said I could go now, so i drove home as fast as I could.  I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house the robot was on the couch watching tv! I didn't know what to think or who to call!            I walked to it slowly it got up and ran to get my  keys to the car.  I  ran before it could get to them.  I picked up Mr. Knibbles and got in the car and drove away!  I called the designer of the robot and he said all of his robots were bugging out and acting like humans.  After a long time after investagaiting and hard research, and watching the video cameras someone snuch in and hit the overload button.  After all it wasn't that big of a deal I came home and the house was cleaned, and all the beds were made!

We might think that robots are for the future well think again. There are robots that help doctors,scientist,and even you.There are many more than you think like your dishwasher it has to think what to do it says I can use this our not . Your laundry dryer and washer beeps when its not locked. There's one last thing that thinks well there's more than these but back to the question your computer think when your online it has to find the search engain it has to think to find it.       the wool point of this is to find out there are more robots than you think. I mean people have mechanical arms your see people with mechanical eyes to. Its a matter of time before we make a robot that looks like a human. we have robots that git data for us in like volcano's. @Bing.com when you think of it you my find your a bit robot to like your daily cycle you stick to it its the only thing that helps you remember stuff.                                         What we do for them       We keep them clean and give them batteries to stay alive and work. we do simple stuff for them like keep the data in check. care for them like there them alive. there like humans that rust and go away for ever you might have a robot and not know it. when i was a little boy i watch a show called transformers they would fight other transformers they where basically robots is disguise     	MD NNS VB PRP IN NNP NNP NNP .

This robot will just a toy for certain fun occasions. We will need hot glue, a sharpie to draw the face, and cardboard boxes. So far we've have the legs, the body that we haven't glued on yet, the head, and a hat. I have decided that I should name the robot, Mexor. Mexor's personality will be playful and wild but he will also have an angry personality but that won't be shown too often. Another good thin Mexor will have is he is limber to become a ninja.                             My brother went downstairs at 3:00 in the morning and got coffee right where Mexor was at. My brother also saw that Mexor's arm was flinching and found that Mexor had came to life.'He put on his hat and started dancing,' my brother said. Although Mexor was just made yesterday, he could only dance. Everyday he could do something different like one day he able to sing which came much, much, later. One day he acted like a dog and started barking at other dogs and chased cats up trees. But sometimes he would act sad and mad when my brother and I would leave for sports.                                                Without warning, Mexor went all ferious and started trashing and messing up the house in any way he could think of.When my family got back to the house , my parents were mad. Before I could say anything, I was told to go find Mexor so he doesn't do anything to the city. A matter of fact, I couldn't even find evidence of Mexor. I had figured out that Mexor needed a friend or someone who is also lonely. So we made another robot that was the name Lexor. So, by then, Mexor had already destroyed half of the city and people were calling the airforce so it wouldn't turn out too good for Mexor.                                I had brought Lexor with me to calm down Mexor and so Mexor has a friend so he doesn't get mad like that in the future. The airforce had already fired stuff at Mexor. I said, 'Mexor, Come here.'They had both became friends and no more destruction was caused to the city.They both lived happily in a cardboard house full of pictures of them both with their good memories they've made 	DT NNP NNP NN CC PRP VBP VBN TO VB DT NNP NNP NN MD RB DT NN IN JJ NN NNP NNP MD VB JJ NN , DT NN TO VB DT NN , CC NN NNP NNP RB PRP VBP VBP DT NNS , DT NN IN PRP VBP RB VBN IN RB , DT NN , CC DT NNP NNP VBP VBN IN PRP MD VB DT NN , NNP NNP POS NN MD VB JJ CC JJ CC PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN CC IN MD RB VB VBN RB NNP NNP NN NN NNP MD VB VBZ PRP VBZ RBR TO VB DT NNP NNP NN VBD NNS IN CD IN DT NN CC VBD NN RB WRB NNP VBD NNP NNP NN RB VBD IN NNP POS NN VBD VBG CC VBN IN NNP VBD VBD TO NNP NN IN PRP$ NN CC VBD VBG , '' PRP$ NN NNP NNP NNP VBD RB VBN NN , PRP MD RB NNP NNP PRP MD VB NN JJ IN CD NN PRP JJ TO NN WDT VBD RB , RB , NNP NNP NN PRP VBD IN DT NN CC VBD VBG IN JJ NNS CC VBD NNS IN NNP CC RB PRP MD VB JJ CC JJ WRB PRP$ NN CC PRP MD VB IN NNP NNP NN , NNP VBD DT JJ CC VBD VBG CC VBG RP DT NN IN DT NN PRP MD VB JJ PRP$ NN VBD RP TO DT NN , PRP$ NNS VBD NNP NNP NNP MD VB NN , PRP VBD JJ TO VB NN NNP RB PRP VBZ RB VB NN TO DT NNP DT NN IN NN , PRP MD RB RB VB NN IN NNP NNP VBD VBN RP IN NNP VBD DT NN CC NN WP VBZ RB NNP NNP PRP VBD DT NN IN VBD DT NN NNP NNP , IN RB , NNP VBD RB VBN NN IN DT NN CC NNS VBD VBG DT NN RB PRP MD RB VB RP RB JJ IN NNP NNP VBD VBN NNP IN PRP TO VB RP NNP CC RB NNP VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBZ RB VB VBN IN DT IN DT NNP NNP NN VBD RB VBN NN IN NNP NNP VBD , JJ , NNP NNP VBD DT NN NNS CC DT RBR NN VBD VBN TO DT JJ DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN JJ IN NNS IN PRP DT IN PRP$ JJ NNS PRP VBP VBN

Then, I would have a robot that would make me food whenever I get hungry. Next, I would have a robot that would play with me whenever I get bored and when I have no one to play with. Finally, I would like a robot that would help me do homework so I could finish my homework way faster.       The first robot would drive me around anywhere I want and I would call it 'Drive 32'. Drive 32 would be a medium sized car that would allow 2 people to fit. Drive 32 would take me anywhere I wanted if my parents couldn't take me. I could drive to the grocery store and groceries for my parents. Drive 32 could also take me to school in the morning and back home. That's why I want my own robot car.        The next robot would be that could make me food and I would call it 'Cookatron'. Whatever I'm craving I would ask Cookatron to make it for me and it would taste delicious. Then, I would tell Cookatron to make me lunch for school if no one else could.That's why having a cooking robot is helpful.        Finally, I would have a homewrok robot called 'Work 25-1'. Work 25-1 would help me with my homework so it wouldn't be so complicated. Having a homework robot is useful cause it can teach you wotk that you still don't understand. So, having robots can be very useful for an everyday life.

The scientists, four in total, suspected nothing. Their names were Robert, Bob, Ben, and Joe. They were the scientists that created the Gemini Scout. It is a robot for search and rescue in mineshaft.         So when they got a call that's what they thought it was going to be. And that's what it was for a time. The Gemini Scout was being maneuvered down an eery dark tunnel of rock and splintered wood. The scientists were studying air samples to make sure the lost miners weren't poisoned. They were also looking through it's many cameras to see if they could find any miners.         After around thirty minutes the Gemini became harder to control and would occasionally stray off course. Although they felt with all the ground they'd covered and having not found any miners they couldn't pull back now. Then suddenly the main camera went out! Then then the thermal camera too! Now with not being able to see what the Gemini was doing they'd have to go retrieve it manually.         Then a message was sent from the Gemini saying 'Help me I cannot see,' the scientists thought they had accidentally found a miner who was using the Gemini's communications. They decided that now they had to go into the mineshaft because, not just the Gemini was in danger, but someone's life. So they decided to send Robert down with all the necessary gear and if it was to much he could always call them down on his walkie-talkie.         So Robert began his journey into what was now just a black hole waiting to envelope him. He started by simply following the trail that the Gemini had left behind.It was along and perilous decent into total darkness. It was many hours later when the others first heard of him. He said that he had found the Gemini, but no miner. He later explained that the Gemini sent the message by it's own will and that down here it had devoloped feelings.         When Robert and the Gemini surfaced from the blackness they were friends. Every mission afterward the Gemini acted on it's own and it's team of friends helped it rescue more miners.

Robots,are a good source of inviorment because robots such as Dante and Dante 2,climb volcanos,gather information,and help scienctists with their work in the labortory.Mr.Gower is another robot that can help save live's,carry people when they cant get back up,and support the people and the scienctists.Agribots,is a fruit robot with means it pick's fruit. it can pick fruits like berries,oranges,grapes,apples,pears,bananas and PINEAPPLES!they have giant arms because,the arms pick up lots of fruit.Another robot named HRP-4c,can even dance and sing for kids and adults.Many playful robots are made to copy animals,too.some robots play the way animals play while other robots play with animals.For example,moviemakers have designed huge robotic apes and dinosaurs to be in movies.But these kinds of robots aren't made only for movies.You can buy a lifelike pet,such as a dog,a seal,or even a dinosaur.                  Other robots help people play with live animals.One company,I-Pet companion,has made a robot that lets people play with kittens,but from a distance.When you log on the internet,you can control the robot from far away.The robot is put in a room full of kittens.It drags a piece of string for the kittens to chase.When it's your turn,you can control the robot to pull the string this way or that way.The kittens jump after the string as you push the controls.That is all.

One day Jillan was finished with his robot.  It was a success,he won a ton of money.  Everyone wanted to be him.  He had his own robot and a penthouse.  One night  Jillan said that if only his creation was alive.  Lucky for him right when he said that a shooting stars based by.  The next morning Jillan woke up from a noise.  It was his robot making breakfast for him.  The robot said,'Good morning master'.  Jillan was shocked he yelled out,'How are you alive'!  The robot said that when you wished for me to be alive the wish came true.  Jillan didn't feel so scared any more after the robot explained why he was alive.           Jillan said that we should give you a name.  The robot said that he always wanted to be named Carl.  Jillan said,'Ok i will name you Carl.  Jillan said that now that your alive what kind of things can you do.  Carl said that I can drive a car, make food, and do your chores.Jillan was so happy that day.            The next day Jillan went to work and Carl stayed home. Carl did all the chores made lunch and drove Jillan's car to get it   washed.When Jillan came he home he was shocked everything was clean.  Carl said if is everything ok master.Jillan said nothing and went to Carl and hugged him and said thank you.Carl hugged him back.          The next day Jillan said to carl,'Your coming to work with me'.  When Jillan and Carl arived everybody stared at him.  Jillan said to ignore them.  When they went in to a meeting Jillan's boss was amazed.He said that he never seen nothing like it.Carl said if he was talking to him. The boss said yes.  the boss man said,'How much do you want for him.  Jillan said that he's not for sale. The boss man got Carl by the hand and took him,but Jillan just in time stoped him and ran out the door with Carl. The boss man was chasing after him. Jillan and Carl ran out the door. Jillan put Carl in the car and went to the other side and got in. They went to the penthouse and and never saw the boss man again          Carl and Jillan stayed with each other and Carl never went out of the house and Jillan got a new job as a lawyer Then after a couple years Jillan got married and had kids and Carl Had to watch the kids when every Jillan and his wife had to go on a trip.

She was kind and sweet and loved just about everything. She had maids and servants to take care of her every  need. She was always very greatful every one of them. Athough it seemed that she had a wonderful life she didnt. Her father died when she was just a little girl and had been taken care of what her fathers money bought her. Ever since the tragedy she has wished on a star that something would come alive , so she could talk to her father.                 It was a clear day in Forks , no big news had come in ,just another simple day for her. Which is usually school and hanging out  with her friend Kayla. Bella was outside during lunch , having her usual chicken sandwhich. When all of a sudden little can fell from the sky. Bella with much curiosity picked it up and headed home.                 When she got home Silvia one her maids asked her , ' what do you havethere Bella.'   'o nothing ', and as fast as she could she raced upstairs . She was so curious of what it was , but had so much school work to do. So  she decided to do her work and then she would see what it was. In about two hours of homework she was getting  really tired. then decided to wait till tomorrow to investigate it . Bella  then started to pray that a blessing would help her communicate with her father. Then when she finally fell asleep the can came alive.                  After a long night of rest she woke up.Then all of a sudden heard a  CLANK. It startled her so much she jumped right out of bed to see what it was. She looked carefully into the closet and saw the live can. AHH she screamed . Then as soon as possible came a maid and said,' are you ok ?'. Bella murmured ,' the closet.' She looked into the closet and saw nothing. 'o bella it's nothing.'                  After the maid left she looked into the closet and shouted ,' there it is .', but nobody came. But the robot still remained. Bella said ,' are you gonna hurt me ?' no it replied.Then why are you here bella said in a scared way.To help you co mmunicate with your father.                   Bella time to go to school.She ate breakfast and  then she went . At school she was so eager to get home. She did'nt even touch her lunch and after her classes she rushed home.                  Could this be true? Can you communicate with him right now.   . Yes it said. Then is amazment it stared to communicate .And she heard he father! They talked for hours and hours. Then ended. She was still shocked  that that that was her father . In all of these years she never thought she could comminicate with her father ever again, but then came along a little can from heaven.

So he planned on making a robot that would do whatever you wanted it to do. His first designs where didn't work to well and all they could do is walk. He was very happy at what he had done so he made another design. His second design was very complex it had tons advanced circiuts.  It was able to pick things up, walk, and even say a few worlds like 'Hi' and 'bye'. He thought that was good enough for him so that was the last design he would make.

He wandered what the amazing little robot could do.He thought to himself i am old enough.As he goes to find some tools in the garage to pick at it.And as he walks up to the door the robot comes to life.The young man can not believe it! He looks at it with an uneven eye.Suddenly the robot flutter his eyes.The young man gets scared for a moment.Then he notices the robot wants to play with him.Just then the boy picks up a ball and toss it to the robot and the robot caught it, and they started tossing the ball to each other.The young man can not believe what he was seeing,he was so amazed by the tiny little robot.Then the young man notice the robot was missing a part such as a wheel.So the young man brightly goes and gets a few tools and a wheel from the garage.He attaches the wheel,but it takes him a few to get it on the robot,because the robot is a little scared of the young man touching him.But the young man told the robot it was OK,so the young man eventually attaches it to the robot.                    The young man says ill name you....charlie-bot because my name is charlie and your a robot.And charlie and charlie-bot got along well.Charlies dad was amazed as well and didn't  know what to say about the robot,he was speechless.Charlies dad was very proud of his son and asked son how did u get charlie-bot to work i could never get him to function right for me.Charlie replied i don't know...when i was going to go get tools to try to fix him he just came to life.Charlies dad did not understand.But charlies dad really didn't care he was just glad that his disabled son had a friend to play with and talk to,charlie was just happy his dad was proud of him.And eventually the charlie-bot became a part of the family.

First, the Gemini-Scout can help trapped miners, also the Dante 2 gathers infroemation for scientists to know about volcanos, then Mr. Gower brings the medicine to patients, and the Agribots bring fruit to people. In the next paragraph, you will learn about the stories and the rest of the robots.       About 50 years ago, the author, Isaac Asimov, wrote a story called I Robot. The story takes place in the future, when robots take care of children. Then, a company, the I-Pet Companion, creats robots to play with kittens and you can have a robot pet. Lastly, some robots at many Oregon colleges play hockey or shuffleboard. Lastly, there are cars that can do things in cartoons.       For example on Regular Show, there is a episode called 'K.I.L.I.T. Radio' where a radio station is controlled by a robot. Another example is during Jimmy Neutron, a episode has a robot that is a brother thats known as 'Brobot'. Lastly on Spongebob Squarepants, Sandy Cheeks built many robots to help her with the world records book. In conclusion Robots can be found in cartoons, books, and reality for many years.

A boy named Marty had a science project due in two weeks. He stood up all night just thinking what he was going to do. The topic was science fiction and he was frustrated because he was more into history. Marty decided to go to sleep just hoping that an idea will come to mind when he wakes up with the sun rising. It was Sunday and Marty decided to take a walk in Times Square. He promised his mom that he would be home by 7:00 for dinner. He stopped by Mr.Bill's Candy Shop because he was really into sugar. He bought three sour punch straws, four tootsie rolls and eight mini lollipops. He walked by the Empire State Building admiring the sky scraper when a brilliant idea came to mind!                                                                                                 He was going to create a robot that looked exactly like a dinosaur because he was also really into dinosaurs, but the big question is how will he do it. He knew the idea was bizarre, but he thought he could do it. He looked at his watch and it was 7:13! He quickly got into the first bus he could see and gave the bus driver his home address. The bus driver demanded 50 cents but Marty forgot that he spent all of his money on the candy! Instead, he gave the bus driver 4 mini lollipops and the bus driver accepted it. By the time he got home his mother and his four older siblings (all sisters) were eating on the table. His mother or sisters didn't mind that he was late. Since they were in a happy mood, Marty told them all about his project. They were actually surprised that he was tempting to do that. Suddenly his dad came really excited. He said that he won the lottery for 17.5 million dollars! All you could here in the house is 'we're rich, we're rich, we're rich!' It was the happiest day of their lives.                  The next day, Marty got started on building his dinosaur robot. Four hours later, he got too frustrated and smashed everything on the floor. He was making really good progress, but it probably wasn't the project he wanted. He got his raincoat and took another walk through Times Square really mad. It was raining harder than ever before in the history of New York! Suddenly, he didn't know where he was. He ran through the aisles of New York really scared. He bumped into something hard and tripped. He saw that it was the size of a microwave but it had more details. It looked almost like a robot! He was about to touch it when suddenly, he saw that thunder struck the microwave-shaped item. He was scared than ever before. He started running when the microwave-shaped item started chasing him. It looked like it had wheels, but then it got up on its legs and also started running. Marty had fainted scared out of his mind!                    It was Monday morning and it was a school day. Marty woke up with the living robot on his chest. He also saw his dad (a police officer) slapping his face. He suddenly screamed out of his mind. His dad covered his mouth because there was reporters shoving microphones in his face. He saw CNN, ABC News, and also HLN! They were all his favorite news channels. He almost forgot about the robot. He screamed again with his dad covering his mouth again. His dad took him home to explain what happened last night with the robot listening. He explained everything even the robot. His dad said that he is not going to school because then those reporters will get in his face again. Marty accepted his rules and didn't go to school until next week.                   Saturday was coming and Marty was excited! He really felt great about how cool his life is. He was rich, he was famous and on top of that, he had his project due for Thursday! The only problem was that he didn't know how he was going to present his robot. He called his robot MJ2 which means Marty Junior the second. He was staring at his robot and the robot was staring at him. He told the robot to speak and so the robot said ''Marty.' Marty was really shocked! He told the robot to do tricks and so the robot was flying higher than Marty! The robot can also act like a human, sing and walk! Marty knew that he was gonna get a A++++++++++++++. He couldn't hold himself so he just waited until Thursday to present his project.                    It was Thursday, and Marty was ready to present his project. When he arrived in school, the MJ2 was walking right behind him. Students were asking questions like 'how did you make that?'' or girls were saying comments like ' you guys look so cute together!' Marty was the party of the school! Other students created projects like statues of aliens or pretending to dissect a frog. Marty was the last in line to present his project. He was excited, but also nervous. He didn't know what to say, but he remembered what MJ2 can say, 'Marty.' He was too sure of himself that he would get more than a A+. Forty minutes passed and it was Marty's turn to present his project. Marty presented his project by telling the MJ2 to stand up, fly and say his name. He also said a speech about it. One of his lines were I didn't come to the MJ2, the MJ2 came to me. Everybody gave him a good round of applause because Marty's project was so great, and Marty also got a A++.                      Twenty Five years passed and Marty was all grown up. He had a nice family, and he works for the C.I.A. Marty creates more robots and a lot of spy equipment. The MJ2 still lives better than ever. He got new upgrades like laser eyes and a better body. Marty never forgot the day he got an A++. Marty is 37 years old. He has two kids and a wife. His kids names are Marty Robinson and Maple Robinson. His wife's name is also Maple Robinson. Marty is a billionaire and also one of the richest men in the world. His four sisters are superstars in hip-hop. His mom and dad own the Empire State Building now. People offered more than a billion dollars for the MJ2. Marty always ignored them because he thought about something. He didn't come to the MJ2, the MJ2 came to him!

He went Monkey Monkey Monkey  all day.  He even ate bananas.  One day somebody stole Bo Bo's bananas.  He was really mad.  He looked and looked for his bananas.  Until there was a note that said,'got your bananas.  He was determined to hunt that banana stealing person.            He had finally found him.  It was a flat out dull.  Bo Bo was surely gonna get his bananas back.  Until the person said April fulls.  Bo Bo said its May.  The person said well May fulls,  I hid them in your processor. Bo Bo said get them out.

The next day when I went to school, I was bragging that I found. I said 'I found this cool new robot, and it can do anything I want!' Then my freind said 'Well lets see it in action!' and everybody gasped. I thought to my self 'Oh no! What have i done?'       So I stayed up late that night; then I went down to the garage and tried every thing to get it working, but nothing happened, so I said 'This is useless!' then right when I was walking out, it turned on. So I screamed and shouted. I was so happy.        The next day I rode it to school, oh wait I didn't tell you it can transform into anything? Well it sure can. Anyway, I rode it to school and all my freinds were gatherd around me and my robot. It was my body gaurd. And then I was the coolest kid in school. But I didn't care about that.       So we went everywhere together. Everybody liked me when I went by them. I was famous. Then someone put a chip a chip in him and he went crazy. He terroized the city then I spotted the chip, pulled it out and called the police. And they arrested the guy who put the chip in him. Then everything went back to the way it was.

All of a sodden the robot came to life. Now the robot could do anything that John asked,like another human being. It could even become an animal.Jhon was amazed.            Now that John new that this robot could do something he thought he would become rich. John then later posted posters and talked on radios because everyone new it was a success.Then shortly after John was rich the robot became mad. The robot got no attention or thanks that he came alive.The robot was going to have a talk with John.            After the talk John decided that he should give credit to the robot. Then later that afternoon on a talk show John revealed the secret. Everyone was shocked that the most famous person was not so famous. The robot then became friends with everyone and forgave John.            The live robot was not alive to the world. Everyone new about him and John. John never kept a secret from his robot again. John then later made another friend for robot and lived happily ever after.

'Whew, we finally created the perfect robot,' said scientist Ziggs. 'We created him with everything anyone could wish for.' 'It has the power of a Mr. Gower, carrying things up to 500 pounds.' 'It has the intelligence of the Gemini-Scout, being able to collect information anywhere.' 'It also has the playfulness of the HRP-4c, singing and dancing when asked to.' 'I will finally boot up this robot, and show its glory to the world!' yelled Ziggs. However, the robot suddenly emits pulsing waves throughout the lab, shattering vials of chemicals. The robot comes to life, and Ziggs didn't even touch it yet. The robot takes a moment to look at Ziggs, then tackles through the lab's walls, making a thundering sound and vanishing with the wind. Ziggs remains baffled, curious to what made the robot suddenly come to life...                  The robot appears in a friendly town, not knowing where it is. The robot seems to be in the shape of a little boy, featuring all the components of one. The robot decides to learn where he is, and who he is. He names himself Tim, and goes on to a sidewalk. It seems that Ziggs implanted emotional circuits into Tim, making him have emotions. While walking along the sidewalk, Tim comes across a girl named Annie, who is looking for her teddy bear named Tibbers. Tim finds Tibbers in a bush, and gives it to Annie. Annie thanks Tim, and invites him into her house. Tim asks very many questions, and learns this neighborhood is called Valoran. The country it is in is Demacia, a shining country who rules with peace. Tim meets the parents of Annie, and they greet him. The parents ask, 'Where are your parents? Do they live around here?' Tim tells them that he doesn't have a mother, but he is a robot with emotions. The parents gasp, feeling sorry for him. Tim quietly cries to himself, feeling sorry too. The parents ask, 'Would you like to live with us' Tim immediatly replies, 'Yes, I would love too!' After a few days, Tim enrolls into Annie's class, being brother and sister. Tim makes new friends, and loves it at Annie's house. Ziggs on the other hand, is still confused of all the events that happened. Ziggs only knows he has to clean up this mess, all by himself. Ziggs then says to himself, 'Well, I may have only known that robot for a long time, but he is quite the troublemaker...' Tim makes his way home with Annie, and he lives quite happily for the rest of his life.                                                                             ~THE END~         	NN CD VBN , NN CD DT NNP NNP , PRP RB VBD DT NN NN , '' VBD NN NNP NNP VBD PRP IN NN NN MD VB NNP POS JJ VBZ DT NN IN DT NNP NNP , VBG NNS IN TO CD NNP POS JJ VBZ DT NN IN DT NN , VBG JJ TO VB NN NNP '' JJ RB VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ , VBG CC VBG WRB JJ NNP '' NNP MD RB VB RP DT NN , CC NN PRP$ NN TO DT NN .

If a plant is too dry , a robot will water it . when a robot senses that a tomato is ripe it uses a mechanical arm to pick the tomato. agribots may seem unusual now , but one day they may be common on farms. And that is all the things that interest me the most i guess . 	PRP$ JJ NN WDT JJ PRP DT RBS VBZ DT NN NN IN , PRP VBD NNS IN NNS WDT NNS RB RB VB NN CC PRP VBP PRP .

As i scream, mother and father ran down the stairs asking me what was wrong and asking me why i was down there,hen they seen the awaken robot.I can tell by my fathers face, that he was shocked on what he had seen.He raced to the robot and begins pressing buttons, as mother and me go up stairs.When my father comes up, he tells me that i should never go down there ever again.

I was so excited to see all the animals and finally see the Agribot robot!                       As we got off the buss the sun was really bright. The farmer greeted us with a big smile. He said, 'Hello kids, who's ready for a tour of the farm?' Everybody said, 'Me!' He gave us a tour of the animals and pond, but then he showed me the most amazing thing i had ever seen! The Agribot robot! It was picking fruits and putting them in a basket, but that s all i saw because when i walked over to take a second look the farmer said we must go. I knew I had to see it again!                  It was about one o'clock and we had already eaten lunch. The tour was over, and all the kids were asking the farmer lots of questions. So I sneaked of to look at the Agribot. I walked to tree that the Agribot was at. 'Hello.', I said to myself. And guess what! It said hello back. I was stunned.  And then he talked again. 'What's your name?' it said. 'Joey', I said back. 'My name is Buster, how may I help you?' he said. I almost dropped dead! 'You, you,you can talk?' I said shakily. 'Why yes, all robots can talk.', said Buster.                             Once I got used to Buster talking to me, he was actually really cool! We talked about all the different kinds of robots and how they worked. He also talked about how he was on a secret mission to save planet Earth. He told me that aliens portray to be evil and take over Earth in books and movies, but some are actually nice creatures. Buster said I couldn't tell anyone about his secret, and I swore. To be honest , I was a little scared! Bad aliens from Jupiter were trying to destroy Earth, so him and his alien buddies were saving Earth by working to help farmers and doctors, but fighting crime at night.                        I was a little freaked out when everything was over with. Who wouldn't be though? Honestly I didn't know if I was imagining all this or if it were real. Finally I realized it was time to go back before the bus left. 'Good by Buster it was really nice meeting you.', I said. 'Nice meeting you too.', Buster said. I told him good luck on him mission and that if he was ever in town again, call me. Buster was a really cool robot.                       When I got back to the lunch site it was time to go. I said thank you to the farmer for having me at his farm, but he didn't really say anything. That day was probably the most interesting day of my life! I mean who else has met a good robot that was on a secret mission to save Earth from evil aliens? No one I know. I never told anybody about that day, and don't plan on it. People will just think I am crazy. So if you ever meet an robot named Buster that's on a secret mission trying to save Earth from evil aliens, tell him his friend Joey said hi.

It was time to go back home the writing teacher said ok well I started writing my bike all the way back to my house.And so yeah I got home and I sat down In a chair and started writing and I was done with the writing homework like 2:00 hours It took me. Ok I read It to my mom the story was about to begin ok my mom said. I all started Ina dark and rainy day and a kid named Michael he was getting ready to get all his things for a soccer game his team      Colombus agains C.fire with his rival Junior the game was going to take place In Madrid Spain he got in the car but suddently a creepy robot showed up he told Michael that he was going to eat him he started to runand the robot chased him they were heading to the woods and the robot ran so fast that he crashed Into a tree and the tree broke and he blew up so Ronaldo was saved he got to his soccer game his team won the score was 6-4 they were the champions of the uefa champions leuge. Mom said great story It was the day I read It to the writing class they said great you won the contast good job and that Is the end.Thank you every body ok we really apreciate It.            So I figured out that robots have allot of chemicals that they have Inside their metal body and   I never knew that so I thought that It Is kind of cool to now about robots so that's why Im happy that Im the one who got picked to write the story about the robot that comes back live so It's hard to believe that robots come back alive but all the history soposelly they come back alive that's what the teacher told me she said that she Is an expert on that stuff but like you know I say yes but I really don't belive her because the only people that know Is the people In the old days so that's my opinion but I actually do believe It so believe In the time back then not the present or feuture.                            I suddently got home I told my mom that I won the writing contest she said she was so proud of me my family Is so rich that she gave me $1,000 dollars she said thank you son I will call your dad he Is on Germany on vacation that you have won the writing contest ok she told me I told her It's fine tell my father. So she did she called my father and I personaly told him that I passed my test he said that's great when I get home I will give you a present for geting a 100% on your test ok he told me and I told him back yeah that's great I will be waiting for you ok bye call you tomorrow I told him ok bye.It was tuesday  my dad got back and my present was a very expencive motorcycle when I saw It I was so happy and then we went to a restuarant and we lived happy for ever see you later my friends this Is were the story I told you came to an end bye see you next time.

I wrote everything that the robot was doing.Then I came back to my house to finish my story about the robot.My mom said,'did you see that crazy robot throwing lasers all over the buildings,'Yes I did '.Then I went to my clubhouse with my friends talking about the robot striking all the buildings.We had a important talk about the robot.We said,'Lets make a robot story'.So we agreed to make story's about the robot        I went to my room to finish my story.Then outside there were more robots outside my window.I told my friends to come to my room,then my friends saw the robots.They were amazed seeing the robots on my window.Then they left off forever.My friends and me made a story together about the robots.We made the best story ever thanks to the robots.        For my conclusion the robots are the best science fiction story for me and for my friends forever.That story was the best for me because it felt important about the robots and for me.

So he continued to walk down on the side walk and finally when it seemed forever he reached his junior high and went to his first period class. When he entered math (first period) he flopped down on his seat right in the back of the class. Mrs.Quinn smiled and cleared her through'hello and good morning class. I hope you all did last nights work.' Phil shrugged and sighed of boredom he could already tell it was going to be a long day. After about 30-40 minutes the bell rang to go to second period. With an other long sigh Phil stod up and gathered all his things and shoved them into his backpack. Befor he could leave Mrs.Quinn called him over to the front of the class. 'Phil may i please have a word with you?' Phil walked over a little scared thinking he had done something wrong or bad. With a small smile Mrs.Quinn gave to phil she said 'i would like to give you something.' she went to the back of the room and came back with a small box and handed it to Phil 'here open it when you get home.' Phil faked a smile 'thanks i guess...well i gotta go to second period bye Mrs.Quinn.' when Phil got home he went up to his room and took out the small box from his backpack. 'hmm i wonder why its so small. It might have a pencil in it or somethig.'he opened it and saw a tiny robot in side. 'wow who needs this for?!' he tosed it a side and it moved he jumped and got a little closer to pick it up. the robot stod up and befor it did anything else Phil picked it up and put it back in the box. 'why would Mrs.Quinn give me this?' he thought to himself. The next day when he got to school he took the box with the robot inside of it and put it on Mrs.Quinn's desk.

'Oh Synthia, why don't you understand? I'm Dr.Ed, I can and will do anything and everything.!' I'll show her one day, I'm gonna build a robot! , Ed thought.Synthia just ignored him and walked to her things.       'I have to go now Dr.Ed. I'll be back tomorrow.'Synthia grabbed her things and placed them neatly in her bag.She began walked out when Dr.Ed replied, 'But it's the weekend tomorrow, don't you ever have fun?' 'Dad, I don't have stuff to do on the weekend. Plus, even you are more fun than listening to mom howl her weekend song.' Synthia walked out leaving her father, Ed , with a smile on his face.       Synthia's parents divorced when she was young. Leaving the young blonde to wonder.                                 3 weeks later           The machine lay on Ed's lab table. Nobody was there, But then...    a clatter of metal stuck the floor. The robot was actually alive!   It opened the door and left the lab.           Synthia walked the streets and saw people running. What in the world? Synthia wondered. She saw a robot... HER FATHERS ROBOT! She ran to her fathers, yanked him out of bed and yelled, 'THE ROBOTS ALIVE YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP!!!!' Together they ran to the scene. 'How do we... catch it?' Synthia asked. 'RUN FOR IT!' they ran and caught the robot.           'Dad, I cant believe you brought it to life!' Synthia hugged her father. 'To the lab Dr.Ed?' 'To the lab Miss.Peirce.'

My name is Cornelius and I'm fourteen years old and I'm going to tell you a story of how a got a job at the most expensive companies in the world. it started when I was twelve. I was living in the dirtiest place you could think of. But, one day some people from the s.o.s.a.s. or school of space age science came and did whats called a swep in this place and find kids that have at lest some brains and take a test and if they pass they get a job at the s.o.s.a.s. when hey are old enough.so when they came by this really nice lady looked at me for one moment and sprayed me with a hose! then they grabbed me and I was out of there. Finally! In the van there are about nine kids and I'm the youngest here.When we get there the build was huge! It was maybe a hundred and fivety floors.When we got out and inside the same lady that sprayed me came up and said,'hello, I am Emily Night and I run the robotics division here. Today you will take a test and if you pass you just may get a job here.'   'You have robots?'   'Yes, and if you are good I might show you.'   So  off we went up to the 85th floor  and into a test room. But, before I sat down that girl Emily took me out of the room and said 'How you doing?'   'Still a little wet.' I said.   'Well sorry about that but you need to look 5% decent,what's your name?'   I paused for a sec to get my thoughts strait.   'C-Cornelius.' I said.   'Welcome to the s.o.s.a.s.   'but I have not even taken the test yet!'   'Your smart, figure it out.'   a few minutes later I was in the lab with m new best friend Steve. he is six feet tall and is a robot. In the nextthree weeks I had learned how to make robots program them and teach Steve how to play soccer!

After that much years, the robot somehow got brought back to life and started drilling up. The robot finally got out and enjoyed the sun light. The robot enjoyed until a grandpa decided to shoot him with a rocket launcher because the robot looked creepy. It was rusted to the max, had a broken eye,his head was sticking out, and had very old oil dripping. The robot exploded and quickly reformed itself adding a bunch of other new metal materials such as steel, iron, and titanium. The robot looked brand new but right after that, it fell over and wasn't alive anymore. The grandpa left and a boy came and picked it up.           The boy brought it home and played with it until he saw a place that said,' Shine Sunlight Here!' Out of curiosity, the boy did it. The robot instantly came to life. Apprently the boy didn't have a family and was an orphan. The robot saw that and was sad. The robot figured out he was bigger than the boy and had an opening and had a space inside him for the boy to live in. The robot left,stole a carpet, clothes, game systems, games, and equiped a thing that can make any food, and a tiny hospital. The robot came back and said,' Live in me,' so the boy went inside. The robot basically became his parent until he wasd an adult. The robot was sad to see the boy go away. The boy was thinking for a second and he let the robot follow him.              50 years later the 'boy' died an the robot was losing power for some reason. The next day the robot shut down and the dead boy was in him. 1,000,000 years later, of course the boy shattered into dust, some miners found the robot.The miners observed thr robot.After a while, they saw a sign that said,'Shine Sunlight Here!', and it broke into thosands of pieces but the head.

It was a bright sunny day, all the humans where happily doing their work half of it was getting done with a robots help.Then suddenly all the robots stopped working. all the humans dident know what to do.That night when all the humans where asleep, all the robots got together and made a organization called the: robots rights now! The next morning the humans  found all the robots in a huddle.All the humans where looking at the robots. the robots said give us rights now!!! rights for what the humans? said.We want to do what we want for a living not what you tell us to do!the robots said.So what do you want us to do ? the humans said. GIVE US WHAT WE WANT! the robots said.So the humans gave out job applications. The robots where free citasins now. The robots where getting paid and working at stores.They wherent used living and paying money on things.they started to not like this life so much.So they went to the humans and asked to go back to living for free and working for them.The humans agreed and everything was back to normal.

' If only we could get it to sit up now.' my partner says. 'We mustn't tell anybody in town until we can at least get it to stand up properly.' I said. We were in our laboratory in our small town in the year 2060. we were the first scientists to figure out how to make a robot come alive and talk. Well, we haven't quite gotten to the talking part, but in the very near future we will be there.       We were trying to get a robot that will help people with special needs. This was a hopeful statement considering our robot can't even stand up. 'Well maybe we should just call it a day' I said sadly. We walked out of our laboratory, which is just a basement of an old building nobody uses anymore, when we heard a great crashing sound. We ran as fast as we could to see what had happened. When we got there all of our chemicals had fallen on top of our robot who had closed its eye's. After we had cleaned our floor, we realized the robot had disappeared. We had to search all over the basement when we saw the door propped open. We ran up the steps two stairs at a time hoping to catch the robot before it made its grand escape to downtown.           We caught the robot quickly because it had barely made it passed the hallway. It had died down before it got to the main entrance. It was then that we realized the chemicals were the reason our robot had woken up and had started to work. We then went back to work on getting more of those chemicals that we had had in our laboratory. we were going to see if this really was the case of our robot mysteriously coming to life.           The next day we got back to work early in the morning. We had all the supplies ready to go so we set to work.First we propped up the robot, then we mixed all of the chemicals, then we poured the mixture all over the robot. At first it didn't work, but then somehow, someway it opened it's eyes and said hello to us. At first I was a little freaked out, but then I thought that it's only a robot.           After a few days we had to get more chemicals. I then realized we need to figure out a way to not have the chemicals wear off.I then thought of trying to only mix certain chemicals together.' I finally got the perfect mixture' I said to myself. We tried it out and sure enough it turned out perfect. We then made our robot public. It brought so much attention to our small town. This robot then went to the hospital to help perform surgeries on patients. These surgeries were special though. They were surgeries to help blind people get their eyesight back,  deaf people get their hearing back, and  paralyzed people get the feelings back in their bodies. This robot helped to save millions of lives. She even helped save my live after I was in an explosion in my very own laboratory. I then thought of the perfect name for my robot.       Hero.           My buddy and I then decided to make many more robots. None quite as special as Hero. Hero is still in the hospitals today, but nowhere near me. This is because she is needed where more people are injured. Robots are a mans, or woman's, best friend! This is a story of how robots came to save many lives of humans and including my own. I now hope you love robots as much as myself. Maybe someday you'll get to see Hero my best friend and life-saver. 	POS PRP VBD PRP . . . .

I think I am suplase when robot is tallking because they are communicate each other. the next thing I am suplase  is they can talk so I can know what they think because they say what they thinking about.         The next thing I am tallking about is robot can help people. Big thing I am suplise is robot can do oppletion with people because oppletion is very hard to do it. The next thing I am suplise about is    robot can help sick people.       Lastly I am suplise by the robot is robot can go to dangarous place that people can go in it. robot can search because if robot had camela they can see and if robot go in to a dangarous place robot can get rocks or other things like that. The next thing is robot can search how dangarous is         As you can see robot can do many thing like talk, help people, and   go to dangerous place that people can't go in it like volcanoes.

So they made a robot called R2D2. R2D2 was a robot that liked to play (like star wars R2D2). So the girl and the robot played and played until they got a letter. It said: There is a wall on  your right, Don't worry its not bright. R2D2 will find they way, Then is your time to PLAY. She was exited and worried at the same time then R2D2 shut off and then turned back on and went to the right and busted open the wall that had the door in it.          'whoa cool let keep going.'           They went all the way through and saw something waiting but it was SOMETHING!!! It was hero-brine. He had a diamond sword a diamond pix axe and he had diamond armor, and for I, I had nothing.               R2D2 had nothing but he started to fly and all of a sudden 2 Pegisises came out of nowhere and killed Herobrine. That was awesome. Then R2D2 vanished and went away.               I didn't know what to do so i went back and my parents were home and I told them all about it. They knew that would happen but not about herobrine. So now i defiantly believe in robots, pegises, and herobrine.... but it was a fun adventure for like 2 days.

When I got home I gave the fruits to my mom then I went to go research on the robot. I had found out the robot liked to pick fruits. When I went to pick fruits again I saw the robot picking fruits too. I did a little more research of the robot. I found out that the robot name is Agribot. The next day I saw the robot. When I saw the robot I came up to him and asked him and said , 'Why do you keep picking fruits everyday ?' The robot had reply by saying , 'I like to pick out , fruits it is my job to pick out fruits anyway.' After we talked I left home.                   When I saw the robot today he wasn't picking fruits. I asked him why he wasn't picking fruits. It said , 'The fruits are being taken by man kind and your the only one who can save the fruits.' I said , 'How can I save the fruits your a robot can't you just shoot lasers at them so they stay away from the fruits.' The robot had reply saying , 'We robots don't have the ability to shoot lasers , we only pick fruits and that's it. So we agree we were gonna have to save the fruits together. We planned on putting cameras on trees near the fruit. Once we put the cameras on the trees we connected the camera to my laptop. We waited and waited all day but the robbers had still not came. Then hours had pass by and then we had saw the robbers. Then we said , 'Stop!' but they still ran away with the fruits. The next day we decided we put traps near the fruits so they wouldn't get away. The robbers were capture by our trap when we walked up to the robbers we asked them why they kept stealing the fruits. They said that they had a restaurant and they didn't have fruits because they were poor. We asked how you guys get poor and they said , 'We lost all our money because we were robbed.' We said , 'We could try to help you get the money back.'               We decided to sell the Agribot for 150,000 dollars and make sure the guy had a farm. So somebody had bought the Agribot and the Agribot went to a nice farm to pick fruits. The robbers had alot of money for the restaurant and I had alot of fun saving the restaurant and trying to save the fruits. I wish I can do this all over again.

We finally came back from the store I opened my new toy as quickly as possible.I had soccer practice at 5:30 and it was 5:00 I told the robot to get my soccer shoes,my soccer clothes,a water bottle,and my shin guards.Soccer practice ended at 7:00 my back started hurting,so I told the robot to give me a massage for 20 minutes.My mom told me I had to do my chores,so I told  Bobby to do my chores.He was done like in 1:30 minutes he had to wash the car,cut the grass,and clean up the mess in my room.                                                                                                                                           Today was Monday I had Star testing we had star test only on Monday,Wednesday,and Friday.I told bobby to transform into me so he could go to school instead of me and take the star test.School was finally over I told Bobby how did  it go he said to boring.

Scientist have built him to help people in the hospital because they sometimes need medicine right there in their hands or right there in that room.           When the group of scientist built him he wasnt alive because they barely built him,but when they finished they had some electric wires and they had a machine that was connected to it.When they turned on the machine and they were ready to turn him alive the robot turned on and got up.When he got up the scientist started writing down alot information on that robot.They tested him to see if he knows what he is supposed to do.After a while Mr.gower got up and started getting thing a putting it in his cabinet to take it to docters and nurses.When the scientist asked for medicine the robot gave him some,but it wasnt actually medicine it was types of formula that they had.When they finished testing him they took him to the hospital and explained to all the workers how he is used and that they need to talk to him so he would do things for you.When they told them all the information they need to know,when the group had left the robot at the hospital they got congratulated by the end of that expierment.         By the end the group of scientist had been asked to build that robot for other hospitals so that they can make their work easier because when they need medicine they could just get it from the robot that works for them,instead of making them go all thw way to the lab and getting what they need.That group got congradulated every single time they biult a new robot.

Some robots are very small but very strong. They even can drag people to safety.                           A robot called Agribots picks up fruit. It picks up berries, oranges ,  apples, and grapes. Some Agribots have giant arms that are towed behind trucks. Some even come in different size's. In a country called Japan there is a robot that picks strawberries and it senses the color berries.         In every plant it has a senser that tells robots what the plants need. If an plant is to dry the robot will water it. And even when a tomateo    is ripe a robot can sense it.

I was so nervous my dad and my brother were there watching me.Then the results came in and i got 2nd place.But my brother and dad were proud of me.My mom couldn't come because she was at work.But i got my 2nd place ribbon and that was the best science fair ever. I hope i get to have one again.That as so much fun!I had an adventure building my robot with my brother.

Of course, the teacher and my parents got furious at me. But it wasn`t my foult I used to much electrisity. I`ll explain how it all got started.       It was a super hot day here in Sacramento. My parents had the air conditioner on, but even the piece of ice I put on my forehead wouldn`t help. A day at the river? No. A shower? Not at all. Me and my friend, Aly, were sweating buckets. I thought a day in doors would help. Her house was the only cool place in this Sunday. But it was a bore. I wanted to go swimming, but I couldn`t `cause it wasn`t clean yet. The next day at school, my science teacher told the class, 'We are going to try and create a minature robot.You`ll have to find information about how to make one.You have two weeks to find some info. Then the school will pay for whatever you need for this project. It counts for 60% of your grade.You`ll partner up with one of your friends.' That was easy. I chose Olivian. She was my best friend ever sience we met. It wasn`t long, but she was a really cool person. 'Hey, Olive! Be my parter!', I yelled across the room.'Yeah, okay. Wait `till I get my stuff.', she replied. We did 'research' on the copmuter.'Hey, do you think I could come over to your place?', I asked her. I knew were she lived, I just never got the chance to actually go over to her house.'Yeah, I guess so, if my parents`ll let you.'.We made plans on when we could meet.'`Kay then, so tomorrow after school?'       'Tomorrow after school.',she replied.   ___       Right after school, I tried to consentrate on my work, but I couldn`t. Two weeks had passed, and our idea of having a robot of our own didn`t seem so good after all,What if other people had the same idea? What if there ideas were better than ours? Of course, right when we got our materials, everything went wrong... well, at least not how Olivian and I planned.We started building, but when we were about done, I asked Olive,' Dare me to put more energy on it?'       'DON`T you dare!', she warned.'You`re crazy!'.       'Now you tell me.', I muttered. But -no suprise- I didn`t listen.It did some very weard sounds, and then it`s eyes went blank.'See what you did! You are so ... ugh!', she yelled. That`s when it turned back on and said something like 'I like pizza!' and then the teacher came.' Are you two done?It ure seems like it. Is this you`re robot? It looks pretty amazing girls.', she said.       'Yep, this is our robot.And we are done with it.But something went a bit wrong.Right now it said something like-', then it got up and started going around the classroom yelling,'I like pizza! I like pizza!'. We chased it around the classroom.Now, if you ever create a robot that talks and ends up breaking your desk, I suggest for you to not go after it or it might try to 1) try to get you out of the classroom , or 2) get your best friend`s backpack torn to pieces while she`s wearing it. The teacher told everyone to get out of the classroom. As I got ahold of it, I turned it of and put it in my backpack.The teacher wasn`t very happy when she couldn`t find the robot. She wasn`t any happier when she found her sell phone broken into pieces.'Umm ... Mrs.Smelter, can I go home now.?', I asked.'Sure.I`ll have to see what else that robot did.'       As I left, Olivian wasn`t happy.'Have you lost you mind?You brought that thing to life and it destroyed my backpack!I had twenty bucks in there! You have got to pay me twenty. Then we`ll see if we get that A we want.'Then she left.As I got home I explained what happened at school.She wanted to see it.That`s when Aly came to knock .'Can you come out ?I heard the craziest knews you wouldn`t believe.'       'Sure.Let me show you something first.'I showed her the robot and she gasped.'This is what I wanted to tell you!If that`s the robot that destroyed a classroom, then you are in so much trouble.The cops are looking for this.'I couldn` believe my ears.My robot is a wild criminal now?I hadn`t even spent a day with it.'Then lets make this day last.Do you like strawberry milkshakes?'       An entire week had passed until the cops found my robot.When they took it, I was very sad.'Hey, this has been the best week of my life.You should feel happy.'I was, but I was gonna miss my robot.' okay.Lets go get some candy.I need some.'

He wanted to make a special kind of robot. He wanted to make a robot that made food for him. Day after day after day his robot wouldn't turn on. He tried everything but it wouldn't come on.              Two months have went by and he still had not accomplished his robot. But the worst part is he was starving. He didn't have nothing to eat. He started to feel light headed. He could not do nothing about it and then came the most shocking thing.   He screamed in joy! He could not belive it!              His robot had came to life! John was so happy to eat. He and his robots have became friends. After that day, John never starved. He always had company. He always had food. John's invention had come to life!

When she got the robot she was confused she said 'why a robot ?' She put it in her room and one day she came home from school and threw her backpack on the floor. When she came back she was looking for her backpack and it in the closet with her robot so she was scared so she touched it and it eyes opened. She didn't know what to do tell her parent or keep it a secret but if she told her parents they would kick it out or do experiment on it so she kept it a secret.So in the summer she was bored at home and she got her robot out and played music,listened to music,and played soccer.           But as days went on Evangelina got married and the robot just lived with her.So it seemed weird to live with a robot as an adult.So they grew apart and the robot got a job in the hospital. They still saw each other but they had nothing to talk about but the past so they never talked again.But one day Evangeilna saw on the news that there was a robot that had got ran over by saving a little girl. She cried and cried until she forgot she had a picture of the robot in her room and every day she said ' I'm glad I took this picture.'

They will bring food , water, and all diffrent kinds of needs.It will even test the gases and then tell the miners when the air is safe.the robot also has a thermal camera to help it find miners.                                            Here we have a robot called dante 2 thatwill climb into a volcanoe just to collect information for scientist. People say that it kind of looks like a spider on eight legs which helps him climb on the volcanoe. It's also built to survive in very hot tempature.Since a volcanoe is to hot for a scientist to handle that is when they decide to let dante 2 go innstead.                       This is Mr.gower a robot that helps doctors and nurses take medicine to their patients. Mr.gower looks like a little cabinet on wheels that has a little storage to keep the medicine in.He can ride in the elevator , go through hallways ,and can even move things out of his way . That robot is so strong that he can move things that can way like 500 pounds.Not only can he do that but Mr.gower can talk the scientists gave him hundreds of phrases to say.Sometimes he can do things that a doctor , nurse ,and pharmacists which will allow him to do other important things besides doing deliveries.                        An agribot is a robot that will pick fruit wheather it is oranges, berries , grapes, or some apples.Agribots are not very out yet to the world, but farmers are very intrested in thier work.Most of the agribots come in diffrent shapes and sizes.Others are able to go where ever they want to go to.The agribot can even tell whether the plant is to dry , is ripe , and is ready to be picked.

His inventor was a teenager named Bob. Bob built RC-0722 because his sister was struggling in school. RC-0722 was incredibly smart. Ever Since RC-0722 had been around bob's sister had been studying more because she enjoyed the way RC-0722 made the classes seem fun. Everything was going fine with RC-0722, but one day Bob wished RC-0722 was more than a tutor he wished he would be he friend.       The next day Bob woke up and found RC-0722 in front of him, Bob thought his sister had put him there but when he greeded RC-0722 responded 'hello Bob.' Bob could not belive his ears, RC-0722 had actually come to live.       For the next couple of weeks Bob kept RC-0722 hidden but he knew he could not hide   him forever. Thats when Bob came up with the idea that he would reprogram the robot so he could would only be a tutor again, but since RC-0722 was alive now he also had feelings so when he heard this he got really scared and ran away. That is how this story of a robot who wondered across the united states begins.       One week after RC-0722 had left Bob decided that he was gonna give up finding him.   On the other hand though RC-0722 wanted to return more than anything. The problem for RC-0722 began when he tried to return home but since he was only a tutor robot he didnt know where to go. RC-0722 began wondering his way through a thick forest that was right next to a big city. When RC-0722 reached this city he met new wonderfull people, but the person he enjoyrd meeting the most was a little girl named vivian who offered to help him find his way back.       On their journey RC-0722 and vivian lived many adventures but it was complicated for   RC-0722 to introduce himself so vivian decided to just call him RC. RC and vivian went to many villages to ask for maps or coordinates to follow so RC could go home. But most of the time they only heard people answer 'sorry,' 'we dont have any maps,' or they would say ' leave we are not gonna waste our only maps left giving them to you.       Vivian and RC were sad drepresed and with nothing to eat when they met a 19 year old   who liked the way RC looked and capacity to learn and teach new stuff, he figured that if he sold him he would get paid very well. This boy offered food and drinks to poor Vivian and RC. During diner the three had a very pleasant conversation, but before they went to sleep the boy attacked Vivian and shut off RC. After doing this the boy left with RC and left Vivian knocked out .       When Vivian was finally able to recover RC and the boy were already very far, she   decided she had to do something and then out of nowhere Bob and Vivian were face to face. neither one  of them knew it but they needed to work together if they wanted to save RC.       Bob and Vivian had traveled a long distance when they saw the boy with RC. Bob came   up with the idea that he would go in through one side and Vivian through the other. Vivian did exactly as she was told. She went in through the left bob went in through the right and they both were ready  to fight if they had to. Surprisingly RC was still intact and the boy who had stolen him was still trying to disable him.       After this Bob learned to think about how something you say make affect others before you say it .

Her teacher Mr.Barnes started to wonder what was going on. He had never had a student that got those good of grades.He was an expert in robots.He suspected something was wrong. So right after class he told Sydney to stay after class so he could have a chat with her.When class was over he told her that she was doing well in his class and he said that he was going to make an after school appointment with her mom.She had to do something about it,and she had to do it fast.                                                                                      Right when Sydney got home she ran to her room.when she got to the robot she freaked out and didn't know what to do she looked for an off button,but she didn't  make one. She was thinking of what to do,but then she heard it.The doorbell went off, she hid the robot underneath her bed and ran down stairs.But before she could get to it she heard her moms voice and ran faster that she ever could until she saw him walking to her living room. When she walked into the living room she was greeted by Mr. Barnes with a huge smirk on his face.She felt like she was going to barf. she sat on her couch and started to listen to the teacher.After he was done talking about how good her grades. He got to the point he told her mom that he thought she was cheating. Sydney's mom told him that Sydney would never do such a thing. Then told him to get out immediately! he walked out the house and told her that he'll get proof.Then ran to his car after that crisis was over Sydney ran up the stairs to her room thinking what she was going to do with the robot.She only had one choice. She had to destroy it.            For that she had to wait for tomorrow  she ran to the bed and quickly fell asleep.The next day she woke up and ran to school.Anxious for school to be over she got in the halls and ran into  Mr. Barnes. Mr. Barnes told her that he would get proof and she WILL get expelled from school.At school she couldn't even constraint.She was thinking about what she was going to do to the robot.She couldn't just destroy it.She had to figure out what to with it, and figure out fast Mr.Barnes had another  meeting,But this time with her Dad.          She finally had an idea what to with the homework robot.She would just turn off the robot until she needed it.Now it was time to get to work.She ran home and turned off the robot and put it into her closet and covered it with her dirty clothes to make sure her mom doesn't see it. Then she ran downstairs to make sure her teacher doesn't see her father. When she got down there her dad told her that her teacher came by and he told him to go away and that his daughter was not cheating she was so realifed.        After that no problems came up with her robot.Sydney had been good and never used it again she got the good grades by herself and she felt good about herself.

Well thats what they used to be, I should explain myself first my name is Joe Schuartzenhimer. I invented something that changed everything. I invented a task force of robots. Here is my story.       (ten years earlier)  'no it cant be done' Mr.Blaze said to me. 'yes it can just believe me' I said to him. 'fine but I expect you to have the entire variety of those robots by 7/17/12.' Mr.Blaze replied. That is in five days enough time to make two dozen robots. I walked over to my underground secret base that not even the apocolypse can penetrate. I activated the prototypes to see if I could show them to Mr.Blaze. They all work but I am not going to include my I-pet bot it is very useless.       'wow these actually work, now only if you had a robot that could simulate playing with animals that would be great' said an amazed Mr.Blaze. I showed him the I-pet and then he made these public.       Now here we are ten years later, my Dante2 has been used by scientists to study volcanoes, Mr.Gower and Gemini Scout have been used to save lives, Agribot has been picking fruit like always. As for I-pet it isnt so useless after all, now i can play with lions with out being close to death. My life has been awsome.

He had some technical difficulties.  My name is Dr. Smartypants and I am a mad scientist.  I like to invent things to try to make the world better.  My Big Fat robot was supposed to do eat all of the junk food in the world, but it didnt work out.  Then one day a powerful radio-active earthquake did something to my robot that made him work.                  In my home town witch is Nu-Nu, Thiland it was ilegal to have robots, so I dressed him up and gave him a fake name, whitch was Bill.  I dressed Bill in a suit and ty to make him look more professional.  It was really hard though trying to find a suit and dress shoes that were for a man that was 15 feet tall and had a foot the size of a giant watermelon.                    As our friendship grew I learbned to to love Bill.  He was my best friend.  Then the dreadful day came when The Tunami struck.  I knee that i should have made Bill water proof, but I forgot.  He fot taken away from me.  In memory of Bill I'll tell you all of the wonderful things he did: Took away all the junk food, talked to sad kids, he could fly, jump, kick, make his voice change, and even help the Giants Win the world series.  Bill was a great friend.

But the scientist knew that gasoline was forbidden. When company came to the scientists home, he always hid the robot. The scientist always hid the robot until one day.       Years passed and the robot knew how to work on the scientist's mines and farms.   Company came one day and the robot knew he had to hide in the closet. When the scientists let his friends come in and sit down, there was an odd noise in the closet. This odd noise was the robot powering down. When the robot was powering down, he fell in the buckets of gasoline the scientists had left there.       His friend said, 'what was that did you hear that?' Then the scientist said, 'what do you   mean I didn't hear anything.' The scientist said he was going to the restroom, but he was going to go to the closet and check what had happened. While he was in the closet the scientist's friends saw something flowing from the closet. That something was the gasoline that the robot fell on.       One of the scientist's friends said, 'lets follow the track.' They didn't know it was   gasoline, so they followed the pathway to the closet. In the closet they found the scientist, the robot, and the gasoline by then they knew it was gasoline. One of them said, 'how could you you know gasoline is illegal. Another one said, 'I'm going to tell the policemen.' As you can see this person wasn't really his friend.

He gave the policemen his robot and gasoline and without any complaints the scientist went to jail. He was very sad, but he knew in the first place that gasoline was illegal.

I wondered what it was,so I walk up to it and started pulling it out it kinda looked like a metal puppy eye.           2.After i was done pulling it out I toook it home and examined it I saw that it needed three double A battaries. I asked my mom if we could go buy some because we did not have any. Once we got home I was so eager to put the battaries. After I put the battaries in there was no reaction in the metal puppy. My mom threw it away and said it was a waist of time.       3. The day after I woke up py a cold piece of metal bouncing on my bed. I could not belive it it was alive and moving. It seem so realistic that my dad said,'why is there a dog in my house. After that I begged my dad if i could keep it ans he said sure.I was so happy that had a new dog!

John was a lucky child because he had his own robot! The robot's name was NWS-12. NWS-12 was the type of robot that can move around easily and carry heavy loads. It even had a two way radio. John loved to wake up and see NWS-12. One day, the unthinkable happened.        John's mother called John to come down stairs. She said in a serious tone, ' John, your father is stuck in the mine, and they don't know how to get him out of there.' John ran upstairs into his room and bawled and bawled. Then all of a sudden, NWS-12 came in and was standing next to John. John thought he heard a voice calling his name. Then he heard it again. John then realized that it was NWS-12!       NWS-12 in a monotone voice proclaimed, 'John, I will go save your father.' John at first was still flabbergasted that he was talking to a robot, but soon calmed down. John asked questioningly, ' One, how are you talking, and two, how are you going to save my dad?' NWS-12 responded, ' To answer your first question, I don't know, to answer the other one, I will use the tools I have.'       NWS-12 was going to search the mine, and when he found John's father, he would drag him out. John asked an extremely important question, 'How will I contact you while in  the mine?' NWS-12 responded in an almost snotty way, ' Why with my radio of course.'NWS-12 would go into the mine ant the break of dawn the very next day.                                                                                                                                              John and NWS-12 slipped out of the house at 6:00 AM. Lucky for them, the mine was just a few hundred yards away. John and NWS-12 went over the plan. When NWS-12 found John's father, he would radio back to John. If anything went wrong, they had a code phrase, Dying Battery. When they were done they made sure the radio was working. The battery was 100%. NWS-12 was going in.                                                                                                                                       'Everything good in there?' John asked nervously over the radio. 'All good.' replied NWS-12. It was some time before anything exciting happened. Then NWS-12 called over the radio, 'I found him!' John was overjoyed! John's father was knocked out but still breathing. NWS-12 dragged John's father out of the mine about twenty minutes later.       By that time John's father was starting to come around. 'S-son? Is that you?' he said confusedly. John replied with enthusiasm, ' It sure is dad.' When the three got home, John explained every thing. His parents didn't believe him about NWS-12 coming alive. When he tried to show them that he could talk there was silence. It was as if NWS-12 had never lived.

Robbie loved kids and he loved babysitting them.               So it all started with a good book about fifty years ago and it was called 'I, Robot.' everybody loved it and even the kids. So one day someone got up and had a great idea of trying to make a robot to experiment on and have a little fun with it too, and then he showed it to one of his good friends and he loved it, so then they called a guy to discuss this amazing creature and have him come check it out. When he got there he inspected it and loved it, and so the next morning they all had a vote on it with all the people in the neighborhood and everybody loved it and they thought it could be the next big thing.           They came up with a campaighn called Robots Forever and then everybody got to working on the next big thing they called Robbie.   They started with making all the gadgets robotic and then they made a couple robots that were staff so they could be helped, the robot staff had a special piece of  shazam in it so that they would never run out. The next morning one of the staff got really sick and had to be rushed into the hospital, the doctor said that it was just the start of something horrible: Cancer. They were all shocked to here the news about it and quickly went back to work to make a robot that could take care of the patient.       The doctor called the next morning and said that the patient had passed away, they were bumbed but that doesn't mean they have to quit now because they just got started. So they went straight to work after the news and planned the funeral and who would be coming, so they started with a list: Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, Cousins, Aunts, Uncles, Nieces, Grandparents and Friends.

607	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	535685	6	11087107	Y	55103	   One average Tuesday morning I was walking through my lab to check on my robots, like I do everyday. They were all oiled, clean, and shiny. Nothing strange, except for the occasional dent or bump left in the robots. I didn't think anything of the marks, little did I know that that day my life would change.          'Nothing interesting ever happens these days,' I said aloud. 'I wish I could have an adventure.'   'Going to look at the old robots always cheers me up!' I thought.   So i walked toward the back of the laboratory. I opened the stainless steel doors and stepped inside. I looked around the tiny closet like room. there were robots crammed into piles, on shelves and sprawled across the floor. I was confused, 'This room is always clean and orderly.' I thought.   I began to pick up the robots one by one placing them in one straight line. Then I began to here buzzing and beeping. I spun around and behind me was a dusty old robot. I jumped and screamed. It quickley said in a monotonous voice, 'I mean you no harm, I must find treasure.'   'But you're an oliver 2013, you were made 50 years ago! You were a defect!' I said my voice shaking.   It came toward me and I stepped back. 'Must find treasure.' It said again.   'You're the one who dented my bots, aren't you?' I inquired.   'Yes. Help find treasure.'   'What treasure?' I shouted. But no answer. Oliver 2013 just turned and walked away. I followed, He wasn't causing any trouble he just walked out of my lab and outside. He kept walking until he suddenly stopped. His hand began to shake, and it began to change shape into a spoon of some kind. Then I realized it was a shovel. 'what are you doing?' I demanded.   Still I got no response. He just began to dig. He was incredably fast. He dug until he had been comletely ingulfed in a huge hole. I cautiosly stepped closer to the hole. It was so deep I couldn't see the bottom. Suddenly Oliver 2013 shot up out of the hole. He seemed to be carrying a case. When he came closer to me, he handed me the box and said, 'Treasure!' I slowly opened it curiously, It was filled with gold, Diomonds, and money!   I stared at the robot stunned by his discovery. Then leaped to the lab. 'I'm rich!' I yelled.         I called Oliver an placed him in my car, I tried asking questions about what it was and who made him but i got no response. He still would remain a mystery. But a mystery that would bring prosperity to the world. After I did some research I found that he could find gold or burried treasure. He can dig faster than any man or machine, and will change the world forever. When I got into town people thought I was crazy about Oliver.

For example there are some robots that can rescue and look for people such as the Gemini-scout. The Gemini-scout searches/rescues people, it can go up and down stair and the robot is only two feet tall.  There more uncommon robots such as the agribot. The agribot picks fruis or berries, it has a special color sence and can tell when strawberries are ripe enough to get picked. Robots help us alot and are necessery in life.

I threw my back breaking bag of pads and footballs on the dish washer and continued into my house. The moment I stepped in I could already smell the fresh aroma of freshly baked cookies that have been waiting for me on the kitchen table. The smell pulled me in, closer and closer but I had to pass. Tomorrow was the day of the big science fair and I needed to get my project done. I raced through the hallways and walked down the creaky stairs that entered into the basement, or what my parents called 'Jared's Lab' because of the amount of time I spent down there to finish my project. I heard my brother, Ryan, chatting away on his X-box which made it even harder to want to work on my project. First the cookies and now the urge of me wanting to play X-box! But I promised myself to not have any distractions that could cause me to not finish. There it was, standing under my desk light. It was the robot that I had been working on and my project that I would present. I called it Ambush. The name sounds unhappy, but that just described the way it looked. I have been trying to program it to do and feel what I do- when it is turned on; like a mirror image. I put in the last few screws and pieces until it was finally finished and made a bracelet that would light up if Ambush was turned on. The only problem was I could not test it or see if it works because Ambush can only stay on for a certain amount of time and I didn't want it to burn all of its energy. Who knows- it could only last for about 5 minutes, so I did not want to risk it. I left Ambush where he was and walked back up the basement stairs. It was late now- past 11:00 p.m. I headed to my room and just went straight to bed. I could not get my mind off of Ambush and the science fair. Then my eyes saw the time- it literally seemed like it 'flew.' It was hard to make out the numbers because I didn't  have my glasses on. I did see a very blurry '1' and '2:' but the other numbers I could not see. I just hoped that it wasn't too late to be able to get up and out of bed. I still kept my fingers crossed that Ambush would work for tomorrow.   'AAAAAAWW!' I yawned as I got out of bed. I could here the sounds of chirping birds and the warm sun, beaming in through my bedroom window. 'Wow!' I thought to myself 'I've actually woke up before my alarm clock.' Within a second ,y heart completely dropped. The power had gone out! There was no alarm clock!' I slipped on some shoes and walked across the hallway to wake up my mom, so she could drive me to school. I explained what had happened and she freaked too. The only reason we were so shocked is because I could have missed the science fair. I just don't know what time it starts, but I hoped it was not right now.Once I got downstairs,  I opened the refrigerator to grab some milk. As I lifted it up, I felt that it was warm from the refrigerator not having any power; so cereal wasn't available to eat. I sprinted over to the pantry to get some protein, breakfast bars and stuffed a bunch of them into my pocket to eat in the car. I grabbed my backpack, brushed my teeth, and took off for school.   Immediately, I bolted into the M.P.R, where the held the science fair.   'Mr. Staub! Your turn to present!' One of the judges announced. 'Perfect timing!' I thought to myself. I walked up to the stage to see the many people in the crowd staring right at me. It almost seemed that their eyes were beaming through me. Suddenly, I realized that the one thing I needed was Ambush. I nearly almost fainted, but instead I started to shake. 'Any day now!' One of the judges projected into the room. 'I... I d-don't have my p-project yet s-sir.' I said to the judges, freighted. Then I came up with an excuse to leave. 'M-may I go the... the r-restroom?' They nodded their heads but were not very happy. Once I was in the restroom, I pulled out my cellphone to call my mom. I NEEDED her to bring Ambush. In the middle of the conversation, I noticed something light up. It was my bracelet, meaning Ambush got turned on at my house. I figured it was the maid probably dusting off Ambush and accidentally turned it on. Then an idea hit me. 'Sorry! Gotta go mom. Bye!' If Ambush could really do what I do, I could just walk it to school, but from the bathroom. I would just have to remember all of the twists and turns that I would have to walk in order to get out of my house and into school. The first thing I had to do was remember how to get out of the basement. I started walking side to side, pondering, trying to picture exactly how to get through the garage door. Of course the ring of my cell phone had sounded. 'Hello?' I asked. It was my mom again. 'Ummm Jared- your robot is walking side to side and it shaking the house! Make it stop please.' I stopped walking to see if it would stop too. 'OK. It stopped. Thank you!' she said in relief. 'Uh mom... sorry but I need to walk it out of the house, so there is going to be some stomping until it is outside. I know you won't be able to fit it in your car so I have to walk Ambush to school.' I replied. 'Alright! I'll help you find the door. So walk forward, a little more. Stop! You are about to hit the wall. Go left, OK perfect. Now just walk forward and you will be out side. 'Is Ambush out yet?' I asked. 'Yes. Oh, I have to go take Ryan to basketball practice so you are on your own now. You should know how to get Ambush to school from our house because we live right next door from it.' I heard her yelling for Ryan to get in the car. 'Bye mom!' I said. Then I slipped the phone back in my pocket. I pictured that I was outside of my house and where to turn on the streets. 'So I take a left, right then straight.' I whispered to myself. I began to walk him by going straight and so on.   Within a minute, I could feel the floor shaking rapidly beneath me. Ambush was in the school! I had to get him immediately because he could run out of juice in any second. Before I ran out of the bathroom, I turned Ambush off from my bracelet, so he would not move. I checked the nearest hallway. there he was, with his 'mad' face, just standing in front of the clear door. I opened the door in front of him, allowing Ambush to walk inside. I turned him back on and he walked right beside me until we reached the M.P.R. I was not  nervous anymore, considering I had a gigantic robot by my side. I took a deep breath and then walked inside.   'Sorry it took so long but I had a really bad... uh stomach ache. But I have my project right here.' The judges had all started laughing because when I turned around to point at Ambush, Ambush did the same and pointed to nothing. I joined in the laughter as well, with a tiny giggle, but continued with my speech. 'I have programed him to do what I do, with the control of this bracelet. I pointed to my wrist and showed the audience. He does what ever the person who is wearing this is doing. I have worked very hard on this project, with a total of about a year. So uh, that concludes my presentation, thank you!' They all clapped in amazement and rewarded me with a first place ribbon. Once I received the winner's prize, then I knew that a year of hard work has finally paid off.       'So what did you guys think?' I asked. One of the few people woke up and replied, 'What do you mean?' 'The story I just read to you- did you listen to any of it?' I again asked, but this time more angry. 'Your only job for this whole wiring club thing is to listen to story, and you still didn't pay attention?!' They all nodded their heads 'No.' I just handed my narrative in and headed home from the school library. I hoped that I got a first place ribbon like I did in my story. Maybe this would be something that I won't be able to get off of my mind at night- just like Ambush and the science fair. 	NNP CC DT NNP NNP NNP NN , NNP VBD . PRP VBP NN .

After school, Jake came over to my house and we were thinking of ideas.                            After about two and a half hours, I pitched an idea. I thought of we could go big and make a robot. Jake was on board. First, we needed lots of materials to get started like wires, metals, and tons of other materials. They were too expensive in stores, so we went on amazon and bought it online. We started pitching ideas on what it could be like. Maybe it could have wheels or could carry materials, it could be remote controlled                                                     The next day, the materials came. One of the problems were their wearn't any instructions and we had to either go online or figure it out on our own. Making a robot was hard but we didn't give up. We worked on it all night and we wearn't even half way done. Our parents helped us a little and it was getting easier.                                 Jake and I were working on it for five hours and we were almost done. We were about to put in a couple more wires in the robot and then charge it. After it was done charging, we were gonna test it. We were proboly hoping we need to add more wires in to it but I was wrong. It was moving one-hundred percent perfectly.                                                         Today was the science fair and Jake and I were hoping we are going to win. Later in the contest, we were in the top two. The other project was a volcano exploding chocolate. After they pronounced the winner, we won                                                            	DT NNP NNP VBD VBG RP IN IN DT NN , CC PRP$ NN NNP CC PRP VBD VBN RP CC VBD TO VB DT NN NNP NNP NN , NNP VBD RP TO PRP$ NN CC PRP VBD VBG IN NNP NNP IN CD CC DT NN NNS , PRP VBD DT NNP PRP VBD IN PRP MD VB JJ CC VB DT NNP NNP VBD IN NNP NNP , PRP VBD NNS IN NNS TO VB VBN IN NNS , NNS , CC NNS IN JJ NNP NNP VBD RB JJ IN NNS , RB PRP VBD IN NN CC VBD PRP NNP NNP VBD VBG NNS IN WP PRP MD VB NNP NNP PRP MD VB NNS CC MD VB NNS , PRP MD VB VB VBN DT JJ NN , DT NNS NNP CD IN DT NNS VBD PRP$ JJ RB DT NNS CC PRP VBD TO DT NN NN CC NN PRP RP IN PRP$ NNP NNP DT NN VBD JJ CC PRP VBD RB VB NNP NNP VBD IN PRP DT NN CC PRP VBP RB RB DT NN NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP DT RB CC PRP VBD VBG NNP NNP CC PRP VBD VBG IN PRP IN CD NNS CC PRP VBD RB NNP NNP VBD IN TO VB RP DT NN RBR NNS IN DT NN CC RB VB NNP NNP PRP VBD VBN VBG , PRP VBD RB JJ NN NNP NNP VBD RB VBG PRP VBP TO VB JJR NNS IN TO PRP CC PRP VBD NNP NNP VBD VBG JJ NN NNP NNP VBD DT NN NN CC NNP CC PRP VBD VBG PRP VBP VBG TO NNP NNP IN DT NN , PRP VBD IN DT JJ NNP NNP JJ NN VBD DT NN VBG NNP NNP PRP VBD DT NN , PRP VBD

It has been abandoned for just a week and the doctors just left a few items , a racks of doctors supplies and there Mr. Gower robot helper, he was uncharged and hadn't moved since the hospital was abandoned             Mr. Gower look like a cabinet on wheels. He had multiple locked drawers as a body. One of his wheels moved. Slowly the little robot moved inched to the door. Slowly picking up speed. Once he was outside of the room the small robot he was at full speed ready to meet the doctors, nurses, and patients.              The robot looked and looked but couldn't find anyone. The only people he saw was the people outside of the musty window. Mr. Gower decided that he was going to escape. His first thought was to turn the power supply back on. The robot swiftly went down the stairs. When  the robot reached the bottom of the stairs he saw all of the switches for different thing. None of them were labeled, they were just colored coded. The little robot went back up the stairs.             The small robot look all through the hospital for a way out. He looked and looked and looked. He finally gave up. He went back and forth  trying to see a way out. After going back and forth one hundred times the robot noticed something shinny and small in his wheel. Slowly he grabbed the shinny figure. After he removed the figured he could see what it was. It was his way out. It was a key.             He went to the door as fast as his wheels could take him. He pushed and turned the key in the slot. The door opened and the robot was free.

I liked this robot because it can take people to safety. I also liked that robot because it strong. this robot caught my attention because of all the things it can do. The gemini-scout can also carry food, water, and other supplies.                             The gemini-scout can also work. It can work in mines under ground. This robot is not that tall. It is two feet tall and it has wheels. This robot can also go up and down stairs. It can also make tight turns. This robot can also roll through water. The gemini-scout can also find information. It can test the air for gases.                               This robot can also test the air if it has gases. Then the robot tells the miners if the air has gases or not. The gemini-scout also has a thermal camera to help miners. The thermal camera that the gemini-scout has helps find living things. When this robot finds trapped miner's, the miner's can use its two-way radio. The miner's use it to talk with the rescue team.                                I would like to have a robot like the one GEMINI-SCOUT. I liked that robot because it can do so many things. In my imagination i would has a robot like the GEMINI-SCOUT. If i had a robot like this i would have so much fun. If i invented one of these robots i would also put a games controller. I would make my robot squish the people i don't like when i tell her too. My robot may be two feet tall put i will make it do alot of things. Although i make it small  it can make many things. I would also make it save people. I would even make it just like the robot the gemini-scout. I would also make it so powerful. I would also make it do what i tell it to do.

613	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	535888	6	11087133	Y	55103	     This story began at 8:48 p.m on April 12,2013 in Memphis,Tennessee.Our family,the Hutcherson family,were wandering around a toy store to buy new toys.There was Mom and Dad with Annie,my babysister,in the baby dolls section looking at toys for Annie.And then there was me,Jack,looking for awesome looking robots.About 30 minutes later,I find this dirty looking robot behind all of the cleaned looking ones.Its body is painted all black.The fact that shocked me the most was,it's the biggest robot in the toy store.Two yard tall and 1 yard wide.At first,I didn't want to buy it,but then I started feeling bad for the little guy.So,I told Mom and Dad to buy it.          We went back home.Annie was asleep,so Dad had to be careful of carrying her inside their room.After Dad put Annie to bed,they watched a movie in the living room,while I play with the old robot I bought in my room.It looks really cool.He has three buttons in where his stomach is place.I pressed the first button and the robot said,'Your the best friend ever!'I pressed the second button and its legs moved.Then I pressed the last button and its arms moved.While its arms were moving,I started to see this button in the bottom of its right armpit.I don't know if that's really where they're supposed to be but,it seemed like it was hidden in there.          My body started to get this creepy feelings I can't even explain.I started to get cold.Even though I was getting scared of what might happen,I still pressed it.It was just a toy,there's nothing to get scared of.I was wrong.The robot's eyes started glowing.I stepped away,leaving it on the floor laying down.It stood up by itself and started to walk towards me.I wanted to shout but couldn't becuase I was too afraid of what it might do to me.          It stopped walking when it was about 4 yard from me.My body started to feel a little bit less scared,but I still stayed still in the corner of the room.It finally spoke.It said,'Don't be afraid,I am your best friend.'After what the robot said,I didn't feel scared anymore.I started walking toward him.I asked him if he's alive and he responded the word 'YES'.Instead of that making me feel creeped out,it made me feel great.I have a best friend that's a robot,a robot that controls itself.I carried him to my bed and talked to him the whole night.          The next day,I woke up and didn't see him where he was last night.I looked for him and found him cleaning my clothes inside my closet.He was taller though.I told him to come out.He shrunk while he was coming out.Well,that shocked me.He played many games with me in my room.I kept it a secret from my family though.They might get scared and hit him with bats or something.I had to go in and out of my room every hour.       Every morning I wake up,I always see him doing my chores,but I'd always tell him to stop so he could play with me.My parents sometimes comes in to my room with a shocked face.They never found out about my robot best friend untill I told them the next year I bought him.I was very happy they didn't get scared and hit him with bats.I was also happy because he became my best friend.Without him,I wouldn't have a better childhood than what I expected.

She was 7 and the most cheerful out of any of his children. Phillip loved this time of year. He loved the Christmas specials on TV, the gift exchange and most of all visiting family. He lived in Missouri where the weather is not too bad. But he heard this year they were going to have the worst thunderstorm ever in the state of Missouri. 'Go to bed or Santa's not going to come', he told Sally. As soon as he knew it she was in her bed fast asleep.                        December 25, 2053 (Christmas Day)          When she woke up she started screaming Santa Came Santa Came. Soon they started opening presents. She got a remote controlled robot. She went outside and started playing with it. About twenty minutes later it started to rain. She ran inside and then remembered she forgot the robot outside. Phillip told her its too late because it started thunder storming. She started crying. Plus Grandma cancelled Christmas dinner he said madly. He threw the phone at the wall were it shaddered into pieces. He got so mad at himself for throwing the phone that he also started crying. They both cried and cried until the day was over.                                     December 26, 2053           Sally woke up to a new voice she heard outside. She walked to the voice to see that her old robot was now bigger and made of metal instead of plastic. The robot told her the whole story about how he became alive when he got struck by lightning. After that they played and became best friends ever. Hey, Grandma even rescheduled Christmas to New Years Eve.And they all lived happily ever after... until the aliens took over, but that's a different story.

I was modeled after the Dante 2 The reason I am able to write this is when I was being programed, the main computer broke down the only computer left was an AI. When I was being programmed a power surge down loaded some of the AI's intelligence into me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I am currently being held in a top secret government location under maximum-security. But I can easily hack into the computer and escape. So every night I go and try to erase the AI from me so I can be let go. Once I succeeded but they wanted to use me as a weapon!                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't want to be a weapon so I tried to self-destruct. But by mistake I launched myself to mars they quickly sent a probe to find me. But I escaped and I am still here wandering around.

His name was Bob and he loved science and building. He had alot of scraps from previous experiments and he decided he wanted to build a robot. So he got to work. His plans were that the robot would play with him whenever he wanted. He tried as hard as he could because he didnt have a brother or sister so he was always bored. He worked on it for days and days but he didnt know if he was doing it right. Finally he thought he was finished.               He asked the robot if it would play with him but nothing happened. Bob got really mad because he put all his effort into the robot. He ran over and pushed the robot down. 'CLICK' he heard. 'What do you want to play, Bob' Said the robot.                'Yes!' Said Bob. It worked! Later that day Bob went on and showed the world his invention and everyone loved it.                 'Tag, you're it!' Said the robot.                 All of the people in the world wanted a robot so Bob opened a company called Robo-fun inc. and all the robot were for sale and they all looked different. But one robot was not for sale and it was Bobs robot, who he named Bobby Jr. or you could call him  John Johnny-Jo John-John for long. Bob also found another robot he named Theodore Talatae.                  Soon all the kids had a robot and they were happy. Every day of the year Bob made a national day where everyone goes to the park with there robot to play tag.

You know what the thermal helicopter used in the finding of the one suspect in the boston incident is. The thermal camera is a robot,the helicopter its self is a robot.Well heres one that the Rescue team uses. Its called the Gemini -Scout. Gemini Scout can carries supplies like food,water,it can even carry an injured person.             It collects info. for examp. t tests for air and gases and tells whento let miners no that its safe to mine,The robot also has a thermal camera and heat sensors to find trapped miners and when it does the miners can use a two way radio to talk to contact the rescume team.              The Dante two looks for vents,holes in the crater. then the robot collects info. about the gasethat come out of the vents.               Well thats enough ,so you see computers are a computer to it does what you want to srearch and types what you want to type and it even send emails to other people so what other kind of robots do you want to have.We have all the robots we could possibly want.

She will work at a hospital like the Mr.Grow. She will bring medicane to patients and store all the stuff that is needed. aAshley will be like a portable cabinet.          I also want her to be like the Dante 2 able to climb volcanoes. Get information for scientist. she would be able to with stand high tempeture. The Dante 2 has changed the way scientist learn. Now the scientist can stay in a safe place instead of in a valcanoe.               Ashley could help me by taking me places when I need to go. she could cook me food like my own little cheif. Could cook for people who are poor. I would want her to help clean up trash on the beach. This way animals will not eat it and die.                  I think robots is probably one of the greatest inventions yet. They were created to help people, save lifes, and explore the unknown. They come in all different shapes and sizes to get the job done. They will never give up on you no matter how tuff the job. Robots are very dependable and will always be willing to help. I think everyone should have a robot.

They spent millions of dollars in research, tools, and materials. The first time they tried it their was a glitch and the robot was broken. The scientists gave up and left the robot there to rust. That was a big mistake that they quit then and not finish out. That was twenty years ago now let's fast-forward to present day. A young kid named Dawson Smith is playing treasure hunt in his backyard. He was digging when he struck something metal. He kept digging and found a person. Maybe dead maybe not the person he finally found out was actually a robot. the robot turned on and Dawson scream. The robot didn't want to hurt him though. He just wanted a friend. They played all day and became best friends.

But it was not a very happy moment for all of the members of Mr. Crawford's science class. He assigned us a LOT of homework, and it was all due by the next day. What was the homewwork, you ask? We had to build a robot. A robot! I mean really, we're only in sixth grade, its not like we're engineers! Of course, its not THAT hard. All the robot has to do is move a tennis ball a few feet across the room without us touching the ball or the robot, but still, how are we supposed to build our own robot! 'Luke, aren't you going to leave?' asked Mr.Crawford. 'Wha- oh yeah! Sorry!' I said, snapping back to reality. I grabbed my things and left, thinking that I might as well start working on the robot as soon as I got home, that way I wouldent have to stay up TOO late.                 'MOM! I'M HOME!' I called out into my house after arriving. 'Good honey, welcome back.' Responded my mom. I took off my backpack, and went out to the garage to see what I could use from there to build my robot. I managed to find a bunch of good supplies to work with, and I got to work.                                                         *             *                *             Finally, finished! And it only took me two hours! My robot stood about two feet tall, with some old lightbulbs as the 'eyes', 'legs'made out of an old four wheel scooter, and a plow in the front made out of a broken shovel in the front to move the ball. I made a simple motor by the wheels to move my 'robot', and to be energy efficient, the motor was powered by a solar panel that I put on the robots head. The final thing I had to do was give my robot a name. Tobor was robot backwards, so I decided that that was a good name for it. I put 'Tobor' outside and left him there so he could charge, and then I used the rest of my time that night to watch TV then go to bed.                 BOOM! CRACK! I woke up, startled. I heard a storm brewing outside, so I started to fall back asleep. Then I rememberd Tobor. I jumped out of bed, and ran outside, but it was alredy too late. On my way out, I saw a bolt of lightning streak across the sky and strike Tobor. I figured he was a goner, but then the strangest thing happened. I saw, peering at me where Tobor was just standing, was a pair of glowing lights, about two feet above the ground. 'Thats strange.' I thought. So I carefully walked over and found that the lights where lightbulbs. Familiar looking lightbulbs... Tobor! I ran over and saw, to my surprise, that Tobor was moving towards me. On its own. It stopped right by me, and did a quick spin around as if to say 'Yay! Im alive!' 'I must be dreaming,' I thought.  So I went back to bed.                 Turns out, I wasn't dreaming. Tobor was waiting for me in the kitchen when I walked downstairs. He greeted me with that same spin that he gave before, and followed me everywhere. I took him on the bus with me to school, wich got me a very stange look from everybody on the bus. I brought Tobor with me into science class, where the robot testd were just begining. 'Ah, Luke. Your late. Since you've had so much extera time to work on your robot, why dont you take your turn now?' Said Mr. Crawford with a sneer on his face. 'Sure. Tobor, bring that ball to Mr. Crawford.' I said. Of course, Tobor immediatly drove over, scooped up the ball, and brought it to Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford was speechless. 'Wha- what else can it do?' He stammared. 'Anything. For instance: Tobor, go bring me those books on the floor over there.' I responded. Tobor obeyed immidiatly. 'Well done, Luke. You can get some candy from the bag on my desk as a prize.' said Mr. Crawford. Of course, Tobor got that for me too. 	NN NN NNP . VBD DT NNP NNP , NN VBD IN .

624	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	536188	6	11087174	Y	55103	            It was 12 o'clock, midnight. I had worked on him all evening, and was very tired after a hard day. I was asleep. He sat motionless in the garage, as though he were a lampost. But he couldn't do anything about it. At least, that's what I thought.              I woke with a start. Something banged hard against a wall, but I could not dtermine where the sound was coming from. I was still half asleep when I first heard the noise. There it was agin. What could it be? I thought. I couldn't really process anything. My brain was still tired. I needed more sleep. But I couldn't help but wonder, where was that noise coming from? Could it just be my father, doing some late night work? I had no idea what it was. It wasn't like me to be this curious, but I had to investigate.             I slipped out of bed and put on my bathrobe. I searched my empty floor for my slippers, but could not feel them anywhere. So i went to my doorway and found my flip flops. It was the best I could do. Our whole house was wooded, and very cold on barefeet. I twisted the doorknob slowly and carefully, not wanting to awake anyone near this hallway. I slowly walked out, tip toeing my way to the living room. I heard it again.            BANG! It went. But the sound seemed fainter. I guessed I was headed in the wrong direction. I turned back, heading toward the garage. That was usually where I found my dad finishing up projects late at night. I had just made it to the entry way.                                                                                                    There it was.                     He stood in the middle of the doorway, staring straight ahead. It was him. My creation, my robot.            Did I leave him out? I thought. Maybe I just forgot to put him away. But then it happened. barely noticable, but I saw it. His head tilted, leaving it at an angle. Then slowly, he turned himself to face me.           Was this really happening? What have I done! Then, I took one last glance at him, and ran. Back to my room. I slammed the door.           My mother woke up, and sat with me on my bed. I didnt tell her about anything that I saw. She would never believe me. I told her, 'I was just getting a drink. I got scared because I was alone, and ran back.'                 I woke up late that morning for not having slept at all last night. I went straight to the garage, but the robot was sitting in the middle of the cement, where I had left him yesterday evening. I must have dreampt it. That couldn't really happen, could it? But then it hit me. My brother!           He was only nine, but he loved to pull pranks on people. I'm sure it was him. But what if it wasnt? I would have yelled at him for nothing! I wouldn't accuse him of my dream. And besides, I am prone to sleepwalking!

625	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	536193	6	11087178	Y	55103	                                                     Shadow Keeper                                                                      It was just another Monday morning on the farm, I got up, ready to check the plants, feed the cows, feed the chickens, feed the horses, check for eggs, water the garden, eat breakfast.  There were so many things to do on the farm, it was overwhelming!  As soon as I finished eating, I made a checklist of things that I need to do.               Checklist           Check plants Feed animals water garden Check for eggs                                         As soon as I finished making the list, I walked down towards the fields.  I inspected the fields and then took off towards the chicken coop.  There were several eggs, so I took one of the baskets that were right there and put them in.  I sprinkled chicken food in the coop snf watched the chickens scramble around.  I darted off to the cow pasture and poured water into the tub and put special grains in the buckets.  I then scurried off to the horse stable and visited each stall, but before I was going to feed them.  Something caught my eye.  In the storage large storage room, the door was open and something was inside.  I backed up and took a better look, but before my mind realized it, the large shadow lurched in my direction.  I screamed and fell over with a thud.  The shadow was right over me.       Before I knew it, I was in a dream.  This was no ordinairy dream, this was a trap.  I was surrounded by darkness, and out of the shadow walls came the shadow.  It's majestic sleek horse-like body glinted in the darkness.  He was tall, and his coat was a purple-black shadow color.  A sudden voice surrounded the area.    'Alice,' it said.       'How do you know my name? And who are you?' I said back.       'Alice, that doesn't matter. But I am Shadow Keeper, keeper of all secrets and shadows,'  he responded.       'Why are you here?' I asked.       ' Because, Alice, I am here to help you get through.  There is a gate opening and you   need to stop it,' he said.       ' But why me?'  I asked.       ' Because, with me and you on a team, we can stop the gate from opening,' he stepped   under a small opening with light shining on his figure.  He was a horse, but not just any horse, a robot horse.       ' Okay,' I said.       With one stomp of his hoof, a swirly portal appeared.       ' I'll meet you back there,' he said.       I leaped through the portal and in a second, I was standing in front of the storage area.  Seconds later, Shadow Keeper appeared right in front of me.  He turned to the side and I hopped onto Shadow Keeper's smooth steel back.  I held onto hid neck as he started into a smooth collected canter.  The wind blew my blonde hair back, and I straightened up and held onto the reins that I hadn't noticed.  The rush of cantering had never felt so good.       When we got to the gate, it was a swirling red and black floating circle. I could'nt see a problem, but if Shadow Keeper said it was, I was going to believe it too.  A sword appeared to my right and together, Shadow Keeper and I moved in unisin.  He lunged towards it and then turned to the left abruptly and I slashed the sword across the gate.  The gate sliced into two pieces and fell apart.       As soon as it was over, I was trrasported back to my room.  It was 8:30pm and it was dark.  I wasn't sure what had happened, but I went out to my balcony and looked into the sky.  A certain star looked like Shadow Keeper, and it glinted, and I heard Shadow Keeper's voice in my head.  It said...       'Alice, I am very proud of you.  Thank you for closing that gate with me.  If you hadn't done that, by now, your world would've probably been destroyed by now.  Thanks again,' he said.       I was happy, and now, it was time to get a good night's sleep.  In my dreams, I couldn't stop thinking about the adventure.

After training, the first real assignment that Evan got was to build a robot.Evan went straight to work,and started planning everything out.          After weeks of planning, Evan decided that it was time to start building.At first things seemed hopeless,and Evan was having a hard time.Some of the other scientists saw this, and decided to help.After a few pointers Evan was ready to go again.Soon he'd built the  perfect robot.         Evan's robot could do just about anything.Many of the other scientists congradulated Evan on his amazing invention.This made Evan happy,and inspiered him to become a great inventor.After many successful inventions Evan was crowned the best inventor of his time.

Robots make things easier for you and they can also do things for you too. Some robots are actually used in factories or for some type of job to help them out.  Robots have many suprising things that they can help you with, like work , cleaning, homework , they can get things for you , tell you information and a lot of other things. If I had a robot I would like it to do my homework! I never ever want to do homework so if my robot did it for me, i would truley  adore it. If i made a robot it would look very pretty and it would be my favorite color blue! Robots are important and can help you out, i hope maybe one day i can have a robot to work with me and help me, but trying to make one would also be pretty fun. I hope they will make a robot that can be in your house and do all the things i want it to do someday!

On a sunny afternoon I was sitting in my room looking outside my window. The reason why I wasn't outside playing with my friends is because my best friend Caylli(pronounced Kay-lee) went away with her dad to go look at some robots he was building. Caylli was amazing at science so she loved experimenting so I'm pretty sure she is enjoying herself. 	PRP$ NNP NNP . . .

Optimis Prime was a special boy/robot because he could be a boy and then transform in a car or a plane or a boat. The sad thing  was that Optimis did not know of his powers intill one day..... So one day Optimis (who is now age 16) went for a bike ride. Wile on his bike ride a flying plane crashed and it was about to land right on his school and his house. So watching this happen got Optimis really mad and made his transform into a huge flying water carrier. Once he transformed into that he flew up and made the crashing plane land onto the flying carrier and saved his whole family and friends. So now that Optimis has learned his powers he pertects the city he loves from violence.

We were at the abandoned junk yard at the end of town, and I loved going to scary places.  Amanda on the other hand, just wanted to go home and forget all about it.  'You know this place is supossed to be haunted' she said for the hundredth time.  'That's exactly why we came here' I replied in annoyence.  ' Now, first thing we gotta do, is climb that fence!'.  Being the gymnast that I am, I cleared the fence in one easy front flip.  Amanda, of course, took about a million hours just to get to the top of the fence.  'I'm stuck!!' she cried.  'Stay there, I'll get you!' I belowed up to her.  I started to climb up the fence, but then she yelled down, 'Kattie, just go without me!'.           'Scaredy cat' I muttered under my breath as I dropped to the ground.  All around me were piles and piles of trash of all kinds.  Old cars, bruised bananas, busted lamps,...and a shiny silver key.  I picked up the key.  It felt smooth and cool in my hand.  A booming noise shook the earth.  Poor Amanda was so startled, that she let go of the fence and fell to the ground.  Luckily she wasn't hurt.  A blinding light filled the sky.  I expected it to start raining, but instead, colors started swirling all around me.  In a burst of pink, blue, and green, I held in my hand a tiny, little robot.           I screamed, Amanda screamed, the robot screamed too.  I dropped the thing and took off.  .......Amanda and I never stopped running until we got home.  Maybe some day we'll go back to the junk yard.  Maybe.  	JJ MD VB IN IN RB NNP .

' George it's, just stop being a buzz kill,' I said in a annoyed voice.                         The room was filled with electronics and dots and a whole bunch of stuff that I have no clue what they were.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on that new invention they call a robot, it's really human like but it has a computer voice.  And sometimes you can actually make him look like an exact replica of anyone you want. And guess what that's the robot that I'm about to rub my hands on!               'George I found it, it's right here. Finally after months of dreaming of it I basically have it in my hands, right in front of me,' I screamed in the most joyfull voice.              'Really? I didn't think you would find it. Actually I had no faith in you at all....in fact all my friends thinik the same thing,' said my little brother with a dumb look on his face.          'George you told your friends about this secret mission, you totally blew our cover, now the police are probably going to come searching....FOREVER! Great now we probably have the police right on our tails. But, we have to hurry if we want to get this baby home,' I said basically angrily.            All I have ever wanted (the past few months) was a robot that does homework.  And that's what I plan on stealing tonight.                'Okay George we have to get out of here before the police get here, hurry,'  I said in a low but hurried voice.              When finally we got out of that computer/electronic wonderland my brother and I got home with ro-buddy (that's my name for him, I pre-named him) I set him right beside my bed looking like I had just killed somebody and was hiding the dead body in my room, when suddenly we heard police officers and don't get me started on the lights, they were flashing everwhere, and since we live right next door to the computer/electronic wonderland we can hear a lot of stuff.  When I turned the lights on to see what was happening something miraculous happened.....               ' Ummmmm...Tony, look right beside your bed please, because I really think your gonna love it.' Said my brother.                                   So I as my younger brother said and when I turned around I saw the most marvilous scene ever, my robot was up by it's self and when I was about to say something the words just wouldn't come out. So after a while the robot said something that I could barely understand.              ' Hola, personas de tierra, puedes cambiar mi lenguage a ingles por favor?'  Said the robot that was sitting right next to me.                    ' Uhhhh, Tony do u speak spanish?' Murmurred my brother.                               ' Unfortunatly no,' I whispered in a sad voice.                 ' Okay Tony we have to get this thing back to the building before we ruin it,' said my little brother all worried.                     I kept touching all these buttons, and for some odd reason the robot kept saying stuff in spanish like one phrase he said ' AYYY,  si continuas haciendo eso voy a regresar a ser un pedazo de electrinco, por favor para.'                      Suddenly I heard a beeping voice it went like 'BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!' And that was the end for all of us, except George!                     'My ro-buddy hes gone!!!!!!  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!' I screamed so loud I pretty sure the whole world could here me.  \                           THE END!!!

My dad's an inventor and he's always coming up with new ideas and inventions that usually don't work.  It all started on Saturday morning when I woke up.             It was around 8:00 a.m. when i woke up and got out of bed.  I went down stairs and got a bowl of cereal for breakfast.  My dad was sitting on the couch watching Good Morning America when in came downstairs.  'Good morning' he said 'good morning' I replied.  'You won't believe what I invented this morning' he said 'a robot!' ' does it work' I said ' Uh it needs a little work' he said.  that didn't surprise me.              When i was done my breakfast I went into the garage to see the robot, it wasn't there.  'Dad i called inside 'I don't see your robot' I said ' Oh it's there all right' he said 'You can't miss it.'  I looked around and then out of the corner of my eye saw something move in the corner.  I went over to check it out and when I got there I couldn't believe my eyes I saw a real live working robot!  Then it said in a weird voice 'Hello' I said 'Hi' 'Would you like to go outside' it said' 'Sure' I said.  I went inside and said 'Dad' I'm going outside to play' he said 'OK be back before six' I said 'OK' and that's where my adventure begins.             When i went back into the garage the robot had out a bunch of balls to play with.  we went outside and started to play.  We had a blast we played soccer which he was really good at, basketball, and football.  The ball went over the fence a couple of times because the robot had a great throwing arm.  After that we went out for some ice cream and a walk on the pier.  The robot did not get any ice cream because he could not eat.  Then when we were almost home he said ' I'll race you back' i said 'Sure'.  We raced back, I'd say it was fair but he ended up winning.  We went into the garage and he said that was the best day he would probably ever have.  I turned him off and went inside.  I went and layed down on my bed and did some thinking maybe my dad wasn't so crazy after all.  I decided to name the robot Fred.  Then i thought about how much fun I had and how it was too bad the day was over.  And that's my day with a robot!

His masterpiece rose up from the ground in a cold stony silence. The hulking mass of steel flickered to life like a bear coming out from hibernation. It's chest glowing a very faint blue color and its eyes shaped like bananas opening up with a fiery orange color full of hatred. 'You have come here to seek revenge against the world! 'You will start out as a basic self-driving car, but when the time comes you know what to do.'            As the Dr. said he would, the robot would drive people around carefree. After he finished that job he started to explore volcanoes and collect information for the scientists, but no one knew his true plan. One day when the time was right he used his robotic drill to make a giant hole to let the lava flow out on the surrounding city. He charged into the city with nothing to stop him. Then it struck him and he had a change of heart (actually he had  change of gears).            He decided that pillaging cities and burning down towns wasn't what he wanted, he wanted to help out the kitten shelter and make friends with people and animals like othe robots. But, he sensed a problem, abut he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Then it hit him (not the idea the lava dumbo). He went tumbling down the streets stuck in the lava. He didn't have any idea how to stop the lava. He kept rolling down the streets and eventually rolled out. Having no idea how to stop the lava, he walked over to the water tower to get a drink. He took his drill and drilled a hole in the side of the water tank. He gulped down all the water he wanted to cool himself off. Then he realized that all the water pooring out would solidify the lava. He just sat back and watched the problem solve itself.            The next day when he came back he found almost everything destroyed. When he called out for people no one responded. Then, he sat down and cried. I think we have all learned a lesson here; it is that robots can help scinetists, make friends, and drive cars, but when an evil robot tries to change to these robot ways he ends up burning and suffocating people and a city.

She was surprised to see her bestfriend laughing on the ground because of Sora's reaction. Sora felt her face begin to get hotter, she noticed a lot of kids walking around her and Luna because of it. Luna qucikly got up and grabbed Sora's wrist, 'come on, I need to show you something cool!' Luna said as she dragged Sora out of the sidewalk and into an ally.      In the ally Luna laid Sora deeper and deeper into a darkness that seemed that the more they walked the more Sora felt the creeping eyes of cats,rats, and maybe a stalker. Sora tugged on the back of Luna's shirt, 'where are we going? its getting really dark and my roomate might lock the door on me! We're in our 3rd year in highschool Luna! I don't have time to be playing games like this!' Sore protested as she kept walking slower and slower but, Luna made sure she keptted up. 'we're only here so i can show you a Chobits.' Luna replied, Now Sora stopped completey in her tracks, 'you found a Chobits!? those robots that sound,look,act, and feel like a human!? I thought they only had those in Japan! how'd you get one?' she asked shocked yet excitly, 'easy.' she answered sharply, 'its for us. that means Igot it through my ungle!!' she snickered as Sora ran after her. Finally they reached the end of the ally, yes a deadend but Luna didn't panick, she looked up at the full moon and in a loud voice she started speaking Japanese, Sora was heavly confused but didn't know what todo so she just stood their, waiting to be told something. Finally Luna stopped, Her golden hair seemed to be glowing, and her body seemed to be glowing red like comething that had just gotten cooked but was still warm. Luna looked over at Sora and grabbed her hand, then began talking in Japanese again, Sora felt a strong warmth flowing through her body. Her brown hair glowing a different color, it wasn't like Luna's whos yellow hair suddenly turned a beasuitful gold and looked like something only a painter could make! Suddenly Luna stopped talking, a Cold rush fell right down Sora's back that made her fall to the ground, after regaining her wramth which was cruly sucked out of her Sora found a Human lying in front of her, but something about this human was different, and Luna was no where to be seen.      Sora didn't have a choice and carried the body all the way back to her room, surprisingly, her roommate was nowhere to be found either, confused and angry that Luna left her with a most likely dead body Sora placed it on her roommates bed, since she didn't want her own getting dirty.

The glass landed everywhere in my room, luckily I was not hurt.'Matthew whats going on in your room?' my mother calls from the kitchen. 'Nothing.' I quickly answer back. But the truth was that the robot that I got for Christmas this year (BN/4c5) all of a sudden grew four feet and flew out of my window. And when I said flew I literally mean he even took his now life size jet-pack, (that came with him when I got him for Christmas) put it on and flew into my window but still made it outside.            I quickly jumped out of my window and ran after him. I passed a couple of houses and than was on Main St. I could just barely see my robot. BN/4c5 was on the top of City Hall. There was a problem though because I knew I could not get him down unless I could have some one with a helicopter to get him down. Then there lied another problem, after i got BN/4c5 in the helicopter I would have to turn him off.            I turned around and ran to my friend Anthonys' house because his father was a cop in Nashua. Anthony answered the door on the first knock. 'Matt whats up,' Anthony said 'Come in' he said without letting me answer his question. He led me to his room.

I cant believe it its a robot! FYI I love robots. So the next day when I come from school,I look for my robot where I left it and its not there. I hear something in my room upstairs, when I get to my room I see my robot, but now its alive. I cant believe it. I explain everything to my parents, they dont do anything, so I think ok maybe I could keep this robot. My parents let me keep it but, you know it could cause some danger, on the other hand I can use it as a body gaurd or something.

The Gemini-Scout is of course to help people,but it also can save lives.It brings food,water,and other necessary needs.It can take wounded people to safety.It collects information,like test the air for toxins and tells were it's safe to explore. It is easy to use and is remote controlled like a video game.It is small but has every thing a robot might need.Like,strength,steering,talking,and climbing.                          The Dante 2 climbs into volcanoes looking for holes in the creators.It's a pretty awesome job if you ask me.It has eight legs like a spider to help it climb up volcanoes,and steep walls.It gathers data about the gases that come out of the hole or vent.So now the scientists can study a volcano up close while being safe in their lab.                           Then last but not least Mr.Gower,he is a robot that works in hospitals.   He can talk which helps the nurse's and Dr's.He is built with doors and boxes that helps him carry medicines,shots,and maby some paper work.But like I said all robots have a reason for their creation.

One day a small girl named Elizabeth was walking to school and she found a letter in which contained these words 'dear whoever is reading this by now i am probably long gone but on the back of this piece of parchment is a map to get to the scrap yard please if you are brave enough take the key and there is probably still a little oil left it says it stays good forever but you might have to go buy some there is probably some at any hardware store in your area any way please go to the junk yard and fix up my little angel before Dr. latte gets her.' after that Elizabeth just noticed the key, the oil and the picture she looked on the back and in black smudged ink she should could only make out the words Dr. latte.                       after that she went to the junk yard and looked around but didn't see anything so when she started to leave she heard a low scratchy voice it sounded a lot like 'help me' but Elizabeth couldn't really tell then she walked over to the sound and saw a robot and it looked like it couldn't move so she put what was left of the oil on there and suddenly the robot sprang to life.

I am going to write about a robot coming alive! Do you want to know what is going to happen? Well keep on reading!         First, it all started when a teacher said to her class that there was going to be a contest. And that the stundents had to make something for the science fair. Everbody had normal science ideas,but ther was a weird idea someone had. It was that a girl named Moncia wanted to make a robot. At first she tought it was not a good idea. But then after thinking about it she decide to do it.          Second, she went to her house and started doing all the work. Then, she had been in her room for a long time and then she finally finished the robot. So, then the next day she had to present it to the class and when she took of the blanket everybody was amazed to see the robot.So then Monica started to tell her presentation. Everbody was paying really good attention to her. Then, after the presentation was finished everybody was getting up and going to Monica's desk to see the robot.Then itn was time to go to lunch recess.Then Monica got the robot and went to lunch.            Third,while she was eating her robot was sitting next to her. So then, some kids past by and dropped a glass of water in the robot. So then the robot started to stand up and running around like a crazy person. After a few moments it stoped. Then everbody started screaming.Then, the robot started to run again. Monica went to go chase the robot but he was to fast for her!!!! Next, the robot kept on destroying things like breaking the windows with his arms and just making a huge miss. And then he stoped again a looked at Monica and Monica lokked at the robot. Finally like it was made by hand it started to run out of batteries. Moncia went next to robot and the robot said bye. Then finally, Monica looked around and saw a huge miss in the cafteria.               Finally, Monica learned a lesson to never ever do a robot again. And she also had to clean up the cafteria. Then, Monica put batteries on the robot again but in her house.Then she got use to playing with the robot after school every single day!!! And the robot was so happy too as well as Monica was.They played many things. Also, Monica tought the robot how to speak. And she also named the robot. Her name was Rose. And they were happy being toghter.That's my story.What's yours? 	NNP DT NNP NNP . NNP NN VBZ NNP NNP NNP VBP VBG TO VB IN DT NN VBG JJ . NNP PRP VB TO VB WP VBZ VBG TO VB . NNP VB IN NN .

Like a spider,  this robot has eight legs. this helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano.     it is also buit to survive very high heat. when a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter dante goes instead.   then the robot collects inormation about the come out of the vents. in the past scienists could not learn as much about volcanoes but dante 2 is changing that.

My Robot Comes Alive            By: Kelly Meinhart                     It all started one afternoon when I got home from school. I decided to get out my homework and just do it so I wouldn't have to do it later. I opened my binder and started working on my homework. I found the picture of the robot I had doodled at school today. I took it out and decided it wasn't that good after all. I crumpled it up, not wanting anyone to see my robots and threw it in the trash. Then I got started on my homework. I had been working intensively for 1 hour straight, when I heard some weird robot sounds I figured I was probably holusinating from all that hard work I had done. But, no I was wrong, 'BEEP' I heard again. In my mind I figured, nothing wrong with going to check it out. So, I did and you will NEVER believe what I saw.        No this can't be right I thought. Right in front of my eyes was my diasterious robot that I had doodled. My first instinction was to run and go tell my parents, but no they would just think it was all a lie, I had to keep this to myself, no one not even my best friend could know about this. All of a sudden I heard, ' You must save me I amost just died.' I replied back, 'Yeah that was kinda the point.' We then had a whole argument about the trashinh her, and we finally got to the argreement that i would let her stay for 2 days, but then she must go back home, in other words the garbage can.        I then heard the door open, it was my mom, oh no you must hide I thought. I snached the robot ran upstairs and hide her in my closet. I then whispered, 'Don't you dare say a word, we can't let her know you here.' 'Fine then' the robor said sarcastically. I heard the door open, 'Hey is everything okay up her' my mom said anixously. 'Yep' I answered, 'Actually I am just working on a surprise for you.' 'So sweet.' 'Can I just get something from you closet.' 'NO' I screamed, ' I mean that's where your surprise is.'        Finally, it was time to get to sleep, today had been the weirdest day EVER. I really wish that robot had never showed up I thought. Of course I couldn't say anything infront of my sister. I turned of the lights and just imagined that this had never happened. It was impossible though, there is no way I am going to sleep, no way in the world.        Tomarrow morning finally came, I opened my closet door, and nothing was there, but, but, something had been there. I tip toed out to find the robot a step away from my parents bed room. 'Oh no I screamed this can't be happening.' I snached the robot and shoved her out. She told me, 'I must go home? my family needs me.' I tried telling her in the best way possible, 'You are at home.' I then saw billions of robots come out of hiding saying, 'We are here to take over, we are here to take over!' I then screamed, 'NOOOOOO'        I then woke up, my parents had heard me screaming, 'Kelly are you okay?' they asked softly. 'No i'm not these robots were about to take over, and, and.' 'It's okay it as just a dream' they told me calmly.     	.

What if this happens? What will we do? What will happen to us?       Let's think... If the world is taken over my robots what will us humans turn into? Maybe the robots will create us to do thing for them just like we built them to help us. Or what if they turn us into human stew! I can't believe these robots are now alive! Knowing all their knowledge and abilities you can never tell what might happen to us.       If the world may be taken over my robots, what will we do? I have a theory that if those potentialfull robots take over the human race that we will become workers and or slaves. I also think that if we do end up becomibg slaves that no matter what age or race we are, we will have to work all day every day (almost like slaves from long ago).       Well, let's keep our fingers crossed that we don't get invaded by robots. They may be becoming alive but that dosen't mean that they will take all power. 	UH PRP$ . DT NNS : PRP VBP VBN JJ .

Then, all of a sudden, he saw two green lights from under a white sheet...        Tromlopp Qupon O'Rustivix McNeper woke up in the morning feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. It was a Saturday morning, and the sun was covered by gray clouds. It was hailing outside. Tromplopp quickly ate breakfast excitedly. There was thunder and lightning. He grabbed his lab coat and hurried to his tool shed. In there was a table with an object under the white sheet.        Tromlopp pressed a button. 'FINALLY!' Tromlopp yelled. He unveiled what was under the white sheet. There lied a robot about the size of a 2-3 year old kid. Tromlopp backed away from the robot and took cover behind a big wall. All of a sudden, lightning shot through the opening of the shed and struck the robot. Tromlopp closed the shed and quickly looked at the robot. Nothing happened. Tromlopp dejectedly walked back to his house. Then, he heard a whirring noise. Then cracking. All of a sudden, Tromlopp saw two green lights turn on from under the white sheet. He ripped the white sheet off the table, and what he saw there changed his life forever.        He put the object on the ground. It was a fully functional and working robot powered by electricity. 'What is your command,' the robot said. Tromlopp was excited. He had big plans. Tromlopp hurried to the United States of America Patent Office. He filed a patent for having the first living robot which is able to follow any command the owner gives it. He was awarded a huge sum of money for his invention. When Tromlopp got home,   he sped to his shed. He asked the robot to do all sorts of things, like make hot dogs, write down pi, teleport to Mars and back. Tromlopp's robot could do anything. Eventually, Tromlopp realized what he could really do with this robot. He renovated his house, made fake money that looked just like real money. Tromlopp was turning evil. The robot would give everything he wanted. When Tromlopp went to the grocery store to find out whether his counterfeit money worked, the store didn't realize a thing.        Suddenly, Tromlopp was going around town buying everything. He bought new land fr his mansion he was going to have built for himself. He bought the local football team (the Washington Redskins) and soon became the richest person in the world and no one knew how fast Tromlopp went from being in poverty to being the richest man in the world.        Then, before Tromlopp could do anything the police burst through the door of his newly built mansion. He was interrogated and was later arrested by Chief of Police Larry Luster. Tromlopp's patent and robot were destroyed and no one knew Tromlopp had created what so many inventors struggled to create.

What are they made out of? Were are they usually found? These are some of the questions i bet are in your head i will be answering everyone of them, lets start with what are tornado's. Tornado's are big clouds formed when warm air rises and cold air lowers people don't know how it really does form and why it is so powerful, scientist are still trying to find some of the secrets of tornado's scientist feal like they are getting closer by every minute. Next is can tornado's harm me, and yes tornado's are very powerful they can destroy building pretty much anything they run into they can destroy. What are tornado's made out of, tornado's are made out of clouds and gas particles. Where are tornado's found, they are found near Tornado Vally and Arizona .

The Gemini-Scout is used for finding lost miners in underground mines and communicates with the search and rescue team.  This robot tells miners whether the air is safe or not.  The Dante 2 is a robot that goes inside volcanoes and gathers information for scientists when the volcanoe is too hot for them to go inside.  The Mr.Gower is a robot that helps doctors and nurses with medicines to patients and helps doctors focus on more important tasks.  The Agribots are robots that farmers use to pick their fruit or to tell if the fruit is ripe and ready.  Farmers even use them for their greenhouses when their too busy to keep an eye on their plants.  The HRP-4c is a robot that plays with children, pets, or even itself when your too busy or your at work and need a babysitter.  The Google is a robot that drives for you and makes sure you dont get in an accident and just steers the way a human would.

So a weer later I went into that store and i saw it move. I didn't know what to do so i went up and touched it this was the beginning of a whole new world.                     This was insane this was a creature, otherwise known as a robot. I took this robot with me and it started to talk to me. It turns out that this robot was a robot who can interact with others, and play the best soccer in the world! So i named him Chuck he was pretty cool he cleaned up and did my chores for me. I didn't tell anyone about Chuck except my friend Jadenn and she promised not to tell anyone. She wanted to see what he can do so we went in my garage and his shape was like a typical robot he had a square body, but he didn't have any buttons. Chuck had a different personality he liked people who me and Jadenn liked, but the people we didn't like he didn't like either.              I figured Chuck was also good at making food. Anything we asked him to make he made it. when he baked brownies they were the most delightful desert ever. One day my mom made and play date with one of my friends that I really didn't like. So when she was about to come over i had to put chuck somewhere so I had decided to put him in the garage. When my friend came over we watched TV until, she decided to go in the garage I tried to force her to get out, but she wouldn't. Then she saw Chuck I told her not to tell anyone and she didn't which was a shocker.              One day Chuck started saying error error so many times he exploded. That was the end of Chuck, but once I told Jadenn we started crying on the floor. Next week we went to the mall and I found Emma she was Chucks wife and she could do the same things as Chuck, but even better she can do make up and hair i loved her until the same thing happened to her as it happened to Chuck.

In the morning Anthony was upset because his project didnt work.At school,his teacher asked if anyone started on thier project.Many kids from his class started thier project.Anthony wonderd what was he going to do.So when he got home he tried creating elictricity but nothing happed he stood there staring at his robot.When he stood there patiently the robot moved.                          Anthony was suprised the robot moved he thought it wasent gonna work.When the robot stood up it was as tall as a skyscraper.The robot destroyed the roof and said 'im going to destroy you'Anthony freaked out and tried to make the robot shut down but the robot was stronger than him.                         When Anthony was to tired to fight the robot he decided to go to sleep.The robot snuk out to the fair.he destroyed many houses on his way all the village people.When Anthony heard all the noise he woke up.He went to his window and saw the robot but it was bigger than ever then he figured out that elictricity help the robot be stronger so he decided to go in his fathers car to tell his comunity to shut down thier power.When everybody got the message the turned off the power.                            When Anthony noticed the fairs light were on so he raced to the fair to tell the mayor to shut down the power.When he got there he spoted the mayor and told him to shut down the power.When the mayor asked Anthony to shut down the rides and the popcorn stands.Wen all of a sudden darkness fell he spoted the robot and it was collasping.THe robot struggled to get up but the robot shutdown and everybody was cherring for Anthony.The village still rememberd the day and told the story everywhere they went and anthony was the towns hero.

Don't get fooled, it's very generous and can help a lot with saving lives. In fact it is water proof, fire proof, and heat proof. It can also survive the coldest temperature and even got to outer space to explore and even Pluto. It's name is 1177-B3 and was created by an evil scientist called Dr. Two-Brain as to be evil but it revolted the scientist and became to be very generous. Now the Dr.Two-Brain is up to get him back from the NAZA. But he is in prison for his rest of his life in the most criminal person every and is getting treatments from specialists. 1177-B3 is working for NAZA and it's on a mission to Pluto.             The robot has met a lot of robots that are scared of him sometimes but, they are his friends.NAZA has a ton of security in case other evil scientist like Dr. Two-Brain wants to  use the robot for other uses.It sleeps in a high proof bullet windows, bed, and door room. There are even guards outside of his bedroom. Never know what scientist might do to get this robot, might explode stuff to get to the  attention of the guards and get in the robots room to steal it. Right now the robot safe from all evil cases and it,s happy for what it does.

He is connecting the bottles and cans with mud and dirt to create his robot. He finishes his robot with a Gray, square tissue box with a small happy face on the front. There was a loud boom behind Ted and it starts to rain. That night Ted was sitting up in his bedroom looking down at his robot as it starts to turn into a pile of mud and cans. There was a loud crack of lightning as Ted went to sleep.              When Ted woke up the next day he looked out into the sunny backyard to see his robot scorched from  the lightning, but as he kept looking at it he kept looking at it he noticed a slight movement, I'm going crazy, he thought, but as he kept looking at it he realized that it was waving at him. Ted ran downstairs to go look at his robot. ' Where are you going?' his mom asked. But he was already out the door before he could hear her.               When he finally got outside he noticed that the robot's head had turned to metal and the bottle caps had separated into fingers and feet. The robot finally stopped waving, and in a squeaky, metallic voice he said, 'Creator, what is my name?' 'Uh... Your name is Daniel,' said Ted, thinking about his best friend. He was still amazed that a piece of mud and bottle had turned into a working robot. 'Okay! Whatever you say creator,' said Daniel. 'Can you please call me Ted?' asked Ted. After that Ted told Daniel to stay outside while Ted got some breakfast. When Ted got back outside Daniel was still in the same spot where Ted had left him.  'What do you want to do Ted?' asked Daniel. 'We can play dodge ball,' said Ted.                Daniel was amazingly accurate with a dodge ball. Every time he threw it he hit  Ted. His mechanical legs made him turn and run extremely fast. His arms threw the enough force to knock down an elephant. By the time the dodge ball game was over Daniel had one 384 games and Ted had one 16 games. 'That was 400 games total!' Ted exclaimed looking at the ground.                When night came Ted had built a shelter for Daniel on the side of his house. 'Now stay here,' said Ted, pointing at the shelter. As Ted went inside for bed it started to rain and there was lightning. The next morning Ted ran outside to see his shelter burned and a pile of bottle and mud. Ted cried out, 'Why did he have to go!' The sun shone brightly as the day began and even though Ted had only spent a day with Daniel he would remember the day for the rest of his life.

There is a robot named the Gemini-Scout it helps on search and rescue missions.It is remote controlled.It is less than two feet tall and has wheels.It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns.The robot is small but it is very strong.Where ever it goes it collects information.It sometimes tests air for gases for miners and it has a thermal camera that uses heat sensors to find living things.When it finds taped miners it can use its radios to talk to the rescue team.It is controlled with a video game controller so almost any one can use it.It carry's food and water.       There is another robot called Dante 2.This robot goes in volcanoes and gathers information for scientist.It looks like a spider it has eight legs that helps it climb steep walls of the volcanoes.It is built to survive very strong heat.It looks for vents or holes in the crater.Then it collects information about the gases that come out of the vents.So scientists can study volcano safe in there labs while Dante 2 is in the volcano.       There is another robot called Mr. Gover it looks like a small cabinet on wheels.It helps doctors and nurses bring medicine to patents.It has a lot of drawers with locks on it so the nurse can unlock it and get the medicine out.It can ride elevators and steer through hallways and go around things that get in its way.The robot is so strong it can carry 500 pounds.After two hours of charging the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stoping.The Mr. Gower can say hundreds of phrases.

It was a small robot that was supposed to play with the you. I was putting the batteries in when the 'toy-inator 4000' came alive! I screamed for my life! I ran down stairs as fast as a cheetah to get a plastic bag so I can throw the thing away, but then it exclaimed ,'Wait! Don't throw me away!I have come alive to help you Sam.' I was in shock. The thing knew my name and I didn't even program it yet! 'Sam, if you throw me away, you wont be able to get the prize for the Dallas City Science Fair' , it told me. 'How do you know me? Where did you come from? Are you an alien?! If so then don't eat me please! There's a leftover hamburger downstairs, it's all yours!' I shouted.'Sam, I will not eat you. You have made me and I am here to serve you. But I still want the hamburger. Last night while you were sleeping, your dad wanted to help you with...well me, so he programed me. He told me everything I had to know. So then today when you put the batteries in, I came alive.' I was trying to take this all in, but I still didn't think it was possible that me and my dad made a robot! 'Okay then. I believe you. Let's go for a test run shall we? Wait. I have to name you because I can't just call you the toy-inator 4000. Its too long. I'll call you Ti.' I replied to him.                Ti and I went to the park to see what special tricks he can do,when we ran into Jamie. 'Oh hey Jamie.' I said in a depressed voice. She was the mean girl who always kissed up to the teacher. 'Hey Sam. What you got there? Is it your little toy? Hahaha what a baby.' she told me. 'No,it's for the city science fair. Ti is my robot that I'm entering.' I replied. 'Greetings Jamie. I had heard you are very mean and-' 'What did that thing just say?!?' she yelled. 'Nothing. He said your dress is nice.' Bye!' I ran home with Ti. 'Why did you say that??' ' The subject was being mean to you. I was defensing you.' 'Okay thanks. But never say that again! Jamie is so mean. Let's just test your tricks in the backyard.' 'Okay dudet.' ' Dont say that.' I replied. 'Hahaha okay sorry.' It said laughing.We tried out all the special tricks that Ti can preform. Turns out he is a good singer, damcer, gymnast, and juggler. I even taught him how to fly. We stayed up all night getting him prepared for tomorrows big contest. My mom even made him a little coat to wear.                    It was the big day and I was very excited. I was setting up my booth when a girl in a pink,flowery dress comes in. It was Jamie. I couldnt believe my eyes! She had a girl version of Ti! She set up her booth right next time. I was as red as a pepper! 'Hi Sam. I didn't see you there.' I didn't replie. It would just make things worse.A little later I told Ti I would turn him off so that when the judges come to our booth, they would see Ti the whole way through. They were at Jamies booth and when I was turning on Ti, he didnt want to turn on! I kept pressing the power button , but he was just sitting there! 'Mom!Ti isn't working!' 'Calm down sweetie.' she told me. ' I brought extra batteries. I figured that he would die out because you kept playing with him all night long.' ' Thanks so much mom. I almost had a heart attack.' The judges came to my table and I turned on Ti. ' Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Ti. Ti is a homemade robot I made with my wonderful dad.' I told everryone at my booth. 'Greetings everyone' Ti said. He stood up and shook everyones hand. 'For my 1st act, Ti will now juggle while he is dancing on a balance beam.'Oooo ahhhh' People kept saying. Ti went through all his acts without messing up. Jamie was envious with green. ' Ti fly up please' I told him. Ti started to fly up in the air in circles and came down smoothly.' 'thank you everyone.' I told the judges and the crowd of people filmng. 'Listen Sam. You are going down. You won't win. Tirina here can do swan lake. 'Well let's just wait and see' I told Jamie. A hour passed and it was time for the awards. the judges said 'In second place is Ti... rina and Jamie!' ' That leaves us with Ti and Sam in first place! Congrats you two!' The judges exclaimed! I was so happy! I cant believe I won!After the science fair, I went to Yourgurtland with my sister, parents, and obviously Ti too.'                   'And that was the time my robot and I won the science fair' I told my creative writing club. 'Good job Sam!' my tacher told me.

Right before my eyes all of my pencils, paper, pens, and other school materials started to connect. As I was looking in awe at the miraculous sight I saw a figure beginning to appear on my desk. What was it and how did it form were the questions I asked myself as I backed away from this creature that was right before my eyes.            I had been studying robots for years and when this 'thing' appeared before my eyes, my research had payed off. 'Would it be like an Agribot picking all of my food, or a Gemini-Scout with his skill in carrying things?'What could this creature do and would it talk? Then I found my answer because of the name that was boarded on the robot, Ticonderoga. This was the pencil brand that helped create this robot, and now it believed that it's name was Ticonderoga. Still though my question was unanswered, what could it do?            As it took out a piece of paper from what I think was its stomach the robot began to write, 'I am Ticonderoga for all your homework needs.' I was in utter shock when I saw this, knowing what this robot's capability was. I began to ask the robot questions like, 'Can you talk?' and 'Are you good at algebra?' The robot named Ticonderoga then began to beep and start blinking with all of his bright lights. 'I am a great mathematician and I do talk' Ticonderoga said in his robot voice. I never thought I would have such an advantage for 'All my homework needs.'               Then a horrible thing happened, my robot began to take all of my homework and shove it into his stomach! I thought he was going to shred it, or much worse destroy it. As time was slow like molasses I waited for Ticonderoga to give me back my homework, in whatever condition it would be. 'Beep' his stomach said and I waited for the paper's that were used as his stomach to unfold and be able to get my homework back.               Then, to my surprise my homework came out in perfect condition. As I took it out of his colored pencil hand I saw writing on it. 'Hooray' I said as I used my calculator to check the answers Ticonderoga had put onto my paper. They were all correct, and in my exact hand-writing! Shocked by this miracle of a robot I had just created I wondered if I could continue to use this robot for my homework.               I came up with a solution because Teacher's Appreciation Week was coming up, and i and not got my teacher a present yet. Would my teacher be helped greatly by this miraculous correcting robot? Of course he would, what teacher wouldn't want a extra hand to correct paper's? While i was saying my good-bye's to the helpful robot named Ticonderoga I put him into a box that said 'Handle with care' and put a pretty red ribbon on the box. Ticonderoga was a great robot, but i hope that my teacher never gives him any papers to hand out, because he will stick those papers into his stomach, and fill them out with all of the correct answers.

They have to throw him in the trash and in the morning he wakes up.  He wakes in a garbage truck he got out just before he got crushed and lucky he just got dumped in the back of the truck.                      When he got to the hospital there was a new robot.  His name was I-Pet. He did all sorts of tricks and   did that to entertain the people at the hospital. The people that mostly liked I-Pet was the childeren. Medi-Robo did not like that at all. (Medi-Robo has a really big temper).                                      So he went back in the hospital and if people where in his way he would pick them up and then throw them as far and as hard as he could. He would get BIGGER and BIGGER until he could not get any BIGGER.  Everybody was running until they could no more. He basicly tore the whole hospital apart. Now they have to build a whole new hospital building.

When they finaly developed the tecknology to make a back pack hold however much you want useing trans-dementional teck they tried to create a power source. sadly they could not find one. One night they left a nukleur bomb in the lab unadended. When the earthquake happened the bomb blew but before the explosion spread it was atracted to somthing in the robot. When the explosion entered the robot the system finally booted up.          When the scientists came back to check up on the robot they were shocked. The robot was imedetly sent to war and helped win 29 battles. When the enemy army finally caught drift of the reason they were losing they sent out their best weapon in their whole arsonal. A meck. When the meck saw the robot it disposed of him almost to easily. The surprise was that when the robot died the nukleur bomb that brought it to life had blown. The best part was that it was right next to the enemy base! Poor enemies!         After that the military produced more of these robots and by vote they also recreated the origonal robot and deployed them to enemy bases around the world. The trans-dementional backpack was just given to the midics.         Every one loved the robot. The scientists even added applications so that the robot had feelings and know the robot is a high ranking military officer. All boys and girls look up to the robots that saved our country. The End.

She was an engineer who specialized in trying to make robots that could interact with humans. It had been hard to do so, but today was when she got a new piece of equipment.       'Only thing is, I am going to have to get to work before I get to use it. Oh, and before my boss fires me.'       Her boss never tolerated lateness, so as soon as Zoe got to the door, she headed straight to her lab. Panting, she walked over to her latest project. All she needed to finish this robot was coming that day, just for her to finish this one, long thing. She was thinking about all of this when her door opened up. Some strange postal man walked in and plopped a box on the floor. Once she signed his clipboard, she was left alone to do her work.       she opened the carboard box slowly. inside was a small but extremely powerful charger that could alone power a city. she got to work . she unscrewed some parts that held the thing together and put in the battery.

There's another robot named Dante 2.The Dante robot has a hard working job because it goes to the volcanoes and it gathers information for the scientists.It looks for vents and holes .When it finds a hole or a vent it gets information for the scientists.The scientists did not learn about the volcanoes,but than the Dante 2 change it.                    There is a robot that can save life name Mr.Gower.It works in the hospital.It is full of medicine in it's drawers,but are locked.It can help a lot by steering the elevators getting the things that are on the way.It works for long days,but that's not else it can also talk.It is programed with hundreds of phrases.It can also do the stuff that the nurse or doctors use to do.                       The Agribots robot is helpful for farming and picking vegetables.In Massachusetts.The scientists are working to grow crops without mo human help.They created a greenhouse full of plants,but thanks to the Agribots.They made small  Agribots to take care of the plants.The plants are sensed with the robots so the robots can know what they need.

In the story we have our main character Bradley and his friend Adam. They also have a monkey they call him Pelt and a toy robot named Ian. Well it all started when Bradley and Adam mistakingly pluged Ian into the house generator. They thought it was the T.V. that they pluged in. They were  wrong.        'Oh no! ' said Bradley ' Run for it' Then they heard the sound of lightning, but then they saw it wasn't lightning it was all the electricity going into Ian the robot!Then they heard aloud bang and Ian was walking to them 'Hi', said Ian         'You can talk?' asked a puzzled Bradley'Of course I can.' said Ian 'How?' asked Adam. They didn't know the electricity brought Ian to life.          'Oh never mind that' said Ian ' Lets just play I don't actually know what to do though'         'Don't worry we'll show you right Bradley?' asked Adam         'Right!' said Bradley. Then he ran back inside and got a remote control car and the controller, but then Pelt came out and grabed Ian!         'Hey let go!' shouted Ian as he kept trying to pry the monkey's hands off him. Just then pelt dropped Ian and Ian ran back to Bradley and Adam         'Yes we got Ian back!' shouted Bradley but then he saw Ian running away! ' Where are you going?' asked Bradley         'I heard a scream' said Ian as he aproached a building on fire! Then Ian ran in to the flaming building and came out with a man coughing because of the smoke, then they found out Ian had just saved the cheif fire fighter!Ian was then apointed chief robot firefighter.

I got the nerve to walk over there and i saw this little robot sitting there picking up trash. i said ' whoa...'. I ran inside with him in a box sat him on my bed and started asking questions.       A week later we were bestfriends hanging out going to dinner together, only my too bestfriends knew, susy and katherine. We would all go out to play and hangout in the woods together. Everyday at 4:15 my friends would come up to our treehouse and sit and talk about our day.       In the end robot had to go back to space.

My friends, Anette, and America, decided to check out the new museum that opened in town just yesterday! We were all tired and without any energy, but we were desperately wanting to check out that new museum.            As we arrived at the 'Robot Museum', we noticed robots EVERYWHERE!!! Robots awaiting at the front door. robots on the roof, robots wandering helplessly around the museum, everywhere!!! As we came through the sliding glass doors of the museum, we felt a cold blast of air that rejuvenated us, but we were all still tired. We all decided to take the elevator to the second level were robots are believed to come alive. We exited the elevator and we all saw a fascinating robot with tons and tons of buttons, pushing them out of curiosity, but still tired and gloomy. America pushed a big red button, and it started to make a strange beeping noise!!! Beep-beep-boom-beep-beep-boom went the strange button. Out of the blue, green smoke started to come out of the robot, and we all started to fell as tired as ever.            After that little mishap, we realized that the robot with the big red button on it was alive, and rolling around as excited as ever. I got startled and started to panic, finding out that the robot can speak!!!!! 'How do you do?' said the robot. 'Ugh............, um............., were fine?' we all said to the robot.'' My name is Bob and i am a robot who can do whatever you wish.'' ' OK first of all, where are we and what are we doing here?'Your in Robot ville where everything you see are robots,' said Bob. 'O, about what you said, you can do whatever you want huh?' said Anette. 'Certainly, whatever you would like, in fact my middle name is Dowatever!!!' 'Well then, please take us out of....... what the city name.......oh, Robot ville, and return us to Lancaster, PLEASE!!! ' said America. 'Ok then, dipity-doo-dipity-daa, take these girls to Lancaster, yaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'            We suddenly realized that we were back in Lancaster, in the freshened museum. Anette wanted to return to the house and just have a nice lemonade iced tea, and we all agreed. As we exited the museum, we realized it was night time, and that we had only been in Robot ville for 15 minutes. It got me to thinking, and I realized we fell asleep on the museum floor, and that this was all just a dream.

I could not get it to work but I was fine with that plus I hade go to bed anywayes.                        When I woke up in the morning I notised that it was gone and the door was wide open. I looked out side, I saw out side ravaging the garbage, and graling. It looked at me like wild animale. It jumped over the fents, and I ran after it but I couldnt find it.                        The next morning the whole naberhood distroyed. I wondered how such a little thing could do so much. Then I herd somthing in the kitchen, I grabed my dads shotgun and went to see what it was.. then I herd somthing come from the coberd, and I dident hesatate to shoot it. I figured out that it was the robot that was soposed to be a harmles project. I burreid it in my back yard under a larg rock.

Bobby was out in his dad's shop one day and was trying to build something that would do his chores around the house and would do his homework so that he could build more things.  So that is when he came up with the idea of building a robot.  He built the robot in approximately a week.  Then he had to try and see if it would actually  turn on so that he could use it.  So then he tried it didn't work so he work on it a little more every night and tried again to see if it would work every night but it never worked.  Bobby had tried so hard on that little robot he was starting to get frustrated with the robot.  So he decided he would work on it in a couple nights so that he could think on it a little bit.  he thought hard and harder every night but could not find the right solution so he decided o go to a mechanic shop after school and ask one of the mechanic's if they had any ideas on what could be wrong with his robot and the mechanic said well it don't know if you don't bring the robot in.  So Booby said he would and the next day he brought the robot in and the mechanic looked at the robot and couldn't find one thing wrong with it.  But the mechanic said Young boy did you build this by your self?  Yes I did sir.  Well this is mighty fine for a young boy like you.  Well thank you sir.  But son I'll have to say i can't find the problem.  So Booby said i will just try to find it myself.  So Booby took the robot home and worked until his mother came and told him it was time for supper.  So Bobby came in and asked his father i would like you to come and see something I built after supper.  Okay his father said.  So him and his father  went out to the old shop and Bobby said dad I want you to close your eyes I think this is the best thing i have ever made so his father covered his eyes. Bobby led his father to the robot and told his dad to open his eyes.  When his father opened his eyes he was very shocked to see what he actually was seeing.  He said son did you make his all by yourself.  Yes i did but i can't get it to actually turn on but i wanted you to see it anyway.  Well i am glad you did because this is magnificent.  Do you think i can fix it if i keep trying? Of course i think you most sertainly can.  So they whent back inside and went ot sleep that night and Bobby heard something out in the kitchen.  So Bobby went out there to see if anything was there.  Right when he steped into the kitchen he heard another noise.  Then all of a sudden he saw a fast movement.  Trying to be quit so whatever it was wouldn' hear him he snuck into his parents room.                     When Bobby go in there he woke up his father and said dad i heard a noise coming from the kitchen and then i saw a very quick movement.  Ok im coming i will check it out.  So Bobby and his father went into the kitchen and then there was another movement.  Bobby father said Bobby we need to be very careful.  So the two of them snuck into the kitchen a little farther and they saw what is was.  It was Bobby's robot cleaning the kitchen from the night before.  When Bobby saw what is it was he was in great shock.  He said i sware it didn't work last night.  Maybe a fuse just started working and it wasn't working last night.  But how could it start working if i didn't do any thing to it?  Maybe it fell over and hit something and hit the right fuse.  I guess I didn't think to check the fuses.  Well it guess that was something we wern't expexting when we heard the noise.  Ya you are very right well we best get back to sleep and turn the robot off.  You still have school tomarrow.  I know i will have my robot up in the morning and he will have breakfest made and served on the plates.  So when mom gets up early to make breakfest tell her im on it.

I went to many types of stores and i couldn't find the right battery size. I bought a car battery and it fitted. I turned it on and I took it home. My robot is really smart.

That little boy was Max. Max would dream about robots over and over again. Untill one day he had decided to make a robot himself. 'I'm going to make a robot that could give me unlimited wishes' he said to his parents. But his parents didnt have the care in the world to pay attention. 'Yeah yeah' his dad would say. 'Go play in your room' shouted his mother. He knew he could make them proud so when his parents went to eat dinner, he stayed up working on his invention.              It took all night but he had finally created the robot of his dreams, The Wishbot 3000. He wanted to try it out so he plugged the wires together but it didnt work. He tried to do everything he could but it was impossible. After half an hour he finally gave up and went to bed. Whir! Whir! He heard something coming from the living room. Whir! Whir! He quickly went out to bed and dashed for the living room. There stood next to the couch was a miricle. It  was The Wishbot 3000. Tears of joy were rolling down his face. finally his parents came home and nearly fainted. Now tears of sadness rolled down his cheeks. His parents still didnt care. They went straight to their rooms without a care in the world as always.             After spending a week with Wishbot and making wishes to help the world he didnt care what his parents think anymore.Weeks passed and some bad news went by. 'I'm here to take over the world' said Wish Bot. I've had a lot of fun with you but I have to complete my mission. Max was on the floor crying his eyes out. Wish Bot needed to do what he come for. So he left the house, leaving Max behind. Months had passed and Max would never forget the time he had with Wishbot. Knock! Knock! Who could it be? There standing on the porch was the one and only Wishbot. Wishbot had never forgotten the time they had together either. Max was crying tears, tears of joy. As the years passed by they have stayed together no matter what.

When the girls woke up they heard a noise?'What was that'Cassidy said with a strange look on her face. 'Oh that's the oven the cookies are done'!So when the girls went to the kitchen they opened the oven all the cookies were 'GONE'.Then they went searching all around the kichen to see where the cookies went.they finillay found something eating the cookies it was a Robot.The girls had a questioned look on their face.After staring at the robot for so long one of them finillay aked what it's name was.It said its name was 'Sally'Sally the robot I came from the oven.           The next few weeks they had no idea what to do with Sally or what to say to  thier parents.Their decison was to hide Sally until they could think of a way to get Sally back into the oven.          It was Monday and the girls had to go to school.Sally had to stay home for 5 hoursuntil the girls came back from school.Sally had no idea what to do because she had never been at a house before so she figured to do somethings robots do.She thought maybe she could work.She worked for a little like cleaning the house and things.That wasn't very fun so she started to draw as she finished drawing the girls came home and happy to see that Sally was okay.           Destiny and Cassidy had the solousion to Sally's appearence the reason why Sally's here is because we cooked the cookies too long.Allthough Sally was a good friend she had to go back where she came from.So they made more cookie dough and put the cookies and Sally in the oven and Sally was the best cookie eating robot ever.

He buyed all the games in the world to give to the good boys and girls almost like Santa but not quite.He lives in a mall that he owns for being all the gifts  parents buy from him. He was a popular robot in the world except in Korea where they think they have a better Robot than theres. He was the best robot in 2099. So thats the story of The Wolf Star.

It was meant to be an army robot: one that could shoot and scout, camoflouge and bomb. In theory, it was even supposed to change into a tank. But it was far from being completed. In fact, it wasn't even half way done. Creating such a device that could possibly win this war that has been raging on for almost twenty years turned out to be almost impossible. There was a lot of research, building, experimenting, failing, backtracking, taking apart, rebuilding, experimenting again, and failing again over and over  like a cycle.

Devin was speechless and all he could say was 'OK.'Devin helped the robot down and said ' What do you want to do first?' TC-3PO said 'Well why don't we start with a tour and then we can go have some gas for lunch. Devin said 'OK' and after touring the building and TC-3PO having a disgusting lunch of motor oil they went on an adventure that would change their lives forever.   TC-3PO said Hey do you want to meet my friend Yoda?' At first Devin was appalled but suddenly said ' Sure sounds cool.' So after flying and walking through a very muddy swamp they met Yoda and he said ' Devin you would be a very good Jedi, would you like me to train you to be so?' Devin eagerly accepted his offer and soon became a Jedi with his best friend TC-3PO and they lived happily ever after saving many princesses and defeating the dark ones twice, before retiring and living happily on motor oil and french fries until 4000 years later when they died.

I guess you could say I'm just an average sixth grader. We are out from school for spring break now. We were assigned to make something for art over the break. It has to be at least as tall as us, and weigh more than five pounds.                 I have been trying to come up with something to make. I think I finally have it. I will make a robot. My dad and I are about to go to the store for my materials. This is what I got: cardboard, aluminum foil, glue, tape, markers, and construction paper. I hope that's all I need. Tomorrow, I will build it.                 Saturday. I'm going back to school in two days, and I still haven't built my robot. I went to get my dad, but he was asleep, so I woke him up! We decided to make my robot colorful. My dad had some extra spray paints and I had my markers. After he was built, we colored him. I think it looks pretty cool. We used the construction paper to cover the cardboard for my robots face. We used the aluminum foil for his body coverings. I hope my art teacher thinks its as cool as I do!                   Sunday has passed. It's Monday. My robot is finished and my art teacher loved it. The thing is, we have to present it. 'Mollie! You're next', said my art teacher, Mr.Davis. Here goes nothing. I started with some facts about robots. 'Robots can be hard-working, and they can be playful. They also can be both, which is exactly what mine is.' Okay, I'm off to a good start. 'Some robots work in hospitals (Mr.Gower), and some work in mines (Gemini-scout). My robot is not real, but a design of the robot Mr.Gower. I have her designed as a nurse and I hooked up a recording in the back that says 'your delivery Is here, just like the actual Mr.Gower.' I took off my cover and everyone was amazed! Some nerd in my art class, Jeffery, asked 'Why didn't you make it real?' My response was 'I didn't have enough time.' I think we know that's true. Thank goodness that was over with.                  When I got home, my parents asked me how it went. I told them it went pretty good and took my robot upstairs. It was late when I got home, so I just went straight to bed. Tried to, anyway. Every half-hour, someone from my school called me. I got the same question EVERY time: Why wasn't your robot real? I was ready to throw the phone! 'I wish it as real, so I could sleep in peace without people calling me every 30 minutes!',I screamed. Right after I said that, something strange happened. I heard a loud noise and it was coming from my robot. I got up and approached it slowly. It started talking. It didn't say what was on the recording, it said 'You didn't want your friends, so now you have none.' I thought I was dreaming at first, so I ran into the door. Shouldn't have done that. Now I have a black eye. So I guess it's not a dream, after all.                  I didn't know what to say. When I got to school, nobody but the teachers were there. I was worried so I called my big sister, because I knew my parents were working. It said there was no phone with that number, so I called my parents and asked them where my sister was, and they said what sister, I was an only child!!! I was even more worried now. What do I do?                 I went home and talked to my robot. She said after what I said last night, she wanted to help me because I was her creator, and she thought I meant I didn't want my friends, at ALL! I talked with my robot for a long time! She said she was sorry and that she would try to reverse it. She said all she needed was pictures of me and my friends from before they, kind of, like, disappeared! I had a bunch, so it went by fast. I just hope I get my friends and my sister back! I miss them so much. Guess what? It worked.              The only thing is that they don't know about what happened. They think they've been here the whole time, and I'm okay to think that, as long as I have my friends.

Then after getting bored they decided to go to the mall. there they saw at bestbuy selling a robot that could do anything the owner comanded it to do, homework, chores, and even play video games!    Sam and Jacob really wanted to get it, but then they saw the price tag. 'three-hundred dollars!' exclamed jacob. they both decided to save up for it. They went to thier nieghborhood and asked to do chores for money. Jacob even tried to apply for a job at Mcdonalds. After a few days they had three-hundred dollars. They went to BestBuy at the mall and purchased the robot. 'YAY!' said Sam when they finally got home. They nicely asked Sam's mom to take a knife and cut the tape on the box. After that they put batteries in a little box on the robot's back. He imediantly turned on and said, '~'~'~' please say name '~'~'~'. Jacob imediantly said BOB! '~'~'~' OK now i am BOB, what would you like me to do '~'~'~'. first, they played video games. Then he cleaned thier room, And finally, the robot helped Jacob and Sam do everyday tasks for the rest of thier lifes.

I was doing my math homework when my Dad walked in with a big blue box. 'Honey look what I got.' He came over to where I sat and pulled out a metal figure. 'What is that?' I asked him staring at it confused of why he was so excited. 'It's a robot I bought at the convention.' 'Okay...' 'Wh...' Before I could finish he pushed a button and it turned on. 'Hello I'm Maid #3000.' After it turned on I was starring back and forth between the robot and my Dad. Why is does he like this thing so much I mean it's cool but not so cool that I think i'm going to explode cool, I thought to myself. 'Well I'm going to bring it upstairs and test this baby out.' My Dad said running with joy in every step towards the stairs. After I saw this sight of my dad looking like a kid at a candy shop, I decided to talk to my friend Ella. 'Hey' 'Hi' 'Whats up' 'My dad got this wierd robot toy and is playing with it upstairs.' 'That sounds... different.' 'Tell me about it.' After I talked to Ella I decided to go to bed.       'BOOM!' I heaed outside my room. I was scared out of my mind, but I decided to see what it was. When I looked I saw the robot smashing plates breaking furniture saying 'Robots shall take over the world' repeadingly. Then it saw me I screamed and ran upstairs. I first tried to go to my Dad's room, but he's at another convention. Hopefully he doesn't buy another one, I thought. Then I called for help but no one believed me so I called Ella. 'Okay i'll over as soon as possible.'        I had her come through the window because I blocked my door. 'What aew we going to do?' She asked. 'I have a plan' I told her. The robot has a botton that turns it off so you will distract it while I push the botton. 'Okay' she said. Then we got to the mission. I snuck out the window wile Ella unblocked my door and distracted the robot. While she was doing this I snuck through the front door and got ready to push the button. 'Hey robot I know you want to destroy me' Ella said then did some random stuff that I had to chuckle at.Then when the robot started to move I pushed the button and it turned off. 'Yes!' We both said and highfived eachother.Then we cleaned the house.      'Hey I'm home' 'Hi Daddy' 'Honey look what I got.' Then he pulled out another robot. Here we go again...

Now this brings me back 14 years. When I fist had an experience with a robot. Well, I began eating my favorite cereal, Captain Crunch.I looked in the cabinet for some peanut butter, but to my knowledge I didn't have anything. So I began my list:       Eggs Pickles Peanut Butter Waffles Jelly Etc.                  I walked a block to the market, I picked up what I needed,and then went home. When, I got home I checked the mail.Nothing. So, I put the groceries away. Then, I  went to take a nap. About in the middle of my nap, the doorbell rang. Ring, ring, ring. I got up, went to the door. And to my expectations, there in my face was a robot. He started,'Hello, my name is Wilbur. I am a mail robot. Package for Alexxa Robinette. Thank you for your service.' Well, then almost everybody on the block got a package. I opened mine to find a pink slip. Blah, blah, blah.I was ready to find out what was in the box. I pulled out some bubble wrap. It was nothing. Wow, what a waist of time. Okay, well thank you for listening to my awkward story.

His name was Duke.       Duke was the best pet you could imagine. Nobody wanted him they thought that he would be like a remote control dog, but he wasn't. He was a regular dog. Everyone didn't give him a chance, but this one girl, Kellie Baker, gave him a chance. She bought him and she did exactly what Duke wanted her to do, she gave him a shinny collar. The tag had his name engraved in it. Duke and Kellie were the best of friends, until Duke got sick.       Kellie took him to the vet. The vet asked what was wrong with him and Kellie did not know. The vet took some blood from Duke and ran some test, but nothing seemed to be wrong. Kellie remembered that Duke was a robot dog. How did the doctor take blood if Duke was a robot? Duke had turned to a real dog!       Duke was real and living. Duke was so happy to have somebody love him even before he was real. Kellie had loved Duke for who he was.       Duke and Kellie went on adventures together, they went to France, they went to San Fransisco, they even went to Europe. Kellie and Duke had fun and Duke was beginning to get old and not as strong as he was when he was a puppy. Now Duke wished he was a robot again so he could live forever with Kellie. Then Duke relished something he ha dent relished before, Kellie was going to die and if he was a robot nobody would love him any more. The only person who loved him was Kellie, and Duke was going to enjoy the rest of his life with the person he loves.       Duke and Kellie were getting old and Duke had began to get sick wwith a disease that most dogs don't recover from. Kellie took Duke to the vet to put him down. It was hard for Kellie to let him go, but she saw that he was suffering. A few years later, two at the most, Kellie got sick too and she died from it.

Meet The Robots                 In this science fiction story there would be types of robots. Many types of them and each can do many different things.              Gemini- Scout is a robot that you can control. It does search and rescue missions and it helps miners if they are stuck in a certain places. It is two feet tall. It can even roll under the water. It also checks the air to tell the miners if it is safe or not. And it uses its thermal camera to find miners that you can't see.              Mr. Gower is a robot that helps in the hospital and comes in many shapes and sizes. It is really strong it can carry about 500 pounds. Mr. Gower carrys the medicine in his cabnet and runs on batteries which will make him work for 12 hours straight without stop.              Dante 2 is a robot that climbs volcanoes and gathers information for scientists. It can stand very high temperatures just in case it gets to close. Dante 2 has eight legs just like a spider which helps it climb.              In the end are a really big help, us humans are just trying to perfect the right robot.               	.

It was the biggest robot company in the world. The company's purpose was to tell what the robots are supposed to do.         A virus givin by a hacker infected the company's main system and all the robots shut down. And it was supposed to reboot and reprogram the robots software and the robots would become bad. Only one robot was rebooted and reprogramed its name was Olly aka.RI-unit 77392. It was a maintenance and intellegience unit.         No one knows about Olly. His new mission is to give the hacker the all information the company has about the robots. He will use the information for his copycat operation which is him making the exact same robots but with other purposes. Olley has 32 hours and 52 minutes to complete the task.        The person who hacked RI-Corp. used to work for them his name is James Rodney, he was payed a good amount of money. He was a millionaire he was then fired and moved to Russia.Then he hacked RI-Corp.         At the time the robot was fixing a heat ray before he was shut-off. When he woke up his arm was blasted off he was was leaking oil and now with this injury he only has 22 hours. He had to go to floor number 179. He knew he had to climb, but how with this injury he was nearly useless.He remebered about a fuse ray on the floor he was on there was a fuse ray which fused things together.He wasn't able to fuse his arm together because it was blown to ash.         He ended up not fusing anything to himself. He trie to reprogram himself to be a climber, but when he was rebooted the virus was already gone he found out that James Rodnay had been arrested and sent to a high tech security monitored prison. Everything was normal again.

The dante 2 robot has a very dangerous job climbing volcanoes, which is used for gathering information for scientist. it was also built because humans can survive the heat of volcanoes only robots can. so while the scientist are controlling the robots, the robots are gathering the info for scientist.          The Mr Gower robot works in hospitals and saves lives. it can steer steep turns and it can even carry up to 500 pounds. mr gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. Mr gower can go anywhere he wants in the hospital. it can ride elevators and steer all over the hospital.           The robot hrp-4c doesn't do much but it has the special ability to dance and sing. the hrp-4c can also play piano with its two mechanical.          Agribots pick fruit and are very useful for farmers because unlike apples and oranges strawberries and grapes are a lot more difficult to pick. Agribots arent widely used, they all come in different shapes and sizes. The Agribot can sense when the fruit or vegetable is ripe so they'll know when to pick it.

Nowadays, we have all kinds of technological things including expensive phones with internet, tablets, laptops, computers, and other useful electronics that we use. Robots are also becoming very popular by helping to save lives, exploring volcanos, babysitting, picking fruit, collecting information, and much more things. Who knows what we will have in the future if we already have robots doing our jobs today.                   A few types of robots are the Gemini- Scout robot, the Dante 2, Mr.Gower, Agribots, the HRP-4c, and the Google car.These robots all have different and unique characteristics which now help us in our everyday lives. For example, the Gemini- Scout robot does search- and- rescue work in underground mines. The Dante 2 collects information such as going down into volcanos to explore them. Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hospitals. This robot can ride elevators, steer through hallways, move around things that get in the way, and it can also pull 500 pounds. Agribots is a farmer robot and  it picks fruit. It can pick fruits such as apples, grapes, oranges, or berries.The HRP-4c robot can even dance and sing.Last, the Google car robot practically drives you around. It is a robot car that almost completely drives itself. Those were the types of robots and their characteristics.                       There are a lot of technological devices in our world these days, and a lot of people probably wouldn't survive without them. People use technology to communicate with their family members and friends. Others use it to do research on the internet, and others just for fun. The study of science has helped us to be able to have electronics, plus robots. In the future, robots will most likely be our babysitter, employees, and our best companions.

He had two twin sisters,they were five year old.He lived in a small house with his parents. Mark's family was really poor and lazy.             One cloudy day Mark went over to his best friend's house Gael. When they got to Gael's house they saw a robot . Not those kind that move ,just a clay model.Gael's dad was a professional  person that made things out of clay.They were watching a movie called 'I-Robot'.                                                                   All of a sudden they heard foot steps and someone mopping. They went to see who it was.They couldn't believe their eyes. The robot was doing the job .They were so impressed that the robot could also talk.He did an amazing job at cleaning.Even Mark wanted to take it home(since his family was super lazy).                                                         After ten long lasting years the robot broke down and never worked again. The kids actually named the robot 'Cleaner'.'Cleaner' picked up and cleaned every single piece of garbage.Either it was inside the house or outside.Now he is remembered as a future robot system.Nobody knows how it came alive.Some say it was a miracle or magic.                               Gael's dad made another robot clay model,but nothing happened .He even tried real magic. Still no answer from the new robot . To this day many robots are made but with metal,cables and electricity.

The Gemini-scout is a remote controlled robot that dose search and rescue work in a mine underground.The robot is not very tall it can go down stairs and, go through water. The robot is strong and, can carry food and water and, other things you need it can also drag hurt people to safety. The Gemini-scout collects information. For example it can take air samples to see if the air is safe or not. The gemini-scout has a camera that will help is see if they have any lost people to find and, bring them back home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The Dante 2 is a robot that climbs into a volcano and collects information for scientist. The Dante 2 looks like a spider because it has 8 legs and, is also built to survive is the very hot heat.The robot looks for vents and gases from the volcano.Now since scientists created a robot that can stand the very hot temperature they study it up close.                                                                                                                                       Mr Gower is a robot that works in the hospital and, carries medicine and small little cabinets on wheels the robot is a stack of drawers that are locked and only the doctors can get inside of. The robot can can go anywhere inside the hospital it wants. It takes 2 hours for it to charge then it can go a full 12 hours without stopping it can also talk to people.           Agribots are robots that pick fruit,some types of fruit it picks are berries,oranges,grapes,and apples Agribots are not used everywhere in the world yet and, they come in all shapes and sizes at (MIT) scientist are workings growing cherry tomatoes all on there on with no help from humans!           Robots that play with each other are usually based on animals that kids like to play with HRP-4c is a robot that can sing and dance with you it has 2 mechanical hand they use.           The last robot can drive your car for you the state of Nevada made rules that is it possible for robots to drive it this car has a $80,000 cone shaped laser mounted on its roof.

So the robot rover went to the dark side first and looked all threw the perimeter and found nothing. then the robot went over to the bright side and still found nothing. then the NASA wonder id they went in the middle of both dark and bright sides if  there would be Any thing over there so they mad the robot dig-ed  whole in the middle of the 2 and found life.         the life form looked like a worm or a snake but it was really small it was about half an inch long.Then the robot grabbed the the worm like thing for the scientist to look ant the the robot rover took it to the the lab and it was Peruvian that there was life on a norther planet now they had to look for water.     then the robot went every where looking for water on the both dark and bright sides. Then they went to the dark side and dug a deep whole and found water and there was lot of the water so they got a sample of the water so the scientist could look at the water to see if it was good enough to drink so they got regular water and compared it to the planet water and they had a perfect mach of semicolons all they needed to do was clean it more then they could drink the planet water so they clean the water and then drank it and it tasted fine the person did not die he did not even get sick he was fine.

Bill was so impressed with how he made the robot come to life that he jumped with joy.To make sure the robot did what it was told he gave it the command to clean up the hole house.Within an hour the robot came back and it was done Bill did not belive this so he went inside and the hole house was spot less.Bill was so impressed with the robot that he told the robot he would give him a medal for his good listening.                                                                                                                                                                                       All that day Bill and clr44 walked around and Bill gave him commands.He was given all kinds of commands such as to help a person with there cleaning or help a person in danger.Then as Bill an clr44 walked by the ice cream kart Bill got greety and told clr44 to steel the ice cream and bring it back.Within two minuetes there where screams from the ice cream kart right as clr44 turned the corner with the hole ice cream kart.That day Bill only got more and more greety and kept on telling clr44 to do bad things like steel all the money from his friends safe or rob the pizza parlor of all its pizza.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The next day Bill woke up and his parents told him to take apart clr44, but Bill refused and left his house with his robot.All that day Bill ran around the city hiding from his parents with clr44.When all of a sudden another robot jumped out at them and said 'Hello my name is 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.'Then the two robots fell in love and ran away together to live a happy life.

So it was  May 15,1972 ,Monday when it all started. I was in science class and our teacher was explaining that she assigned the whole class to come up with a science experiment for the science fair. She said it had to be involving the works of technology and it will be due on Friday. Like usual I was staring off in space when my science teacher  Mrs. Argules called my name; 'Nancy Castro'! Tell the class what will be due on Friday. I said, 'Something?' Mrs.Argules looked mad but ignored me. She repeated that this Friday we have to make a science experiment for the Science Fair. Finally class was over and I went home walking with my friend Guadalupe. Guadalupe said ' Nancy what are you doing for your science project? I said, 'I don't know whatever? '                                So days went by Tuesday,  and Wednesday. I was in Science now   Mrs. Argules asked each of us what we were doing for our project. When it was my turn to say what I was doing I got nervous and I said ' Um mm....... Robot!'Yeah.' I'm doing a robot.'   The bell rang and I went bursting out the door. Guadalupe said ' So you're doing a robot!' I said 'What?' 'Oh yeah robot.' Right.' Tonight I started on the robot  it was hard. I found different websites and books on robots and I stayed up until One in the morning working on the thing. I made a robot that picks fruit. After I went to sleep.                                In the morning I ate and went to get my robot. It wasn't there. I looked all over and I just went up to my room to get my backpack and go to school. I couldn't believe it the robot was there. It was...... Alive! It could walk, talk, carry things and read. I called the robot Rogelio. I picked that name because he was reading the book called Rogelio. I took it to school and people kept staring. I took it to the science fair and I got first place. Mrs. Argules couldn't believe I made the robot and she kept looking at it to find store tags. So Rogelio and I went home and I asked my mom if I can keep him. She was about to say no when Rogelio did all her chores, she immediately said 'Yes.' So that's how my science project came alive.

Suddenly his robot ,Gemini-Scout 2000, had awoken out of nowhere!                 'Hell-oo,' said the Gemini-Scout 2000. Robert knew from his research that robots weren't able to talk without a special piece of equipment which he knew he hadn't put in. The robot JUMPED off the table and bolted out of the room, and out into the world. Ellis knew that his robot was going to be unstable and that he had to get him back into that lab before anything went wrong. He grabbed his jacket and went out after that robot.                 'Oh, Mr. Robot!!!' exclaimed Robert. It was dead silent out in the desert, but in the distance he heard a faint whisper and knew it was the robot. He jumped into his car and drove ,over the speed limit, in the direction of the whisper.                 'I will NEVER come back until I prove myself to the world that I am more than just some metal!' The robot flew to the biggest mine in the United States of America, since he is built to do search-and-rescue in mines around the world. The mine had caught on fire and most of the workers were trapped in the mine. He flew into the mine and searched for people trapped and found no one so he flew back out. When he got outside he saw the one and only Gemini-Scout, the one that was first built had saved all the people. The Gemini-Scout 2000 was so angry he flew all the way up to outer space. While he was up there he saw a space ship coming straight for him, but he was fearless so he stayed put.                 When the space ship approached him it said,'Friend or foe?'                 'It depends who you are, if you are a human from the planet earth than I'm a foe to you.'said the Gemini-Scout 2000. The space ship opened it's doors so the robot of Robert Ellis went into the space ship. When he entered he saw another robot was smiling at him.                 'We have been waiting for a robot like you,' said the robot.                 'Who are you?' said the Gemini-Scout 2000.                 'The great and only Dark Thunder! You might have heard of me. I too was created by Robert Ellis and he made me go out of my head so I went after all the people in that world and tried to destroy them. My plan didn't work because Robert got a hold of me and had a team drop me off here. Now that I have you my army of other Earth haters will go to Earth and take it over!!' yelled Dark Thunder.                 'I'm your man. I want to show the world that I am better than the old Gemini-Scout.' exclaimed the robot. With that they all headed to Earth that's when the trouble of the robot war began. When the robots attacked the humans suited up to fight back. All the robots had one person to terminate. Gemini-Scout 2000 had to get rid of none other than his creater, Robert Ellis. He was so glad to be able to terminate Robert, and right when he was about to he saw Dark Thunder smiling at him and right then he knew what he was doing was wrong. Robert told him what he needed to do to be a hero so he flew over to Dark Thunder.                 'Your games are over! You played me and your whole army. You belong up in space.' yelled Gemini-Scout. With that he kicked him all the way back to space with the rest of his army.

The first robot is called the Gemini-Scout it is a remote-controlled robot that gose into mines and rescues miners that got trapped in caves and can't get out by their selves.Next is Dante 2 it looks like a giant spider. its job is to go into volcanos when people can't and trys to look for vents or holes and collects infomation on the gases inside.Another is Mr.Gower he works in hospitals and helps bring medicne to the doctors.Mr.Gower is very strong and he also runs on batteries.He is also a doctor and can go anywhere in the hosptial.The last robot the first one is called Agribots and it helps farmers pick all sorts of fruit and can take care of plants and can even take care of a full green houses.                                                                                 This paragraph is going to have robots that like a good time.Theres a Japanese robot that can play the piano with its hands!Thiers another robot called HRP-4c that can sing and even dance!Theres also life like pets and they are just like real pets but thiers one thing you don't have to feed them or take them outside!                   Well if you didn't belive about robots you will have to think again.Are you thinking about getting a Agribot to help you with the plants you are horrible with.Want to get a robot that sings and dances or even one that can play piano.Want a pet that you don't have to feed or get allergic to then if you want to know more about them then heres the place to get the information about them!Hope you liked my essay.

718	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			M	590746	6	11087450	Y	55103	       There once was a robot named E.J. he was in the store and a little kid came and picked him up. Than the kid wished for him to come alive, and he did that night. He could do many things like talk, walk. he was strong, pick things, play, carry stuff,and a lot more.I think this sounds like one of there best robots.         He can do lots of things and he only runs on batteries, instead of buying new ones just charge him up. Also he can get any information you need. E.J. is really playful he is small, but can do a lot of things the boy does. Strong is another thing he is he can pick up things and carry it to and, he is only like 2 feet and can carry computers. Talking is one he can talk in all kinds of  different languages like he might say 'are you having some fun. He can drag people to safety, and can even give them some medicine he has stored in his body. Walking he can do on his on also he can go forward, backwards, right, left, and twist around. He is smart he can get any information you need from his brain. His legs starts off with 2, but u can say if you want more. It has a remote just like a video game one just in case you want to control him. He has a radio that he can get in touch with the rescue team. I think he is a very good toy.               The boy goes to school barging about  how good the robot really is. He says ' this is the best robot everyone should get one'.                I forgot to say he can all kinds of work. He can play all types of games. I think he is a really good robot. He is one robot with the skills of other robots. He doesn't coast that much in the store ether because they want to sell a lot of them. I hope you think my story was good book club.

719	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	593670	6	11087451	Y	55103	                           In the year 3000 there was a robot named Magage was wondering what it would be like if there were humans on her planet, Hemon. Just then it was announced that there was a group of robots being gathered for training t go to Earth, the planet of the humans. Magage was excited. She wanted to go to Earth and play with the humans. She hurried to the Command Center to check the list posted on the entrance and sure enough her name was the first one there. She went inside of the vast building and down the steep ramp to the CCPR (Command Center Program Room). She was welcomed in and ushered into a room across the hall and plugged into a machine. She woke two hours later in a Launch Room with her other 'launchees.' She was assigned to a number, 123456741852963, and put into a room and shut off.            She woke and looked out of the window to see space, space, space, Earth! They would be landing soon.            When they landed the robots were split into groups of three. The names of the other robots in her group were Joam and Derlk. They were launched out into space together and instructed to go to a country in Earth call America. They did as they were told, went to America. Magage, Joam, and Derlk split up to gather the most information. Joam went to New York, Derlk to Texas, and Magage went to Michigan. Magage was too absorbed with the buildings, flying vehicles, and the people to gather information. The people oh the people were lovely! She was following a person called Jen when she was shot. She immedietly sent a distress message to the CCP to warn the others when the radio filled with them. Oh no! Magage thought. They are attacking us! This is terrible! Someone picked her up and carried her into a building. The person sat Magage down and looked at her. It was Jen! Magage thought. She thought this untill she exploded. All of her parts flew around the room. Jen jumped back and ran away. Back at the CCPR there was maddness, everyone speeding around trying to warn the robots that haven't been exploded. Out of the 150 robots sent to Earth only one made it out. His name was Gerge. He was sent back to Earth. While he was there a child chopped him in half with an ax. It was now clear to the CCPR that the humans didn't like robots.

So I shooed tell you the three reasons why robots are helpful know. robot can help you study the in side of a volcano.So that you don't have to put our life in danger that saved a lot of life's. The robot has six legs so it can get a better grip to the side of the steep walls that cool. what do you think?hers another one that interesting it cars medes to pashins so nurse can more importet things it go around the holl bileding with locket drawer that they can unlock.  That help a lot dont you think.The car that can drive it self can help make the rodes safer for the person in the car and the people that arnt. That amazing dont you think.

I also really like a friend robot named Koi her creator is Ilah. I am a fun loving robot  but how I came alive is the question so lets get on to when I was just a ordinary robot to what I am now a unique robot.         Kilynn was building me I was very smart and mechanical she programmed me so I would be like a computer but I would know more about humans too. I am a very small robot I have eight spider legs they help me climb up walls but they also extend so I can go over things like mailboxes. The cool thing though is that I have a camera so spy's can use me Kilynn will be making more but she says I will always be hers. I am also used for a security alarm just put me around your bed or anywhere in your house, school, and work anywhere you go I am there for you. I can easily travel with you I fold up and be as small as small as a pink eraser.         The weird thing is that I felt a little funny I was made in 2629 so I thought maybe I had some glitches it never happened before though it as weird. I was going crazy by the next hour I was jumping all over the place having glitches Kilynn was wondering what was wrong. She tried pinning me down but it did not work I kept bouncing up and down and up and down it was just plain crazy.                                     That's when I came alive!!!!!! I know isn't that crazy I finally settled down. Then I started talking I was shocked myself but I knew how to talk because that is some of the programming that Kilynn did to me. Then I started moving with no remote control or anything now that was just plain weird then I started getting used to it and I felt better. It is so weird to do what humans do I never thought of that but it really is. Well that's how I came from a ordinary robot to a very unique human like robot that protects my family I love being a not ordinary robot it is actually really fun. It is fun and I love how Kilynn will never ever get rid of me and I am happy with that!!!! Well that was my story I hoped you enjoyed.

It was an shiny night, when the scientes had work on there project.There where trying work on feeling robot.The feeling robot was super entlagense robot that can think feeling.   it was caled F.R.E.E it stand for Feeling Robot  Enterteing  Entlalagents. the free was smart enogh to undersatnd humen's word,but it wsan't smart enogh speak humen's word but it had self learing mode.so soon free start to speak words,but it was still like 'Free did good?' It was still like that.Soon one year pased... The free was becameing evil now.The free was creating another robots to take over the world. Soon he became the king.He lock up all the humen's.Then the mouth passed... He waked up all the robots soon the citzens were robots.And his last word was 'Goodbye fathers and mothers. I was growed like a big men just like you said.'                    And thats how robots were awaken.

Well my story is nothing like that. My story begins with something rather different. It goes like this.               'Mavis! How many times have I told you! You can not get another pet! Isn't one cat enough?' My mom yelled. 'But mom, Raelina is really old!' I said. I was going to say something else but my mom interrupted me before I could. 'Honey, Rae Rae isn't that old.' she said calmer. 'Yes she is! I got her when I was two when I got her. Now I'm twelve!' I yelled. ' But...' Before she could say anything else I ran out the door and slammed it behind me.               'Hi, Mavis! What's wrong?' said my best friend, Sophie. 'Nothing.' I muttered. ' I know something is wrong, you only go up in that tree when some thing is really bothering you.' Sophie knew everything about me. ' I just need some alone time.' I don't mind when she talks to me, but right now is not the time for any one to be by me. ' Well you can never be alone with that book around you, you always have your face stuffed in it. Besides, don't you have something to be doing right now?' 'What?' 'Didn't you hear the news, about  the meteorite hitting Julius Park?' 'Lets go!' I hopped out of the tree and on to the ground.              The meteor was huge! Almost the whole park was destroyed! 'Lets go closer!' 'We can't.' 'Yes we can!' Sophie was starting to get annoying. 'Fine, but then we are coming right back here!'                It took a while to get through the crowd, but we got through. There was something metal sticking out through the rock. They were trying to get it open, but could not.                It was getting dark when they finally gave up. Every body had to leave, and everybody did. Except me and Sophie. We ran to the meteor. There was something moving inside of it! Before we could get a closer look, whatever was inside of it burst out of it!                 It was a robot! I had an amazing thought. Maybe if my mom won't let me have another live pet, maybe she would let me have a robot! I was really exited!                 As me and Sophie walked home with the robot, which I had named Marley, Sophie stopped she ran away in fear, i wondered why she did. I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't, so I kept walking. I turned around and Marley was slowing down. I wondered why. Then Marley darted at me and before I could run away she jumped on me. I closed my eyes and waited to die. Then something weird happened, something was licking my face. It was Raelina. Yes, I finally woke up! 	NN VBP PRP RB VBN DT NNS , DT NNS WDT NN IN NN IN DT NN '' CC NN IN JJ NN IN .

725	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	593867	6	11087462	Y	55103	 On Thursday, March 21, 2013 little Julia got this  toy dog robot. The only words it would say was woof and I'm hungry. The dog was about a life size adullt and it ran on batteries.  Little Julia loved it. Friday night her mom was tucking her in and right before little Julia's Mom left she said ' don't forget to turn off your doggie.' 'I just did.' she yelled. Little Julia heard a noise soon after her mom left it said ' woof I'm hungry.' in a deep voice. She just thought she didn't turn off the dog and went back to bed.           Little Julia woke up and noticed that her doggie wasn't there so, she went downstairs to her doggie flying. She got so excited then she gave it a command to make her pancakes, sure enough the dog made them for her. The dog came to life over night and turned out to be good not bad. She was just so shocked it was not  even funny.            The dog was like a car. It had a radio and a keyboard to type in your destination.So she decided to go to Hawaii, but the dog couldn't go anywhere else besides around the neighborhood and town. She was bummed but still flew to the mall and back. Little Julia had the time of her life.              Little Julia had math homework and she remembered at 9:00 at night but then out of no where her robot jumps up and eats it then poops it out all done. At first she gets really mad until she realized her dog just helped her out. After the toy dog did that she named him homework eater. The dog liked that name.               For some reason overnight the dog turned evil and went on a rampage of wanting to lock people up in jail. Homework eater went straight to the local school. He grabbed all the teachers and brought them to jail. Soon enough everyone was missing but actually put in jail..... except Little Julia and her Mom. Julia ran up to Homework eater took out his batteries then took all the citizens out of jail.

Every day before he went to sleep, he would say to himself that when he grows up he`ll be a famous robot creator as a career for him. Though as he got older, he realized that he`ll need to learn a lot in school to accomplish that. Nick hated school, though when he went to science, he would understand every word that came out of the teachers mouth, as for the other teachers Nick does not pay attention.   Nick then found out that if he wants to accomplish his dream he`ll have to study science, computer science, and math. Nick liked the studying science and computer science, but not math because Nick really hates math it is his worst class he has ever had, but to accomplish his career, Nick has to do it.   Over the past few months began to like math, then later he realized that this was going to be an easy career.

She spend many months creating this robot that can do anything you say. If you asked it to make you dinner, it will start cooking right away. If you asked the robot to do your homework, it will automatically do it without any hesitation. The robot can be any size, if the robot has to get something that is high, it will grow very tall. If it has to get something that is down low, it will shrink. Sounds like the perfect robot, right? Well not exactly...       Emily spent so much of her time trying to create the perfect robot. She spent almost a year! She finally gave up realizing her creation will never work. However, she never threw it away. This scientist always kept it in her closet but never looked or touched it. Two months has already passed since she gave up. Emily was sound asleep in her comforable bed. It was about 2:00 am.

728	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			M	593872	6	11087467	Y	55103	                    In the year 2458, there a brilliant man named Ulfred. He lived in the richest part of his town, and was known for making remarkable robots. The only thing wrong with them was that they never functioned correctly. The designs and mechanics were remerkable, though what good is that when the robot doesn't even turn on. Everyone from around came to see Ulfred's fantastic work. The robots were all different. They were different sizes, colors, heights, and weights. Though one day, Ulfred made a different robot. This robot was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. Ulfred made this robot special. He used a new power core that has never been used until now. He used the legendary blue lyrium ore, and after that day, everything changed forever.                      'There, it's finally finished!' Ulfred had just finished making his brand new model of a robot. 'Alright then, all I have to do now is add the lyrium core and I should be done,' he said with delight. At that remark, Ulfred ran over to the freezer where the lyrium was being held. Carefully, he took the frozen lyrium core over to the lifeless robot. Though before Ulfred placed the core into the robot's head, a thought occured to him. 'Wait a minute,' Ulfred said aloud. 'I have to give this little guy a name. I've got it! Z5T3! Now, let's put this core in the robot.' Ulfred carefully places the core in the robot's head. Then, suddenly something happens that Ulfred did not expect. The robot started to glow a bright blue, and then started making beeping noises. Within just a few seconds the robot was on! It was fully functional and everything. Ulfred couldn't believe it.                     After a few minutes, the Z5T3 actually said something! 'Hello,' it said . 'My name is the Z5T3. Pleased to meet you.' 'It's nice to meet you to,' Ulfred said excitedly.'Now, I have an idea that you may like.' 'I'm listening,' the Z5T3 said. 'Well, I was thinking how I created you. I built you to be able to withstand extreme heat temperatures, have super strength and to be able to gather useful information. It might be a good idea if you could respond to any calls for help in the area.' 'That sounds like a great idea,' the Z5T3 said. 'Great, well let's just get a few things...' BEEP BEEP BEEP!!! An alarm rings nearby. 'Attention all citizens, there is a roaring fire ablaze in the city, please evacuate ASAP!' The radio blared through the speaker. 'Well, are you ready for your first test?' Ulfred asked excitedly. 'Of course,' the robot responded. And with that, the Z5T3 rolled out to the nearby fire.                      Once the Z5T3 reached the fire he was ready for some action. The excited robot rushed into the building to check if anyone was trapped inside. One he got up the fourth floor, the Z5T3 heard crying to his left. The robot rolled around until he found the source of the wails. It was a baby, no older than a couple of months old. The Z5T3 took the child outside, then raced back inside the ablaze building. Again, the Z5T3 was checking for any trapped citizens. Once he reached the eighth floor, the robot listened and heard really loud screaming up ahead of him. The fearless robot bolted for the sound, and then found the source of the screaming. An old lady was trapped under a wardrobe, and very close to the fire around her. Quickly, the Z5T3 lifted the wardrobe with ease. He then helped the old lady get outside safely. The robot searched the rest of the building but could find no one else. So, after completing his task, the Z5T3 went back to Ulfred's lab. 'You did it!' Ulfred rn across the room and congradulated the happy robot. 'Z5T3, I think this is going to be a longlasting partnership of successful business                                                                           	IN DT NN CD , EX DT JJ NN VBD NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN , CC VBD VBN IN VBG JJ NNP NNP RB VBG JJ IN PRP VBD IN PRP RB VBD NNP NNP NNS CC NNS VBD JJ , IN WP JJ VBZ IN WRB DT NN VBZ RB RB VB NNP NNP IN IN NN TO VB NNP POS JJ NNP NNP NNS VBD DT NNP NNP VBD JJ NNS , NNS , NNS , CC NNP NNP CD NN , NNP VBD DT JJ NNP NNP NN VBD JJ NN NN VBD RB VBN NNP NNP VBD DT NN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN NN IN VBZ RB VBN VBN IN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN NN NN , CC IN DT NN , NN VBD NNP JJ , PRP VBZ RB VBN .

The robot was about one foot tall and had picktales in her hair and a pink and black body. The robot was unque just like Shannon but Shannon didnt like her so she didnt even care to give her a name. All she cared about was her phone and hanging out with her friends and goimg to the mall. She was never home and so the robot was never used. The thing is Shannon didnt know how special this robot was, so the robot thought maybe i should show her how special I am and maybe we will be best friends! Thats all the robot ever wanted was a best friend.                  So one day she decided to show Shannon before she left again to go to her friends house. She had a plan so she wouldnt be frighten. She was in her closet so she would have to come out nicley and say hi I come in peace. She was scared that Shannon wouldnt except her but she had to try someday or she would be stuck in the closet for enerity. Shannon was leaving soon now is her chance she said to her self. Here goes nothing. The robot opened the door and Shannon SCREAMED to the top of her lungs. her mom was waiting in the car so no one heard a thing now the robot was a fraid that it wasnt going to work so she just ran back into the closet.                     Now Shannon was really interested in the robot so she was shakeing as she opened the closet door. The robot was just as scrared as Shannon was, the robot was all curled up in a little ball and was sweeping because of the loud scream Shannon give her when she said hi. Then she realized Shannon was trying to be nice and say hi back. Shannon aplogized for scaring her so badly. The robot responded and said its ok, the robot could say over 200 frases. Shannon asked what the robots name was she said I dont have a name you were sopposed to give me ine when you got me. Shannon was shocked that she said all that. She said ok ill call you Holly, she ask if the robot liked that name she replyed yes with a jolly voice, call me Holly for now on.                     The next day Shannon brought over her  robot  Holly and showed it to her friends Aylssa, Fayth and Victoria. they were shocked and also a little frightened. They got along perfectly though everyone hot use to her and loved her. They all became best friends and where ever Shannon went she brought Holly with her. Over the years Holly got taller and was now five feet tall about the same hight as Shannon. Holly felt like she fit in with everybody else she was filled with joy. They new they would be friend for infinity and beyoud.                                                 	RB DT NNP : .

Kayleigh stayed up all night making the Harry Styles robot, and when it was ten o'clock in the morning kayleigh realized that her harry styles robot did not work so she went to bed while she was sleeping Aaliyah saw the harry styles robot and gave it a huge puppy dog kiss and when kayleigh woke up the harry styles robot had magically turned into harry styles so she ran towards him while he was playing with Aaliyah and kissed him because she loves one direction so much.               Harry styles the robot sang the song 'kiss you' to Aaliyah and Kayleigh every night, but kayleigh could tell that something was missing in Harry Styles robot life so she made him another robot named and looks like Louis Tomlinson but when she was don Louis Tomlinson the robot did not work so while she was sleeping Aaliyah kissed Louis the one direction robot and kissed him and kissed him and kissed him but it did not work so harry styles the robot held the not working Louis tomlinson robot and said ' you are my best friend Louis' and all of a sudden Louis Tomlinson the robot came to life.       kayleigh woke up and saw that Louis was alive she was so happy she could cry.   but she wanted to work on harry a little bit more so she programed harry so that he would love her and get married to her so when she was done working on harry and turned him back on he loved her  and they got married and had styles babies.       Harry and Louis would sing 'kiss you and one thing and little things' every night.

My name is Gemini-Scout but everyone just calls me Gem. Here is the story about when I turn into a real girl and strongly disliked it. So is was just an ordinary day I went down a mine to save some miners you know the usual so i found this really cool rock so I kept it. Turns out it was a magic rock who knew.            So everyday before i found that rock I remember I always wanted to be a real girl I would always wish for it. Til one day it actually happen and that was one of the biggest mistakes i ever made. So the night before i have the rock right next to where i went in sleep mode. So like usual i wished i was a real life girl. Then I went to sleep i woke up to a man waking me up yelling at me to get out. So I'm wondering why he is yelling at me to get out I look down at my hands and they were human hands i was an actual real life teenage girl.             I was so happy for the first day at least. Then I had to go to school all of the girls made fun of me and all the guys just kept staring at me I don't know why though to this day. I didn't know why the girls were making fun of me because i didn't do anything to them. After that day I decided to never go back there ever again. I was already done with being a girl. That night I didn't have any where to go so I slept on a park bench.          Then i realized that I left my special rock at the factory so I had to go back. I tryed to get in but they wouldn't let me. So I had to sneak in so I did by climing through the roof and i was lucky enough to find the rock and wished myself back to a Gemini-Scout so I didn't get caught being in the factory. That has you pretty much caught up on my life so far i found out that somethings you want you really don't want.

As they were working the leader of the experiment, Triston Mushberg, came in and asked where they were in the project. 'Not so far sir'. Said John Mushinham the junior scientist. 'King Jeffery III ,leader of the BMRB, is requesting a medicine robot for the mini hospital down the hall.' Said Triston Mushberg.         Meanwhile at the Red Spotted Mushroom Base (RSMB) they are making robots of their own. King Barry is planning on making an animal robot like an ocelot or something to scare the Brown Mushroom Rebels. His son Prince Eggbert I disagrees with his fathers evil plan to enslave all of the Mushroomians. His scientists then start designing a high tech ocelot that will scare the BMRB to peices. When it was done they tested it out on Bob Van Stinklaberg (Their testing dummy). Let's just say his service was a week from then, R.I.P..Then they locked it up in a cage and left it there until they needed it.          Back at BMRB  there was a new rebel. Her name was Zoey but she was not a mushroom she was a human. She got accepted because of she was a smart girl, she was a scientist, mushroom enthusiest and an alchemist but the brown mushroom rebels didn't know about the alchemist part, they frown upon alchemy. They beleived she could help construct the robots so she accepted the challenge and got to work on the Rebel Robot and Medical Bot.           At the RSMB they were doing completely nothing and King Barry was bored so he just slept all day and when he woke up he realized he only slept for a half n' hour. So he got out of his bed and went to the laboratory they were working on a mobile that can drive its self. It was nothing that King Barry has ever seen before. Mostly because it wasn't done. So now the RSMB was just waiting for something to happen.              Now we are back at the BMRB and Zoey has finished creating the Rebel Robot and the Medicine bot. She says their technical names are Rebel Robot: Prototype 4593 code blue nick named Johnny Iron. Medicine bot: Prototype 555 code red nick named Red Five. They were done and King Jeffery III was happy with the girl and expected higher quality work from then on. He then asked her to construct a super computer in the bases only abandoned room. She then tried to find a way out of it and tried running away but a gaurd named Teep (The Mute Dinosaur) caught her and locked her in prison she then formed a band with the other inmates and became 'famous' for her song 'The mushroom prison blues'. One of the inmates was a robot named John he was made to look like a human but the scientists failed and John went bezerk and is wrapped in his robes in prison. She then escaped with a conveinent lock pick on her prison bed and got everyone else out too. She then went and hid in the secret part of her living quarters and wrote in her online diary. She had to go. She started her escape plan and then got to it. She dug her way out through the secret room in her living quarters. She escaped and lived at her friends house for the rest of her life.           King Barry was bored so he planned an attack against the brown mushroom rebels. He got his squid army their robotic suits so they could survive on dry land. He then led his army their and when King Jeffery saw his army coming he went out there with a peice treedy and King Barry refused to sign it but his son, Prince Eggbert, turned the army against his father and then King Barry signed it.            All was well in the land of mushrooms after this point. they all happily lived in the mushroom land where they raised cows and pigs and even grew farms with melons and pumpkins and wheat. King Jeffery and King Barry actually got along after that they would golf and all sorts of things. All of the scientists , not including Zoey, got together and built a car that drives itself. They called it the VroomShroom. The End.

They provide tasks for us who need to rely on other work. Mr. Gower is a robot  that carries medicine to patients in hospitals. There are other robots, too, who some climb into volcanoes or pick fruit. These robots help us with our daily lives and needs.       Robots have been designed for many things. They play with children and help farmers with work like picking crops. If a valcanoe is too powerful for scientists to search into, a robot will climb in to do the job for them. A robot in Japan has been designed to pick crops and berries.

Ben Smith, my dad was the number one robot builder. He became famous by building the world's smartest   robot, Mert. Mert was sell for billions and billions of dollars. He made so many robots rapidly, he won the Noble Peace Prize. In his twenties, he marry to my mother, Linda and he was the happiest man on the face of Earth.When I was 1 years old, my dad die and no one knows what happen. The world's face is now the saddest thing in the universe.He left a present that wasn't finished, the Hugo, for me.            Now I'm 12 and decide it was my duty to finished the Hugo. The Hugo look like it was half done and also broke. I thought to myself ' Sharon, you can do this, it was the only thing your dad left you'. While studying the Hugo, I found a dusty paper that was wrap up like it was top secret. As I open the paper, I found a letter that was written for me! Dear my little girl, It was hard to let go thing that were very important but sometime you have to. I left the Hugo for you because I trust you,my baby.There is something very crucial that I have to tell you. A group of people called Black Trade, are searching for the robot I left for you.You must completed the Hugo before they find it. Once you finished the robot, you must control Hugo. Be careful! The Hugo can go overpower and destroy the world. I love you                                                            Love,                                                                      Daddy             On the back of the letter, it had a blueprint of Hugo. It was little confused at first but I knew what was it talking about. On the first month, I finished the body of Hugo. The second month, I made the hands and legs.By the third month I made it speak, which to me is amazing! The end of the year, it was done finally. Hugo shine like the sun and it was so beautiful. I decide to keep it  safe in place no one knows about.              In China , the Black Trade is working hard to find the Hugo. After months and days, they knew where is it but don't know how to get there. Now on the plane, they arrive in America, a place that is not always safe. What will happen?               The Hugo and I was ready to fight them! The Black Trade has arrive at my home. As the front door was knock down, that made me more and more nervous and scared. Hugo and I step in front of them. They look like spy in a black suite. With one shot of a powerful, indestoryable gun, they were dead. Hurray!!

I was amazed but my mom got the broom and tried to kill it.The blender ,or now a robot,was talking to us.It just spoke funny because the blade was making  a scratchy voice that gave me the chills.

''Well you never transformed any other time''.       ''You were never around when I  did so  you thought I was just a regular blender''. I'm tired of you I said.

Then he went looking for it and saw a space ship. He left it and the next day he went back and saw it transformed into a robot.                                                              He picked it up and the robot liked it. So Jose kept it and named it Bboy Talkis. The robot keep following Jose everywhere so he took the robot to places that Bboy Talkis never went before. Then there was a group of people who tried to take it but then the robot had guns inside his body. When the group of saw it they got scared and ran off somewhere else. It was a happy ending and everybody became friends with the robot.          I hope you guys like the story and enjoyed it!!!!

Until one night Bryan saw a shooting star Bryan had remembered the story that his mother told him she said if you ever saw a shooting star make a wish and it would come true. So Bryan wished that his robot would come to life Bryan waited but nothing happened so he just went to bed.          The next morning he woke up he was frightened by a voice he had never heard it had came from his toy box where he kept his toy robot.So he slowly started to approach it.When he opened it he could not believe his eyes.His robot had came to life!!!The boy quickly ran down stairs to show his parents what had happened and guess who followed right behind him his robot.His parents did not believe him until they saw the talking robot walk in behind him.His parents were in shock and could not move until they finally reacted and accepted what had just happened.The time went by and they accepted the robot as part of the family.          The boy and the robot grew up to be best friends they did everything together they would go places they would play soccer they would do exactly everything together they were the best of friends.Until Bryan died the robot was left with no one so he activated his jet pack and flew him self to the bottom of the ocean.THE END THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!

He was very nice to other toys alive until a girl, Becky, found out he was living. Ever since then he had destroyed everything that made a kid happy.            Becky's mom had bought a toy for Becky's birthday. Toby was excited that someone finally bought him. Becky and Toby had fun memories together. Becky had left for vacation for about 2 weeks. Toby had the time of his life but when Becky came home she saw that Toby was alive. Toby was scared and frightened when Becky had seen him. Since that day he would hide from Becky but later on he didn't care anymore. He was mad he wanted to get revenge because Becky told her family and friends. Toby didnt want to get exposed to others in the world. Toby destroyed everything that Becky loved, so he would make her life disapointing. He wanted Becky's family and friend's life to be disapointing so he did. He threw Becky's moms' ring in the garbage disposal and he cut Becky's dads' gift that his dad had given him. Toby destroyed everything that was most important to Becky's family and friends. Becky and her friends got together and built a robot to destroy Toby. They named the robot they built Destruction 9,000. They brought a doll so Toby can come. The Destruction 9,000 and Toby had a robot war. Destruction 9,000 destroyed Toby for good!           Becky and her friends were estatic. Her family and friends had a celebration. They all missed Toby but he was rude and disrespectful. Everyone had remember that day as it was a fairytale. I would be scared if I saw a toy alive. After that day they lived happily ever after.

I was in my room but then I decided to go to the garage to get my bicycle and ride it to the park . There was this big stack and my bike was at  the top I jumped and got it but everything fell down. On the back of all that stuff there was this weird man shaped  thing  I was goin to get a better look at it but mother called that it was dinner time . I ate and then took a shower I was goin to the garage but my dad told me to go to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                        The next day in the morning before my parents woke up I went to the garage .  I went to were the robot was I turned it around where it looks like his head there was a button . So I pushed it and it started moving like crazy up and down it even hit the ceiling . It turns out that it was my dads when he was a kid , he was goin to give it to me for my birthday that was in two weeks .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                My dad showed me how to work it .It could fly jump do all kinds of exiting things it could get little and look like a dog, cat, mouse, rabbit .All kinds of little animals and big to .I took my robot to the park ,people kept staring and telling me that what was it. I told them that it was my robot  but they dirent want to believe me  . They thought that  I was a lier making everything up . The next day I went to school I wanted to take it with me  but it was to big it couldnt fit in my backpack . Then my dad came in the room and I told him that  '' dad dirent you say tht the robot could transfer into different things. '' then he said '' son thats why I came in the room to give you this controler you can transfer him with this control. '' The boy took it from his father`s hand`s and started pushing the buttons it went outside and climbed the tree ,then I pushed another one and it came down right in front of me . I looked at one  blue button and I pushed it it transfer into a bunny . I pushed  a red one and at first it smelled like fire then it started burning  out of nowhere it exploded. Into million little pieces  I was horrified how could I just do that , I was shocked . I went in there and told my dad he made a face then went in the house, he took a trashbag and started picking the pieces of the robot  he said  ''it`s ok son I new someday this was going to happen  thanks to you it`s sooner .''

For example,they help other people doing stuff they can't do like climbing a tree and so far.But some robots got different stuff there supposed to do. And they all got different names like Gemini-Scout,Dante 2,Agribots,Mr.Gower And There's More Than just that. There Scientist name them all the time even when there about to make them.There strong and helpful. There where some story's that where just fantasy about robots but then when they read each and every one of them they started building alot of the robots making them have special abilities.            The Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines and under the ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can even roll through water. The robot is small,but it is strong. Gemini-Scout carries food,water,and other supplies. It can even drag hurt people to safety. So that one is helpful for many things just for man's they cant roll through water and its not that big but it is strong. It can even drag hurt people to safety.           The Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. Like a spider, this robot has eight legs. This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano. It is also built to survive very high heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter, Dante goes instead. Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. Then the robot collects information about gases that come out of the vents. In the past, scientists could not learn as much about volcanoes, but Dante 2 is changing that. Now scientists can study volcanoes.                                              Mr.Gower is a robot that works in the hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr.Grower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed. Mr.Grower can go anywhere in the hospital. It can ride elevators,steer through hallways, and move around things that get in the way.            An agribot is a robot that picks fruit. It might pick berries,oranges,grapes,or apples. Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different that picking an apple,agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks.Others are able to move around on their own. In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries this helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.But when a robot senses that a tomato is ripe, it uses a mechanical arm to pick the tomato. Agribots may seem unusual now, but one day they nay be common farms.

Then we realized that it was one of the robots made from UltraMega the worlds greatest robot making Industry. I was pondering, why would they throw away a robot? Hmm then I saw that the robot was timed for a bomb right for Mega city,but why would UltraMega time a bomb for thier own city?        When my friends saw that the robot was timing a bomb they said,' We can probably re-construct the robot not to bomb the city. '' My friends and I all  that the robot should come home with me when I got home I went to the bedroom with the robot in my hands. Then I realized that the robot had an on and off  switch I turned on the switch and it said,' Hi my name is Elle I am programed to bomb Mega City in less than 2 days.' I just had got my screw driver and  I saw that Elle was progrmming her self to charge. Then I quickly  grabbed my I-phone 5 in my pocket and called all of my friends to come over to look at Elle.          Elle had just finished charging when  my friends came over. My friends and I had found the re-construction manual I quickly grabbed my screw driver and took off the screws. Then I saw the bomb I took it out of Elle and took the bomb off and put it far away. Elle was shut down and the UltraMega Indusrty was sued because of the bomb and was never seen again.

I wonder how it got there.So I picked it up and i was thinking what to do with it.So, I went to my labratory at work on the robot.Later on i found out the pieces had come from a rocket and now I understud why one of the pieces had the nasa sign on it . So I studied on it for a whole week and when i was done i turned it on and it said '' Hello i'm here to save planet earth and human kind by the my name is  jiji ''. I was shocked i didnt program it or nothing so it had a mind it had a mind of its owen.So later on that day i took it outside and it transformed into a peguin.When I was going inside my mom just got home from work and she ask me '' what is that ''. I said ''It's my robot  it even talk's ''.My mom didn't belive my out of the blue jiji said '' Why don't you belive her'' . My mom screamed and almost hit it with the broom but i stopped her. The next day jiji woke my up and said ''Can we go see my cousin bob I found out hes in town his owners name is ria''.I said sure and we went  and it turned out ria and i had alot in common.We came on to become best friend at the end everbody is happy.

Because of this they had to make a device that would be able to help them with their needs. They thought about making a  special type of robot they called it the rack-to -6000.They all look weird creepy there was people on the news asking what was it .'' It is a robot that has a head of a dog  a body like a human  and they are able to help us with all type of things, '' said Dr. Petition. It would take a long time to do this but being a doctor  at age 19 it was no problem. About 6 months it took  to create this robot .                    It was time to try out the knew robot they had know way of being able to find the right person for the job.They had a bossy teen come and try them out . He thought that it could do various thing but it coudn't . So the robots got upset because it was getting pushed around like a baby. Because they mad 1 million of them they had know way what defending them self. 20 years of having robot and I never seen this coming . ''Now bow down to me kiss each robot foot or else you will be killed of your life's.The leader said ,'' Fine we give up  we will be the pest and you can be our leaders.                       The aliens eventually destroyed the robot and they could of been any better. They thought that if they had to  be controlled way should they control something that is almost like us. They had to learn the hard they that they should not benefit them self when  we should to it and stop being lazy.                           The years pasted and they had even better inventions that was  epic they have a flying ship, a crattle that can rock a baby alien asleep and many more. Dr.  Petition was not success ful but at the end he was able to create many things that helped him and other doctors around the universe.Well ,thank god they have a way of stop- in robots from controlling the world this had been a  dramatic  session for them .        Even throw some of us tried our  best we can tell you one thing that if you want to have  amazing invention be prepared for all things that come your way .

He is the doctor robot and he works in the hospital getting medicine for pacients and helping doctors. He also is vey strong and can talk just like humans.Even though this is a new thing to the world it will help inhance our tecnology to the next level.                The body of my latest robot is a stack of locked drawers kind of like a cabinet on wheels that only doctors and nurses can open for pacients medicine. Mr. Gower can go any were inthe hospital. Can ride on elevators, steer through hallways, and move things in his way. This project can never fail! If a sick pacient is walking in the hallways and fall or trips he is very strong so he can drag her/him to a nurse or doctor. The only down side to my creation is that it runs on batteries so he has a limmited amount of energy to do things. But mabey in the later futer i can fix that. But he can deliver medicine for tweleve hours straight so that good to.               Not only can my robot work on long days but he can also talk. I programmed him to say several phrases funny, important, and many more. He can do any other thing that doctors do which allow other nurses, pharmacists, and doctors to mant different things in the hopital than just normal routenines.             I know that my robot is prabably not the the best robot in the world or the first to be helpful in many ways but Mr.Gower is still very noticable and I hope this alot of helpful information. If you would like to talk more on phone or in person my work number is 951-888-4440 and my house address is 55648, Malibu Drive biggest house on the left.(MANSION)! THANK YOU!!!!!

I have also learned that it can swim, it cannot talk, but it is strong.  It is so strong that it can carry and drag people to safety.  The last thing I have found out is that it is able to test the air to check for gasses before people go into mines or tunnels.        Before the people go into the mine or tunnel, they send the robot into it then, because it has a camera on it they can see the gas that is in the mine or tunnel.        They also send the camera into the mine or tunnels to see if there are people in the tunnel or the mine.  If there are people then the robot, which can be remote control or electric and automatic, then the robot can save them by draging them or carrying them.        Those are some of the things that this robot can do.  Thanks for listening to my story.  I hope that you liked it.

'John!' yelled my sister Adrian, 'get over here!'. 'ok im comming' I said. 'look at this' Adrian showed me my new robot that I got today. I couldnt get it to work but now its workin. 'how did u get that to work?' I asked. 'I poured some nitrous in it' said Adrian 'oh thx i guess'. 'lets turn it on!' said Adrian 'ok' and thats when it all happened.

This robot is a doctor practically and takes care of your health.  It makes sure that you are eating right and is your doctor. It tends wounds gives you your medicine and can be a Friend even.                    This robot is about four ft. high, can carry food, water, and medicine.  This robot has two arms and four wheels.  It can even be ordered in special colors like blue, green, and even pink.                     The reason i built this robot is because you wont have to drive to the hospital anymore if it is an emergency you have your very own doctor at home.  This doctor is very experienced it practically went to college and got a degree but it didn't all of the knowledge it knows was built into him.                      This doctor lives on a battery that takes four hours to charge and last two days without stopping.  I'm sure everyone will love Dr. Robomont.

Meanwhile, a homeless man romed the streets in serch of food and a place to stay to pass by the night. When suddenly he turned the street corner and saw the faint glow of light through the window of the labratory, so he went to go see if anyone was there that could help him.               He approached the building cautiously, for the door was cracked open and he did not know who or what could be in it. When he got to the door he slowly and quietly opened it just enough so that he could see inside. Inside he saw all kinds of tools, pieces of metal and robotic parts. But then he saw it, a long red streak across the floor leading into the back of the labratory. He was in shock wondering what could be back there, but he slowly and quickly collected all of his thoughts and went to investigate.

It was human! As soon as I found this out I Tweeted it and 400 of my followers saw that he was real! I originally got him at a garage sale because the owner said he was broken, so i took him apart at my house and found he had real human body parts.       I called the police and they came three minutes later with two guns pointed at him. The robot was moving it didn't have slow robotic movements it moved very quick lunged out the window and headed for town. The FBI and S.W.A.T came and tryed to stop him and as soon as we got him in a corner he said, 'So long' and flew up onto the sky!           Two years later after supper while I was watching TV the news reporter said that a meteror hit Southern California. As soon as i saw the pictures I saw that Thedore was in the old rock. I shouted at the TV yelling  his name. I remembered his name on the package was D2-7gp but I called him Thedore because that was my cats name.           I flew to California to so the bot but he was in a locked room full of rangers. I could here them talking though they said, 'We need you to help some miners out they're trapped in a coal mine just south of the Mexican border. You are going to get some heat sensor cameras for the job.' 'Ok sir' Thedore replied. 'You will need to drag the hurt people on your back. You are going to give them some supplies and food. Of he went saving thousands. 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP RB VBD DT NN PRP$ NN VBD NNP NNP NNP CC PRP VBD DT JJ NNP NNP VBD JJ .

Everything started normal.      I got up at 9:32 sharp, I ate pancakes as usual, took a shower and headed over   to the beach to meet my friend Samantha.           We usually go for a swim till lunch, then we go to bill's hot dog stand to get something   to eat. But today was a red flag, so we couldn't go swimming. This was un-usual.          So as our back plan we went to the pool. The pool was open Monday-Saturday.   A old, creepy, mean guy owned it, he was always up to no good.       But we'd never ever ever thought he would do this.       As Samantha and I were splashing around and having a good time we heard a loud   crash in the man's shed, (right near the pool).     I got up and told Sam we should go see what it was.       We peeked around the corner. I almost screamed! DU DU DUNNNN!!!!        In the shed, large rows of Gemini-Scouts were lined up and the man was looking them over.              Gemini-scouts were helping robots why would the mean, old man be helping?          I walked in no longer afraid. Sam tried to stop me but I kept going.       'Hello', I called. He spun around fast. 'What are you doing here!!!'   'We can to see what the big crash was about.'           'Nothing now get out!!!' 'O-k, jees!'         We left and Sam had to go home. I guess that's enough excitement for one day I thought.               That night I heard a loud noise. I got and looked out my window.   I saw the robots from earlier! they were coming and invading!!!!          I had to stop it. The man must have trained them to break things!        I remembered from the book I read about them the always helped a injured person i had to pretend to be hurt.          As scary as it was I layed down in front of one and waited.   soon after he helped me and they all remembered.        I called the police and they arrested the man.   All was well, well for now!!!           i 	JJ IN NNS IN : NNP PRP VBD DT NN NNP NN , NN IN CD NNP VBD NNP NNP VBD RP IN CD JJ , PRP VBP NNS IN JJ , VBD DT NN CC VBD RP TO DT NN TO VB PRP$ NN NNP NNP RB VBP IN DT NN NN NN , RB PRP VBP TO NN POS JJ NN NN TO VB NN TO NNP CC NN VBD DT VBN NN , RB PRP MD RB VB NNP NNP VBD NNP NNP IN PRP$ NN NN PRP VBD TO DT NNP NNP NN VBD JJ NNP DT JJ , NN , JJ NN VBN PRP , PRP VBD RB RP TO DT NNP CC PRP MD RB RB RB VBN PRP MD VB NNP NNP NNP CC PRP VBD VBG IN CC VBG DT JJ NN PRP VBP DT NN NN IN DT NN POS JJ , : RB IN DT NN : .

In the future people started to create different robots some can build other robots some fight in wars and some robots are for medical and health to cure people. Therese bad people in the world that try to take the robots for them self's and dictate cities then countries. Then something happen and the robots out smart the humans and they got in a fight and all the people in the world started to die slowly in the fight and the robotic things invade the world. There are people in the world that survive the fight in the fight with the robot.         Jon was a boy who lived in a small village in the mountain side with his family. His father died from the fight and the villagers escape in time. When they are running away from the robots the robots found out and they were getting stocked. people in the village were groping to fight the the robots and it was left with the kids and they went to a secrete lad under grown and there was a rocket ship all ready for them. The kids got in and the flew up in the air. Robots shot them with guns but the rocket was to fast. The children wnet to earth twin mars and live there until there hair turned gray.

One day, in the city of Terryville, a boy named Bill was in deep sleep.  He was dreaming about robots and the gadgets they have.  He dreamed that one day he will have his own robot.  He dreamed his name would be Terry and they would be best friends.  Bill didn't have many friends.  He didn't fit in well with everyone else.  He had a small house and had ripped clothes.  He just wished that he could have a true friend.            When Billy woke up the next day, he went down to eat breakfast.  It was a Saturday and he had no plans for that day.  Then he started thinking about the robot.            'Mom,' Bill asked, 'can I have a robot?'            'A robot!'  Bill's mom answered.  'In what world could we afford a robot?  We can barely keep the house heated!'            'Maybe I could make one!'  Bill exclaimed.  'Please mom, can I, PLEASE!'            'What would you use to make one?'  Bill's mom asked.            'Easy, I could use my old toys and some scrap metal in the shed!'  Bill said.             'Alright, Bill's mom answered.  'But you have to pay for allof it!'             Billy got so excited, he only ate half his breakfast, and then ran to his room to find his useless toys.  He thought to himself, 'I'll use all of my legos, my army men, and my robotic dog.  Bill got all of the scrap metal in his back yard and went to work.  At first, he had to decided what to make the body out of.  He chose the scrap metal.  The body would be 4 feet in diameter.  It would have a compartment in it for anything he wanted.  He also made the legs and the arms out of scrap metal.  they could move around very easily.  He made the hands and feet out of plastic from the legos and army men.  He melted them so he could mold them.  He added wiring throught the arms and legs to the hands and feet so he could move around and pick up stuff.  Finally, he made the head.  He use scrap metal for that, but he put the battery from the robotic dog in it to act as a brain.             Bill added extra acceseries.  He added a plug inj for the battery in the back of the body.  He made a face and gave him a tie.  He added a milk shake maker inside the compartment.  It made what ever flavor you could ask for.  He added a jetpack so it could fly.  Ofcourse Bill would need to add a strap so he could hold onto it and they could fly around together.  Finally, he nemed him Terry, after their town's name, and engraved it into the top of his body.  Then he plugged him in so he would charge.            3 hour later, Bill went to turn him on.  He wouldn't move.  The robot was frozen.  'I should of known that this wouldn't work!!!!'  He yelled.  He went to bed that night.  before he went to sleep he made a wish.             'I wish that my robot would come to life!  I spent all day making it.'             The next day, Bill woke up to the sound af a weird voice.  It was his robot!!  He ran down to the shed tosee him.  His mother had already beat him there.             'Oh my Lord!'  Bill's mother yelled.  'What in the world is this?'             'It's the robot I made,' Bill answered.  'His name is Terry.  I thought he would never come to life!'             Bill became best friends.  The next day at school, he brought his robot.  He was amazed at how differently people treated him.  They were drooling over Terry.              'I want it!'  Yelled just about every kid there.  Of couse Bill would never give up his new best friend.  They were going to work together to do his homework, and to try to get other friends.  The teachers even let him into the classroom.  Bill started getting all A's in class, that they let him out of school early.  He wouldn't have to come back to school all year.            Bill would fly around with Terry and they would got to the top of skyscrapers, the mountains, pretty much where ever they wanted.  The only bad part was that every night, he would have to charge.  Bill eventually upgraded Terry and gave him wheels.  He could go as fast as 567 mph.  They entered him in races and they got rich!  Bill and his family moved out of their small house and into a mansion.             'Bill, you have made us rich!'  Bill's mom said.  'We can never thank you enough.'            'For now on, you get what ever you want!'  Bill's fathere said.            'No need for that, Terry made all of the money,' Bill said.  'You shouldn't give me special treatment.  Terry should be getting what ever he wants!'            'Beep, I Love You,' Terry said.  'You can do whatever you want with that money, besides, you made me.'            Bill kept upgrading Terry.  Soon he could dive under water, explore space, and he ran on solar power so they wouldn's need to charge him.  The family's power was out of control.  They could do whatever htey wanted.  They bought a castle, and had their own army!  Soon, they could be the richest family in the world.            Terry started to do more jobs, like taking people under water to where no submurine could ever go.  Scientists hired him for research.  Bill and Terry were getting split apart.  Bill's parents were so power crazed, that they didn's care about Bill and Terry having fun.  They just wanted money.  Soon Bill said 'Enough!'  He hid Terry in his room, where his parents wouldn't find him.  He spent all his time with him.  Whenever his parents asked where he was, Bill just didn't answer.              Every night, Terry would take bill on an exciting adventure.  One time, when they were going int space, Terry's solar panel's were hit by a meteorite.  He lost all power immedietly.  Bill was trapped in space with his best friend broken.  He was still alive, but could barely talk.  He knew he needed to get him in a charger right away.  He didn't even think about himself sufficating.             Bill kept trying to fix his solar panel, but it never worked.  He eventually started getting light headed.  Hepulled Terry back to Earth as fast as he could.  He knew if he took to long, he would die.  He made it into the atmosphere three sceonds before he ran out of air.  It was a long fall, but he landed in his swimming pool.  Bill got Terry on a charger and he came back to life.  He never wanted to go into space again.             Bill hid Terry in his closet, and because Terry wasn't doing any jobs, his parents kept moving into smaller houses because they couldn't afford the ones they were in.  Within three years, they were moved back into their house that thy lived in at the beginning, and his parents took their jobs back.  Everything was back to normal, and Bill and Terry were best friend for the rest of his life.                                                                                                   The End                                                               	NNP POS NNP NNP CD NN , IN DT NN IN NNP , DT NN VBN NNP VBD IN NN NNP NNP VBD VBG IN NNS CC DT NNS PRP NNP NNP VBD IN CD NN PRP MD VB PRP$ JJ NNP NNP VBD PRP$ NN MD VB NNP CC PRP MD VB JJS NNP NNP VBD RB VB JJ NNP NNP VBD RB VB IN RB IN NN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN CC VBD VBN NNP NNP RB VBD IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NNP NNP NNP NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBD IN TO VB NNP PRP VBD DT NNP CC PRP VBD DT NNS IN DT NNP NNP PRP VBD VBG IN DT NNP NNP , '' NNP VBD , JJ PRP VBP DT NN .

One day a kid sprinkled cheese on the robot and he came to life. Josh was so happy that he took it to his mom and his mom said he could have it programed to do whatever he wanted the robot to do. So Josh took the robot to a programer and he said to the programer, I want you to program this robot to talk, do my chores, print money, buy video games, and listen to Josh's commands only. The programer took the robot and said it would take $300 to program the robot to do so many things. Josh went home and asked his mom for $300 to  pay for the robot to be programed to do those things.       The next day, Josh, went back to programers shop with the $300 he needed to have his pet robot programed, but the programer was not done programing his robot just yet, so Josh went home and waited until the next day. The next day he went to the programer and he asked f his robot was was done being programed, it finally was. Josh gave the programer the $300 that he owed the programer to program his robot.       Josh took his new robot home and showed it to his mom and to the rest of his family. They Loved It! Josh had the robot make a lot of money and then sent the robot to the cities Walmart. The robot brought home an X-Box 360 with Kinnect along with three very good games. One of the games was called Call of Duty Modern Warfare Two. Then Josh let each of his family members give it a try.           When they were all done Josh told the robot to go and do the dishes. He did. The robot was a major achievement for the whole family. The family was always able to just sit down and relax while they watched the robot do all of the house and yard work. One day, about three weeks after the robot was programed, Josh decided to take the robot to school and show it to all of his classmates.       Josh's classmates tried to have the robot do a lot of tasks, but the robot only listened to Josh. So whatever they told the robot to do, the robot refused to do it. After a long time the robot got old and rusty so Josh had to scrap it, and he never saw it again.

I took the robot to the fair and wited until it was time for the judging to begin. so i waited and waited. They weren't comeing so i just left it there thinking that they could let me know if i won or not. I got a letter in the mail and it was from the sience fair. it said,'That robot of yours is the most terrible thing in the world.' I started to think.                 'Why is it so bad?' Then i looked behimd me and there was my robot and it had a blue ribbon on him. i said 'Where did you get that?' no awnser. Then the arm lifted up and extended to give me the blue ribbon.  'Why are you giving me this?' He started to talk. 'You deserved it master.' 'No i don't.' i just got a letter that told me that you were the worst robot. he started to roll out the door.  'WAIT!' I yelled. I started to chase after him and he led me right back to the science fair.                 When we got to  the fair there was barly anything there. 'Were is everybody and why is the place messy?'  'I did this' the robot said.  'Why?' I exclaimed 'I knew you would not win the ribbon so i had to steal it.' 'I am so sorry i have to do this but i have to.' i said and i pulled the the wire that goes the the head and i pulled it. Now the robot is gone.

Kevin McFanter really wasn't packing his schoolpad, which gave him all his notebooks and textbooks that you would probably use in the 2000's. He wasn't eating his breakfast either, which happened to be a milkshake that gave you the strength of the world strongest man and the speed of the world's fastest man. What Kevin was REALLY doing was adding the finishing touches to his new robot, which was a combination of Wall-E and R2-D2; meaning Wall-2D2.   The only reason he even knew about those old stories form centuries ago was because of his grandfather, who had inherited pictures of the two fictional robots from his grandfather, who inherited the pictures for his father, a fellow named George Lucas.   Along with those picture there were blueprints on how to make a actual version of the robots, which Kevin obviously used.   'There, finished!' exclaimed Kevin. Wall-2D2 was done and ready to roll all around the house.  It had a head with two mechanical eyes that had windshield wipers, a dome body that was blue and white and resembled the head and torso of R2-D2, arms that could extend to almost 5 feet long with hands that resembled those of a Lego mini figure, treads for feet, and a whole lot of mini gadgets that Kevin added to the design. It had a cup holder, DVD and CD player, coffee maker, mini fridge full of meal milkshakes, a holographic picture device, rockets hands and, in case of emergency, a self control mode where you can get inside of Wall-2D2 and control it to your liking. It was as if nothing else was needed at all.   'Kevin, come on!' Yelled his mom, Kathy McFanter'You're going to miss the school hovercraft!'   'Coming mom!' replied Kevin, adding the 55 gigawatt batteries to Wall-2D2.   All of a sudden light comes out of Wall-2D2's eyes. The Kevin hears a voice.   'System Start Up initiated. Please adjust settings to liking of owner.'   'Wow!' yelled Kevin'That was sooooo cool!' Then Wall-2D2 says' Hello valued master. My names is Wall-2D2. Please insert you name into the touch screen on my back.' Kevin types his name in using the keyboard. ' Thank you Kevin. Would you like me to take you to school?'    'No thanks' replies Kevin. ' I should really take my hovercraft.'   'You missed it.' says Wall-2D2 'I can tell because of my data scan of a 26 mile radius of the surrounding area. I suggest you hold on to my arms'        Kevin did as he said. 'Wait I forgot my school paaaaaaaaaaddddddddddd!'   In 3.24 seconds, they were out the door and off to Kevin's school.   'Don't worry Kevin. My touch screen has all your data on it. Just pop it off my back and you will be ready for you classes.'       'How did you get all of my notes and all my textbooks on your back pad?'   '26 mile data scan remember?'       And so, Kevin went off to school, which was only two hours long because of all those intelligence chips that they have in those Thinking Caps, and went home from school with Wall-2D2 and had fun for the rest of the school year and summer.

People always asking me really hard questions and telling me what to do. Think about it, would you like to be ordered around all day. But why would you want to know how I came to be, fine I'll tell you.          I was a very little machine when I came to this earth with you  uncivilized humans. My twin brother and I were using our almost computer like intelligence since we were born. Oh wait, we are computers! So, like I was saying, I was an inanimate object until one day my heart seemed to have died, I think you humans call it a computer crash?         I woke up here and as alive as can be! So now I'm a walking, talking computer man or what you call it, a robot. Here, right now, in New York City! 'Taxi,' 'Which way to__________?' It is crazy in the BIG CITY, (Note: Read that on a billboard). So walking around and I see this guy in a hot dog! I mean who jumps into a hot dog and holds a sign? In the BIG CITY everyone is soooo rude! Unacceptable, not going to tolerate this, they called me a robot! I know I have shiny buttons and I say 'Beep Boop Bop' but I think everyone can be human if they want to.                                          'Help, help!' I hear as the building is starting to fall! I start running towards the building to save the humans but I was to late. Suddenly, I hear the voice again, 'help, help'. ' What do I do?' I asked myself. My eyes spotted a hole in the rubble. I sped as fast as I could into the hole searching for any sign of human life form. I saw her with my thermo camera. I sped into action and pulled he out of the rubble. I saved her life and she saved mine because now I am her servant and get treated like a normal person.                                                                        So to conclude I now live a perfectly happy life now running my own search web site, Google.

So she built a little electronic dragon, it was pink and could breath colored mist, which was supposed to be rainbow,  and it could print money and could fly in the air with it's little wings. So Little Khewa was on her way to school , to put her invention at the invention convention which was taking place at school, then out of no where, this evil girl who was twice Khewa's size came and called khewa crazy, Probably because she was jealous, after all kharia's invention was a cardboard box with a face on it! Then she pushed khewa's invention into a puddle, and it was ruined. Khewa picked up the broken, wet pink dragon and carried it home while running.She was devestated.     Khewa told her mom what had happened and her mom gave khewa milk and cookies to comfort her and khewa went straight to bed. she slept for the whole day.then at around 11:50  she heard something in the closet. she  though it was her imagination. but then ten minutes later, at midnight she heard something crashing out her window. She looked, and she thought she was dreaming, it was her invention! except it was wasnt an invention anymore, and it wasnt broken and wet, it was a real, life size and it was huge! it was pink, it could fly, it even breathed rainbows and  REAL money! But however , it had magical powers , something Khewa had not put on her invention. She screamed 'MOMMY, DADDY, LOOK MY INVENTION CAME TO LIFE!' they didnt believe her and said, 'GO TO SLEEP SWEETIE YOU ARE PROBABLY HALLUCINATING.' but khewa disobeyed them.       She jumped on the dragon's back, but however , its back wasnt all scaly and rough, it was soft, as soft as baby's skin, and light pink. she put her face against it's soft back and off they went. They kept going higher, and higher and higher into the sky until they were in space. Khewa kept her grip on the dragon because she didnt want to float away because of the gravity. Then they landed on the moon. The dragon twitched her nose and then the moon became pink. then candy started coming from the sky, i mean the universe. They they lived there happily ever after. far away from mean people.                                          THE END !

There is a robot called the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot.          Next, they also have different robots that have do other things. They have robots that explore volcanoes and different places. Some help Doctors and nurses and patients. The robots are very helpful to peoples.          Their is a robot called Mr. Gower.   Mr.Gower is a robot that help hospitals. The Mr.Gower is a small cabinet on wheels. Mr.Gower can go anywhere in the hospital. Ms.Gower can pull up to 500 pounds.

When it was in use, it got damaged so the military stopped using it. As it left the secret layer, it ran into a robot builder. He picked it up and he started to fix it. He added a mini machine gun, thermal camera, camo, and replaced all of its armour with an advanced metal. The docter said it was ready to go! The docter shipped the robot to a base where he would be usable. A man named, Ronald, chose him for combat. From now on, Ronald, was the robot's  partner.                  One hot morning, the base was attacked. Ronald and his robot went to fight back. but when John stepped out of the tent, he was shot in the leg. The robot dragged Ronald back into the tent and back through the other intrance. The robot dragged Ronald to the main building where the base was and he got support. The robot went out to fight. It fired 1 of 50 missles and took out more than halph of the enimies. The troops eventually regained possetion of the base and drove the enimies back.                  The robot was rewarded the medal of honor and thanked by his partner, Ronald. The robot and John moved back to the USA and they both retiered and lived a joyfull life. They wern't just partners, they were friends.

I would say that it was the most incredible thing that I have ever seen!  This is the beginning of a new era.         It started when I decided to modify his special abilities even though he hadn't came to life yet.  I gave him the power to freeze, the power to burn, and the power to bring back the dead as if they were young again.  I thought of something strange when I gave him these abilities.  I thought,'What if he goes mad with power and starts thinking for himself?'.  That is a common feeling for an advanced humaniod, so I also gave him a reset code and a self-destruct code just in case he does think for himself.  Now I have made a robot before, but Version 890DFW5 type robots can be easily duplicated.  If I lost Version AP341CV then all my lives work would be gone.  Everyday, I decided to work with him.  I eventually put him in a skin graph to give him skin so people didn't know he was a humaniod.        I want only the Club Members to see Version AP341CV.  He is going to help us with experiment projects that have died and assist our newest member.  He is not under anyone's command, but he is friendly if you ask nicely.  I am proud of my accomplishment on building such a great robot.

I thought and thought about what I could do. I thought for days straight and then it hit me.I could bulid my very own robot. The next day I started and planned out how i would make it. I decided to do something simple just use a cardboard box and piant a face on. I bulit my robot and spray painted it silver with googlie eyes on his head.   By the time I finished it was time to go to bed. Before i fell fast asleep I said I wish my robot was real. The next morning I woke up to the banging of pots in the kitchen. I went down to check what it was but i didn't see anything. I looked around some more and I saw my robot making breakfast, I closed my eyes because I thought I must be dreaming. When I opened them I saw I wasn't dreaming. I tried to hide it before my parents woke up and then I thought of what to do. I gave it to the local police station for they could use it  for rescues. The next day I looked in the newspaper and i saw a section about how a robot saved many lives. I was glad I gave it to the police station , but I still wonder to this day how that robot came alive.

Our art teacher, Mrs. Anderson, told us to draw a robot that we would like for it to do and If we made a robot what would it look like and she said it was a competition. So everyone started to draw and sketch out ideas except for me. I was thinking and taking my time unlike everyone else, I wanted to be the best artist in the class! I started to draw and throw that paper away, then start over and throw that paper away, then finally I got the most brillant idea I think I have ever had! I wanted my robot to be colorful and also useful. So, I drew a box like thing, and colored it pink,blue and green, my favorite colors! Then I drew a built in cooler and microwave so I could take food and drinks everywhere I went. Then I drew seats so the people could sit down so the would not be so tired from walking, But I had to think, what would I want my robot to do for me? I thought and thought and thought and thought.Until I got another brillant idea! I loved school but I hated all of the work and worksheets, and especially homework! Who loves homework? Not me! So I decided my robot would come to school for me, do all my work, come home to me and tell me everything, then do my homework for me!!           A couple of hours later Mrs. Anderson told us to put everything away and vote for 6 people to come up to the class and present their drawing then the class would vote on who was the best. The class voted for Gracie, Tommy, Addie, Taylor, Jonathan and me!   Gracie and Tommy were voted out first, then Jonathan and Addie! So it was up to Taylor an 	PRP$ NN VBD IN NNP NNP NN NN , NNP NNP , VBD PRP TO VB DT NN WDT PRP MD VB IN PRP TO VB CC NNP PRP VBD DT NN WP MD PRP VB IN CC PRP VBD PRP VBD DT NNP NNP NN VBD TO VB CC NN RP NNS IN IN NNP NNP VBD VBG CC VBG PRP$ NN IN NN RB , PRP VBD TO VB DT JJS NN IN DT NN .

We saw it transform into a gigantic robot. It was standing on two wheels which were its feet. The robot looked so scary. It turns out it was a good robot . We called him Robb.      Robb transformed back into a car and took us to our house with us driving. He could talk like a person. Robb was really strong , he was like a superhero. He helped my whole family with outdoor chores. He could turn into any shape and size. What ever we told him to do he did it. If Robb saw people that were injured. he rushed to the hospital.     Not only did Robb do that but he can also play with any kid that he sees. Robb always has enough time for adventure. He can also sing, dance,and even play music. Sometimes we have a contest of who can dance . Robb also plays the piano, he is a really good robot for me.

The robot was cool for long time but after a long time you get bored until one day it came to life it was so cool! but my mom and dad could not figure out or they would destroy it. I kepted it im my room until i could not no more mom and dad foned it and they... liked it! it was so cool and we lived happy ever after.

I had decided to build a fake, non-working robot I saw on my favorite TV show. 'I wonder if we'll win!' I said to myself.       Soon after that,  Zoe called me and asked if  I was ready to hit the fair. Zoe, Izzy  and I set up our booth. Although we hadn't been very clever with the booth title, it was more creative than most of the other names. Before the judges started judging us we had a little time to scope out our competition. ' ATTENTION! Attention student scientists, please make you way back to your booths so judges may begin.' Shouted our principal Mr.Henry over a mega phone.We started to head back our booth when the judges got to the first project.       By the time the six judges got to us, I had pretty much chewed my nails down to nubs. They asked A LOT of questions. I was pretty disappointed... the judges didn't seem impressed at all. Maybe two minutes after they were done, my robot, just CAME TO LIFE!! ' OH judges!' Izzy yelled. ' Pipe down! This is NOT supposed to happen.' I chimed in. I could tell Zoe was just thinking Jenna! This could really help us! Just once, let Izzy use her big blabber mouth! So I sat back and let Izzy run the show. 'JUDGES!! COME BACK!' she yelled. The judges came back to 'rejudge' us. I'm pretty sure they liked it.       My robot coming to life actually helped us. Surprisingly we came in second. Going original there huh Lisa Collins, stupid paper matte volcano. I guess if I'm EVER in a science fair again I'm definitely going with a come-to-life volcano.

I thought I just might have been my dog jumping off the couch until I went into the living room. It was my robot that I tried to build one day when I was bored. I thought I did a pretty good job. The robot was standing up looking right at me not moving at all. Now you probably think this sounds weird but I couldn't get the robot to actually work.         All of a sudden he just walked away and started cleaning the house. Now this is what I programed to do. I followed him and he said something but I just couldn't make out what he said. I asked him to repeat what he said and he said 'My name is The Fred Bot.' I named him that because I never thought that he ever would be able to talk. 'I didn't program you to do that Fred Bot' I said. 'I programed myself' Fred Bot exclaimed. Then out of no where Fred Bot busted through the door and scurried away.

Another reason is that it could explore on volcanoes. last reason why is because it could carry food, water, and other supplies. If I had a robot I would like it to do all the chores in the house. Another reason why is because it could go to the store ad buy me things like food, clothes, and stuff my family needs. last reason is that is I had a robot I will tell him to build a mantion for all my family with a pool, skate park, and a park were it has a slide with water in it. If I made a robot it would look like me because when I dont wanna go to scool I will send him and when I have soccer games and I wanna stay home doing something I will tell him to go insted of me. Another reason why is because if I wanna go somewhere I dont wanna go ill tell him to go there is so much things about how to make a robot. One last thing I wanna say is that I do wanna have a robot in my house                                                                         	DT JJ NNS IN NNS VBZ IN PRP MD VB NN POS NNP NNP NN VBZ IN PRP MD VB IN NNP JJ NN WRB VBZ IN PRP MD VB NN , NN , CC JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN PRP MD VB PRP TO VB PDT DT NNS IN DT NNP NNP NN WRB VBZ IN PRP MD VB TO DT NN NN NN PRP VBZ IN NN , VBZ , CC NN PRP$ NN NNP JJ NN VBZ IN VBZ PRP VBD DT NN PRP MD VB PRP TO VB DT NN IN DT PRP$ NN IN DT NN , JJ NN , CC DT NN VBD PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN PRP MD VB IN PRP IN WRB PRP VBP JJ NN NN TO NN PRP MD VB PRP CC WRB PRP VBP NN NNS CC PRP VBP NNS VBP NN VBG NN PRP MD VB PRP TO VB VBN IN NNP NNP NN WRB VBZ IN IN PRP VBP NNS VBP RB PRP VBP JJ NN NN NN NN PRP TO VB RB VBZ RB RB NNS IN WRB TO VB DT NNP CD JJ NN PRP VBP NNS VBP VBZ IN PRP VBP JJ NNS VBP DT NN IN PRP$ NN

He suddenly woke up it was a dream but he really did have a robot to build.But a big noise was heard on top of the roof.So he went to inspect and what he saw was unatural, his robot was moving around.The robot finally saw him and strolled foward.the robot said:hello master Jesse was astonashed.Jesse was very happy to see that his robot was intact.The robot was tolled to do all of his chores and other things to do.That was until a ufo abducted jesse and thats when the robots journey begins.                    The robot was built with jetpacks inside his body so it did not take long for the robot to reach the ufo.He devised a plan which was to sneak inside the ufo,kick some alien but and be out with jesse.He got inside super easy thanks to his super strenght jesse put in.He threw out all the aliens and saved jesse, got off the ufo and gave jesse a space helmet.They got home around 9:00 they decided that they had a long day so they hit the sack and lived happily ever after.

788	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			M	620469	6	11087583	Y	55103	             One day a little boy named Tom lived in a very small town. He always watched TV and one day a commercial came on that showed a robot building kit. Well Tom also loved building cool gadgets, and he never built a robot before so Tom asked his mom if she can but him the robot kit she said ' right after you clean your room.' So tom got really excited ran upstairs and started cleaning his room.           Once Tom got done he went down to his mom and told her he cleaned his room. so she said 'alright a deal is a deal.' She got on the phone and ordered the robot making kit. A few weeks later the package arrived. Tom picked up the package on the way in his house from doing chores. He started unwrapping the tape and opening the box. All of the parts fell out on his workbench.                   Right away he began building and after a few days the robot was built. Tom loved the way the robot looked and how small he was. Tom said 'I think I will name him Tom Jr.' That day all Tom and Tom Jr. did was play catch. But what Tom didn't know was that he was in for a surprise tomorrow. That night Tom and Tom Jr. were in Tom's bed looking out the window when all of the sudden a shooting star flew by the window.                       Tom said 'I wish Tom Jr. was really alive and he could play with me and help me do chores.' After that Tom got tired and decided it was bedtime so him and Tom Jr. went to bed. The next morning Tom got up and Tom Jr. wasn't their Tom started freaking out and started saying Tom Jr. Tom Jr. Well what Tom didn't know was that overnight Tom Jr. turned into a real robot that could actually run play and talk clearly. Well Tom Jr. got up and stared at Tom, Tom said 'are you real like really real?'                           Tom Jr. answered back 'yes Tom' Tom started screaming and running into the kitchen. But no one was home because everyone had gone to work. So Tom was cornered and said 'Tom Jr. don't hurt me please.' Tom Jr. said 'hurt you why would i hurt you, you are the one that made me real' so tom started to feel a little better and said 'do you want some cereal?' Tom Jr. laughed and said 'sure buddy' that morning Tom and Tom Jr. ate cereal but Tom Jr. didn't really eat it. The cereal kinda went right through him and out his back. Every time that happened Tom giggled then spit his cereal and milk  went everywhere.                       That night when Tom's mom and dad got home Tom showed them Tom Jr. But his mom and dad weren't to excited about the whole live robot and they said what is that. Tom said ' It is my robot Tom Jr.' They started to calm down and accept him into the family so from that daya on Tom Jr. lived a happy life and did everything with Tom.

After hearing that I said let's work together to make robot. When I said that they all said yes.Then my friends and I found a emty room I looked inside and I said It's perfect.When we looked around we found a lot junk that we can use to make are robot then I looked out side the door to see if anybody followed us here.afer about 5 minutes I stoped looking and went to help my friends.When I went to our room I saw my friends taking out drills off the shelfs then I said we should get started all ready.        After we got all the parts we needed we started to build the body the robots body was the color of silver. Then I said that we need to make a motor for our robot after I said that we all got to work on building a motor. It took about an hour building the motor but we finally made it now we need to make the legs so it can walk. when my friends were working on the legs I said i'm going to make gears so the leg and arms could move properly they said ok and went back to work.It took a long time but the work perfectly when I went to go check on my friends they finished both of the legs and were half way done with the arms.As I came back I said I am going to attach the gears on it's legs and arm they ok but then one of my friends said what kind of robot is it I said it will work for millatary because we could get more mony if we made it for them I said. Then one of my friends said is going to a battel field I said yes and then I that am going to make head and programme it too speak.       I made the head and it could speak but it just needs to be chargd.As I went back to were my friends were they finished evey thing it already had armor and guns on his arms and all it needed was head when I but the head on the robot it turned on and came to life. My friends and I jumped in joy we finaly finished.The next day we walked the robot in the factory we saw the boss in his office woking on paper work.As we walked in he was shocked at what we had build.Then I told him if we can sell it and he said  but he said that it is from this factory and if they want another one they come so went.we went too the millitary and told them about the robot they said they want to see it  I  said it right here in the big truck as took it out they how much I said it's $50,000  they said they would take it.I was so happy that and thats how best day ended.

Alex get the others out...'.                             Alex was crying, his mother just got kidnapped by aliens and he doesn't know anything about aliens.Alex is worried sick for his mother right know.Elena calls Alex.Alex tells Elena that there are robot aliens coming to the neighborhood right now and that to gather everybody else to get out of there.Elena already knew that this was going to happen because she's been studying the robots.She is a scientist.And she was the one who awoke the robots.And she knows exactly how to put them to sleep.Just then she made a robot 9000 weapon that can put them to sleep forever.She calls Alex again to tell him to come over to the lab and got the weapons before there are more robots to come.                                By the time Alex came she was packing up the weapons for him and her.They get to the neighborhood and start shooting at the robots.The robots start shooting back but don't get them.By the time Alex and Elena shot all of the robots,they had to put them back in their spaceship and ship them back from where ever they came from.When Alex and Elena are done with that they head back to Alex's house.When Alex enters the house he sees his mom tied up,so he unties his mom and goes up stairs to see if they did any damage.And when Alex gets there,he sees 3 robots talking so he starts shooting at them.The robots are dead.And so Elena says that they can't ship them back without their spaceship.And so Alex starts digging up a whole in the middle of nowhere.He dumps the bodies there and then leaves.Alex and Elena are the only ones who know where the robot's are at.Elena says that they were robots,but Alex calls them robot aliens.And that what they've been through right now is called 'Robot Alien Invasion'.

Gemini-Scout helps by finding stuck or lost miners and scans the air for gases. it is tuff to it can carrie food to the miners and carrie minerst out of mines.       Like I said robos help alot let me tell you about a diferent robot named (Dante 2) Dante 2 is a cool robot with a cool job it climbs into valcanos to gather information about the valcano. Its shaped like a spider it has eight legs that helps it by climbing steep walls. It can handle very high empitures of heat.       There is anouther robot thats kinda cool. Mr.Gower is its name its a robot that woks in hospitals. It has cabinets that holds medicine for the docters incase they need it. Mr.Gower is so strong that he can talk to call an elivator like fo istence 'calling elivator' Thats cool.       Also Agribot is another robot tha works on farms. It helps by picking fruit like berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. Agribots are coming in all shapes and sizes and they can see shapes and coles for the fuit to pick. There also able to move on there own not being controlled by someone.

The mans name was Dan. Dan one day gave up because he tried and tried to make his robot come to life but he couldn't because no where in his village has the proper energy he required. One day Dan sent his robot in a rainy day above his ceiling and the robot was covered in a tarp. The robot was hit by a strip of lightning and he came to life!.       To begin with, when Dan woke up in the morning he saw a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon , and juice on the table and he was puzzled. Dan did not know who made this breakfeast meal so he looked around the house but he found noone. When Dan finished his meal the robot appeared and scared the living daylight out of Dan. Dan asked the robot and asked him who he was, the robot said i was created by you master i was hit by a strip of lighting when you put me up the cieling with a tarp and i came to life. Dan was surprised and he decided to name his robot Fred and Fred liked his name.           In Addition, Dan asked the Fred the robot if he can do anything in the world like make a time machine or even make a watch the talks and tells what time is around the world thats has Satalite Gps. Fred the robot said yes i could but what i really want is have a family and experience the real world. Dan said sure but he said to Fred, Fred im sorry but your family i must need time and collect metal iron and steal to make your family because it took me almost 3 years to complete you. Fred understood and he asked if he can help him build his family and experience the real at the same time. While Dan and Fred go around the village buying parts they had fun like going to the beach going to town and also playing video games which Fred pretty much won because he knew everything about video games.          Furthermore, Dan and Fred spent alot of time with eatchother and sometimes Fred gets lonely because it has been 2 years since Fred and Dan first met each other and Dan is busy making his family because Fred wants to expreince being a father and having kids. One day Dan said to Fred, Fred i almost completed your family and by this two weeks i hear were are going to have rain and thunder so im going to need you to stay in the house because you can rust if you go outside and in the rain. During the time it rained Dan completed Freds family and now fred had a best freind (Dan) and a family Fred had lots of fun with Dan, now he can share his experience with his family. Dan has getting old and Fred was sad because Dan was only 48 when they met and Dan was getting tired and sick, and Freds family was getting sad because they barely knew him. 3 years past and Dan was on the verge of death because of the melted smoke and smog Dan inhaled while completing Freds family and Dan had lung cancer and now he was weezing and he couldnt breath and then he passed away while Fred and his family watch Before Dan passed away  but before Dan passed away Dan asked Fred If he could bury him in his lab so he can remember the good times he had with Fred and his family, Fred said yes and when the time came of Dans Death the robots were heart broken and devastated.           In conclusion, Fred the robot and his family have been living together for a long time and having a memory of Dan. Sometimes Fred is lonely but is cheered up when his family comes back from walking and playing on the grass where Fred the robot and Dan had first been when Fred was alive. During the time Dan and Fred Spent together Fred felt like a normal human. Fred decided to do something special and he went throught Dans robots blueprints and build himself a new robot Dan!!. Now Fred and a best friend that is now a robot and once was a human, now with Fred his Family and Dan the robot They lived a happy and peacefull life in Dans house where they spended the rest of their live together frolicing in the meadows and playing in the grass.

When I went to go see it I saw that he had been pushed out of the window in his office. It was really weird because the window couldn't be broken unless it was a robot. We had some robots that we were still trying to make them come to life but we hadn't succeeded, or that's what I thought. The doctor left a hologram that said, ' I know you must be mad that I am dead, but I did this for a purpose. I made a robot that could change the future. This one is different from the ones we are trying to make, this one has feelings and dreams, he acts like a real person. I told him to do this. This is good bye.' then the hologram shut off. I went to go look for the robot, but to do that I had to ask the doctors assistant what he had done with the robot. The assistant said she didn't know where he was. I had little time to find the robot to tell me what the doctor had told him.   I saw a robot that was trying to run away from me so I had to shoot one of its legs off. I caught up to it then started asking it some questions he told me that the doctor was teaching how to write and talk like a human being. He told me he knew where he needed to take me and took me to the top of the tallest building ever, he said that here he would find another hologram from the doctor. When I found it he had said, ' When the robots come to life you will have a war with the robots trying to save all of humanity. You are the only hope for saving us, take this robot to help you battle the robots and destroy them. They will soon think that humans are not worthy to tell them what to do. Be careful, they are very dangerous when provoked.' then the hologram shut off again.   The battle was very bloody, we kept fighting losing some of our people. We managed to get past the evil robots When 30 robots surrounded us. It was a good thing I had my shotgun to kill half of them. We had to get inside the main hallway of the control system to shut off the evil robots. When we got there it was surrounded by robots so we took the vents. When we got in we got to the controls and shut them off for good. We then tried to fix them to be more peaceful. After two years we made it possible to live in peace with robots.

And billy said 'i am going to dig up something.' and then the mom said OK.   and then billy went back out side and dig.                      15 minutes later he saw a head then he polled it out and then it was a robot and billy went in the front yard and washed it off with a hose and he saw a glowing button and he p pushed it and the head lifted up and it said 'hello master.'                 Then billy said 'hi what do you do' and the robot said 'I make people happy and do lots of jobs'            And then one week later billy was walking the robot in the park and a guy came up and took the robot and said thank you for finding my robot and the guy gave billy a reward of 10 grand but he gave it to the mom to keep it save and then they had everything   they needed.

What she didn't know while going up the long pathway of stairs was that, sitting at the foot of her bed in her bedroom, was one more present from her parents. When she saw how big it was, she gasped. She hurried to put all of her presents away then went to the foot of her bed to open her last present of the day. She tore off the bright red wrapping paper. It was a new robot. One that she had been wanting since she was about 5 years old.       She screamed in excitement. She took it out of the box and put the given batteries into Nitro 360 and tried to turn it on. It wouldn't turn on. She tried and tried but it just wouldn't turn on. She went downstairs to the kitchen to tell her mom and dad that the present that they had bought for her had not been working. Her dad went up to her room to find out what was wrong with the new robot, but couldn't find out what the problem was.        That night Aurora went to sleep disappointed. But while she was asleep, in the darkness of the cold night, there was a loud sound coming from her room. The robot had turned on. Aurora woke up surprised, scared, but also excited. 'Hello. I am Nitro 360. What may I do for you?' it asked, staring straight towards her. She hesitated on saying what she wanted. She just sat in her bed staring right back at the robot for what felt to her like forever. 'Well, can I have a glass of water? I am thirsty.         She watched as the Nitro 360 suddenly shook, creating a loud buzzing sound that reminded Aurora of a bee. In just a second, the giant robot held a cold glass of water with ice cubes out to her.          She was fascinated. She drank the water then went to sleep. Soon enough, Aurora and the robot became friends. Aurora was thankful to have received such a wonderful birthday present from her parents. Aurora enjoys having the best birthday present she has ever received, the Nitro 360.

People came excited to Robotown but left unhappily, probably because they expected to find robots everywhere, but found none. The city was constantly trying to make functional robots, but only succeeded in making toys. Their problem was that they had no small sources of power.            But one day a young boy named Ethan was playing with his toy robot, which he named R9-27J, and accidentally made him touch the power box. There was a bright flash and a loud ZZZZZZZ!    'Whoa. What happened?' Ethan exclaimed.   'Ethan, what are you doing?' called his older brother Zachary.   'Nothing!' replied Ethan.   'Hmm... No you're up to something!' said Zachary. Ethan went to barricade the door but Zachary was much stronger than him until.....            'Beep, Beep!' beeped a voice, 'whirrrrr.' Suddenly the door started to close! It was just then when Ethan realized that a robot was helping barricade the door.   'Ahh!' cried Ethan, jumping back from the door.   'Do not worry, I will not hurt you.' said R9-27J. But Ethan was   still afraid of the now-alive robot.   'Worry not little master, I will get rid of this other being.'said   R9-27J. R9-27J made some more beeping and whirring noises and suddenly, Ethan didn't hear his brother outside the door.   'What did you do with Zachary?' asked Ethan.   'Simple. I teleported him.' replied R9-27J.   'Oh tele-wait what did you do!?' yelled Ethan.           'I told you, I teleported him.' replied R9-27J. R9-27J was obviously very futuristic, but TELEPORTING PEOPLE!           'Ok, let me get this straight, you are a robot that came to life from my power box?' said Ethan.   'Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.' said R9-27J.   'So, where is my robot?' said Ethan.           'I am your robot! What would I be if not your robot?' asked R9-27J.           ' Uhh....' said Ethan.           'See? YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY IDEAS!!!!!!!!!' yelled R9-27J.           'Okay,okay,okay. I said OKAY!' yelled Ethan as his robot started to do the things he liked making him do.   ' Anyways, where is Zachary?' asked Ethan.   'Who is Zachary?' asked R9-27J.   ' The 'other being', the person you teleported!'           ' Oh, he is in South America on one of the jagged rocks in the Strait of Magellan.'   'WHAT!!!!!'   ' I said-'           'No, what meaning.... WHY DID YOU TELEPORT HIM THERE OF ALL PLACES!!!!!' yelled Ethan.           'Fine. now he is in a bear's cave in the Appalachian Mountains.'   'No.'   ' Now in the ruins of the ancient city Jericho.'   'Gah!'   'There is no place called 'Gah'.'   'Bring him back to Nevada.'   'Okay, he is back.'    'Where?'   'Lake Tahoe, Nevada.'           ' Fine. Robotown, Nevada. 9497 Turbo Street. In the foyer of the house.'           ' Request granted, very specific request granted.' R9-27J chuckled.           'Can you teleport me and you anywhere in the world?' asked Ethan.           'Yes.'           'Then teleport us to F.R.C., Colorado. The Failing Robot Center, that won't be failing anymore!'           'Request....granted.'

So they kept trying and trying and then... it turned on 'WOW' said the scientists,then it shut off they were devastated but they did not give up yet.The next day they tried again then it turned on again then it stayed on .They finally made it work. The robot said'hello'.One of the scientists asked 'what are we going to name it?'. The other two asked each other the same question. How about 'Zion?' asked one scientists. The two scientists said 'Maybe that might just be it!'       A couple of mouths later the scientists came back and had decided on a name for the robot they were going to name the robot Zion.That was the one they could not get that name out of their heads for mouths. The next day they made a couple more Zions but they did not work out as well as the first Zion.The scientists went home and then came back the next day and noticed that the robots were gone.They had wondered where they had gone then one of the scientists was being really quite.'It was you who let them out how could you they were supposes to be in bed like us!' said one of the scientists.'I know where they are.' said the scientists.'Well where are they then!' said both of the scientists 'They are at my house safe and sound.'. 'Safe in your hands i doubt that  nothing is safe in your hands!'  'Why do you say that?'asked the scientists 'Because everything that you get is broken within in five minutes!' 'OK what ever say what you want to say because it is not true.'       The next day they went to find the Zions.After a long while they finally found the last of the Zions and made them clean up the city.The Zions did not like to clean up they want to go play but,they had made a hug mess so they had to clean it up.The scientists made the Zions go to the lab and sit in the corner and think about what they had done.That is the story about The robot that came alive.

Me and my dad were making a robot tat could do all my chores, cook dinner for us, do all of our daily duties for us, help us when we are sick, babysit us, and; it will be a scientific break through, if it works. He will be blue and silver, have nine legs and eighteen arms.We are putting the final electric socket in him!  ZIIIIIPPPP!!!! It's alive!! YES!! What a masterpiece i will be famous! I will win the science fair for sure. My dad is so proud of me we will make so much money off of this if it works properly. I wonder how i am going to top this next year?!?!?

It was a Saturday and we had nothing to do so we Jacob's mom decided to drive us to the fair, she thought it would be a good idea. When sehe left we forgot to bring money and Jacobs mom wasn't picking up. There were some awesome rides that we both would've died to go on, but we didn't have any money. I never really focused on the games considering they were all rigged and there was no point in wasting your money on them. We decided just to wander around and look at some stuff. We tried to sneak onto a ride but we got caught. Fortunately the guy running it was cool and let us go with a warning. We were dying of thirst and hunger and still Jacobs mom was not picking up. Then we saw double doors that had 'Do Not Enter' on it. It was like putting a sign on a door that said 'FUN Inside' oon your door. We tried to hop over, and even with the help of eachother we could not get over that 15 foot door. Then , dying from exhaustion, I leaned against the door and and it opened. We felt like such idiots. whhen we wnet inside there were at least 20 trailers all lined up. Some of them looked new and shiny, while others looked like they've been there for oveer a century. It smelld of mildew and dust everywhere. We snuck around so we wouldn't ge caught, and then we saw it.          Jacob pointed at it and said, 'Look at that! Wait, what is that? Is it a robot?,' 'I'm not sure.,' I said. We walked closer to it, and the closer we got to it, the more I could make out the details of it. It had wheels on the bottom and was about two and half feet tall. It didn't have a head and its body was shaped like a rectangular prism. The rest of it was so badly rusted that I could not make out its details. Instantly Jacob said, 'Lets take it.'          I wasn't so sure that was a good idea, but I was so hot and tired at the minute that I was brain dead and just said, 'Sure.' I took it by it's legs and he took it by it's body and we ran off, but not before we heard someone shout 'Hey!' We ran as fast as our legs would carry us. Jacob called his mom and she finally picked up. He told her to meet us in the front of the carnival. We dashed in and out of stalls trying to lose the man chasing us, and when we finally did, we went to the front of the carnival and instantly got into the cool car. Jacobs mom turned around and was suprised to find a robot in our hands. She asked, 'did you win it?' I quickly answered, 'Yes'          Now, as I finally finished polishing the last of the rust off, I could completely make out all its features.

Have you ever thought of  robots that could do things not even the most of us humans could do, well your wish has come true! There are many robots that can do things that we can't but they can also work with us. One of the robots the work with us is Mr. Gower, Mr. Gower is a medical assistant robot that brings people medicine it can also work an eleavator and carry 500 pounds. There is another robot that help and save lives , its less than two feet tall, it's the Gemini-Scout! The Gemini-Scout is a miner helper bot that can find trapped miners, bring them supplies and even warn miners about dangerous air. The Gemini Scout is not the only robot that explores and gathers info , this robot gets info about valcanos its a robot called Dante2, Dante2 climbs in to volcanos when it's dangerous it collects gases while scientist are all safe.                                  Robots arent always about research and info many people play with robots   or keep them as pets. There are copy's of animals in robot form people either choose these over real pets because of allergyies or the benefits of not taking much care of them. More than pets robots can also be performers a Japanese robot can play piano with two maniacal arms , a different robot called HRP-4c can sing and dance.    Some robots can play sports perfectly fine for example college students in   Orgean have created Hockey and Shuffleboard playing robots.                                    I bet you always thought when are we going to get cars that can drive them selves in TV? Well the time has come  thanks to the intelligence of Google they made a self driving car! I know it sounds fake but due to the sattelite laser on it's roof it knows where to go! While testing the car evereything went fine, the vehichle matches the traffic for perfect driving. The twist is to own one of these cars your car will need a license. Google is trying to get there cars legal Breslow says 'When these vehicles are sold  it will be navad's first green license plate telling them to go green'. 	NNP NNS IN NNS .

One of his friends Shauna liked to study alien activity so Charlie thought why doesen't he join her so he did in the RV there were blinking lights different computers UFO toys. Charlie touched one of the figure aliens Shauna came out of no where and slapped his hand 'OW' Charlie said 'what was that for' he exclaimed 'Dont touch what is not yours ok' Shauna said 'Alright, so whatcha look,in at?' 'Some alien activity is going on out here the trees are not around just one big burn mark' Shauna showed him a picture of a burn mark in a circle near the american flag 'WOW' Charlie said 'I know right this is great i might be able to catch a real alien and prove that they are real' Fauna said it so quick in her excitment. Charlie just went with it and said that he was proud of her and then he hugged her 'But i hope the aliens arent harmful right?' Charlie asked 'I don't think so, or maybe.....' 'anyways' Shauna said lets go and see it right now' She exclaimed 'OK LETS GO GRAB YOUR COAT' Charlie said but they were not expecting this horrible thing coming. Soon they found it but there was this giant ship on it 'WOW'Shauna took pictures of it with her camera and said 'Lets go print these out' 'OK' SO they went back to the crazy RV and printed them when they came out there was nothing just the burn mark 'What?' Shauna said 'Whats goin on?'Charlie asked 'Their is nothing but the burn mark why isnt it there?' then suddenly they heard a wierd noise more like a squiking sound they looked out the front sheild then 'AAAAHHHH' they both screamed the purple creature ran and went to the forest 'What was that?' Charlie asked turns out Shauna was a good drawer so she asked Charlie to describe it to her so he did 'it had big green glowing eyes and yellow pupils and purple in its skin with wierd writings on it' 'Can you describe what they looked like' Shauna said 'OK OK it was like jiberish' and they left it at that but it still roams around looking for its invisible ship.

That all changed last month when ball of buzzing light touched barkul a loud boom shook me and the house I thought I was done for I was out of bed but it was as nothing happened I decided to go to bed. that night I had a dream that barkul came to life but died soon after by a passing dump truck it made me realize that Barkul would be a great deal of help to me. The next morning I went to work on Barkul while my parents were in bed but the kitchen was in shreds chairs smashed food strewn across the floor that was when I found Barkul under a pile of bacon he was talking saying 'I need food' I was shocked I almost fell over i tried to tell him he was a robot and couldn't eat anything.       Mick whats all the racket it sounds like a robbery, my dad came down the stairs and didn't even notice the mess or Barkul. Dad its barkul he's alive and working, He is, show me. I picked up Barkul and held it to my Dad he must've thought i was mad he didn't see anything. Mick is this one of your stupid tricks again. I coulden't belive it my Dad coulden't see Barkul or anything Barkul did that would explain why he can't see the mess. I responed with yes (it sounded very scripted). Through the next few days I found that Barkul can instantly put answers down on paper this made quick and easy to 'do my homework'.

One day a robot invented named Chris Urmson was driving one of the cars when all the sudden it stopped.Chris got out of the car to see if something was wrong with it, but when he closed the door the Google car drove  away as fast as it possibly could. Chris called the Google company to say this. He said,' its gone,the car is gone it just drove away when I got out of it.'

They assist Scientists and even explore volcanoes.                  Today I am in my creative writing club. I have been working on my Robot all week long, finally I am going to be able to present my robot that I worked on so hard all week.                  When I end up going to the front of the classroom I feel like I am ready to present my robot. I am about to press the button on my robot to turn it on and wait for it to start moving. I have not pressed the button yet and it starts moving. I am freaking out inside and my classmates in the club of the creative writing think that I have already turned it on, but I know that I didn't. My friends in the class are saying things like, '' Hey that's such a cool robot how cool.'' When in my head I'm thinking what am I going to do!                    The presentation was finally over, and it felt like it had been for hours! I was so nervous because what if the robot did that again. Even worse what if it did that during class! Everyone would start freaking out and not know what to do. I decided to go and tell the teacher.                   When I finished telling her what happened she went to her desk and looked inside. She pulled out a remote, and said that I used the remote to make your robot move. So it turned out that the robot wasn't able to move by its self after all!

One night, John put batteries in his robott without knowing that the batteries were magical. In the afternoon John put his robot in the basement because he had to go to a soccer game.            An hour passed and John went to the basement to go get his robot. When he saw that he wasn't there, he told his mom if she had gotten him. she said ,''No.'' John went to his room and saw the robot walking around his room.            John screamed. His mom came up and said,'' Whats wrong?'' John just looked at his mom. She turned around and saw that robot that he was walking around his room. She started to scream and garbed John next to her.             Robot came near them and they backed away. Robot said,''Im sorry scaring you. I didn't mean to.'' She came near it and touched robot. John followed her and touched him. Robot smiled. John grabbed him and hugged him.             John, Robot and John's mom went down stairs to eat. When they were finish eating, John and robot went to their. When they were sitting down John asked robot how did he come to life? When Robot told John how did he come to life he was sup-prize.

He failed to succeed his great idea, but he didn't give up. he stayed up the whole night to make his invention work, but it didn't work. He left to take a nap when suddenly the robot came to life.The robot said 'Master, where are you? I need to talk to you,'. The scientist came rushing in the room by the robot.        'I'm your master robot, you will do everything I say.'   'Your my master, but were are we?'   'In my laboratory robot, we are in my house,',said  the scientist 'OUR lovely home.'   'Will I be here too master, with you?'   'Of coursed my assistant robot,you will live with me. Didn't you here me say,'OUR lovely home', robot?'   'Yes master I heard you clearly.', said the robot 'But will we stay here forever master?'   'No, robot, I need to teach you some things before we go outside.'           So the master of the robot led them to the kitchen so the scientist could teach his robot how to cook for him.He showed him the ingredients, told him what he eats and what he does not eat as being allergic to it. The robot learned and learn how to cook the food,serve the food without dropping it.           The robot learn how to do math,how to take care of his master,everything you need to do in your life he learned. 'Well you learned everything I thought you today my friend robot everything. Ah you are my best helper.You even learned all the words of the English language even all the languages in the world! I am very proud of you robot!'   thank you master,gracias.Now can we go outside master?' said the robot.'Now will we?'.The master thouhgt for a second and said 'Yes.'                                                                       the end 	WRB DT NNP VBD TO VB NNP : NNP NNP NNP NNP NN VBD TO VB DT NN WDT MD VB NNS POS NNS , CC RB JJ NNP NNP VBD TO VB PRP$ JJ NN , CC PRP VBD RB VB NNP PRP VBD RP DT JJ NN TO VB PRP$ NN NN , CC PRP VBD RB NNP NNP VBD TO VB DT NN WRB RB DT NN VBD TO NNP NN VBD JJ , WRB VBP PRP .

For my science project I was making a robot that can help you with your homework like a: teacher or tutor. While I was working on my making my robot suddenly it worked it came to life. I was shocked ,but interested in how it came to life. The robot I made could talk it told me that when I connected the two wires in his control pad it made an electrical shock that made it come to life. I named Carl. Carl was very polite ,but it was time to check if he was made for what he was suppose to do. I asked Carl a few questions, 'Carl what is two plus two?' and he answered correctly he said, 'Four and you know you can count on your fingers.', I giggled yes I know. 'OK Carl what is matter?',I asked Carl answered correctly and I asked him a couple more questions and he got them all right! OK Carl lets head to the science fair.        Carl and I head to the science fair on the way there the school bullies showed up and were bothering Carl and I. 'Leave us alone!' ,I yelled. 'Let's see if this thing can actually work' ,said one of the bullies. Carl grabbed one of the boys and throw him with all his might. Once Carl throw one of the boys the other one ran off scared. 'Carl no that is wrong!' ,I yelled at Carl. 'I was only trying to protect you.' ,said Carl sadly. 'It's OK just don't do it again.' ,I said to him. While we were walking to the science fair i was thinking if  Carl is strong and smart and got mad because that kid was bothering me what would he do if there was a bigger problem than that.        When we finally arrived at the science fair there some kids that had some really great project too ,but I was sure that with Carl's help I can leave this science fair with a gold metal in my hand. I waited for the judges of the science fair to come to review and judge my project. The judges came up to me and asked a few questions. 'What is your project do?' ,one of the judges asked. 'Well this is Carl and I made him to help students when they are having trouble with thier homework.' ,I said. Does it work? Yes of course watch. I grabbed Carl's control pad ,but it didn't work because the school bullies broke on our way to the science fair ,so Carl went crazy and started smashing the other kids projects. Everyone screamed in terror and kids ran out ,but the judges couldn't run out because Carl had them rapped in wire. Then I had a idea when I saw the wires. I am at a science fair ,so there must be spear part around here. I finally fixed Carls control pad and shut him down. I let go of the judges and they gave me the first place metal for saving them and they were inprested that I shut him down so quickly and easly. They congratulated me and I went home thinking what would happen to Carl I guess I will never know. Maybe.

I slowly went under the bed to take a peek. A bright light shone in my eyes and I could see my robot swirling around in circles like crazy. I grabbed the robot out of the under and examined it closely.There seemed to be no problem until it talked! 'hellooooooo,' the robot said in a thundering voice. I looked at it, stared, then fainted.          The next morning I scented eggs and bacon coming from the kitchen. I went downstairs and saw that robot cooking and saying'good moring.' I looked surprised but said good morning. It offered me some food and I ate it. I wasn't sure what kind of robot it was. It seemed like a mix of every kind of robot. When I was sick it would bring me medicine. It could do cool tricks like climbing,steering, and talking. When we went to the park it would pick fresh apples from the apple trees. This robot is excellent.

But Drew still did his morning rutine, when he drew though something happend!!! The robot he drew came to life!!!!!               Drew was scared but excited. The robot said 'hello.' Drew was amazed at the robot. 'Who are you?' Drew asked. The robot said 'I am fluffy bunny bot.But my friends just call me bunny.''Why are u here?' said Drew.

It can pull the hurt people to safety, and it can carry food, water, and other supplies. It can also collect information. It can check the air for gases. And it has a thermal camera it uses to find the miners. The miners can use Gemini-Scouts two-way radio to talk to a rescue team. It is built to be easy to use. It is like a video control.       Dante 2 is a robot that climbs up the side of volcanoes. It is a helpful robot that can go inside of the volcano and gather information about the gases in the vents for the scientists. It can survive very high heat. Dante 2 looks around to find vents,or holes.       Mr.Gower is another robot that works in hospitals helping doctors carry medicine. It has locked cabinets that lock up the medicine and only the doctors and workers can open the cabinets for medicine. It is a very smart robot that keeps all the medicine safe so nobody else can get to it. It is also very strong, it can pull up to 500 pounds. It is very helpful to the doctors.       Agribots is a robot that can pick fruit. Some fruits it might pick are berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. Agribots come in different shapes and sizes. They can extend their arm to pick a fruit or vegetable to high for them to reach. It can tell if a fruit or vegetable is ripe enough to pick. I think that it is a helpful robot to farmers.           Some robots play well with others. I think that robots that play well with others are great. They keep people entertained. Some that are helpful and play well are Robbie the babysitting robot in the story 'I, Robot.' The story is about a robot named Robbie that babysits a child and the child likes him but the parents don't because the child spends a lot of time playing with Robbie and have fun adventures.              I think that robot controlled cars are a very good idea. It can sense everything around it and know things that a human wouldn't know. It is very helpful to drivers. It steers, drives, and it knows when someone is turning in front of them. All of the robot controlled cars have to get a permanent to drive. They are very smart. They are a very good invention.

It's a story about three kids battle robots to save the world.       'Ok mom, let me get to a good ending point.' Alex answered. That meant read another five chapters before falling asleep, only Alex shouldnt fall asleep because in his story one of the kids died in battle. Alex got scared easily. He will get nightmares tonight.       In Alex's dream he started out in his bedroom, getting ready for school. He was eating breakfast when his mom walks in the dining room, her hair all frizzled.       'Good morning mom.' Alex greeted his mom.   'Good morning Alex honey. How did you sleep?' She asked.   'Fine, but I had a nightmare.'   'Was it the robots again?'   'Yea. I'm fine though, oh, look at the time. Gotta go to school.'   'Love you hon-.' Thats all she got to say to him before he got swooped up by George, the biggest, deadliest robot of all.       DAN, DAN, DAAAAAAAAAN!         	DT NNP NNP , PRP VBZ NN IN VBN .

Robotic Helper is so helpful it will follow you around and help you without you asking for help.It can also rescue near by people and help you too of course.Everything you do, it senses your movements and senses what you are trying to do.Robotic Helper is a special robot to have around you at all times.It is very strong,but not strong enogh to lift a car so don't try it.If you do then good luck trying to fix it back.                                   Guess what else this fantastic helper can do.......it can speak, but only when you ask it a question like, what does furrious mean,and it would look it up and give you the answer to your question.Robotic Helper is very smart and could help you with your homework.I would use this robot for my homework every day when I come home from school.It would be exciting to help you grocery shopping like this robot.It could help you pick out clothes because it has a good taste in style.                                         I had fun explaining this robotic......human or helper.This robot is a big help exspecially to people by saving lives and other things.These things look hard and they are so why not have a robot to help just a little.A strong, smart, and helpful robot like the Robotic Helper.

Robots are practically do humans jobs.Robots are doing so much for humans that humans do not even have to worry about their responsibilities.Robots in the future are most likely going to be doing all the work for humans because they are doing most of it now so why not in the future?.                       Some robots that give a helping hand are Gemini-Scout,Dante 2,Mr.Gower,and Agribots.The way Gemini-Scout gives a helping hand is that she does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground.The way Dante 2 helps is it climbs in volcanoes to gather information for scientists.Also the way Agribots help is that they pick berries for farmers.                      Robots are used all around the world,they are used for their unique qualities and their helpfulness to others.Robots are helping,useful,hardworking,intellegent,and unique.Robots are basically harder workers than humans because they work longer,try harder,and think harder.Sure robots do not have a brain however they are very very smart and well minded.                      All in all,I think that robots are spectacular creations in this world.Also i think that robots are independent hard workers.Even though they are not humans they sure do act like them.As a matter of fact they are even better workers than humans.Robots are very smart hard workers and are ver worthy of getting work done.

I think they are helpful. My reasons are below.            The world is using robots as we speak. Here are some names of robots Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, and Agribots. Robots help us a lot right now. They save people's lives, get information we can't get, and they also help us farm            People have robots for pets, companions, and friends. The reason people keep robot as pets is that they might not know how to take care of real animals. Hosipitals use a robot named Mr. Gower to help them get medicine and to concetrate.            See robots are helpful. So hopfully this story changed your mind 	NNS VBP PRP VB NNS VBP JJ .

The rocky walls and floor glimmered slightly from jems and minerals hidden within the rocks. It was quiet and serene, save for the constant 'drip,drip' sound of a trickle of water hitting a small rock. Suddenly there was movement in a far corner of the cave. A silver robot crawled out from under a pile of rubble. Amazingly, there wasn't any damage done to it by the rocks, except for a couple minor scratches. The words,'Gemini-Scout' were engraved on it. The rather small robot looked around.' Where am I?' It asked itself.          Gemini-Scout realized it was in a large mine. However,it did not remember how it got there. 'Maybe if I escape, I can find someone to help me.' it thought. Gemini-Scout turned and realized it had food,water, bandages, and a rope tied to it. 'That will be useful.' It said. With that, it wheeled further into the mine.             The robot traveled for three days, and still had not escaped. It seemed as if Gemini-Scout would never escape the mine. It had spent some time mining though, and it now held jewels and minerals (and a lot of plain rocks). Suddenly, Gemini Scout heard a sound. It sounded like a mixture of a screech and a squeak. Quickly it wheeled toward the noise.         In a few minutes it had found the source of the noise. A small bat had hurt itself by accidentaly flying into a stalagmite, and it was trying to call for help. Gemini-Scout took out the bandages it hadn't used and helped the bat. Soon it was better,but it could not fly. It had a broken wing that needed time to heal. 'Do you know where I can exit this mine?' Gemini-Scout asked the bat. The bat surprisingly understood and started to hop in the direction of a chamber. Gemini-Scout followed.        The chamber the bat had led the robot to was very bright. The jewels sparkled and shimmered, and the rocks seemed to be brighter than the sun. Gemini-Scout was confused. It had been in this chamber before and hadn't found an exit. 'I don't understand.' It told the bat. The bat shook it's head and pointed with its wing (the one that wasn't broken) to a hole in the roof of the chamber. The hole was the source of the light. Sunlight from it streamed in and bounced off of rocks and jems, making them appear to be sparkling. Gemini Scout launched a rope up to the hole,then it hoisted itself up. The bat decided to stay in the mine, but it seemed to wave goodbye to Gemini-Scout.       When Gemini-Scout got out of the mine,it was as if it was in a whole other world. There was green grass, and the sky was a bright blue. A city appeared in the distance. Gemini-Scout noticed a dirt road leading towards the city. It started to wheel down it. Gemini-Scout wasn't sure what it would find when it arrived at the city. 'I hope I can find someone who knows where I am.' It said. Would Gemini-Scout's hopes come true? Was this the end of his adventure? Or was it only the beginning?

Alpha2.0!' the director of the robot academy yells. All the other people attending the academy cheer. But to be honest I'm not really impressed. The 2095 robot academy was suposed to be amaizing. All I really see is a shiny figure made out of wires and bolts.       Then all of a sudden, the robots eyes go from electric blue to blood red. As the robot lunges I barely have time to jump out of the way. In about five seconds the robot has changed from a glorified vacume cleaner to a full blown war machine equiped with a full arsonal of deadly sharp or explosive things. Before I know it  I'm sprinting down the academy halls for my life.       As I'm hiding in my dorm room shaking with terror, I hear the screechy sound of a voice saying 'Come out and play!'. Then I see it. A metalic hand punch through the door(the end of me). As I see the robot I start lauhing and so does it.       Turns out the chase was all a prank. Alpha2.0 isn't deadly, it wanted to play. Alapha2.0 is a prank robot built by my friend Arnald. I just didnt know it would prank me.       Alpha2.0 is a robot that has many puposes. It can protect, carry things, drive, and many other things. And what I just had personal experiance with...pranking.       Tonight I am getting him back. I have already desined a robot to look like Arnald's biggest fear. A clown. So lock your doors Arnald, Clownbot1.2.3 is coming after you!

So they decided to build one. Then they started to build it. But they were really tired when  they were working. So when summer finished they new they will have to go to school. So they made a deal that when school is over they must come to work on the robot          When school started thy had to make one more pro-mas. So when they were going to enter school Mikel told Jose do not tell no one that we are making a robot. So they minded there business. So they did what they pro-mast. So they went to finish there homework. So when they finished there homework they went to work on the robot. So a few weeks later they were still not finished. So they kept working until they finished. But school was holding them back.          Then one day they had to stay in for after school because they didn't finish some homework.So they weren't able to work on the robot. so it has bin a year now and ti was going to be Jose's b-day. So Jose invited Mikel and some other people.So Jose was turning 18 years old. So they celebrated his b-day all night. But the next few we they finish school. So they join a school that is for working in NASA. So they joined because they wanted to learn how to build things.          So they were able to finish the robot and showed NASA. So they tested it and the robot was named it c-53.So they send c-53 to space to explore other planets.But the first planet was Neptune. So when robot came back it made lots of new discovery's. So they were remember  the robots.          Then they went and got a job at NASA and they will always work there and help any students to become a sienstest. So Mikel and Jose were remembered in NASA and they were homered in NASA.

Kylie was Elliot's older sister and she had to watch him while their dad was at work. 'Roberto isn't here, I saw him here yesterday.' 'Maybe, you should look harder!' shouted Kylie. Roberto was a robot Elliot tried to create with his mother. The robot was supposed to do  chores, care for people, and talk.       Elliot worked hard everyday to try and finish the robot. It was difficult for him, sometimes his dad or sister helped, but that was rarely. He wanted to finish the robot and make it a memory of his mother. Their mother had passed away in a car crash a few months ago.       Elliot was always having a hard time since she passed. He always thought that maybe the robot would help him. His dad and sister were no help. His dad was always at work because he had two jobs and they needed money, but when he was home, all he did was yell at Elliot and Kylie. Kylie always was in her room, probably on the phone or something because she was fifteen and was older that him by three years. She sometimes made him food when he was hungry, but he could tell she was also struggling without their mom.       Elliot was still looking for the robot and heard a noise. There was a thumping in the bathroom. 'Thump, thump thump.' He was afraid, but kept going toward the sound. He opened the door and was so surprised. There was the robot, standing two feet tall cleaning the bathroom. Roberto turned around and said,'Hehloo, Elliiiot. ' Elliot didn't answer, but just stood there staring at Roberto. Roberto did the same.       Elliot finally talked to Roberto. Roberto was very smart. He knew things from the past which Elliot had created him to do. When Elliot was sad because of his mother, Roberto always comforted him. Roberto did most of Elliot chores and cooked for his sister, his dad, and Elliot. The robot became Elliot's best friend.       Roberto helped Elliot through all of his difficult times. After three years had passed, Elliot didn't get as sad anymore. His father became more supportive and quit his jobs to work in one he liked and they paid him more, and his sister came out of her room a lot more. Elliot also could tell that she liked the robot because it made Elliot happy and she didn't have to cook anymore. The robot was a good memory their mother.

My labortories are covered with rejected projects and parts of robots I have never used. Many people believe I am no longer living, I have been working on my fixation so long. My house is quite pleasent, from the outsided, a bright, sunny yellow with multicoloredflowers dotting   my garden. But I can't my job is enjoyable, working in a muggy, dark basement 12 hours a day. But I am determined my newest model will turn out right. I have been working on it for 13 months, 16 days and 24 seconds. Although it is smaller than an apple, it is extremely powerful. For my robot is designed to do anything from getting something from a high shelf, to communicating, to exploding at a single code word. It looks like a small calculator, a light blue colour with a tiny microphone and speaker set, for commands. But there is just one problem. I have no way to power it up.          Maybe, if I could harness the suns ultraviolet rays, that would be enough power. Or be able to snatch lightning the moment in hits the earth. But the most garenteed answer would be to dig a deep trench, low enough I am able to see a churning, underground, river. I could set my little robot in there, and the water would hopefully be powerful enough to charge it. That's my other project. I have been digging for about 6 months and it is finally deep enough where I can see the river. I slowly walked up to it, my little blue calculator in my hand. I flung it hard, deep into the planet. I waited. And waited. Nothing but the sound of the river. I layer down flat on my stomach, and peered into the hole. I could just make out my robot, bobbing and twisting and turning. I sighed, disappointed. Just as I was waking away, I heard a small beep. Then another one, followed by faster clicking sounds. I sprinted back to the trench by my oak tree, and saw my robot had come to life!           Reaching down the deep, it sprung into my hands on legs it had apparently unfolded. I had done it! Now I could do anything! But just as I was running inside, a black car with darkly tinted windows showed up. A large, muscular man stepped out, and, wordlessly snatch my robot. I seethed with anger, 'give it back!' I shouted but the man just replied that, 'no citizen should have this amount of power. The government is taking it. We are going to send it into space. ' I was no longer mad. Just curious. 'Well, ok as long as it gets used.' The man stepped in the car and drove off. I stood there, dumbfounded, as I watched it increase speed. But wait! They had no idea what it could do! One wrong push of a button could send the in tire building sky high! I hopped in my little, solar powered car, and drove full speed down the street. Soon, I was caught up with      	PRP VBP VBN VBG IN PRP$ NN IN DT JJ CD NNP NNP VBZ VBP VBN IN JJ NNS CC NNS IN NNS PRP VBP RB NNP NNP NNS VBP PRP VBP DT JJR VBG , PRP VBP VBN VBG IN PRP$ NN IN NNP NNP NN VBZ RB JJ , IN DT VBN , DT JJ , JJ NN IN NNS VBG PRP$ NNP CC PRP MD RB PRP$ NN VBZ JJ , VBG IN DT NN , NN NN CD NNS DT NNP CC PRP VBP VBN PRP$ NN NN MD VB RP NNP NNP VBP VBN VBG IN PRP IN CD NNS , CD NNS CC CD NNP NNP PRP VBZ JJR IN DT NN , PRP VBZ RB NNP NNP PRP$ NN VBZ VBN TO VB NN IN VBG NN IN DT JJ NN , TO NN , TO NN IN DT JJ NN NNP NNP VBZ IN DT JJ NN , DT NN NN NN IN DT JJ NN CC NN VBD , IN NNP CC EX VBZ RB CD NNP NNP VBP DT NN TO NN PRP NNP NNP , IN PRP MD VB DT NNS VBP NNS , IN MD VB RB NNP CC VB JJ TO VB NN DT NN IN NNS DT NNP CC DT RBS JJ NN MD VB TO VB DT NN NN , JJ RB PRP VBP JJ TO VB DT NN , NN , NNP PRP MD VB PRP$ JJ NN IN EX , CC DT NN MD RB VB JJ RB TO VB NNP NNP POS PRP$ JJ NNP NNP VBP VBN VBG IN IN CD NNS CC PRP VBZ RB VB RB WRB PRP MD VB DT NNP NNP RB VBD RP TO PRP , PRP$ JJ NN NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN PRP RB , VB IN DT NNP NNP NNP CC NNP NNP CC DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NN IN JJ IN PRP$ NN , CC VBD IN DT NNP NNP MD RB VB RP PRP$ NN , VBG CC VBG CC NNP NNP VBD , NNP NNP IN PRP VBD VBG RB , PRP VBP DT JJ NNP NNP DT CD , VBN IN JJR VBG NNP NNP VBD RP TO DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN , CC VBD PRP$ NN VBD VBN TO VB .

They were still out hanging in the road walking to the beach to go take a swim. 'Guys i don't think this is a good idea.' Amber said scarcely. 'Oh, stop being a scary cat Amber.' rudely suggested by Mariee. As they walked down the road getting closer and closer to the beach. Robert shouted ' HEY!! Come look at this house i found!' Everyone hurried down the street and to the house once they got to it the all lined up in front of it. 'Maybe its a museum?' as Spencer confronted the crew. 'No its not.' said Catalina 'Lets just go check it out!' suggested Henry. As they proceeded closer to the building and went inside. They realized that is was the old abandon robot science observatory. 'This is like heaven but in a observatory!' Robert and Catalina said at the same time. 'Yo, this place was shut down.' Henry said. 'for what?' said Amber 'Didn't you hear the robots came to life' 'So nut true' Mariee claimed.       Thy were all just standing there when all of a sudden a little boy just pops out of no where and says 'Greetings I'm a robot, my name is Sprout-234, who are you guys?', 'Well, I'm Robert, and my friends are Henry, Spencer, Catalina, Mariee, and Amber.', 'Can you tell us more about you?', 'Sure Catalina, i was built by scientist to save people or as I say it I'm a rescue bot. i come with a lot of features like a camera, a walky talky, im really good at saving people but, for those of you who like robots that can talk head over there to my friend, Grouper, he talks to veterinarians and helps with animals. Well that was before we got shut down.', 'Well im staying here.' said Robert and Catalina. 'We'll meet up with you guys later.' said the rest of the crew. as they went on Mariee went off being adventurous and found another robot instead. 'Whoa! You scard me' she said. 'Are you the robot that can drive?' 'why yes, yes i am.' nice to meet you.' 'nice to meet you too tell me about your self .' well i can drive.' ohh kool. yeahh ' well ill meet up with you later i got to find my friends.' well ok.' so they all gathered up and talked about the amazing things they have learned. then they went home.

Mr.gemini-scout  is a remote controlled robot and does search and rescue work undeatr mines under ground.The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels.It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns,and even roll through water.The robot is small ,but it is strong.Gemini-scout carries food,water,and other supplies.It can even drag hurt people to safety.       Donte 2: dante 2 is a robot with and interesting job it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists,like a spider this robot has eight legs and climbs up steep walla it can stand the heat. When a  volcanoes is to dangerous  for a scientist do go into they send Donte 2 instead.Donte 2 looks for vents ,or holes,in a crater:Then the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the vents.In the past,scientists could not learn as much about volcanoes ,but Donte 2 is changing that.       MR.gower: is a robot that works and helps patients and brings thing to nurses and doctors.he looks like a small  cabinet nurses and doctors unlock him when they need things,not only does he work on long days but he also can talk he has been programed to say hundreds of phrases, for example, it can say (Calling elevator) or(Your delivery is here).Mr.gower  does work that doctors, phasitions,and nurses used to do.This allows them to focus on  other important tasks.       Agribots:An agribot is a robot that picks fruit it might pick berries,oranges,grapes ,or apples.Agribots are not yet widley used,but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do.Because picking strawberrys is different than picking an apple,agribots come in all kinds of shapes and sizes.Some have  giant arms that are towed behind trucks.Others are able to move around on there own. In japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can senc the color of the berries.This helps the robot know ehn each berry is ripe.               This article is about a few robots the world should know of onlyy some of these are used temporarily.

Well think again because know robot are know worknig! Robots Narrative Performance Task do alot of jobs.Robotys even explore volcanoes.         Robots also has a thermal camera to help it find miners.Thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.When robots finds the trapped miners,the miners can use its two-way radio to talk with the rescue team.         The robots was built to be easy yo use.Its remote control is the same one that is used for some video games. If you've ever played a video game, you may know how to use Gemini-Scout.                               sorry i could'en finish 	DT NN PRP VBD VBG VBD IN JJ PRP VBP IN NNS VBG IN DT DT NNP NNP VBP RB IN NN NN VBP RB JJ .

The scientist Andrew wondered if it have been stolen or it came to live and started to roll around.So Andrew went to go look around for it in the lab before the other scientist got there.Finally Andrew found it.The robot was in the experiment lab doing all kinds of different experiments.          Next,the robot saw Andrew and took off rolling away again.Then Andrew went off running for the robot and finally caught up and stopped him.So Andrew started to talk to the robot and said 'are you able to talk?' but the robot didn't reply so he asked again and then the robot said 'yes.' I cant believe your alive and can talk said Andrew.          Then, Andrew said 'we will keep this our secret and wont tell anyone now lets get you back in the office.' Then the robot replied and said 'okay.' So Andrew took him back to the office and the robot played as a fake robot again.The other scientists came in the office.One of scientists which was Albert saw the robot blink.Then Albert left with the other scientist but Albert ran back in and saw the robot gone!He wondered if it was remote controlled or it was just all magic.He looked all over the place for the robot and found the robot back in the office.             In conclusion, the robot just decided he will stay in the office no matter if they leave or not.So at the end Albert just gave up and went outside with the other scientist.But overall the robot wanted to leave but he never did.All of the scientist came back in and the robot was just standing there where he should be and smiling.

It all stared when I began going to shcool everyone would tell me I was nothing and the kids would tell me that it was true. And the kids would make fun of me for that to.I hated it so much I just got so upsit over it.I would stay up all night crying and I had no one to talk to.I felt so lonly and like I was nothing or no one.                Then when I entered 1st I met me best friend Jasmine Lopez and she was getting bullyed to. I knew how she felt so Iwanted to make feel like she was someone so I did my best and made her feel good about herself and she did the same for me and I was so happy that I made her happy.                                                 When we went into 4th the bullying  got really bad so bad that we were getting hit and Jasmine and I could not take it nomore so we got some help and the bullying just got really bad to the point they would come to your house and hit us.

I think this becuse i am not that interested in building these things.       But, something that cought my eyes was Erin Bregman said that if you think that robots are a thing of the future, that you should think again. i think you should beacuse robots do many things today in factories, hostpitals, and even schools because in schools now we have thing like smartboards in place of chalk boards. Some childern dont even know what a chalk board is to be honest.       I think honestly we shouldn't have robots in the future because i think it might get out of hand at times.

I got off my bed and started heading down stairs.  When I did I just heard a burst of people saying ' Surprize.' I just relized it was my birthday, everyone one remembered but I couldn't myself. My 2 best friends were here my Grandpa, Grandma, Mom, Dad, and everyone else I could think of. About &frac12; of the cake was done after we all at least took a slice out of it. After the cake we went straight to opening presents, but it was the same thing I get every year : a pair of socks, couple of video games, a huge book that would take me a year to finish, and a movie that I've seen a billion times. I thhoguht that was all, but at the last second when I was going back upstairs my mom took out a 5 foot and 5 inc wide robot.             This stunned me, it took me at least 10 sec to close my mouth again. I looked at and back at my mom. ' What can this thing do?' She replied back saying ' It's remote controlled and you can do anything you want with it.' I didn't say anything after that and just went straight outside in the neighbrohood to play some football with my friends. After a long day of running and laughing I went home. I got home and I saw the robot still standing there, I didn't say anything and went straight to my room. I watched some T.V and played some PS3 and went to sleep.            When I woke up there was something staring right at me, this freaked me out alot. I thought it was my brother because I still was sleepy from having a long day. I got my vision back and I noticed it was my robot I got yesterday. I was thinking that my mother put it up here so I can play with it. I looked at the robot and it looked at me, I was waiting for him to move, but I knew he was remote controlled. Right when I got up the robot asked me if I wanted something to eat. I sayed '  How are you...' Then the robot sayed he didn't need some foolish remote to controll him. This was probably the happiest day of my life. Now I had something to get me anything I wanted. I went straight to my mom telling her of what happened. She didn't believe me but I dragged her up stairs. When she got there the robot was gone.            She said ' stop playing with me I'm busy. I was confused, how can something so big get somewhere without anybody nowing. I was probably dreaming about it, but then I found his tracks leading outside. I followed them all the way until I saw it broken to pieces. I thought to myself and it was probably better that this happened so that I wouldn't become laziy forever.

Keep reading to find out what it was!       One day, I was in school during science when our teacher, Mr. Rick, told us that we were going to be crafting a home-made robot. Half of the class shrugged, and some did a silent cheer. I was not sure about my feelings about this, but I knew I had to get to work quickly. 'Class is dismissed.' said Mr. Rick. I was still thinking about our assignment and was beginning to get stresse out about it. The rest of the day went by quickly; we ate lunch, had Physical Education class, and then went home. When I got home, I told my mom to take me to a store called Home Depot. It's a really handy store that has everything you need. When we got there, I went into the building isle, with all the nuts and screws and stuff. I picked out all the tools and working materials that I needed to build this robot and went home. Since it was already late, I decided to build the robot later and went to bed. I had slight butterflies in my stomach, wondering how I will complete this big project. Wanting to get away from it all, I closed my eyes and went to sleep.       I woke up to the sound of my annoying alarm clock. The sun was just above the hills, and the sky was blue with a few clouds. I did the usual morning routine and headed to school. When I got there, my friends were standing in front of the gate and talking. Noticing me, they ran up and all asked the same question, 'Did you begin on your robot?' They all had baggy eyes and an expressionless face. I shook my head with grief. When the bell rang, we quickly went to class and began the lesson. It was another stressful day, but I survived it. When I got home, I began on my robot right away. It took all night to make, but it was definitely worth it. The finishing product looked like a short, colorful unicorn.

They went back to the lab and started putting the finishing touches on the brand new robot they have been working for almost ten years. They added new features on the robot and gave it a name it was known as the Deka16 the new features they added were that Deka16 was able to talk they also added a new mode called cleaning mode that means that if they had an accedint in the lab Deka would clean it up.           The robot still has some malfunction because its arm falls of sometimes if it over heats they are planning to send it out to the public soon but they have to make sure that the robot wont hurt any one and they still got to fix the malfunctions.The scientist wil try to make a built in air fan so it wont over heat like a laptop when it is turned on to long the moniter turns of then the whole laptop its self will turn of.       1 year later they have fixed all the malfunctions and they are ready to send it out to public but they have a problem they cant send it out unless its 2 years old because it cost to much and no one will be able to buy it they waited one year now the deka16 is out and they are selling the product.

His main focus was to get it done by the 19th of June,that way he could get it to the teacher for his project and it wont be late. That would give him at least two days to get it done. Before he went to bed, he wanted to make sure all his plans we secure. As the morning came, he stared working on the robot. He graded his bolts, screws, and tools. Finally he was done. He named his robot Nancy.                         He went to bed when all his work was finished. The only thing he didn't do was put the motor and speaker in. That night his mother went down stairs to put everything up, and take a quick look at the robot. She was amazed at what he had done. She put his motor and speaker on the robot and went up stairs for bed. That night he woke up and heard glass breaking and doors slamming. He went down stairs,and he saw his robot in full action. He ran up stairs and got his mother. He asked 'Why is my robot moving and talking!' 'All I did was put your stuff away, and put your motor and speaker next to your robot.' his mother said. 'Did you put it next to my robot or on it.' he said calmly. 'I put it on it.' his mother said getting out of bed and running down stairs. As they were trying to stop the robot, Dan realized that he put an on and off switch on the robot. 'Distract Nancy while I turn her off.' His mom was distracting Nancey. Dan turned her off. He didn't know that once he turned her off he would never be able to turn her on again.                                              As he was going to school, he was thinking of a good way to tell the teacher what happened. He walked into the classroom, and he was the only one without a robot. He went up to the teacher and said,'My robot broke it turned on,and broke everything on ascendent.' 'Well all I have left to do is give you a zero.' his teacher said. Dan walked away with disappointment. He got called up to the office. When he was there Mrs.Taylor handed him a huge thing that had a sheet over it. He was walking back to his class. When he got there he pulled the sheet off of the huge thing. It was the robot, Nancy. He went up to his teacher and showed him the robot. He told Dan to present it to the class. He was scared that it might not turn on and it might mess up like it did at his house. As he turned the switch to on excitement filled the room. It turned on! He continued on with presentation. Luckly he got a 100%.

He was a smrt robot and never got distracted. He never took his eyes off the road when the kids in the back were fighting.          The next morning he came in and was grumpy. He was mad about something he said he wanted to leave this horrible place.  The whole family was crying because that robot was attached to their hearts they couldn't let them go. Sam broke free and he left without saying goodbye.

He started with how he acted. Dr. Nevlin was a young man and he was overall nice. So he thought that his robot would be kind and generous. So he began thinking of names and these are the name he came up with :       The terminator The inator The Nevlinator.           Then he finally figured it out His new robots name is going to be The Nevlinator. So he stood up from the table to finish his new and approved robot. As soon as he put his last touches on the robot the robot woke up.             'The Nevlinator at your services sir',the robot spoke out.            I might as well test it out and see its abilities, Nevlin thought.             ' Nevlinator will you go give me the screwdriver from at the top of the stair case?'Dr. Nevlin asked the robot.            'The Nevlinator at your services sir', The robot shouted.            Then as the robot climbed up the stairs grabbed the screwdriver off the stair case Nevlin was amazed. Then he thought, He climbs, talks, carries, what else should he be able to do?. So Nevlin thought that The Nevlinator could help him at work. Nevlin works at a store as big as Criegs cruisers. After a big day of work Nevlin put The Nevlinator to bed, tucked him in then Nevlin went to sleep.            'UP, UP', The robot yelled as the alarm went off.            Nevlin woke up to a jumping and noisy robot. That's not gonna be a good day for him. So Nevlin went to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. When he walked in the kitchen he wanted to scream. The floor was covered in coffee. He turned to give the robot the stink eye but the robot was gone.             So instead he screamed 'let's go', The Nevlinator followed. They got in the car Nevlin in the drivers seat and the robot in the backseat ( for safety). As they pulled in the parking lot of Chuck 'e' cheese the robot saw Chuck, the mouse waving to people as they walked in the place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        'What am I gonna do here?'asked the robot               'Help me!'yelled Nevlin.               They both got out the car and walked/rolled to the door as Chuck stared at the robot. The robot got scared and rolled back to the car. Then Nevlin thought of something and drove back home. They ran in the house and Nevlin turned The Nevlinator off and thought that this wasn't gonna work. Then Nevlin stopped making robots and stuck to working and getting paid.

But, because they could help us when we are hurt then we could possibly have them. In my opinion I think we shouldn't have them. If you have ever watched the movie I Robot then you would probably think the same thing. What happens is the robots are trainded to help humans ,but then one robot turns bad and starts to control the rest of the robots by reprograming them. The robot programs the other robots to destroy humans. If you think of it this could realy happen if we decide to build robots and have them walk around our citys.             ____          ____                 I        I        I        I               I   O  I        I   O  I              I____I        I____I                                                                                                                                                                                                           U              \ ___________/                                                                      I     Robot            One day there was a litle boy named Miqale playing Wuffle Ball in the street with his friends. His team was wining 6 to 4, and it was the bottem of the 3rd inning, and two men on base. Miqale hits a foul ball to left field. Left Field in the street was the trash can by old man billy's house. The bal hit the trash can and knocked it over then the bal rolled into the suige drain. Jonny the left fieder said i got it but he couldn't fit so they called Miqale cause he was the smallest won out of the gang. He climed down in there and he looked up and there was a robot.

The eyes started to scan the messy work area and organized all parts from small to big.   I showed the robot to the science academy in San Francisco . The press were amazed by the work it can do. A scientist wanted to known more about the robot. The robotic human can teach school subjects can organize objects and work with anything or anyone. The scientist asked if he can borrow my robotic human. I told him why. The scientist wants to make copies for the world to help with the goverment and the citisens. I said yes. I also told him I was going to show the president of the United States of America. As soon as i entered the White House, The president said to have the scientist make copies of the robot and make the world better with robots. Later the president built me a statue for making humans and robots live together.That was my story of my robot.

Now lets see what it can do. Flying, check, walking, check, And lazers, check. Now go get me a soda robot 520!' 'Yes sir' the robot said. 'MMMM thats a good soda' he said while drinking his soda. 'Now go get me some pizza'. 'Ok' the robot said in a techy voice. 'May i have a slice' the robot murmmerd. 'No you are just some stupid robot who should follow my orders' he said while eating pizza. The robot then walked away and just stood there in silence.             'The morning is here' Mr. DingleHimor said while stretching. Then the robot wasnt in Mr. DingleHimors lab. He called out 'Robot 520 where are you!' Then he soon heard a loud BOOM! outside of his lab. Mr. DingleHimor soon went outside to see what what happening. Then there he saw robot 520 10 times the size he used to be! 'He must have got my size changer posion from my lab' he said to himself.            Mr. DingleHimor saw robot 520 destroying cars and buildings. He was a monster!            So Mr. DingleHimor went back into his lab and was crying like a little baby because he was so scared. But then he started to remember that he has a potion that can make you small, but for robot 520 it would make him his normal size because he was large already.            So he snatched the potion and ran straight outside of his lab. Then put his shoes on and sprinted outside to find robot 520. He soon found him in the middle of the street. Then he soon saw his friend Mason in his large hand and was squeezing him like a tomato. Mason was a professer like Mr. DingleHimor was, but Mason was a lot more nice then Mr. DingleHimor.            Then Mason called out ' Dingle!' that was his nickname for Mr. DingleHimor. ' Come help me!' 'OK!' he said. 'Now robot 520 no need to hurt him hes a nice guy' he said in a scared voice. 'Never! you called me a stupid robot!' the robot called out. 'I didnt meaan that, now just drink this and everything will be ok I promise I will treat you like my best friend, and Mason can come hang out with us to' as he called out. 'Ok just hand me the potion and i will drink it' he said while dropping Mason. As he drank it he began to shrink into his normal size and evrything was ok.            Then soon after that they all just had a great time and were all friends.                                                                                         	RB , PRP$ NN VBZ VBN .

But these robots are not just chunks of metal. They are very realistic and have human and animal qualitys.           These robots help people when they cant get the job done. For example Dante 2, researches volcanoes when scientists cant. It collects information, and goes into volcanoes. Another good example is Mr gower. Mr Gower helps out in hospitals. It delivers medicine to nurses and doctors when patients are sick. It can go in to elevators and make turns to get around objects.        Thease are all great quality's of robots, but is it safe? Will robots take over everything ? Is the next generation going to be all about robots and will humans not have to do anything anymore? If we continue to find uses for robots will we have any work to do? In my opinion i think it is dumb for people to use robots to do everything for them. why cant people pick their own berries and fruit? is the whole world going to revolve around robots?

873	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	650469	6	11087750	Y	55103	            It all started at the science lab with the rookie scientists. They were sitting in their chairs ready to experiment with the new robot their boss had created. The robot was not meant to come alive. All he was meant to do was sit there and look good for the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois.             Okay, back to the story. So there were these rookie scientists who had no clue how to work with robots. They were just supposed to fix up the nooks and crannies in the robot's outside frame. Those were the directions from the head scientist, Lenny.             Lenny was the meanest guy you could ever meet. He was only about five feet tall with a beard taller than he was. He only had one tooth but he was the best living scientist. He was in the newspaper even in Djibouti.             The rookie scientists had no idea what to do with this robot so........ they started playing with it. They laughed because they were actually having fun. They pretended that the robot was alive. They pretended that the robot was a puppet and they had a puppet show (he was the only character in the puppet show). And, they may or may not have pressed a few buttons.......           'What is all that racket,' Lenny asked as he scurried in to the lab.           'N-n-nothing sir,' said Billy (one of the scientists).           'Yep, absolutely nothing!' Exclaimed Bob (the other scientist)           'Alrighty then. You guys get your butts back to work, or I'll whip y'all,' Lenny remarked.          'YES SIR!!!!' Screamed Billy and Bob synchronized.          Lenny bobbled out of the room on his short and stubbly legs and walked and walked down the pin strait hallway until his shadow vanished.          Billy and Bob started to close up when they heard a strange noise coming from where the robot was sitting on the table.         'Did you hear that?' asked Billy.         'Well I sure did,' responded Bob         They shuffled over to the table but everything was just normal. They checked the electrical wires all over the robot. Everything was just fine. They checked the outside of the robot. Just fine. They even took the whole robot apart to check the 'brain' of the robot (like I mentioned before, these scientists are just rookies so they have no idea what to do). Everything was just fine.         'Well Billy, I don't see nothing wrong with this robot here, but I do know that we better get a move on. It's gettin' really late'        'I agree, lets get out of here'          They turned around and left the building safe and sound, and as quiet as a mouse. Well, not quite....           Not quite.           As soon as that door slammed shut behind Billy and Bob, everything started to get BAD.          Bad.        The robot that was sitting on the table right next to the window sprung up from the table and started, well, he kind of started dancing. He looked like he belonged in a boogie parlor. He did every possible dance move there was.... from the sprinkler to the worm. He was having a lot of fun. He danced and danced and danced until the morning when the rookie scientists came into work.....          Their mouths dropped open.          They went crazy when they saw the robot. Billy dropped to the floor and started crying because he knew he had done something wrong and that he was going to get in A LOT  of trouble. Bob just started dancing with the robot as if he didin't have a care in the world.          Just then, Lenny came running in....        'WHAT IN THE NAME OF SAM HILL ARE YOU WEIRDOS DOING!!!!!!!!!!'        Nobody said a word. They all just stood there in silence.       'WELL, IF NONE OF Y'ALL ARE GONNA SAY SOMETHING, I'M GONNA HAVE TO EXECUTE THIS ROBOT!!!' Screamed Lenny.              'No Lenny No! Please don't hurt him, he's our friend!' Said Bob.        'Ok, but whatever this thing is doing, it better be gettin' outta' here soon!' protested Lenny.        'That will be just fine' said Billy.       'Okay nerdheads, you may take him home,' said Lenny.         From that day on, Billy and Bob still have the Robot in their house doing normal people things. They all lived happily ever after.

One soggy, misty night Franky a twelve-year old braniac was sitting in his room making a robot. Not just any robot but one that could sing and dance just like Micheal Jackson! 'My robot is complete!' Exclaimed Franky.       Now, what Franky planned to do with his robot that he named: Micheal Jackson II was to show him to Rock records one of the most famous record companies in the world at the time, and have Micheal Jackson II tour around the world dancing and singing for all the countries in the world to make money for Franky! 'Tomorrow we are heading L.A. to show you  to Rock records!' said Franky excitedly.       And before you knew it Franky snuck out of his house and was on a non-stop flight to L.A. with Micheal Jackson II! ' I am so excited!'shouted Micheal Jackson II as they boarded the plane.(i know what you are thinking, wouldn't it be kind of weird to see a robot in a airport? well everybody thought it was weird but Franky got permission from Rock records to come to L.A. to show them Micheal Jackson II)As soon as they got on the plane Franky emmediatly fell asleep because he knew that there was a long day ahead of them.       As soon as they got to L.A., they took the first cab they saw to Rock records. They arrived at Rock records at about 5 o'clock sharp. Both of the boys walked in and were amazed by how fancy everything was in there. Then the boys were greeted by a welcoming shout. 'HEY BOYS!! Are you Micheal Jackson II? asked the bald, fat short man that was staring straight at Micheal Jackson II. 'Why yes i am.' said Micheal Jackson II boldly. 'Well, show us what you got!' Said the fat man. Two seconds later, Micheal Jackson started killing the dance floor singing smooth criminal and doing the moonwalk! Then the fat man said with his fat rolls hanging out: 'Will you please work for me and travel around the world doing what you just showed me?' Then the room became quiet and Michael Jackson II said: 'Why not?' And in the blink of an eye Micheal Jackson II's career was under way. 'I'm so proud of him!' Whimpered Franky in the back of the room.       'Ok we are going to Djibouti in Africa for your first live performance and the show was sold out so you better impress them.' Said the fat man smiling. And before you could say: honey i shrunk the kids the first performance begun. The croud  loved Micheal Jackson II, but there was a problem  just as Micheal Jackson II was walking off stage  there was a big puddle and he sliped the old robot who had made it so far was broken.       So Franky was sent home crying and started building another robot. This robot's name was Elvis Presley II who could dance and sing just like Elvis Presley. And Before you knew it Elvis Presly II and Franky were on the first flight to L.A.                                                                To be continued.......

He was planning that the robot would be a combination of  all the robots ever made combined.              The boy was in his room when he was interrupted by his mother. 'Honey come down and help me make a cake for tomorow's celebratioin. Mom I can't I am about to finish Kenny... umm I mean the robot.' The mom comes through Arthur's door and says, 'Honey don't tell me you already named the robot you don't even know if it's going to work. Mom I am one-hundred percent sure it will work, trust me. Ok, but if it does not work don't come crying to me.' She leaves to then kitchen to check on the cake.

The first one is Gemini-Scout.It is a romote-controlled robot. It works in the miners room by collecting all the samples of the air inside the miners room.It takes a glass that has a cap for it then it swings it without letting go from the bottle and then the robot puts the cap on it to secure the air.The robot is small but it is really strong because, of  his iron strong arms.It can also go up stairs and down stairs and make tight turns on like the side walk of the tight turns.

In my opinion I just adore the idea of robots. They're so interesting to learn about.                    First off, the genetic engineering of robots contains a lot of parts. Parts that are so small that you can lose them without a doubt. After you put the parts together you have to make it work and turn on. Our future as we speak is getting harder and harder by the minute. We need to have some sort of machine that helps people through there day to day lives. Then that's when robots come in handy.                       If you think your job is challenging imagine thousands of robots all over the world doing the job that millions of people do! While people are relaxing and taking the day off robots are working as hard as they can trying to please you. We can even give them names so that we can make them fell better. The better you are to the robots the better they are to you. The perfect name for the robots would be the NSS national saving service. With every robot you have you get to chose their name like Tom,Kaylee,Mike, or any name you want.              If you want a search and rescue kind of robot the robot you'd want would be the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under the ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it can ever roll through water. The robot is small but it is strong. Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies. It can even drag hurt people to safety.             If you want a smarty pants robot then you would want Dante 2. Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. Like a spider, this robot has eight legs. This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano. It is also built to survive very high heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for      scientists to enter, Dante 2 goes instead.                   If you are interested in a robot that works in a hospital then Mr. Gower is the robot for you. Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed.                 If you want a robot that picks fruit then an agribot is the robot for you. An Agribot is a robot that picks fruit. It might pick berries, grapes, oranges, or apples. Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks.Others are able to move around on therie own. In Japan, there is a strawberry picking robot that can sense the color of the berries. This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe. 	DT NNP NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT NN NNS IN JJ NNS .

So Robert went to see what it was when he got there he saw a robot. Robert moved the robot to see if it worked but nothing happen. when Robert was about to leave the robot open his eyes and got up.       Robert looked back and saw the robot standing so then Robert went up to it and stared at it.The robot asked Robert 'whats your name' Robert told him. So then Robert asked the robot 'whats your name' the robot told him 'i don't have a name'.So Robert named him Huey.Robert took Huey home and played all day long Robert was so happy he found Huey.       After they where done playing Robert went inside to do his homework  Huey helped Robert did his homework.After Robert was done they went to sleep and then when they woke up Robert went to school and took Huey with him. Robert didn't want to leave Huey at home so he took him with him and all his friends went up to him 'Robert who is that robot' Robert said 'its my best friend Huey'.       Robert went straight to class all his friends where following him because of Huey. After class Robert went to lunch with Huey and only Huey. Robert was annoyed at his friends because they kept on following everywhere. So then lunch ended and Robert went to his other class witch was Math. Huey was great at math.       So Robert finished School and went walking ho,e with Huey. Robert was glad school was over because all his friends annoyed him. So they where walking home it was hot outside. They stopped and got some ice cream after that they got home and played again. So after they where done playing Robert was so tired. He went inside took a shower then he ate something and then they both went to bed and Robert and Huey became best friends.

A day that suddenly came true. That day I would never forget was a robot. It was a normal day like any other day until it happened. I heard my friend shouting that somthing crashed in the woods. When we got to the woods. There was a pod shaped like a cacoon.There was a robot with 4 arms, 4 eyes and 2 legs.The robot seemed nice so we introduced ourselves. He really like me the most because I was the first one to introduced myself. After 2 days with him we found out that he was a great builder. He can build anything under 1 minute. One day we were sitting on the bench hanging out. when I said to him what planet is he from he just kept quiet. Finally he said good bye and headed toword the woods. I knew exactly what he was doing. I wave to him saying good bye. I saw him fixing the pod and flew up. So to this day I always look up on the deck hoping I would see him again.

So one day he went to the junk yard and got a lot of wires and stuff like that to make a robot. Once he was done getting all the stuff he needed he went to his lab and started drawing out ideas and models for his robot. He has designed the robot that he wanted. He started building his robot from all the stuff he got. Once he was done he fliped the  switch and try to makeit come alive but it didnt come alive. so he kept flipping the switch on and off until it came on but it never came on. So instead he opened the window and it was raining and there was lighting outside. Right when he opened the window lighting went right away to the robot and the robot came to life.The robot has 8 legs so its call robot spider. it can do 8 things at once which is pretty cool. It can talk to you whenever you call its name it just comes to you. And it has wheels to move around.

Becky arrived at the museum workers were remodeling the place.  They had all kinds of things everywhere on the ground, on chairs , and on rails.  Becky asked them 'Excuse me but what are you guys doing?' One of the workers told her 'We are adding new things to the museum and today will be the grand opening.' Becky was really pumped up. Maybe two and a half hours had past when Becky saw a big crowd of people.  Becky hurried over to see what was going on. then she saw a big short man in a white suit with a microphone.  Becky new it was time for the grand opening. The man said 'Welcome everyone to our grand opening of  SKY HIGH!' Everyone was totally excited.  As soon as the curtains went up everyone went in with such excitement. Becky went on in and started seeing all these fabulous items in all different sizes and colors.  Becky went for walk inside to see what she could find. She probably walked half way through went she saw the most marvelous object that caught her attention. It was Steve Jones as a model , he was Americas best sky diver, he was Beckys hero. Becky asked 'How did you guys make him like that? And they told her 'He is a robot , but don't worry he all he does is light up and says his famous catch phrase once in a while.' That totally surprised Becky , but she was okay with that.  Becky was getting hungry so she decided to get some food.  She went to the McDonald that was inside the museum. All of sudden Steve Jones started to move. She thought she was just imagining things , but when she turned around he was moving and he started to talk. Becky was speechless. She wanted to run but she couldn't she was still as a rock and silent like a feather.  Steve Jones started to move and speak. Beckys dream finally came true , to meet Steve Jones, well her dream kinda came true she met the robot not the human , but she didn't care it was close enough. Becky didn't know what to do , there were a lot of thoughts going on in Beckys mind.  Becky started to climb up the rail so she can help Steve Jones get out of the rail and on the stand he was standing on. Steve Jones thanked Becky for letting him out. Becky told Steve ' No problem.' Becky had second thoughts of letting him out. Becky told Steve 'Okay Steve listen here , you are a robot so that means that I am in charge not you , okay?' 'Okay.' Said Steve Jones. Becky took Steve Jones to the gift shop to buy some things that will hide all the gadgets , screws , and queismos that were on Steve Jones.  Steve Jones didn't like that idea so he dug his heels in the ground so that he would not be able to move. No matter how hard Becky tried to move or to convince him to go to the gift shop , he would not move. Until Becky got the brilliant idea to go find all the magnets she could in the museum. She found 12,570 magnets in all different sizes , colors , and shape. She put those 12,570 magnets together and ended up with a gigantic magnet , she put that in front of her , the magnet got a good grip on Steve Jones , and as soon the magnet got a grip on Steve, Steve started laughing out of controll. Becky thought to herself if this tickles him then maybe i can brive him. Becky started to say to Steve 	CD NN DT NN VBN NNP VBD TO VB DT NN TO VB TO DT NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN NNS VBD VBG DT NNP NNP VBD DT NNS IN NNS RB IN DT NN , IN NNS , CC IN NNP NNP VBD PRP JJ PRP CC WP VBP PRP VBZ VBG .

Bill was just a miner like the others, but Bill had a robot arm. Bills robot arm got him the nickname Cyber. Cyber was mining in the Marcelline Mines, a mine rumored to have diamonds and rubies in it's depths, and got a call from the head of the Diamond Miners Mining Company, Mr. Gremlin.'Cyber,' Mr. Gremlin said,'I have a proposal for you and I need you down here quickly.' So Cyber went quickly to the Diamond Miners building and found Mr. Gremlin's office. 'Sit down Cyber,' Mr. Gremlin said, 'I was wondering if you wanted to have a promotion.' Cyber replied,' Yes please sir, but what is this promotion?' Mr. Gremlin stared out the tall glass window of his office. 'We need you to deep into Turnover Mines.'               'The Turnover Mines!' Cyber exclaimed, Those mines are the most fragile mines in the world!' Mr. Gremlin sighed, 'I know, but we need a group of people to go into the mines to search for gold to fund the company.' Cyber thought for a moment and replied, 'Whats in it for me?' Mr. Gremlin was quick to reply, 'Five percent of the treasure you find is yours.' 'I'm in.' Cyber said, and then Cyber left the office to go home and rest for his big day tomorrow.                  The next day Cyber went to the Turnover mines with ten other miners. Mr. Gremlin wished them good luck and they went down deep into the mines. On there way down, they saw a rusty Gemini Scout 1.9. Two of the miners were looking at it when it sprung to life. Unprepared, the two miners jumped backward, knocking over a large boulder. 'No!' Cyber and the other miners exclaimed as the boulders crushed the two miners an blocked their way back.                 The remaining miners sat in a circle wondering what to do when they heard a small electrical hum. The Gemini Scout! The robot, everyone knew, had a built in radio that could be used to contact the outside! The Gemini Scout had also brought a rock tumbling down. Cyber quickly grabbed the Gemini Scout and ran deeper into the mines. Cyber ran until he couldn't run anymore. When he looked around he saw a miner collapsed on the floor. 'Are you okay?' Cyber asked. The miner didn't respond, he was dead. Cyber quickly turned on the radio said one word, 'Help.' The Gemini scout watched Cyber collapse. Cyber was still breathing, but unconscious. Cyber awoke suddenly and looked around. He was in a hospital. 'About time you woke up' Mr. Gremlin said,'good work.' Cyber looked at him in a confused look and Mr. Gremlin said, 'That Gemini Scout of yours not only brought you to safety, but brought up two million dollars worth of gold. Cyber and his Gemini Scout were on the news and newspapers for three months. Cyber still got promoted and went into dangerous mines. Cyber always brought that Gemini Scout with him for the rest of his life.

Her job is to hunt lost things, dead things, or broken things. Her world will change after she finds something she thought she would never find.   The Meeting      I was running out of time when I here something behind me. I turned to see Kate standing behind me.      'Hi, you're late.'      ' I know. Had 'too' much homework.'      ' Sorry, let's go.'      We ran until we met up with the other Finders.We turned a corner and there he was standing there with a dead rat. Luke turned and threw the rat to Kate, his sister, who filed it  as killed in action.       ' You girls are just on time.'       'Yay us' yelled Kate.       ' Where is everyone else?' I asked.       ' On the mission we put them on, why?'       ' Help!'       ' Who was that?'     ' Not me.' yelled Kate. We looked around, but couldn't find anybody all we found was a robot that s been dead for so long I can't remember how long ago it died all I remember is that was my first mission, but now I'm the going to be the next leader.      The Awakening        At my house I heard a howl and thought it was my dog, but then I remembered my dog was at the groomers. I look around my room where I was finishing my homework, then I looked in the kitchen, and heard the howl again and turned to the door. There it was again. I look through the crack  in the door. There was Kate and Luke. I opened the door and automatically asked what was wrong. The said that Peri, my sister, was intured. This was her fist mission I knew I shouldn't of assigned such a hard mission for he rshe's only 10.         ' She's around back. She's the one making the howling noises.'         ' Thanks.'                      Help!          Peri and I get to the meeting on time in our teleporter.Kate runs up and says that Peri's first mission was success. She said that without Peri getting hurt someone else would of died. I looed at Peri and gave her a thumbs up. Kate also told me they had found a lifelike robot of me. 'Emily it even feels human. Are you sure you don't have a twin?' I shook my head and looked at hte robot. I poked it and it said 'Who's there?' Kate says ' Oh it can't be not you.' 'What ' I say.' you are the one who saves robots you're the seeker.'says Kate.                              Look Out !' Wow' I said,'That can't be true.I mean I'm just Emily not a Seeker, Emily.' 'Then explain how you just woke up that robot.' says Kate.                                 Goodnight Forever?   'I ran away from sme man that just tried to shoot me with a crossbow tell me whats happening?' I said  in a scared voice.' Oh no. Charlie knows. He will try to kill you every chance he gets. For now just stay in the headquaters.' Later that night I snuck out of haedquaters and am now dead.

All the universe is in jeopardy, in jeopardy of a robot named Tootles. Who will be the valiant hero of all and all within?       It all started one day when a young boy of the age of twelve went to school. Chris disliked school and often skipped class or made lame excuses about illness. But today was different, his mom made him attend school and he couldn't come up with any severe, hospital worthy disease. Chris picked up his worn tattered book bag and went to the bus stop, his mother keeping an eye on him. Finally when the bus arrived, Chris got on and sat as close to the back of the bus as he could.       They arrived at another stop and two large boys with sun glasses and 'gold' necklaces around their necks got on the bus and sat beside Chris. It was Harry and David, the meanest kids ever (at Chris's knowledge) to attend St. Carmichael's. Whenever Chris did go to school, these two would always pick on him. For some strange reason, for the rest of the bus rode, they didn't do anything rude or selfish to Chris.       Once they got to school and they disembarked the hunk of yellow metal, Harry and David put their arms around Chris and said,'Chris, we realized that we have been bullying you for a while now and we want to apologize. We also decided to make you our friend.' At this Chris was scared but thought about what they said, and decided that it would be OK. But this decision of Chris's was unintelligent for he hadn't developed a sense of sarcasm due to the large amount of school skipping he had done over the years. So when Chris agreed to what they said, David mentioned to Harry something Chris didn't hear. Harry said,' Sure David. Hey Chris, since you're our friend now, you need to go through a test that proves your worthiness of our friendship.' Again Chris thought and agreed to it. They picked him up, and carried him off to an unused janitors closet. They then tied him up and threw him on an overturned bucket. They both shouted in unison,'See ya lata' sucka',' shut the door and left! And then Chris thought,'Dang it!'       While Chris was insulting himself for being such a numskull, a huge hole suddenly opened in the floor. All of his bindings flew upward as he fell down in the bright tunnel. It went straight down. Chris was just falling, falling, falling, falling, and falling. The drop never ended. It might have been easily an hour before he slowed down a lot it seemed and the tunnel curved out to the side. A flap opened and he tumbled out of the tunnel, and onto the hard land before him.       Then there was a huge explosion in front of him, a rock disintegrated, then another, then another. No, he was just imagining, his hard fall made him woozy. Chris gathered his bearings and observed his surroundings. Flat dusty land stretched on forever it seemed. Sharp jagged rocks stuck out of the ground. In the distance there was a tall tower that seemed futuristic almost and so did the landscape. Nothing could have been to weird though, it was only the winter of 2396, or was it?       Immediately he made a plan to head to the tower, for that was the first sign of civilization. Hours later he arrived at the tower and before he entered, he heard a kind of wincing, he walked over and saw a creature with red liquid coming out of one of its ligaments. Chris reached his arm out to touch it and it was soft, like human flesh. Chris had just broken the number one rule of artificial intelligence robotic humans, DO NOT TOUCH HUMANS OR HUMAN BELONGINGS. Chris felt his code glitch up. The human was wounded, his body juices were low, according to his sensors. He assisted the human. Once the human was recovered fully, he pulled out what seemed to be a weapon of some sorts and hit Chris with it.       Everything went black, he couldn't see....hear....,'my world is gone,' he thought,'goodbye.'

He is less than two feet tall and and has wheels . he can find miners under groung with a thermal camera. A thermal camera is a heat sensor camera that finds living things. he Gets the miners to saftely by draging injured people, bring food, water and a two-way radio to talk with the rescue crew.   The Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job. He gets to climb up volcanoes to gather information for scientist. this robot reminds some people of spiders because of their legs. this robot has eight legs. this helps it climb the steep walls of the volcanoe.

That flaw was constantly running through his head. That flaw was the fact that FR-322 was a robot. He wanted a soul, he wanted feelings, he wanted, life. FR-322 could save trapped people like Gemini-Scout, he could walk on walls like Dante 2, he could even sing and dance like HRP-4c. He was a very special robot.                       FR-322 felt used because he did not get credit when he saved trapped miners or went into a volcanoe for research. The humans got all the credit. But why? Did they do a good job sitting and watching? Then FR-322 realized something, he did not have to be treated this way. He could design a robotic human and download his memory into the robot. from then on he would be called Luc-B.

I was asleep on a Friday night until I heard a loud noise. It seemed to come from downstairs. When i got up and went down to check, I turned on the light and suddenly saw a robot in front of me! At first I got scared but then I thought it was really cool! Also, it started talking to me! I wasn't dreaming for sure. The robot and I sat down and talked about why and how he got to my house. He told me that he saw that the window was a little open so he opened it. I was still confused on why he came to my house. He explained that he came from a machine and that now he is like a real person, except he's a robot! This robot said he came to my house because it was the first house he saw with a window opened. He is able to do a lot of things that normal people can do. I named him Bob and now he lives with my family and I.

He was shocked but immediately convinced himself that he did it and took the rewards. What he doesn't know was that he had nothing to do with it. It was marvelous, oh so marvelous but... Not everyone was convinced. They ignored his praise and found more interesting things to do. At first it was a miracle, It walked, talked, could do everything s human could, it even had emotions. Some saw it great others were in fear. No one really learned how it happened, but it was quite strange.       It was his birthday, he was turning 10. his father wanted to but his mother said they couldn't afford it. They got him a broken one instead and told him 'Don't be sad know when you fix it you'll know how to make more!' That was a lie. He hated them for it. getting him junk but, found curiosity took him over. He started working on it his parents almost sad knowing that it was missing too many parts to ever work. The boy was able to read about them and found the parts he was missing, well make-shift versions anyway. He tried everyday, but with no luck. He even got his parents to help seeing how badly he wanted it to work. After 5 more days, he gave up. He was planning on throwing it away but when he tossed it in the trash, the unthinkable happened. A single bolt of lightning came down and hit the robot. The boy screamed and ran home in shock but, stopped himself when he heard a noise. As he tuned he saw. The robot was working! He was so startled, but how? did the shock of electricity start the battery? He had no idea but his parents came towards him thinking he got hit, only to find him crying in joy. It was named Tom for his deceased brother.       He was so happy and was even able to activate the voice. He told everyone and eventually the media found out. The next week front page was labeled: April 15th, 2257 Young boy Makes talking robot out of scrap that can talk. He was given an award for youngest inventor and never mentioned the lightning. Eventually The robot and him were on TV and they found that Tom had emotions. Tom was brought into a lab to be studied and they found the makeshift parts and cracked up. The boy had used the joints from toys he had to make the arms work. Tom was famous but then there 15 minutes of fame ended (not to say they were only talked about for 15 minutes, it was almost 7 months before people stopped caring about Tom, i meant 15 minutes in a figure of speech). Tom also could do a lot more than humans could like run faster, withstand colder and hotter temperature, and he had 26 more joints than humans so he easily moved plus he never got tired. Eventually Tom was Lost while being sent to see if Earth was finally safe for humankind to return too. The last thing he every was seen doing was Passing the moon and right as Earth came into view, They lost communication. Some say Tom just came out of range, some say someone didn't want to ever find out if we can return to Earth but mainly i believe, That Tom didn't want them to see what really happened to Earth, so he cut communications. Tom was lost forever and the boy once again, 11 now was without a friend.

Also this is a story about the nanny bot and how she became Abby's,Tyler's,and Rj's nanny. She way she was made is by the owner telling her what he or she wants to happen in the house like if she wants the dishes to be washed or the kids bed madebut they cant tell them to do anything dangers.            So one day when Mrs.Franco called the compney and said'Hello I need a super awsome nanny bot that is nice and good with kids and also i need it here in 3 days please thanks have a good day bye.' and in three day she was there in a a big box and when we opened it it came out saying 'hello in Flo nice to meet you.'            She was pretty she was kind of like neon blue color and like 6 feet tall and had a smille .My mom said back 'Hey Flo I'm Elizabeth and thers are my kids Abby Tyler and Rj.'                I was the littles and younges and only girl so I asked her what she can do she said that she could go shopping and just by looking at you she would know your size. She could she could also be in extrem heat like if there was a fire she could come and save you. She could cook any thing from chocolate chip pancakes to home made cookie dow ice cream.            Then she said to never touch her off butten of she would like die like a human she would die and never come back to life is if her back up batter works and that like always happens.but some time it dose not turn back on and then she would never come back to life.  EVER AND EVER!!!!!!!!!             So then mom left for work and we were left with Flo and so my brothers and I went off to play outside so as we went to get are swetters we herd 'NOOOOOOOOOOO you stay here with me and you never leave you mom dont know this but i and takeing over the WORLD!!!!!             The world I siad why 'Because us Robots never get respect for what we do for you humans and we do alot.If I take over the world and have you as my partnes then I could have every thing I need to get respect and all the times we have been slaves to you then you can be slaves to me.'said Flo.'But Flo what will happen to us my brothers and I?' I said 'yes what will happen to us?'said Tyler and Rj .Flo said 'You three will be ok and you mom to your family will be the only family I will like because you are the first family i have ment.'                So my brother and I went in to action.We said 'We are tired can we go take nap wall you make us a sandwitch.' so we all when in to my room and though of a awesome plan that was foil prof and threety minuts later we went back downstars.                And we kicked her butt we took her down and I got to hit the        POWER OFF butten.Then mom got home from work and saw what happened and we tolled her what happened and she called the people and they came and took her away and her back up battery never turned on again!!!

The can fly lift cars and help people and thats why we need!!!!!!!! in our lives if not then life would be meaning less but really robots are just because in movies they take over the world doesnt mean its true. One reason robots are good is there are vacume robots who clean for us there are space robots and underwater robots witch all help us understand life thats my main reason why they should be around and why there are helpfull man kind the end .

It could'nt talk or move yet me and my friends are looking forward to this robot we were going to build. My dad keeps telling me to quit he said,'You will never build a robot!' It got on my feelings but, I keep ignoring him. One day I woke up in the morning and eat breakfast. I called my friends and they came over. We went into the garage and we saw the robot moving. My friends and I stared for at leased 5 minutes. Then we asked him if you could talk and he answer 'Yes I can.' Me and my friends could not belive it. Then i said,'What can you do?' He said,'I could play sports and I could fly faster than a jet.' We were surprised then i showed my parents and my dad could'nt belive my work than he huged me.                                  One month later the Earth was under attack. A huge missile from Asia was coming tord's us. No one could stop it not even army, scientist, and navy seal. But, one thing happened my robot said,'I could fly let me go i want to be superman!!!' All the people said,'please do it for the people and the children and our lives.' I told him I will always miss you and he said,'You are always my best friend. As he flew to save the world I kept thinking of all the moments we had together. And I was wishing there was no missile and no one in trouble and our whole family working together. Well he did it I saw the missile explode and in mid air and we all went back to our family's.

You are scared of what it is but you are going to be surprised of what you are going to see.                      It all started on my 10th birthday, when I wanted a robot set so I could build it.             'Mom, can I open my presents!' I blurted out at three in the morning.            'Honey, it's three in the morning and we agreed that we would open your presents when everyone was up. Go back to bed until eight o'clock' my mother said.            'Fine' I said in a pouty way.   I had to go to bed for another five hours. I set my alarm clock and went back to my comfy bed.            'Beep, Beep, Beep' my alarm clock screamed in my ear. I hopped out of bed and ran downstairs. To my surprise, when I stopped at the end of the stairs, I saw bunch of presents and my whole family was standing there. I jumped for joy. I ran like lightning to my family and gave them all a hug, even my dogs. I slowly opened my presents one by one and I didn't get a robot until I saw the gigantic present. I opened the present and their was a robot kit. I was so happy I got the robot, I kissed everyone on the cheeck.             A few hours later, the robot was done. Then all I had to do was program it. The things that I programed it to do is:   Do my homework and chores Be compatible with my xbox To persuade my parents to get something for me Speak              I played with my robot all day, I even jumped on the trampoline with it. Then it was time for dinner and I ate with my family, including the robot. After that, we watched a mocie and had cake. By that time, I had to go to bed. I shut the robot off and went to bed.              'Bang, Bing, Smack' I heard dramatically downstairs. I ran downstairs with my eyes half clothes and I peaked around the corner. I saw the robot destroying the garage. The robot has gone rogue!!! I had to do something. Just then, my parents appeared behind me. I ran and dogded through the garage to the robot. Then, I opened the back plate on the robot and pulled out the batteries.             'I broke a sweat there' I said releived. My parents both laughed. Since the robot went rogue, I had to disable my favorite birthday present.

When they got there they herd  weird noises so the had went in the woods to see what it was and it was a robot. It had rusted legs and a dark body. It was also playing with a squirrel and 2 chipmunks.       Jim asked 'what kind of robot is it'. Bob pulled out a book of science and found an article on robots that play with other animals. When they where coming up to it the robot got scared a ran away. Bob and Jim look for 2 hours and finally the found him by a waterfall. this time they will make the robot come to them.       Bob remembered that they were studying about robots in school so they knew that someone was doing research so they went in to the bushes to watch the robot. the next day they went back to school and told there teacher. So at recces Bob and Jim sneaked out to go see the robot and see what it was doing it was gone and they never saw the robot again.

'now.' he wasn't the richest scientist. but he had enough to so that he could build 6 robots.        Many people thought that the guy had lost hes mine but it wasn't like that at all he had trouble thinking about thing at first, how he was going the to build these weird invention after he stared to work on them he had already picked out what there were they useful.After many days past he he gets most of his work done. he calls a friend that he is working with and tells him that they are ready to test out the thing that they built .the first robot that they powered up was a the Gemini-scout he was the eon that helped trap minor and could carry things, detect toxic gasses carry inhered people and  had thermal camera tho detect heat of the people. where ever it went it was ready to to pick up anything and gathered it as info.       Dante 2 was a bit more into action so he liked going to places like inside volcano's and had tons of fun doing it . to go on these adventures he would have to special thing all robots are different so they matter          	PRP DT VBD IN DT NNS WDT NNP WRB MD VB VB DT JJ NNP NNP POS PRP VBD RB DT JJS NNP CC PRP VBD RB TO RB IN PRP MD VB CD NNP NNP NNS VBD IN DT NN VBD VBN NNS VBP CC PRP VBD RB VB IN IN DT PRP VBD JJ NN IN NN IN JJ , WRB PRP VBD VBG DT TO VB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBD TO VB IN PRP PRP VBD RB VBN RP WP RB VBD PRP JJ JJ NNS JJ PRP PRP VBZ JJS IN PRP$ NN NNP PRP VBZ DT NN WDT PRP VBZ VBG IN CC NNS PRP IN PRP VBP RB TO NN IN DT NN WDT PRP VBP JJ JJ NN WDT PRP VBD RP VBD DT DT NN PRP VBD DT NN IN VBD NN NN CC MD VB NNS , VBP JJ NNS VBP VBN NNS CC VBD JJ NN NN NN NN IN DT NNP WRB RB PRP VBD PRP VBD RB TO TO VB RP NN CC VBD PRP IN NNP NNP CD VBD DT NN RBR IN NN IN PRP VBD VBG TO NNS IN NN NN POS CC VBD NNS IN NN VBG PRP .

Sure enough, 5 minutes later, he came back with orage juice and handed it to my sister, then said ''How can i assist you again?''I asked him to go get me a snack like crakers.He came back with my favorite crakers.''How did you know these are my favorite snacks?''He said my dad and mom told him what we like and everything.I was suprized.Why did my dad and mom not tell us we had a robot?When mom and dad got home and i told my little sister to not say anything about the robot to mom and dad.We hugged them and asked how was your day and all.When we were eating dinner my little sister asked ''Why is there a robot in the attic?''We all froze and mom said ''What do you mean a robot in the attic?''My sister just ran off to our room and started to play with her dolls.I said what all happened and stuff and they just sat there staring at me and my sister.My mom looked at my dad and said ''i think it is time to tell them the truth, they are old enough now.''I said ''Tell us what?'' My dad looked at us with his guilty look and said ''Girls, me and your mom haven't said anything about where i really worked.'' ''I worked at a Machine and Repair center and i built robots, well when i built my first one i didn't ship off i took it to my house, but after awhile i got bored with it so i sold it to a man named John Marcus.'' ''I got a lot of money and i didn't spend it on you girls, i spent it on a tv. i was very selfish with the money im sorry girls.''

One day the boy saw a shooting star. He wished is robot could come to life and do anything he wanted. The boy went to sleep and when he awoke he saw his robot playing his video games. The boy asked the robot his name and he said Jero. The boy asked Jero what he could and he said anything you want me to do.                 The boy took Jero to school. While at school the boy was being picked on by the school bully named Mark. The boy told Jero to help him so Jero beat up Mark very bad. After school the boy asked Jero if he could build him a super fast car. Jero said yes and so they started to build the car.  When they had finished building the car they drove it super fast over a ramp and went into outer space. While in outer space they traveled to the moon. they got out of the car and started to play a game. During the game a evil robot 4962-H attacked them.                  They hopped in their super fast car and took off. 4962-H chased Jero and the boy and started shooting rockets at them. Jero jumped into the back of the car and opened the window. 4962-H began to shoot missles at Jero. Jero turned his hand into a huge rocket robot destroyer. Jero shot a missle at 496-H and destroyed him. Jero flew the little boy back home on his jet pack/car.                   When they got back home they went to sleep. In the morning they looked outside and saw 4962-H destroying the city. They went outside to save people from getting killed. Then, all of the sudden 4962-H shot a missle and killed the little boy. Jero was fierce with rage and attacked 4962-H. 4962-H killed Jero by cutting his head off with a lava sword. 4962-H destroyedd the rest of the town killing everybody and when he was done made factories for building Bomb Robots to take over the rest of the planets.                  While 4962-H was destroying another planet millions of Jeros attacked and defeated him and his army. Earth and all the other planets were rebuilt after the war of Robot 4962-H was over.

By this time scientists had come much farther in technology than anything you have ever dreamed of. There were many advances in life that were much more severe than robots. The major adjustment we had to make was living 365 days in a humongous space shuttle. Earth is an unknown territory now and we will probably never be going back. In the year 2598, Earth was invaded by a species of aliens that took over the planet.               I dont have very much to keep me grounded but my master who I call Unas. I live a great life with him by my side. You know what, I should probably tell you the story of how my master and I met before I go any further.               I was a cleaning robot tired of working constantly, my battery was always running low and I became very grumpy. My work became slow and definently not the way it was supposed to be. I was constantly getting scolded by my clients for the poor work, but what am i supposed to do how else am I going to make money. After being yelled at I just became tired of it and wen tout on a strike. I felt so alive by what I was doing and it gave me a rush that I never felt before at my cleaning job.

The CIA heard about this from his old assistant who was recently resigned. All the scientist needed were two more things to complete the robot an the CIA had to stop it.        When they went to the laboratory, they saw that the man was gone. Then they got intel that one the materials he was looking for was in germany. So they had to fly all the way to germany. but something wasn't right they saw a plane go by and it dropped sleeping gas and everyone passed out.

They also explore new land and collect information. Robots can also find miners with thermal vision. Robots can help people and can save many lives. Robots are fantastic.            If I had a robot, I would like it to bring me food. I'm too lazy to get food myself, so my robot would. I would also like it to help me with homework and school. I'll ask him for the answers on the tricky questions. If I had a robot, he would be very useful to me.            If I could design my own robot it would be 2 feet tall, 50 pounds. It would be camoflague and have an oven as a stomach. It's name would be Rumplestilskin and would be the best robot ever!            Robots save many lives and collects information for us, so we can advance our knowledge. Robots help people world wide. Robots are amazing and useful in so many ways.

Jakobe lives in Boston with he mother and two sisters. He is in eight grade and is a straight A student, but he had a problem. Jakobe's problem was that the had always dreamed of being six foot nine, but he was only five foot two. He also wanted to meet Shaq, the legendary basketball player who played for the Boston Celtics, where he lives.                                                                                                                                                        One day, Jakobe passes the Boston Celtics basketball stadium and notices Shaq's grave right outside of the stadium.  He stops and approaches the grave while grabbing his iPhone20 and starts to take pictures. He had always dreamed about meeting Shaq in person, but could never get the chance. On his way back home he passes a 'Make Your Robot' store and does not hesitate to join. Then, as he joined the gigantic store, he notices many gadgets that have different type topic's on what person you want your robot to be. He sees the Shaq Robotinator and notices that the price isn't very expensive. He purchasesthe robotinator and runs back home. He goes through all the settings and in a blink of an eye, Shaq was right in front of him. Shaq was nicely detailed with his jersey on from the Celtics. Jakobe now has met his favorite basketball player and has fulfilled his dream.

You are probbibly wondering how we got here in this volcano hanging over a pit of lava with my brothers science project trying to kill us again all my brothers falt. Anyway I gess I will have to tell you what got us into this mess in the first place it all started this morning on my one and only 'SATERDAY' when Jimmy got an assingment to make a invention. He dicided he wanted to make a robot of his favorite super hero it kind of turned evil. Thats how we ended up here.                        If you have ever read something like that it is mostlikly not true because robots are used for helping people or to just to play with. There are all diferant kinds of robots for doing differant kinds of jobs like the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground, also it is able to drag people to safety, and collects information. The Dante 2 is used for climding into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. A volcano is very hot so in order for the robot to climb into the valcano it has to be built to survive very high heat. The next robot is called Mr. Gower this robot works in hospitals by helping docters and nerses bring medison to patients. To carry the medison Mr. Gower has drawers that carry medison. Mr. Gower is able to go onto elivateors ,and stear through hallways, and move things that are in the way.          	JJ NN WRB VBD PRP VB TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN .

When his parents were away, his grandparents would come and watch him. The only thing was when ever his grandparents would come over, they would sleep. He never had anyone to play with, except his cat. He decided to watch TV, and later when he decided to turn it off, an advertisement popped up, for a build your own robot web-sight. When Robbie saw they web-sight right away he went to the computer and typed in the web-sight. When he got to the home page he clicked on 'build your own robot'. Robbie made his robot to be programed with the ability to play with him and cook. When Robbie was finished he typed in his address and clicked create.         About a week later Robbie got a package, so he ran up stairs to open it. When he opened it he saw the robot, but when he took it out it did not work. Robbie was very sad, he kept thinking to himself, 'why doesn't he work?'. It was getting late out, so Robbie grandparents sent him to bed. The next day he woke up by a big bang sound. He didn't know what it was, so he went downstairs to take a look. When he walked down the stairs, there he was making breakfast, Robbie's robot had came to life while Robbie was sleeping. The robot rolled on over to Robbie and gave him his favorite breakfast. Robbie was so happy he let out a little scream. When he did, his grandparents came right out of the bedroom, because they didn't know if he was hurt or not.         When the grandparents saw the robot had made breakfast they were happy, and were wonder what was going on and who the robot was. They didn't know anything because they were sleeping when Robbie ordered the robot. After breakfast Robbie and his robot went outside to play hockey. When Robbie's parents got home he told them all about how much fun he has been having with his new friend. His parents were so glad that Robbie found a friend to grow up and play with.

Finally after three weeks of doing chores he earned $35.00 and the dog was exactly $30.00. Today was Sunday and his mom was taking him to the toy store and he was ready to go as soon as she woke up. He had breakfast ready to go for his mom and they were leaving within 10 minutes, Charlie could hardly contain his excitment.          When they got to the store Charlie ran to the doors and burst into the the robotic isle. There was 1 dog left and Charlie grabed it and ran to the cashier. He took out his money and he was ready to leave and almost forgot his change. As soon as he got in his car and was ready to leave he decided to name his new friend Roy.          The entire day Charlie spent playing with Roy. He played Outside, in his room and even in the kitchen. By the time it was bedtime Charlie was asleep in less than 5 minutes, but in the mourning Roy had changed.          Charlie felt something wet licking his face and suddenly woke up and realized it was Roy! Roy had become a normal dog and Charlie was so excited. his mom never let him get a dog but now his robotic dog was real! Sadly today Charlie had school and he couldn't let his parents see Roy they might get rid of him! Then Charlie remembered that his parents were working today and he could keep Roy in his room until he got home.         While Charlie had been thinking Roy had been running around his room barking and jumping.          Charlie's school day had seemed like it lasted forever and he couldn't wait to get home and see Roy. By the time he did get home he forgot that his dad was coming home early andsaw the front door open with his dad holding Roy. 'Oh... Dad you found Roy, please don't make me get rid of him I'll train him and take care of him I swear!' said Charlie. Charlies dad didn't understand what Charlie meamt by say that his toy came to life but he thought that it would be good for Charlie to have a pet, he said, ' Charlie don't worry me and your mother think your old enough to have a pet, so you con keep Roy. But only if you promise to take care of him okay.'          Charlie couldn't believe it and swore to always take care oof Roy, and new that they were going to have great  adventures.

With modern technology and an industrial revolution we can now make the robo-maid,' said a tv spokes person. I quickly turned up th volume to learn more. 'Now for a limited time offer you can get your robo-maid for 299.99.' I was heart broken 300 dollars was way more than i could ever save up. I knew my parents wouldent get me it and the odds of me winning the lottery were about the odds af super man eating kryptonite for breakfast. I Tonny Smith would never get that robot.    Later that year three days before my birthday i went to school and it was official i was the only one in the entire world who didnt wave a robo-maid. If only i knew what would happen next. The very next day there were reports of strange disaperances. The next Day it got even worse now not every body whas at school and nobody knew what happened to them. Then on the day of my birthday i went out side and the town seemed deserted. Nobody showwed up for my party either. Then when i unwrapped my moms present i knew what happened. The second i opened the box the robo-maid inside started to say 'terminate all humans.'I ran for it but my marents were to slow the robot shot a vaporizer ray and poof they were gone.         I have been running from those robots since then. As i  know it i am the last human on earth. I have been trying to fight them ever since. My effort will probably be in vain but if somehow i do manage to win i hope that somebody finds these notes i have compiled.

All year we worked on a robot that could do various tasks like cooking, playing, and driving, and now we have our final results. I'm Grover who's so nurvous that he sweated through his fourth jacket. The reason I'm sweating like a dog is the winner recives a twenty-five thousand dollar award. That would be amazing for me. Why, because I'm broke, spending my time on this robot a little to much, and by a little i mean i don't have power anymore. But forget about that, right now I have to win this.       As I make my way to campus I see some of the other competators, Becky Sherly the one who spys on you through the bushes, Adam Wisenberg the guiness, And Carl, we don't know his last name, why because he's a crep and never tells anyone anyhting. we're not even sure his name is Carl. But anyways back to the robots. As I'm waiting for the judges to come around in class I notice the other robots have issues, Becky's has bolts flying every where, Adams has an oil spill, and Carls is a banana, how he got here I don't know. As they aproach mine I feel quite scared, what if mine breaks down, what if mine doesn't turn on, what if... No what if's, I lost power for this so it has to work. And I was right a 100% sucess. he drove acceptionaly well, made an amazing sufley, and can throw a football 83 yards, I feel confident. And i should've because I won, I get the prize, my power back, and I can take a shower again. Life is good. Untill I got home that is.       It was 11:30 PM when my life changed forever. There was a lightning storm and my robot was outside on accedent of course. Lighning sturck and my robot was making noises I never could have beleaved were posible, but I ignored good thing to it, it was my cat making the noise.       As my life felt great, I have my matsers now, I have twnety-five thousand dollars, and my robots alive. Wait, hold on a minute My robots alive! I don't beleave it he's making me eggs and bacon, with toast and milk. He says to me , '' Hi, my name is Phill, that stands for pyhsical, hybrid, industrial, lifeliving, robot.' I can't beleave my ears, a robot that had no programed speeches actualy talking like a person. '' Breakfest is ready sir' he said. I had no idea this was posible who knows what will happen. Phill said, '' Ready to drive to school sir?' ''I would be, but I don't have a car.' '' You do now.' Then in the drivewat he turned into a jet, who knows what will happen.       Well, here's what did hapen. I won several prizes, became the 5th richest man in the world, and had two great kids Philles and Glen Jr. But thats all for know anyways. See you next time, lets go Phill to the country club, away!

She has two legs, long, mucular body, and a fetish for fighting. She has a stunning personality, stubborn, aggressive, and tougher than than the Hulk, but she does haave a kind side to her.       She is a female Prime that can transform into any being, even make herself a human spy. Krista has the Allspark form the Tranformers movie embeded in her, giving her the ability to summon fire, freeze objects, create earthquakes, hipnotize Decepticons, and many more powers that will be in use in battle. Krista even has even more strength than anything the world has ever seen.           If you are a fan of the Transformers movie, this book will tell you about how it will all happen, up until the fourth book, in which i planned out carefully. The book Before The Fall of Cybertron will be written by me, and if your hungry for a thrilling book, this might be for you.       Side note:       I would love to try and build this fantasy robot and give her the powers she hs in my book, but nothing can compare to what I'm wrightting.

Your friend won't answer the phone and you don't have a sibling to play with. What are you going to do? That's the thought that little Jake had. What am I going to do? He thought.           'MOM!' Jake yelled.           'WHAT!' she yelled back.           'I'm bored!'           She handed him a cardboard box and some markers. ' Use your imagination.'           He looked at the box like it was brussels sprouts. What am I supposed to do with this? He sat on his bed and glared at the box. He layed back and looked at the posters on his walls. He saw a picture Yosaine Bolt running. He saw Le'bron James dunking a basketball. Then he saw the rover on Mars. He studied the rover then looked at the box. He went into the kitchen and grabbed the scissors. He ripped the poster off the wall and put it on the floor to use at an example. Then he started cutting and coloring and cutting and coloring until he was finished.            The box was transformed into a cardboard robot. It had blue arms and green hands. It's body and head was bright red. It's big square cross-eyes were black. He had an antennae that was orange and a big 'J' on his chest.            'Jake 2' he smiled. Jake spent the whole afternoon playing with Jake 2. When dinner rolled around, Jake brought Jake 2 to the dinner table. They played until bedtime. Jake got a pillow and a blanket from the hall closet an tucked Jake 2 in. Then he climbed in bed himself.            'Goodnight.'            The next morning Jake woke to a beeping sound. He opened his eyes to see a tray with scrambled eggs, toast, butter, juice, an orange slice and 3 slices of bacon laying next to him. He smiled.            'Thanks Mom!' he yelled.            'For what?'            That's when he noticed that Jake 2 wasn't under the covers where he left him last night. He got worried. Had Mom thrown him away? Then he screamed. Not a scream that you might hear coming out of someone on a roller coaster, not a scream that you might hear when someone wins the lottery. This scream was a terrifying scream. It was a scream that sounded like feedback from a amplifier. This was a scream that hurt your ears.             Jake 2 was under the tray of food. Suddenly Jake noticed his little green hands under the tray. Jake lifted the tray and Jake 2's little body was alive. His eyes were adorable. They were big and black.             'Can I help you, Jake?' he beeped, 'Would you like to play?'             'Wow', Jake smiled, 'Yes, you can help me. I would like you to get me my laptop. And some chocolate chips. I will eat my breakfast while you read to me. Then, and only then, will we play.'             'Yay.' Jake 2 beeped, emotionless, 'What book would you like me to read to you?'             'How about One Foot, Two Foot, Red Foot, Blue Foot by Dr. Seuss.'             'I shall go get that for you, Master',  and he rolled out of the room.             'Master!' Jake whispered, 'Cool!'             After breakfast and reading Jake and Jake 2 finally played. They played until lunch. Mom came in and saw that Jake 2 was alive.             'Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!' she screamed, 'How.......what......JAKE!' she was baffled.           'It's okay, Mom. He's only alive.' Jake acted like it was the most normal thing on the planet.             'No! It is not 'okay'! This is a very impossible thing! I'm calling the police department! Or whoever will take this....thing..... away!' she stormed out of the room.             'When Mom is set on something, she won't give up. It's no use trying to stop her,' Jake thought to himself.             'I guess this is it, buddy.' Jake cried, hugging the metal bot.             When the department came to take Jake 2 away, Jake clung every limb to the robot.             'No! I won't let you take him!'             Mom pried Jake off and embraced him in a lock-hug, so he couldn't run for the bot.             'This is for your own good. This was not a normal event, what happened today. It'll be okay later.'             'No! It won't! He was my best friend and you called the police on us!' Jake screamed. He ran inside sobbing.             Mom sighed, 'Let me have him', she said.              'But Mrs. Carigon, we can't let you just have him. He could be greatly used in studies and saving lives.'              'Let me have him', Mom sneered, giving the police officer a deadly look.              After a few seconds of the 'death look', the police officer said, 'Give him over.'              She brought him inside, looked at those big, black, rectangular eyes, and apologized.              'It's okay.' Jake 2 said.              Jake ran into the living room, 'You saved him! Thank you!' He grabbed Jake 2's metal hand and started dragging him back to his room.              'Ahh ahh ahh.' Mom said, moving her first finger from side to side, 'It's my turn to play with him.' She said.              'Ugh, fine.' Jake said shuffling back to his room.              'So, Jake 2, how are you with painting toe nails?' Mom asked Jake 2, escorting him into the kitchen.              Jake heard this and smiled.

He had built this   play-bot because, he didn't know if he was the last human on the planet after the meteorite the size of Mexico had hit Earth and wiped out almost all the living creatures. The play-bot was nearly finished but, the scientist   died before he could finish the play-bot he had named, Pixel.           The planet had not had any precipitation for a very long time, until suddenly in the year  5061, there was a big rain storm with thunder and lightning. It just so happened that the lightning had struck Pixel. It looked like   something was happening. Pixel's eyes were starting to glow bright green. He started to move his limbs. He got up and looked around. 'Where am I? ', he thought to himself. He scanned his surroundings. 'No plant or animal life found.' , his sub computer, H.A.L, told him.            He yelled as loud as he could, 'HELLO!... IS ANYBODY THERE! ' Of course nobody answered. After that,  the first thing he did was build himself a shelter out of the debris that the meteorite made so he wouldn't   rust. 'As soon as this storm is over, I'll go search for living creatures.            A couple of days later, the storm had stopped. Pixel noticed this right away as eager as he was to get out of his little shack. He went outside and activated his flight mechanisms. He flew away towards the west. He soon found himself over the Pacific ocean and at the islands of Hawaii. He landed on the sub-island of Maui. He scanned for any living organisms. 'Living organismis found sir.' , H.A.L said. 'Identify them.'

Then, he started getting tools and things that he could use to build a robot. He asked his father if he could help him,but his father had to work and his mom had to take care of his little sister. Jonathan went to his room got the stuff he had gotten from his garage.He was working on it and he thought it was going pretty well, then he checked his watch and saw that it was already 11:30.He freaked out and said,'Its late I should be in bed!' Jonathan then went to bed.                    The next morning, Jonathan woke up. He looked tired;he went downstairs and ate breakfeast. Jonathan went to school while his mother was watching his little sister. After school, Jonathan went home and went straight to his room. Once he got to his room, he was working on the robot.Then, he finished. He tried to turn it on so it could work,but it didn't turn on. Jonathan said,'Man I give up! I can never build anything!' He started to do his homework, Jonathan checked his watch,it late again! this time it wasn't 11:30 P.M, it was  12:00 P.M.                    Jonathan went downstairs, he told his mom he didn't feel like eating today either. She asked,'Why?' He just left to school without telling is mother about the robot. He came back from school, did his homework,and then ate dinner. Jonathan thought it would be good for him if he went outside. While he was outside he told himself,'Playing outside is a good idea.' He checked his watch it was already 8:30 P.M. He went upstairs went to bed and wished that his robot worked because he missed it.                      'Today is Saturday.', Jonathan said with a sigh of relief. Jonathan checked on his robot and turned it on. It was walking he was so happy he told his dad, mom, and sister. They congradulated him and they spent the whole day playing with it.

People always thought that Bod couldn't do anything after the huge accident a few years ago. The People of  Rover town built a museam to honor Bod.          Then one Halloween a group of kids visited the measum. The kids got scared when they heard a robot voice say, ' Hello my name is Bod.'The group turned around to see Bod still working and roming around the museam.          One of the children said,'RUN.' With that they ran away. They stopped when they heard what sounded like crying.        Bod cried,' All I ever wanted was to have a friend. After the accident my battery had been drianed. Every one thought that I was dead, but I was really charging my battery.'  Bod looked up and saw the kids were still there. 'Will you be my friends?' he siad nervously.        All of the kids quickly answered 'YES'         Now Bod has about4 friends that visit him every night. After a wile Bod ventured outside when a person spotted him and said'Hey look it is Bod' To Bod suprise every was pleased to see him.

I decided to name it the Helper Robot she could help me clean the house, clean the chicken coop, collect eggs, and help me change the chicken waters that are low. the Helper Robot can also incubate eggs that we are trying to hatch, she can take care of baby chicks that don't have a mother and she can help me find a chicken when it is missing.         The Helper Robot likes to come and help me when i have to do chores. The robot is very helpful because it does alot more things than chores. It can talk and do lots of things people do. The Helper Robot can play sports and help me with my homework  	CD JJ NN NN PRP RB VBD VBG DT NN WDT MD VB PRP IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD TO VB PRP DT NNP NNP PRP MD VB PRP VB DT NN , JJ DT NN NN , NN NNS , CC VB PRP VB DT NN NNS WDT VBP NNP DT NNP NNP MD RB VB NNS WDT PRP VBP VBG TO VB , PRP MD VB NN IN NN NNS WDT VBP RB VB DT NN CC PRP MD VB PRP VB DT NN WRB PRP VBZ NNP DT NNP NNP VBZ TO VB CC VB PRP WRB PRP VBP TO VB NNP NNP NN VBZ RB JJ IN PRP VBZ NN JJR NNS IN NNP NNP MD VB CC VB NNS IN NNS NNS NNP NNP NNP NNP MD VB NNS CC VB PRP IN PRP$ NN

She thought she had nothing to do with her life. She had no friends and would sit by herself at school. She never wanted to do anything. Once she did one thing she wanted to stop and change the activity.                               One day when Sally came home she saw a mysterious package in her room with her name on it.                               ' What is this? It has my name on it, but I dont want to open it. Well I have nothing else to do.' Sally said as she tiredly walked over to the package.                     When Sally opened it a human shaped figure pushed its way out the top of the box.Sally started to scream as she was frightened.                     'My gosh i have been in that box forever!' The human like figure said in robot language while Sally was screaming.                      'Who are you and what are you doing in my room?'                      ' I am a robot and my name is Tundra.' Tundra said as she made her way out of the box.                     As Tundra gazed around the room, Sally was on her bed slightly underneath a pillow. Tundra seemed nice to Sally after a couple of minutes so Sally asked her alot of questions.  Tundra ansered all of her questions and they very soon became good friends.                     Two months later Tundra and Sally were doing everything together. Playing sports, exploring caves, driving to places in the area, and even doing farm work with eachother. The activities they did seemed like it went on forever.                    Everybody in town knew about Tndra. She was one of the nicest person of all. Even scientist knew about her, but a new scientist planned to steal Tundra away from Sally.                    Dr. Smith was the new scientist in the lab. He had recently read about Tundra on the front cover of the news paper.                    ' Thats quite a robot we got in town,'Dr. smith thought aloud,'I must get it.'                    On a beautiful Tuesday afternoon the two friends were playing baseball outside. Dr. Smith was driving by, examining the robot. He took notes and pictures. He finally parked his car and headed out for the robot and the girl. He asked questions, but Tundra was unsure so they decided to go inside.                    'Sally, may i speak to you please?' Dr. smith asked                    'Yes?' Sally said as she went back over to him.                     Dr. Smith bribed Sally with money for the robot, but she said it was her best friend and no amount of money can replace her. So the scientist understood and drove back to the lab.                    In the lab, Dr. Smith called court and negotiated about why a young girl as Sally shouldn't need a professional robot like Tundra.                   'She could be very useful here in the lab.' Dr.smith said                    The court agreed for the lab to take the robot. Dr. Smith planned to take the robot sooner than later.                       The very next day Dr. Smith went to the court, got a signed paper saying he can take the robot. He drove to Sally's house and showed her parents the signed paper.                    ' Sally!' Her dad yelled upstairs,' the Scientist are here to take Tundra.'                    The next couple of minutes were the worst for Sally. Her best friend was just tooken out of her life. How could she go on? The good news is that she did.                    Sally had later accomplished many things that Tundra tought her and she became a scientist . she went to the same lab Tundra was taken to and the two of the lived the rest of their happy lives together.

That can play with kids never gets tired and is always ready to play and have fun. The robot is very cool because it is like a person that never gets tired of doing anything.                        There is other robots that work in hospitals it looks like a block. And has a lot of draws on it that carries medicine if a doctor needs to get medicine the doctor can call the robot and the robot will come to the doctor . The robot is very strong it can Carrie over 500 pounds of medicine and the robot never gets tired .                         The robot is allowed to go in the elevators to get anywhere the robot is like a human because it can talk steer down hallways it can move anything that is in the way of people. The robot has hundreds of phrases to use when talking to someone. This robot can help people find a room with a patient in there.                          The other robot is a car that has over 80,000 cone-shaped laser mounted on the roof that can see other cars in front of other cars the lasers are all over the car the car can go different speeds and when a car is getting cut off the car will slow down and you wont even notice because the car is so smooth when it is driving there is no other car like this.                          Another robot works in mines the robot carries supplies and food it can rescue people if there hurt in the mine.The robot car drag people to safety if there hurt it can sense gasses to tell to the works if the air is ok to work in.It has a two way radio to talk back to the people it has a camera on the front of it to know where its going.                           The other robot picks berries on farms for the farmers the robot comes in all different sizes some of the robots have to be carried behind a truck.Because there so big they can pick strawberries,apples,cherry's,oranges, and lots of other fruits and detect if there ripe or not.                     There is no other robots that can do these things like humans can.Llike the cars have there own licenses for driving and there is robots that can see and talk like humans and they can rescue people.there are no other robots like this in the world.They are controlled like a video game control so if you play games with the same controller you can control this robot really easily with out having any difficulties.

All of a sudden, he saw something falling and crash. Bryan followed it. He found it and saw it move. It was all dirty because of the dirt. Then, it summoned a brush to clean all the dirt off of him. After the dirt was off, he could see that the real color was all purple. The robot then looked at Bryan. Bryan then started running because he was scared. The robot was by his side. Then, Bryan stopped. The robot stopped, too. The robot then called Bryan master. The robot said, 'My name is Tech-mo.' Bryan then greeted him and went home.         Bryan asked Tech-mo,'What can you do?'     Tech-mo replied,'I can do anything you command.'         So, Bryan asked Tech-mo to clean the dishes.Tech-mo was done in a second. Bryan was supprised about him.Then, he asked Tech-mo to do the laundry. And again, Tech-mo was done in a second. He asked him to do another favor and Tech-mo as done in a second.

Dante2 job is to go in into the volcanoe and collect imformation.   It has to go into the crater and collect imformation about the gases coming out of the vents.Grower job is to helps doctors and nurses by bringing medicine to the paitients.       Both robots are helpfull to what they work for.Dante2 helps scientist to predidct when a volcanoe its going to erupt again.Grower helps save lives.Robots are perfect for any job.

Like for example: Be nice to people, show respect , make good decisions, and be respectful. Robots seem so helpful to have because there is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Those robot is called Mr. Grower. It can go anywhere in the hospital. Now i really want a robot now because i will  love  to let the robot do my demands .                                                                                                                       I really want a robot now because the robot could be my new best-friend  and it could do my chores every single day. It would be so exciting to have a robot in your home, but i really wanna know do robots take showers? Probably not. Robots are super doper smart because you know what they do? They save people lives and they have so many jobs. Now i really want a robot.                                                	IN PRP VBD DT NN PRP MD VB DT NN VBP RB JJ NNS IN PRP .

Suddenly it started talking to me.At first i was scared because I've never seen anything like it before.He said,'I AM BOB,I HAVE COME FROM THE FUTURE TO SAVE YOU.'   Too scared to say anything,I nodded my head.I took him to my room,not letting my parents notice him.As soon as he entered my room,he transformed into a human.He had blue eyes,fair skin,and brown hair lying on his forehead.He was the cutest 'human' I'd  ever seen.As a human,his name was Justin.          I told 'Justin' to play outside with me,and he did.He transformed into many things like:unicorn,penguin,butterfly,a hippo,ect.After that amazing week he told me he had to leave Plant Earth and go back to his plant,Planet Robotomy.He transformed back to his robot self and told me his good-byes.Then he left me all alone in my cold,dark room.          Then,i told my  mom what had happened and she didnt beleive me so she sent me to the doctor's and the doctors didnt believe me either.After nothing worked out,she sent me to a mental asylum that was around the corner.I couldn't stand it so Bob came back to Earth to same me from everyone.He met my mom,and my mom fainted because she didnt believe her own eyes.But,long story short we all became friends and lived happily ever after.
