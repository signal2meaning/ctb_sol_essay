With all the new technology in the 1800's there was plenty for them to do. They were neede to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all that.   Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in 1800's. Next to Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860's, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.) They kept comong, during and after the war. the Irish were desparate because in Irelandd crops have failed, espicially the potatoe crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.   In the later 1800's, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent so many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed homes, food, jobs-and there just didnt seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hungar.   Others came for religious freedom. These include people from Holland and Jews that came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.(Jews were often mistreated for there beliefs in there home countries.) Still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.   In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year peroid. Think about that, 26 million!. most of the newcomers knew very litttle about America except that it was a land of freedom. But thats what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.

Among them were the Germans, the largest single group of immigrants. The Irish were next to the Germans, with one-fourth of the population, or 1.7 million people, moved to the United States because crops had failed.       In the later 1800s, people started to come in from other European countries, like Russia and Poland. Many Europeans came to America to avoid hunger and find work.       Others, like the people from Holland and Jews from Germany and Russia came for religious freedom. The Jews came to escape prejudice. Still other people came to escape wars. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rate and farming losses. The tradition of leaving land to the oldest son meant that younger siblings were left landless, and often came here looking for opportunities.       Many reasons that people came to America was that they had a harsh environment, wars, other conflicts, and poverty that forced people over. People willingly came to find jobs, wealth, opportunities, and perceived freedoms.       The Chinese came here hoping to find riches in Californian hills. Most of these Chinese were from Guangdong, on China's south coast. There were many rebellions against the government, and endless village and family feuds. The government raised taxes, forcing farmers unable to pay them to sell their land. The area couldn't produce enough rice to feed its growing population.       Between 1860 and 1910, the population almost tripled! Almost 7 times more people lived in cities, and coal production increased twenty-fold. We got 8 times more miles of railroad track, and about six times the amount of newspapers. These numbers show that the population of America is growing.

People who could farm, build, or invent would come to America. With all the technology where would be many work  for them, and would have many things to do. Others would come because living in there country was very hard, or they were drivin out because of a war that would by going on, or rights that they wanted were denied. Witch is why people all over the woeld would come to America hopping for a new better life.                      Now through out 1860-1910 all the time that more and more immigrants would come into America, the population grew by alot. Especialy when the technology had improved, witch helped and made it easier for immigrants to come to America. Now a great portion of America were immigrants form all around, and they had helped alot in the prosses of technology and  escalation in what was possible for men and wemen at the time.

Others moved there for religious freedom like Jews who came from Poland, Germany and Russia.  Soon eoungh America had created many things like railroad tracks so people could vist or moved to America. Many chinese visted California for their gold rush. Many people from far and wide came there just to try and get some gold for their country, family and themselfs. The first time the chinese heard about the gold rush 325 people helped and the following year after that over 450 chinese helped. Years and years on that number got larger and larger.

As well as the Europeans, Irish, and Germans. They fought for food. Some of men worked for food but it still wasn't enough to purchase food for their families even children, babies, toddlers wold actually die of hunger. It would be a miracle if people survived that situation. It was really hard for people to stop the hungriness. there were even worst situations other than starving.                  Another bad situation was back then was no freedom. Like any other people they would of liked freedom, but there was no freedom at all. Some families escaped from wars to the United States of America for freedom. So, back then there were lots of harsh situations for many people. But they just had to live with it. There are many situations they went through a lot.                Back then it was a whole different story. Now a days we have food, water, shelter, and our parents work to give us all those stuff we need to survive. Another thing we have is freedom. There are no more wars and no more situations about escaping for freedom. Now we have jobs, and most important education.

By the time the people settled technolgy was all new to them so they had something to do. They also needed to have jobs so they can get payed. they wantwed to grow crops in America becuase wherever else they tried to grow crops, it failed. People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to America around the 1800's. There was also Jews who came from Germany. People aslso started coming because they can have a better life here and were they used to be at before America wasn't as easy as America is. There was about 26 million people who came to America over a 50 year period! That is alot of people who came to America. Now there are billons of people who live in America.        Alot of people moved here because there was gold. Many man went gold minning here in America. Just by many people moving here in America transpotation improved and so were railroads and roads.It became easier building because many found many items/objects or even invented things to make it easier. By moving to America many things increased here like many transpotation and building and moving long distances. When people moved to America they figured out how to get criminals in jail or to keep bad people locked in jail so it would be much safer here in America. They also had trouble with birth effects because they didn't have and medical help but now that they live in America they are able to find products to make medicine to help with any sickness, injury, or birth effects.        Many Chinese people moved to California because they were able to find gold and thats what they needed. A man named John Sutter was the first one to discover gold in 1849. He tried to keep it a secret but soon enough it started to spread. 60 ships headed toward california and thats when the gold rush began. The people who were gold minning were called the Forty-Niners. After the Chinese people found out they headed straight fo California and more and more came every year. When the pople started getting gold they got alot of money and then the population of the gold started going down and then some people could pay taxes or payments so sometimes they had to sell land or something valuable.       As they kept gold minning they found more int he pacific ocean. Chinese had a plan to get a bunch of gold, get rich, and return back to China. But the Americans did not exept that. China still got away from it and when they returned home they spreaded it around China and more went back to China. Every year more Chinese people came and it kept increasing and would not stop. As many years went by most of the gold was gone and many chinese people went back to china but man stayed becuase they thought America was a pretty cool place and they would stay even if there was no more gold.       This si why i thing many people from around the world moved to America by the products, items, objects, gold, land, food, and shelter. this is also why people loved America so much because it was better and easier than the other country, state, or city they used to live at.

Some came for the hope they could get more food for their families.Many things drove people to come to America in the last 200 years around the world hoping for a place to thrive and survive.             One thing many people came for was gold, after the discovery of gold many people came rushing hoping to get some and sell it to a buyer and make a fortune of money for their family.   People came from many different countries and across the nation all to California.Some there to sell usual item like water but a lot more expensive.Man got rich not mining but instead sell clothes,water,food,and tools.             In the 1860s Irish men,women,and children left Ireland because of crop fails around the country which left 1 million people dead. 1.7 million people left and went to America in hope they could get food for their families in hoe of surviving the starvation of Ireland.

They were really needed to work in brand new factories like farm and to also build on land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all that kinda work.       Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the germans, the irish was the largest immigrant group in the 1800s. Before the American Civil war in the in 1860, almost one-fourth of the whole population of ireland came to the United States. They just kept coming in the midddle of the war during and after. Thats what I can say about immigrants moving to the USA.

Farmers, workers , or invent came ship after ship after ship.    Immigrants came all over the world.Germans made the largest single group of immigrants. After the Germans is the Irish.  One fourth of the Irish came to America before the American Civil War so they were 1.7 million Irish men,women, and children in America in 1860. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland the crops had failed, especially the potato crop. Over 1 million people died of starvation.          After more people came because of the freedom they had in America these included people from Holland,and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In the other hand others escape from wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.In total 26 million immigrants came to United States over the past 50 year period could you imaging all those people arriving to United States.

Immigrants came from all over the world, even from China.       One reason people immigrated to America was for religious freedom. Imagine you were Jewish and you got mistreated just because of your beliefs, and then you heard of a place where you could practice any religion you wanted. You would go there right away no matter what it took to get there. This happened to many people in places such as Germany, Poland, and Russia.                 Another reason people immigrated to America was because of the Gold Rush. People with dreams of riches came from all over the world to try to strike it rich. Many people came from China. In fact by 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese immigrants in America. People came from other countries too. In 1849 there were more than 70,000 hopeful people in California.                 People also came for land and food. In Europe there was a tradition of giving the land to the first born so many people had no land or money. 'Southern Italians also suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices.'  The immigrants wanted a new life, land, and food so they came to America.                 As you can see many immigrants from all different countries came to America for its freedom, food, gold, and land.  Overall by the time all of the immigrants had come the population of America had almost tripled. These are just some of the reasons why immigrants came to America.

Those immigrants were tired of being pushed around like they were a piece of dirt on the ground. All they wanted to do was provide for their families and make sure everything was okay. Those people were as harmless as a butterfly. Well, of course you know that if they had to get down and dirty to fight for their families you better be dog on sure that they would do it!             Next, some of those immigrants came here to find jobs,have religious freedom, and avoid hunger. They were just trying to make a living. I don't believe that they wanted to just come into our country like it was theirs. I just believe that they wanted a better life. I mean they didn't have any rights at all!            Luckily, the pushes and pulls in America made some things better. Like, transportation. That improved a whole lot. Like more resources like silver and lumber could be moved from the West to the East. Transportation made traveling more easier and faster if you traveled from one place to another.            Now, one of the reasons why most of the immigrants flocked away is because of the Gold Rush in California. Everyone went there to get a job when they discovered gold in 1848. It was life changing! There was nothing else that would have ever made those immigrants flee to California. But, quickly people began to feel hopeless. Chinese migrants began fleeing and other immigrants began to flee from conflicts and poverty. Then Guangdong,an area in China off the south coast, it's population began to increase.The area couldn't produce enough rice to feed the people.Especially when floods often destroyed their crops.             Okay, their was many many people that came to the U.S. and how many records were recorded. People who live in cities, numbers of people not born here,coal production in tons,miles of the railroad tracks,and daily newspaper given out daily. You would not guess how many people live here in 1860-1910. In 1860 there were 31,513,00 people living here in the U.S. and in 1910 there were 92,407,00 people living in the U.S. ! That's crazy right?             To sum it all up, there are many reasons why the immigrants chose to flee here and how many were here and what pushes and pulls drove them. Like the Gold Rush was a pull,a feature in life that attracts people, it attract millions and thousands of people.Some people were just trying to have rights like those people who didn't have freedom to believe in what they wanted. People who were starving and trying to find a job? That made no sense to torture people. They were all immigrants trying to find a way to fit into this world.

In 1848 the gold Rush was discoverd.The news about the Gold Rush spread all over the United States and hundredes of people left the city to set off for the American River.In January of 1849,60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed to California.More than 70,000 hopeful travelers arrived in California in 1849.325 men from China arrived to seek for gold.More Chinese came the next and the next year.When China heard about the 'Gold Mountain' about 77% of Chinese were in America.         The Bureau of the Census made a chart of  how many peaple were in the U.S during the 1860s-1910.In 1860 there was 31,513,000 immigrants in California.In 1910 there was a increase there was 92,407,000 immigrants in California.

The Second Largest Group That Came To America Was The Europeans.The Europeans Came To America Faster Than The Irish Because They Had Built Railroads That Could TransportThem To The Docks Faster.The Docks Had Boats That Had A Steam Engine Which Made Transportation A Lot Faster.Lots Of Europeans Went On These Boats.The Europeans Had Left Their Homes Due To Harsh Conditions.            The Third Largest Group That Came To America Was The Chinese.They Had Heard Of A Gold Rush And Soon Came To America.Most Of Them Came From A City In China Called 'Guangdong'.The Gold Wasn't The Only Thing That Drove The Chinese From Their Homes.Conflicts,Poverty,Lack Of Rice All Drove The Chinese From Their Homes.             To This Day Lots Of Immigrants Come To America,Mainly To Find A Job And Hopes To Have A Better Future.

Soon America was a popular place and people were moving here constantly. They decided to start building more technology for there daily needs. One of the great inventions was the train stations.This allowed people to get places faster. The eropouns were very intergiued at the transportation.Also the gold rush happened in California interesting more people to come to America.So i relive that those are the pulls that lead people to move to America.

The largest single group of immigrants came from Germany. Next to them were the Irish men, women, and children. They made a dangerous journey across th Atlantic Ocean. They came in search of freadom, jobs,food, and more land. They also came to get away from a war that was going on at home. Another reason was that they came because they didn't have enough money to pay taxes.          The Gold Rush was when there was gold found in a river in California. People came from the East to mine gold. The place where most people came from was China. They came because the population in China was so high that people were dying from starvation. They also came to make money to pay for taxes because the taxes werte so high.           'Push' and 'Pull' are what make people go from a certain place and what attracts people to a certain place.Some 'Push examples are harsh environments, wars and other conflict, and poverty. Some 'Pull' examples are jobs, money, access to resources, freedoms, and opportunities.             In those three paragraphs, I told you about the immagrants who came to America, the Gold Rush,and about 'Push' and 'Pull'.

With all of the new technology in the 1800's they were determind to work on new things.  They made new factories and and farmable land.  They had plenty to keep themselves busy.           Germans were the largest single group of immagrants in the 1800s.  Next came the Irish.  one-fourth of the Irish moved to America.                                               GOLD RUSH, CHINESE MOVE TO CALIFORNIA            Gold was discoverd in 1848 in California.  Everyone wanted it.  The 'Forty-Niners' were 325 men from China.            The Chinese came to America shortly after gold was discoverd.  More than 70,000 adventures came for gold.  Most people who wanted gold were Chinese.                                           PUSHES AND PULLS        Industry grew in America.  Transportation became more modern.  More people could now move to America.  Now America is big and modern, very modern.

Some moved because they were being prosecuted in their home country for religious beliefs. Others from war. Also, many people were starving in their home country. Many people moved to the United States because of pushes and pulls.                 Pushes are when a person leaves somewhere because of bad things. Some people, such as the Jews, were being prosecuted for religious beliefs. Others, such as the Irish, were starving because of crop failures. Finally, some people left because of war. Many people immigrated the USA because of pushes.                 Pulls are something that makes a person want to leave somewhere. Some pulls in America were the Gold Rush. Others were the freedom of religion. Also, there was plenty of work so people could make a new life. There were many pulls in America.                 Many people got pulled and pushed to America. After many people left the countries, they probably got better in the case of starvation. Still massive amounts of people still came, so America is a great place t live. In conclusion, many immigrants came to America.

Many people had hard times in the 1800 so they moved to america to get the chance to be free and make money for themselves and their family. America is that perfact place to work for many people. Just the land and the chance to be free and yes, the gold!Transportation was much faster and easier in America and people really digged that!They also digged gold! Times were hard but moving to America is just the right choice for a free life.            Moving to America  was the right thing to do for immagrants in the 1800. working people came to America to work, with the help of technology. Technolohy,really?Yes,people worked were they neede like in farms,factories,and to farm.What about inventing things? Yes, imagrants did that too! Many people just could not live in their country anymore.People had to move to avoid starvation. They just kept on coming after the war to come and work for food. Some people came for just religious reasons though.Jews were often mistreated for their belief in their home countries.Still, some just came to eascape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.             The second half of the 1800 was a mighty change for America,in a good way. Transportation improved,travalers could catch a train that would take them right to a boat,and yes pushes and pulls.Wait what are pushes and pulls?You might ask.Well,pushes are thoses features of life that drive people from their homes. These include a harsh enviroment,wars and other conflics of poverty. Pulls are thoses features of life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources,and perceived freedom.You're welcome!             Gold,is here! Jhon Sutter was that brilliant person to discover that beautiful piece of wonderful. So now we know there is gold,but how did the chinease find out? Anyways the chinease is here to get some of that gold and so as Americans they want their hands on that gold and they are gonna get it one way or another!  The 325 people who joined the gold rush in 1849 was just the begining.              Gold was discovered, transportation is faster and easier,and yes,telephones! The 1800 was an exiting time for many people then and know. I mean look at me i have goose bumps just writting this! So many things happened in the 1800.Although there is still so many knew things to discover.You know like aliens,haha!

My brother has always woked hard in the feilds to provide us with food and water even though we dont really have enough to be completely healthy, by the time he gets home my mother and I are asleep but sometimes she stays up and waits for him cause shes afraid he will get hurt like my father did, it was pitch black outside in the cold night it was almost 1:30 am and mom was getting worried cause he usually comes home at 12 the next morning his soft voice did'nt linger in to my room to wake me on the news he had been killed and his wallet was stollen, the man who killed my father is in prison now, but i send him letters not being rude, just asking why.       It's morning, I awake and see my brother standing over me and he told me that breakfast was ready so I ran downstairs and looked but there was nothing on the table except crumbs of bread from last nights dinner, he told me we were gonna eat outside which we had'nt done for a while, we never went to school we were to poor but my mom taught me some stuff.       At a young age I was taught how to hunt animals and use every little bit of them so none would go to waste, I also learned how to cook from my dad at an early age, such a shame that the man shot him down, would've been nice for him to be around but everything has it's reasons.           All and all we had to work very hard to earn what keeps us alive and even though it was hard back then we still worked through our challenges and made it this far.

America            There have been multiple reasons the immigrants have traveled to the United States, such as the advanced coal production, food jobs, etc. An incredibly famous reason happened in 1849. The California Gold Rush. It was supposed to be a secret, but, once the word got out, people leaving leaving like crazy. Over 70,000 peaple arrived. They all wanted some gold of their own.            So, as you can see, breakthroughs in America caused tons and TONS of people to move to the United States.

They needed to work in the new factories.Germans were the biggest group of imagrants that were single. The people from Ireland were the largest group of imagrants.They failed in cropping.Over one million people died of starvation in Ireland.Many people from different countries needed to move to America to avoid hunger problems.They all settled down to get jobs and food for their families so that they dont starve to death.They all needed jobs to avoid the thought of being poor with starving families again.Over 200 years ago many people from different places came to settle in America to have a better life later on in the years the population of people got higher and tere was more than thousands of people settleing in America.

People had a lot of other problems in there old country such as wars, starvation, floods, bad cropping, cconflicts, and government.       Some people moved to America for there farming, building, inventions, technology, and fast transportation.                                       Befor the American Civil War 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children came to America. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed. Later 1800's people from European countries started coming to America. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.       Many Eurapeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Others came from religious freedom. 26 million immagrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.       In mid 1800s industry grew and transportation got a lot faster. Imformation started travling twice as fast.

But in the 1800s people who could build, farm, and invent came to America ship by ship. Between 1750 and 1850 Europe's population increase to double and the extra people left to come to America. Many people came not knowing much only that it was a the land of freedom.?? In the second half of the 1800s more things where invented like the telegraph and the telephone. So people became more aware of the world. But in 1848 gold was discovered by the American River in California which brought many different people around the world. Many Chinese people came in total.

She was 9 years old and was diagnosed with breast cancer.  When she was 4 years old her mom died of lung cancer.  As the years went by, she started to think that she wanted to die too.  One evening her father got up out of bed.  It was going to be a long day for him.  He had 17 job intereviews to go to.  As he was about to get in his car,He realized that Mackenzie had to go to school.  So he ran back inside woke her up,made sure she was all ready in 10 minutes and left.  As they were in the car on their way to drop Mackenzie off,they saw Tom Brady walking down the street.  They asked him if he needed a ride,so he said yes.  There was a problem though because the car only had 2 seat in it,so the dad pushed Mackenzie out of the car and sai 'you can walk to school today,you need the exercise!'.  So she walked to school,she was sad.  She had saw all of her friends in their cras with their moms and dads bringing them to school,yet there she was walking down the dark alleys and crossing the busy roads.  When she got to school it was allready 11:00 and they were all having lunch allready!  SHe got so mad that she threw all of her stuff on the ground and said 'I'm late for school and people have just forgot all about me?!?!'.  She got really mad and decided to take her anger out on someone smaller than her.  So she went up to her friends little sister and punched her!  The little girl cried and cried.  Then the principle came walking down the hall,and said'Mackenzie Hollister I want to see you in my office right not missy!' So Mackenzie walked down to his officer and got kicked out of school.  She did not like that at all!!  So she came back to that school the next day and never told her father what happened.  He father has asked what was going on and how her day was and all she said was 'Fine now leave me alone!'  The next day when she went back to school the teachers had locked all the doors and spray paimted on them with black paint.  It said 'Mackenzie Hollister is band from this school if we see her on this property we are calling to police!'  One of the teachers looked out the door and saw her standing there so she yelled 'what is your problem I did not do anything to you guys for you guys to act like this!',But the teacher did not pay attention!  She just sat there and stared at Mackenzie like she was a crazy salker or something.  SO then that very day as she was walking home she saw a really cute guy!  He looked exactly like Justin Bieber!  She got obsessed with that bot that she decided to follow him to his house.  As the guy turned around to talk to her she realized that was her old teacher Mr.Lewis.  He was stunned to see her following him,so stunned that he asked her if she wanted to come inside!  Mackenzie was so embarressed that her cheeks got all red.  Of course she couldn't deni it though so she said 'i would be happy to'.  They walked in his house and right away she wanted to leave,she got really bored!  His house was broing!       5 months later.....MAckenzie marrys Mr.Lewis...eww! and they have 7 kids! 4 girls and 3 boys their names are :Stephanie Lewis,Kaylee Lewis,Brianna Lewis,Aysia Lewis,Samuel Lewis,Shayne Lewis,Lavontay Lewis!.  THe kids were HANDSOM and GORGOUS!!   THE END!   Mackenzie Hollister was a nice person but she has changed from just a little bit of anger in her!  She could of just done something else instead of hurting someone!!

During and after the America civil war in the 1860's, people from Ireland came to America. When people traveled to America they traveled by ship's. In 1869 the first rail-road that crossed the United States was completed. Instead of taking long ship ride's, people went in train's wich were more shorter than going on a one month ship ride. Advances in transportation was much more easier for people to travel because a train  in Europe will take a passenger straight to a boat.                                                                                                                   In 1848 'gold' was discovered along the America River, in California, on the property of John Sutter.   By January 1848, 60 ships had arrived and thousand's of overload travelers were headed for California. More than 70,000 hopeful adventures came to California in 1849. Among these, their were 325 men from china came to California in look of 'gold'. Farmer's from china sometimes had to sell their properties because they didn't have enough money to pay their taxes. Some Chinese came to America to make some fortune and proudly return to china. In 1860 their was 31,513,000 people in the U.S., by 1910 their was 92,407,000 people in the U.S. The daily news-paper in 1860 their was 387, by 1910 their was 2,6000 news-paper.

This article will explain why, when, and where these people who moved here came from, Enjoy!          It all started in the 1800's. The first people who moved were the Germans then Irish people.Before the Civil War in the 1860's, one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America!           Some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. People came from all over the world for new job opportunities and freedom! But most of the newcomers didnt no much about America exept that it was the land of freedom. They wanted to experience a whole new world. And they did!            	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB NNS VBN TO NNP .

In the 1800s European countries (including Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary) came to America because their crops had failed and many people died. Since there were so many people in these countries people needed food, homes, and jobs, so they thought America could have all the things they needed. They also came to America for religious reasons (which included Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia) like being mistreated for what they believe in and other religious wars as well.                    Another reason people came to America was because of easy transportation. Easy transportation meant that people could could take resources (such as silver and lumber) over a long faster distance. It also meant people could escape wars much more quickly with a smaller chance of getting caught by the enemy. Then with new inventions coming out like steam power and the redesign of printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspaper. However, the invention of the telegraph and telephone made news travel faster and less newspapers were used. Additionally, Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices.               The last reason immigrants came to America was because of the gold!In 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. 70,000, people came in hope to find the California gold along the American river. The Chinese were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. Guangdong was involved in a war between China and Britain, there were people turning against the government, and endless villages and family feuds. The Chinese government was starting to higher taxes which caused a lot of people to go broke and farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their land. They also came to America because they didn't have enough food to feed everybody especially when there was floods.                         These are the statistics for the American population and industrial growth from 1860-1910:           NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE U.S. :     1860: 31,513,000          1910: 92,407,000            NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CITIES:   1860: 6,216,518             1910:41,998,932               NUMBER OF PEOPLE BORN OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES:   1860: 4,096,753            1910: 13,344,545                COAL PRODUCTION IN TONS:   1860: 20,471,000           1910: 417,111,000                 MILES OF RAILROAD TRACKS:   1860: 30,626                   1910: 240,293                 NUMBERS OD DAILY NEWSPAPERS:   1860: 387                          1910: 2,600                   That is why immigrants came to America.

People were leaving their home countries to come to America with reasons called 'pushes' that drive people away from their homes. They then came to America with reasons called 'pulls' that attract people to a certain area. Many oppurtunities were provided for immigrants that came to America which greatly increased the population in America.              One reason that people had for leaving their own countries and moving to America was that advancements in technology provided new jobs and job spaces that needed to be filled. Foreigners saw this as an oppurtunity to start a new life. Workers were needed in factories, for farming and building on the land, and they were needed to invent things. So technically, this area of reason was basically the advancement of technology, the opening of jobs, and access and wealth.              Not only were people just attracted to the U.S., but they also were repelled from their own countries and displeased with certain things. In Ireland, the potato crop ceased to grow, and many people died of starvation. Some people, though, in order to avoid this, came to America. Some people left their homes because of warfare or poverty.              As you can see, people had many reasons to immigrate to America. They were either repelled from home, or attracted to America. Many oppurtunities were provided for many people. This shows that America is a great nation.

Most people came for these reasons, 1) money, 2) work, 3) family, 4) religious freedom, 5) food and homes.   Why people came for money was that in their homeland was because they were not making enough money to support themselfs or their family.   Some people came for family that has lived over seas and they wanted to be with them. doing so they would live with them.    Most people from england came for religious freedom because in europe they had to attend a specified church.

Immigrants went because of harsh conditions or war in their country. 'before the the American civil war in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America.'       immigrants went to America because of the opportunities America held. 'Like the people who came from the eastern united states, the Chinese hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills.'       most of the immigrants needed to come to America because America held their key to a better future. every immigrant had their reasons for coming to America. whether to strike it rich or have a better home. immigrants shaped the way of America so their freedom will not go untouched.

During the 1800s, people who could build, farm, or invent moved to America. Since there was a lot of new technology they had a lot to do. Germans were the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next was the Irish. Before the civil war 1/4 of Ireland came to America because in Ireland crops had failed and many people died of starvation. Others came for religious freedom. Jews came because of their beliefs and they were mistreated. In total, some 26 million immigrants moved to the U.S. over a 50 year period.       Pushes are people that moved because of harsh environment ,wars and other conflicts. Pulls are people that want to find jobs, opportunities, and perceived freedom. Many Europeans wanted to escape because of the harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in America.       Chinese hoped to find fortune waiting for them in the California hills.Many were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. There was a war and that made most of their crops destroyed. Many people wanted to find the gold rush.       Immigrants went through tough times in their life but it hopefully becomes better when they move to the U.S. 	EX VBP JJ NNS WDT NNS VBD TO NNP JJ IN NN , CC TO VB NNP NNP DT CD , NNS WP MD VB , NN , CC NN VBD TO NNP NNP RB VBD DT NN IN JJ NN PRP VBD DT NN TO NNP NNPS VBD DT JJS JJ NN IN NNS IN DT CD NNP VBD DT NNP NNP DT NN NN CD IN NNP VBD TO NNP IN IN NNP NNS VBD VBN CC JJ NNS VBD IN NNP NNP VBD IN JJ NNP NNP VBD IN IN PRP$ NNS CC PRP VBD NNP NNP NN , DT CD CD NNS VBD TO DT NNP IN DT CD NN NNP NNP VBP NNS IN JJ IN IN JJ NN , NNS CC JJ NNP NNP VBP NNS IN JJ TO VB NNS , NNS , CC VBD NNP NNP NNPS VBD TO NN IN IN DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNP NNP VBD TO NN NN CC NNP NNP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN IN PRP CC PRP$ NNS IN NNP NNP VBD TO VB NN VBG IN PRP IN DT NNP NNP VBD VBG IN NNS CC NNP NNP VBD DT NN CC IN NN RBS IN PRP$ NNS NNP NNP NNS VBD TO VB DT NN NNP NNP VBD IN JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN CC PRP RB VBZ JJR WRB PRP VBP TO DT NNS .	1		20131022141046	2364	2		20131022141034	2352	1		20131022171056	2405	1

Some people traveled to America for religious freedom. The Jewish people and people from Holland were two of the many cultures who traveled to the U.S for religious freedom. The Jewish people traveled from Germany, Poland, and Russia.        Another reason for  people coming to America is is that there home country was not doing so well. For example there might be a drought in there country and so they don't have enough food like the Irish people. They also might not be getting fair treatment in there home country. For example the Jewish people had to fight prejudice in Russia.       One of the biggest reasons for coming to America was because John Sutter had found gold in California. When the people in China heard about the gold they traveled to California to become rich. By 1870 there were more than 63,000 Chinese people in the United States. Many people from different parts of the U.S came to California to see if they could find gold to.

But many wonder why did so many travel to America in the 1800s? In this article I will answer just that.       During the 1800s with all new technology there was plenty things for people to do. There were jobs available and more freedom, and that's just what some people wanted a new life for themselves and their families. But people in Ireland came for different reasons.The Irish were desperate because all of  Ireland's crops had failed, especially the potato crop the one they depended on the most.Also during this period of time Europe's population doubled and there was so many people that there was not enough food, jobs or homes. Italians also suffered greatly from the high amount of birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. But one of the last reasons people came to America is because in 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in California. Many people came from all over the world to seek out there own fortune or to escape from a war and high taxes like the Chinese did.        That is why so many people traveled to America during the 1800s because life was not as helpful and generous to them at the time as it was to America.

Many immigrants tried moving to different parts of the world to get a better life for them selves and for there children , to get a job and earn money, to practically get wealthy and have what they need. Sadly not all of this happened to many people more than 1 million people died of starvastion because they had no shelter , and no food.          During the 1800s and the 1870s people who could raise a farm , invent , and grow food came to America in ship after ship after ship. many people had to move away for there own good because of war or there wasnt enough food and supplies they needed. Some just wanted to leave because they were working poorly and they werent getting paid enough money. More than 1.7 million people moved away to places and not all of them had a good life as they planned and dreamed.          In total some 26 million immigrants arrivied in the United States over a 50 year period. They say most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. Not all got what they wanted. Many immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions all over the world , and thats what they did.

People were dieing of starvation. people decided to come to America, some of the countries were Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. they all came here for a new life, new opportunities. California hit big during the Gold Rush. Many people came to America just to go to California for the gold rush. one of those many people included China's people. During that time China was going through a rough time. Their government raised their taxes. Making it harder for Farmers to pay their taxes. It made it harder for everyone who lived in China. America was the best place to be during those times. We had everything we needed. we had everything they needed. So during the 1800s America was the best place to be.

They built factories to farm and invent things. later in the 1800s people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. such as Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.  The population in Europe doubled! all the extra people had no food, homes and jobs. many Europa came to America for better jobs and food. others come form religious freedom. like people from Holland and Jews that came from Germany Poland and Prussia. Jews where mistreated for the beliefs in their counties.       In the late 1800 was a awesome time for change in America. industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America beach's transportation improved and the first railroad was built. that crossed the United Stated this made it easier to to move.  travelers also would catch a train and take them to a boat. a trip to America would take months but the new stream ships could make things faster. these advances in transportation possible to travel a LOT more easier.       gold was discover 1848 along America by a man by John Stutter soon the new spread EVERYWHERE! this was called the gold rush. millions of people fled to America to find gold.  these people where called the 49ers.       these are the ways people came to America and celebrate Cultural Heritage Day.

Next, some immigrants came to the U.S for freedom.They were in war at there home and it wasn't safe. Some wanted to leave so they can work a job.Many people were just held captive at there home. Others just wanted writes to do what they wanted to do.Finally, immigrants also came to the U.S for the gold. Some didn't have enough money to pay for food for their family.Some wanted to be gready for extra money.Others were so poor they needed the gold badder than any other person.Immigrants are part of history and they are part of what made America.

I'm going to tell you about why immigrants came and still come to america.                     People came to america because of hunger and poverty from their other countries. Another reason is because industry grew, factories grew, and jobs were here in america. The last reason is because people wanted opprtunity and jobs and better lives for their friends and family.                     Those are just some of many reasons why immigrants came and still come to america. 	WRB VBD NNS IN JJ NNS VBP TO VB IN DT CD .

First, I will talk about the Source about 'moving to America and how others came to the land of the free. Next I will talk to you about the next Source which is the pushes and pulls for immigrants. Moreover, I will talk about the second to last Source which is the gold rush when the Chinese had moved to America. Finally I will talk about the American pop. and ind. growth where all of the numbers meet between 1860 and 1910.                  First, I will talk about Source #1 and when every one has moved to America by ship and/or other ways of transportation. In this Source all of the people were moving to America because of problems back at their own country or fleeing for freedom and harsh environments. For example the Irish had moved to America because of all of the bad crops and failing crops, while others came for religious freedom like Jews, people from Holland and the Jews came from Germany and Russia. In total about 26 million immigrants has come to America already!!!                  Next, I will talk to you about the pushes and pulls for the immigrants or Source #2. This Source talks about the second half of the 1800s. This was a time of great change Industry had grew and many immigrants have arrived to Americas shores. The pushes of the 1800s were of life which drove the people from home like starvation, slavery, war, and many other things. The pull's are those features of life that attract people to America like the economy and jobs, to the freedom that America had which meant a lot back then.                  Moreover, I will talk to you about source #3 and that includes the 'Gold Rush! Chinese move to America' and this tells me alone from the title that Chinese move to America for what other then... Gold. Back then gold was discovered along the American river in California on the property of a man named John Sutter. Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret but people found out and they rushed over their like a pack of angry bulls. When the Chinese found out they moved to America to find gold and to escape from war in hopes to find a new home or come back to China being rich and showing off to other people.                  Finally, I will talk about the American population and industrial growth thru 1860 and 1910. This Source tells me all about the numbers of which happened like how many people has moved to America or the coal production. Basically it tells me this,   Number of people in the U.S] in 1860 is 31,513,000 and in 1910 is 92,407,000   People who lived in cities in] 6,216,518   41,998,932   Born outside U.S] 4,096,753   13,344,545   Coal production in tons] 20,471,000   417,111,000     Miles of railroad tracks] 30,626   240,293   Daily newspaper 387]   2,600   This is all it tells you.                 In conclusion this is what all of the sources tell you for the Immigration and Explanatory Performance Task like the first source was moving to America which all of the people were moving to America for freedom or food and drinks or crops. The next source was about the pushes and pulls for the immigrants while they came here if it was to escape from the slavery or religious freedom and all of that kind of things. The third source was all about the gold rush and gold was discovered near a river in California and it being on a guy named John Sutters property and all of the Chinese coming here for freedom and money. The last source was on the American population and industrial growth and the statistics on it thru the 1860s and 1910.

They were needed in many jobs immigrants invented the new technology. They farmed and worked in factories. Immigrants did that stuff.             The largest group of immigrants were Germans. The second largest were Irish. Before the civil war Irish came to America at and after the war. 1.7 million people came to America ,because of hungriness and they were starving. Their crop was crumbling and food was short. 1 million people passed away.               Later in the 1800s, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungry came. More people came to Europe so the extra people didn't have enough food to feed them. So some Europeans moved to America to find work and feed themselves.                Other people came for freedom. Like people from Holland, Jews, Germany, Poland, and Russia. Jews were mistreated. Other people came, because of what they believed and war. So they came to America to escape wars, get freedom, and to keep there beliefs.                 26 million people came to America! Wow. In just over a 50 year period. Most of the people that arrived in America wanted freedom. Also a job. Yes. When they came to America they got freedom and a job. They were happy.                                        Changes in America                               In the second 50 years of the 1800s America changed. Travel changed trains were built so people could travel easier from east to west. Transportation got better.                   At the same time Europe was making transportation improve too. First they got on a train that took them to a steam boat that traveled fast from Europe to America faster than ever.                    In the 1800s, travel increased rapidly. steam boats were made. Trains were built along with tracks. the telegraph made news faster. Printing machines made books and papers easier to write.                    People saw the world. The pushes and pulls made them move to America. Pushes are those things that drive you out of your home. Pulls are things that pull you. Like if there was more wealth in America you would come and get the wealth.                    Many Europeans wanted to escape America, because of bad conditions. Jews were escaping, because of their beliefs. All the immigrants hoped America would be a good place to live.                                     Gold Rush!                     John Sutter discoved gold in 1848 along the American river. by his house. He tried to keep it a secret, but word spread quickly. The gold rush had begun.                     Soon the world found out about it. so people were competing for gold. When the word spread to china, China rushed to get gold and wealth.                      Most Chinese immigrants came. Chinese governments then raised taxes. So people who could not pay them had to sell there land. Also the food could not feed people especially when the crops failed.                        Most people felt hopeless. People who went to the gold rush wanted to return wealthy and proud.                        Many other people joined the gold rush.                         The number of the gold rush finders spread rapidly. Every year more and more people went to find gold. Soon so many people went to find gold, And fame.

They also came for religious freedom. including pople from Holland and Jews. Jews were mistreted in there home land. Then some other countries came to escape war. Wars made life unstable and unperdictable.       Nere 1849 gold was found in California. Out of 70,000 hopefuls 325 men were immigrants from China. they were all looking for gold to help there familes bake in China. Later more immigrants came because of the inventions being made.

When immigration is good people transfer to country to country is for helping people build thing that would make peoples lives better. Immigration is bad when people transfer from country to country and kill or hurt people and try to ruin peoples live in America.                           People who think immigration is bad, its not because people who immigrate either come to America to help for charter kids and help them live a better life. Also they can help people build houses and farms to plant food for them to eat. People who help kid or adults the President appreciates what you do to make peoples lives better not worst.   Immigration is a a word to succeed to have a better life. Who wants a bad life, when you have a great life you can succeed.                           During the 1800s working people who could build things like farms, houses, and stores are only allowed to immigrate country to country. Plus the new technology they could build things way better than from had. There was plenty for them to do to help people. Immigrants invented factories for the people to get accessories to help them build the farms and houses.                                          Germans Made up the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to them was the Irish was the largest immigrant group. Before the civil war the 1860s is when the largest population of when Ireland came to America. They kept on comming and comming to America.  Ireland faild the crops, especially the potato crop.                                              In conclusion, the immigrants can transfer place to place as long as you can build thing fast and you know where the huge factory you will be able to do that.

They came just in time, with all the new technology in the 1800s. There That was plenty for them to do. they could work in factories, to farm, build on the land, and invent new things. Immigrants work in all of those things.            The Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants during the 1800s. Next after are the Germans is Irish. In the 1860s before the American Civil War, 1\4 of the whole population of Ireland came to America.The immigrants kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because their crops were failing. There was a food shortage and more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.           In the late 1800s people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This also includes Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850  and all those extra people needed food, homes and jobs. There just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.           Others came for other religious freedom these included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Still other immigrants came to escape wars that made life unstable.            In a total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States and over50 years period. Think about that 26 million. Most new comers knew very little about America, except that it was the land of freedom. Thats what they wanted:freedom and a chance to work.

Hunger was a big problem, since lots of food sources were hunted and extinct.  The population of Europe double between 1750 and 1850, so there was a lack of everything.            People also came from the war going on in their home country.  The people came during and after the war.  Much of the war was civil war, though, but it was still brutal and harsh.

The irish had failing crop so they moved to America. in the late 1800s there was a rapid change in traveling news.          In all of the immigrints that came, ther was 26 million people that came to America in a 50 year period. Through out the second half of the 1800s America has really changed. There also the Chinese that moved to California. In the year 1849   325 joined the gold rush.

They worked in factories, farm, and they also invent things.                   Later in the 1800s, peolpe started coming from the European countries. All those people needed food, homes, and jobs, but there isn't enough for them in Europe, so they came to America. People from Holland, and Jews came for religious freedom. Others came to escape wars.             The second half of the 1800s was the time of  great change. Transportation improved and more immigrants came to America. In the 1869, the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed. People can travel on train and get to places easier.             Gold was discovered by John Sutter in 1848. Soon, hundreds of people came find gold. Later on, more people came to America and the California gold rush had begun. The next year, the Chinese came and hoped to find a fortune. Many came from Guangdong, to flee from conflicts and poverty.             Over a period of time, 26 million immigrants came to America. All they wanted was freedom.

During this time pushes and pulls happened to make immigrants travel or flee out of their homeland. Some came for fortune and other things. Others came to escape, hunger, poverty, religious freedom, and to find work. Here are some things that made them want to come to America.        The first reason is because of hunger. The Irish for example were desperate because the crops had failed and there was a food shortage. More than a million people starved in Ireland. The population in Europe then doubled between 1750 and 1850. At that time not many jobs were available at Europe. So many Europeans came to find work and escape hunger. At China however Guangdong was at war with two other countries. One with Britain the other with China. Poverty also stricken for they were at war. The population was growing quickly at Guangdong, and not enough rice was produced to feed the people. The floods also often destroy the crops.         The second reason is because religious freedom. The Jewish people who came to Germany, Poland, and Russia were mistreated for their beliefs in their homeland. Russian Jews left to escape from persecution from others who mistreat their religion. Also, from prejudice and violent attacks to them. It then made their life unpredictable of what will happen next just because of their religion.  They came to hopefully have religious freedom, and do whatever they want with it. That is America that has religious freedom and no persecution or prejudice. This is my second reason.          The third reason is because of fortune. During 1848 gold was discovered along the American river in California. A man name John Sutter tried to keep it a secret. It wasn't long before everyone heard that there was gold. That is when the Gold Rush started. Meanwhile at China poverty and hunger have stricken. That you read of at my first reason. At China they heard of gold and fortune at the mountains. So then 325 men from China came to get more fortune or Gold. So then when the came back to China they are rich. More and more Chinese came later. They soon contributed in building the railroads since they wanted jobs.          In conclusion, many immigrants came to the U.S. Some to escape persecution, hunger, and poverty. Others for fortune and work. Many immigrants came to the U.S. over 50 years. About 26 million. Still many immigrants are traveling to the U.S. They came for freedom and work.        	NNP NNP .

During the 1800, the Germans made up the largest single group of many immigrant, but the Irish still had the largest immigrant group.Before the war in America has started, some of the Ireland came to America during the war, because the Ireland were so desperate, their crops had failed, especially the potatoes.             In the late 1800, the Europeans came to to America, because during the 1750 and 1850 the European had doubled, they don't seem to have enough food in Europe, that's why they came to America to work to avoid hunger. But not all the Europeans came to avoid their hunger, but came for religious freedom, these people included Holland, some Jews from Germany, Russia, and Poland.              In America, in total, there is about 26 million immigrants came all the way from their home to the United State over a 50 year period!But most of the newcomers wanted is their own freedom and a work to avoid hunger with their children.           So after my researching for all of the important reasons for celebrating the Cultural Heritage Day, I realize how important the cultural is to so many people, so I think I will tell my little cousin and my siblings one day about how much important is about our own cultural, so I think we all have to be respect to our own cultural, even if we all have different cultural than everyone else, we still have to be respect to each others.

One thing about Immagrants and people did is they moved to America if they knew how to build,farm,and invent and thats what my father and i did at the age of 13.After the war 1.4 of the whole population and 1.7 million Irish men,women,and chidren moved to America.There was so much people and 1 million people died of starvation  in Ireland.In the 1800's more people came to America such as Russia,Italy,Poland,DenmarkSweden,and Hungary looking for food,homes,and jobs and I always wanted to help in some way but we were runing low on food to.In the past 50 years of Immagrant's coming to America there has populated over 26 million Immagrants arrived in America and me at the age of 63 I have seen millions of people and I am steel in good shape to do any job.           In the second haf of the 1800's America had a great change.There was one transportatio that was completed in 1869 and that was the railroad and I have traveled on it many times.There was another thing invented and it was the steam powered boat mad it faster and easier to travel wich i have traveled on to see my grandmother.More things were aded on such as printing,books,and newspapers that helped spread news around.The next advantige is the telegraph invented in 1844 to make news travel a little faster for news or letters and are very usefull that I have used many times.More later in 1876 a knew invention was made  and more advanced than the telegraph it was a telephone used to talk to people more faster and I used it every minute to talk to my family because I was gitting very old.       Lastly in 1848 along the American River Gold was founded by John Sutter.The word was spread and thousinds of people came to America and so did 60 ships and thats how the gold rush began.In 1870 there was 63,000 Chinese in the United States to play a critical part in building the first transcontinental railroad and 77% of chinese were in california to build the railroad.           These are all the reasons why Immegrants moved to America and what had hapened and what was done from   1800's to 1957.

Some of these people were builders, farmers, inventors, and people who just wanted a better life for them and their families. All of theses people were called immigrants. A total of 26 million immigrants arrived in America in a 50 year period.       The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. There was new technology such as: better transportation, railroads and trains, printing presses, and lots more. Trains were a big thing because you could travel much faster and haul more stuff to different places. Trains weren't the only big thing though, there were also steamships that moved much faster than normal boats.        America wasn't the only country with steam boats and trains. Europe also had the new and amazing technology. Some Europeans traveled on steamships to America where they soon became Americans.       In 1848 gold was discovered. in the discovery of gold came something huge, that something was called the 'Gold Rush.' People went to California for a chance to find gold. They choose California because there was lots of gold there.       That is just some information about how America was stared.

Out of all those pushes that made situations worse there was also a pull.  With all the news they had heard from their friends in the advance in technology, they had heard about this place far-away called America. They had heard great things about that land, that didn't seem realistic to them because of how terrible the conditions were there.

During the 1800's, many immigrants heard about America as the land of fortune. So they came boat after boat, rushing to seek just that! Most people came to avoid hunger, while others came for religious freedom. 26 million immigrants arrived in fifty years!            With industry booming, more and more immigrants came looking for jobs. Many people in Europe and China were trying to escape. China also came because of the Carolina Gold Rush. Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong, fleeing from conflics. 77% of the Chinese in America were in Carolina!            Lets get off folks.

This was true in europe also.Travlers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat.A trip to America in eariler times would have taken months but new steamships could make the trip  much  faster. these advances.       In the this made news and main ideas available  to more people. The invention of the telegraph in 1844  and in telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.

But what was it like for them and why did they come?        Some people came from different countries to the Untited States, not all of us were born here. In fact all of our ancestors came form different countries to the United States and that's how we got here.        Years ago, there was a gold rush, the dug and found gold, in California. Lots of Chinese immigrants came to dig up the gold. Soon the gold ran out and no one found anymore, so the overflowing cities of California became deserted because everyone wanted to catch the nearest train out of there. Gold doesn't exist anymore in California, maybe in another thousand years they may find more gold. And our decendents will find some. How was the immigration trip to California from China, it must have been hard?        It was very hard for families to leave their country, it's sad to think of leaving your family and having to go somewhere that you are unfamiliar with. Not being able to speek the same language or not knowing what things mean is hard. The Chinese immigrants had to travel all the way across the globe to get to California to dig up the gold. Many Chinese workers probably didn't want to move away from their families, I wouldn't either. And when you got to California and didn't find any gold must have been discouraging. And once you got used to everything you had to move back to China.        Immigrating to another country can be hard and sad, but you will always makea friend, somehow. Even if you don't make one righ away. You never know, your new life in a new country might be better than you old one.

So many Irish people had immigrated to America.       secondly many people immigrated to America in search of religious freedom. for example, many Jewish people were being mistreated, exspecially in germany, so they came to America   lastly, many people immigrated to America for its pleniful jobs. for example many people immigrated to europe but soon europe became over populated so many euopeans came to America in search of jobs.

The Irish were desperate because Ireland crops had failed. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Jews came to be treated fairly for one time.           In America the transportation improved. They also made the first railroad track in the United States. It was completed in 1896. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. Pushes drive you away from home such as: harsh enviroments, wars, and other conflicts. Pulls are those things in life that attract people such as: jobs, wealth, and freedom.           Gold was found in 1848 along the American River in California. People from San Francisco came to find some gold. The California gold rush had begun. Floods destroyed the crops in China's south coast. They called California the Gold Mountain. By1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States.

The Germans treated the Jewish people harshly an even killed them.        People also came here because of technology. There was a train track built all the way across the country. People could go to places faster, like work and visiting family.And for these reasons certain groups came to the united states.        In the 1800s the Germans came to America in a HUGE wave. The Irish came in a huge wave to before the civil war and continued after the civil war. They came because the crops failed and most of the people. The Russians,Italians,Polish,Denmark,Swedish and Hungarians came here because the population in Europe doubled. There was no place to stay for a lot of people so they came to America.          In 1948 there was gold in large deposits discovered in California. The Chinese came from south east china. They were fleeing from war and poverty. They mined an a lot found gold and some struck it rich.

They either came for religious freedom, for food, homes, and jobs, or for the Gold Rush.                                                            People came for the religious freedom because in Europe their rulers would tell them what religion they to to be. The Europeans didn't want o be old what religion they had to be. So they came to America. People came to America for food, homes, and jobs because there wasn't enough of them in Europe. When people came for the Gold Rush most of the immigrants came from Guangdong,China. Some of the immigrants came for the fortune because there wasn't enough rice to feed the people in Guangdong,China. So 325 of these Chinese immigrants joined the Gold Rush in 1849. he year after that 450 of these Chinese immigrants went to California and joined the Gold rush and the number of Chinese immigrants grew larger and larger. By 1870, the total population of these Chinese immigrants was 63,000.

Also Europeans came, but they came from everywhere and they came for food, homes, and jobs-and there didnt seem to be enough of them in Europe. They came because they also wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. People from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia came for freedom because Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Some of them came to escape wars that made their lives unstable and unpredictable. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses. The tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger kids landless.

Immigrants have built some of our largest cities, produced much of our food, and have invented many useful things. However people don't just move to the United States for no reason at all. In fact, there are actually many reasons to why immigrants came to the U.S. especially in the 1800's. They came from all over the world, China to Europe in search of a better life and of course, freedom.          Many nations in Europe were suffering from poverty and starvation due to the huge increase in population there. When something is driving people from their homes, such as war it is called a 'push.' Poverty and starvation are not the only things troubling Europe at the time, many Jewish people in European countries were being mistreated very horribly. However the United States had many jobs, homes, land, wealth, opportunities, and freedoms. These are called 'pulls.' Pulls are features of life that attract people. The United States had many 'pulls' and very few 'pushes.' On the other hand, Europe was the complete opposite. There were so many pushes that many people moved to the United States and became immigrants. Now, they could start new lives as Americans who were finally free from the troubles of Europe.           One 'pull' was in the form of a mineral, a very shiny and valuable kind of mineral. That mineral would be gold, and who wouldn't want something that valuable? In 1848 gold was discovered in California, and the Chinese wanted it, even if it meant moving to the other side of the world. They began traveling to California by boat in the California gold rush. Many came from the Chinese city of Guangdong since they were suffering from many 'pushes' such as two wars with Great Britain and poverty. By 1870 63,000 Chinese lived in the United States, 77% of which were in California. Our new immigrants even helped build the Transcontinental railroad over rugged terrain. Hopefully the new Chinese citizens found some gold so that they could start new lives in the state of California.           Immigrants to the United States came for lots of reasons and came from many places from all over the world. They have played an important role in making the United States what it is today. Without immigration the United States would not be very successful and many people would still be crammed into China and Europe. Immigration has also made the U.S.A a powerful and diverse nation. Millions of the immigrant's lives have been made better with the freedoms and jobs of our wonderful nation.

Of the many immigrants the largest group we're the Germans. Of Ireland's 6.8 million population 1.7 million immigrated to America.  Between 1750 and 1850 Europe's population doubled so there wasn't enough food, homes or jobs to go around. A lot of Europeans went to America. In 50 years 26 million immigrants came to the U.S.!            In the industrial revolution transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the U.S. was completed in 1869. Resources could now reach their destination faster people could also go on these trains. New steamships in Europe could make a trip from a few months to a month. The redesign of the printing press made newspapers inexpensive the telegraph and the telephone made news travel really fast.            In 1848 John Sutter found gold on his property he tried to keep it a secret but word got out to San Francisco. In the January of 1849 60 ships set sail for California. 70,000 prospectors set out for California 325 men were from china. The Chinese called California Gam Saan or 'gold mountain'. By 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the U.S.  	IN DT CD NNS VBN VBG TO NNP IN VBG , VBG CC NNP IN DT JJ NNS DT JJS NN PRP VBP DT NNP NNP NNP POS CD CD NN CD CD VBN TO NNP NNP CD CC CD NNP POS NN VBD RB RB VBD RB RB NN , VBZ CC NNS TO VB NNP DT NN IN NNPS VBD TO NNP NNP CD NNS CD CD NNS VBD TO DT NNP .

But it wasn't because of the high birth rate. It was because the movement of immigration! People from all over the world immigrated to America because of such benifits it offered. Many types of Eroupeans and Asians moved to the U.S becasue of job oppertunities, religious freedom, harvest land, gold rushes and much more.          Germans and Irish people were the largest groups that immigrated. 1/4 of the population in Ireland came because of potatos crop poor harvest. Which killed at least 1 million people. in the later 1800s people started coming from other Europeans countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Europes population doubled between 1750 and 1850 and more people means more food, homes, and jobs, but in Europe there wasn't enough. So they came to America! In america they found many job oppertunities and avoided hunger.           The second half of the 1800s there was also changes in America.Many inventions were created the telegraph and the first American Railroad, which made it easier for people to contact each other and get from place to place. Most Immmigrant came because of 1 of 2 reasons, these reasons were the 'push' and 'pull' reasons. Push reasons are reasons to come to America because there are wars, starvation, and poverty where they would live and they wanted to leave. Pull reasons were reaseons to move to America because there is jobs, farm land, wealth, and religious freedoms. some Europeans moved because of the harsh enviroment, some jews because of religious reasons, and southern Italians because of high birth rate.       Evidently there are many good reasons people would move to america in that time period, for wealth, religion, jobs, and more. Wether they were pushed or pulled to America the Immiegrants from then experienced the immigration to America                                     	NN TO NNP NNP DT NN CD NNP POS NN VBD NNP CC PRP VBD RB IN IN DT JJ NN NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN IN NN .

When Civil War started 1/4 of Ireland came to America. Irish were desprate because all of there crops died. Over 1 million people died of starvationtion in Ireland. People started coming to Europ and there population doubled from what it was at. People could not find jobs, home, and food so they started moving to America. America's population expended 26 million people over 50 years.            The first railroad was completed in 1869. It became easier for transportation and it made it easier for people to travel here. It made a huge difference for everybody you could ride a boat or train and still get there fast. That triggered impormation to, impormation was traveling really fast to. This time in the 1800s boats were and trains were really fast. Train then is like a plane.            Gold was discovered in 1884 in Californa! That triggered the Chinese to come because they wanted to find a fortune. Chinese farmers that could not pay there taxs had to sell there house. They could not produce enough rice exspelly when floods came. The news about the gold spread through out China and everybody wanted to join the gold rush. The 325 who joined in 1849 was just the beggining the next year there was 450 more to join the gold rush. That seemed like the beggining to if you look at these numers in 1851 there was 2,716 and in 1852 there was 20,026 to join the gold rush. At the end there 63,000 Chinese in the United States. They could be althrough the country but 77% of them were in Californa. 	NNS IN MD VB , NN , CC NN MD VB TO NNP IN NN IN NN : NNS RB VBP EX VBD NN IN PRP : .

The 1849 Gold Rush was a big time for everybody. It took place in California. Just about 63,000 Chinese came to America. It all started when John stutter discovered it and the word got out. More than 70,000 hopeful miners came to California in search of this gold. The people were called the 'Forty-Niners'. And a lot of the Forty-Niners were Chinese and other immigrants. 77% of all the Chinese in America were In California.

It's when people from all different countries came to America for a better life. Immigrants came from all around the world, including countries like Germany, Ireland, Eurapean countries like Russia and Italy, plus several more. But why would so many people leave there home and travel to an unfamiliar land?             The resons why people immigrated to America are sorted into two categories, 'pushes' and 'pulls'. Pushes were things that people didn't like about there country, and made them want to leave. Many countries were experiecing war, poverty, and harsh environment during this time. Some people were treated poorly because of religous reliefs. This made America the perfect place for all of these people to go, a land were they could be free and have a chance to work.              That brings me to the 'pulls' catergory. These are features that attracted people to America, an some of the pushes seem even worse. The main things people were looking for when they came to America was jobs, wich lead to wealth, food, and land. Other immigrants came looking for new oppoortunities. A very large group was atrracted in 1849 because of the gold rush in California, a major 'pull' for America. All of these pulls to America and pushes from other countries brought a lot of people to the U.S..              But how did all these people get here? It became much easier in 1869 when railroads that crossed the U.S. were invented. They were originally for transporting goods like silver and lumber, but they could carry people as well! Moving from one place to another become easier and faster! Now immigrants from Europe could take a train write to a boat.A trip that would've taken months was now much shorter with the advancement of trains and steamboats. An it sure did bring in a lot of people!              With all of the 'pushes' and 'pulls', transportation advancments, and even the gold rush, its no wonder why so many people immigrated to Ameriaca. By 1860, 31,513,000 people were living in America, and 4,096,753 were not born in America! Also. there was 30,626 miles of railroad tracks in the U.S. alone! Theses numbers had greatly increased by the year of 1910, with 92,407,000 people in the U.S., 13, 3444,545 of which were born outside of America, and 240,293 miles of railroad tracks. That's a lot of increasing over 50 years!               Its no wonder why all of these people came, with everything America had to offer. The 1800's really were what started making America what it is today.

They also moved to America because of the gold rush which 'pulled' immigrants to America.             It was easy to travel to America because since steam power was invented people could travel faster, and more efficiently. So that made it easier to get to a better place (A.K.A. The U.S.). So then that pulled even more immigrants to America.             Most importantly, Freedom. Some people came, only for that. The freedom of religion, of speech, and waking up in the morning and not have to worry about some soldiers breaking into you're home and taking you away to a prison or something.             Then the rest moved here to get away from wars or to find a better place to raise their children. So that they can grow up in a safer environment where poverty isn't an issue and soldiers aren't pattroling the streets. This is home.

Many people needed work because they need money to buy a home and food.These people were excited when they came to America because they came right in time.America has new technology! These technologies helped them when they were doing their job.However, this was only one of the reasons they moved to America.       In addition,some people moved because of war.Immigrants didn't want war and violent attacks.These Russian Jews escaped prejudice and persuction,which are the violent attacks.Several people such as Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses.Some younger siblings were left landless due to this war.These immigrants hope to find a new and better life for them and families in America.       Last but not least, many people moved to California for.....GOLD!!! Gold was found in 1848 in the property of John Sutter. However, John tried to keep this find a secret,but soon every one in San Francisco found out.Hundreds of peope left their city to set off and seek what they desired,gold.The news of gold spreaded everywhere in the United States adn to the rest of the world.The California gold rush has begun.In China, the people there felt hopeless when the Chinese government raised the taxes.But,they finally heard about the California gold rush and rushed over there to seek gold.More than 63,000 Chinese people were in the U.S.         	IN DT CD , JJ NNS VBN TO NNP IN JJ NN IN DT NNS VBZ IN PRP VBD JJ NNS VBP IN IN NN CC PRP VBD JJ '' TO JJ PRP VBD VBN IN NN RB PRP VBD TO DT NNP NNP NNS VBD NN IN PRP VBP NN TO VB DT NN CC JJ NNS VBD VBN WRB PRP VBD TO NNP IN PRP VBD RB IN NNP VBZ JJ NN .

Thats why in the later 1800s people began coming from european that had not send many people to america before.           All those extra people needed lots of items but there wasnt enough. Many of them came to america to find work and to aviod hunger.Then the secound half of the 1800s was a time of a great change in america. industry grew and many immigrants arrived on americas shore.The first railroad that crossed the united states was completed in 1869.

So i'll tell you what those reasons are.       I think one reason immigrants moved was because they were in a war zone.  One where bombs were going off. Everyone getting shot.  Arrows flying hitting people. I mean a zone where everthing you see is death.  thats a war zone that would draw them away.       Another reason immagrants probaly moved was because of a food shortage.  Or maybe even a drought.  Or just a bad area with lots of natural disaster           There are alot of other reasons immigrants could have moved.  But I did not list all of the reasons.

Another reason why people went to America is because some governments raised taxes.People didn't really had a lot of money in those days,So to pay the taxes they had to sell their stuff.for example if the farmers didn't have enough money then they had to sell their land.If that happened then there would be no crops and there wouldn't be enough food for everyone.That shouldn't happen in any place.       My third reason is when gold was discovered in the American River in California everyone including the Chinese went to look for it.In hope of having a fortune they all went to the American River in California to find gold.All because of the existence of that gold all the Chinese people and other people went to America.Wow!!! That was a great discovery that got a lot of attention and got millions and millions of people to America.The land now called'A Better Life.'      My fourth and last reason why I think people moved to America is because in the olden days it was very hard to travel to America.Now with steamships it's way easier.Without steamships there wouldn't be so much people in America as there is now.Steamships were very important in the old days.Without them life would be difficult for some people.      As you see this are my reasons to why people came to America in the 1800s.I did four reasons out of a thousand of them.America fixed a lot of problems for thousands of people.That's why they call America 'A Better Life.'

When people moved to America many found jobs many didn't . Today we are lucky to even go to school. many Latinos don't go to school . Have are going to hear stories of people who came in the last 200 years.        Germans were the next large group who came in the 1800's . after the Germans were the Irish were now the largest immigrant group . They kept coming, , during the war and after , mostly because the Irish were desperate because Ireland's crops were failing to grow. Food was now short in Ireland .1 million people died of starvation.         Later then , people from Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden ,and Hungary came o America . Everyone need extra homes and food to survive. many propel and religions came . Jews also came (although they were mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries) . Many came too but to escape the war . In total, there were 26 million people from all around the world . all that, in a 50 year period ! Just think about that 26 in America ! Most newcomer knew nothing about America or their new start for them . all they came for was : freedom and a chance to work .

There was a lot of slavery and the U.S.A. wanted to help those people who were slaves. The transportation was hard, but changed slowly to make it very easy to come to America. There were a lot of bad things and good things about transportation. Some people came to America just for the gold that was found here in the U.S.A. Most of the people who moved here for gold were the Chinese. Over the years many people have moved here in America and have stayed here to be free and live there lives fully in a very great habitat here in the U.S.A.             Another reason on why people moved to America is that people who could build, farm, or invent were welcome at any time to come and live in America. The people who came to America came at just the right time because people invented technology. There were very large groups of immagrants who came to America starting with the Germans and the Irish. People in Ireland came to America because there was a lot of starvation there. For example: more than 1 million people in Ireland died by starvation. Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Jews came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The jews were not treated very nicely at there homelands. Now in America there are people from all around the world who came to the U.S.A. and have lived here to grow generations of there families and to let there childrens children live happily here in the U.S.A. and for years and years to come.

Here are some reasons why people moved to America in the 1800s.      First of all, People came to America for happy reasons. For example, people moved to work. Working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America very quickly. This was a good thing because they were needed to work in new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Their work was very helpful to America.      Also, people came to America for sad reasons. For example, people living in Europe needed food, shelter, and jobs. Sadly, Europe did not have any of those things for them. It was a very sad situation. Therefore, they came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.      Finally, people came to America for Industrial reasons. The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry improved lots! For example, transportation improved, and the first railroad crossed the United States in 1869. This made it a lot easier to move silver and lumber from the West to the East. A trip from one place to another made it much easier for immigrants to travel.      Looking back on these facts, I realize that it was easy for some people to live, but not so easy for others. I have really enjoied reading this information about our country. Those were some reasons why people moved to America in the 1800s.

Irish came from Ireland  during the 1800s.  Irish who were working could build farms, but just in time there were a hole lot of activitys for them to do.  The Irish people came boat after boat.  As time came, there were plenty of things for them to do then they travel by steam boats.            Germens had made a single group of immigrants but in the 1800s. Still the Irish had the biggest immigrants group.rihgt before the cival war in the 1860s,  one-fourth of the hole population had came to america.  (That was 1.7 million irish men, women,  and children.)They kept coming during, and after the war.  They was pore because there crop have failed them especially there potato crops.

Many people came to America to find a place to work. Advances in technology brought people there too. One big attraction was the Gold Rush which sended thousands of people there. Most people outside of America knew very little about America, but what they did know was that it was a land of freedom, and that was what brought them there.         Many immigrants from all around the world needed a job. During the 1800's there was new technology in America so there was plenty of jobs avaliable. Some immigrants like the Irish came to America to flee from starvation and crop failure and to look for a job. Other immigrants like the Europeans came to America because there were too many people and there were few jobs, food, and homes avalible. Many people came to America to search for oppurtunites of jobs.         In the second half of the 1800's in America, technology grew. This made it easier to move resources and people to America. Inventions like the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many books and newspapers that made news and ideas available to more people than ever before. The invention of the telegraph and the telephone allowed people to become more aware of the world around them and more and more people moved to America. These inventions gave America more attraction.         In 1848, gold was discovered on the banks of the American River in California by John Sutter. News of this quickly spread and people all over the world came to America. Over 70,000 people arrived in California in 1849 in search of gold and fortune. Exciting news of the gold rush spread throughout China and many dreamed of making a fortune there. Soon, more and more people came to America. In search of fortune, this has brought many people to America despite the hard journey.         America was known as the land of freedom throughout the world. Job oppurtunities brought many immigrants to America to make a living. Advances in technology helped spread the news of America and made it a lot easier for people to come. Attractions like the gold rush brought many more people to America. That is why many people traveled to America despite the harsh journey.

Some reasons that people moved here is because of the lack of food. More than one million people died because of starvation.  Others came for religious freedom.  Railroads were being made and that made a huge change in transtportation.  Some also came because of the invention of steam power and the printing press.

The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America, industry grew and many immigrants arrived on the shore.This was true in Europe to travelers could now catch a train that would bring them to a boat.In early time a trip to America would take months, but new ships made it a faster trip.There was also a rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information travled.People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever before.Many European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe.          After gold was discovered more immigrants came to America hopeing to find gold. Over seventy thousand people looked for gold.Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast, the area could not produce enough rice to feed its people, especially when floods often destroyed crops.People felt hopeless and they listened closley to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean.The exiting news about 'Gold Mountin'spread throughout China, many people wanted to join the gold rush.The 325 Chinese Miners who joined the gold rush were just beginning,the next year 450 more chinese arrived in California.

The 1800's was a very busy time peroid for most immigrants. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's next to the Germans were the Irish, one-fourth of the whole populatin of Ireland. People moved to America in the 1800's because of starvation, they needed jobs and homes, and pulls and pushes.       The Irish were so desperate for crops because their crops had failed in Ireland. More than 1 million people died thanks to the starvation. So they had to come somwhere, which was America.  In Europe they started sending people too also to find work and avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom. Other stried to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.       People started to come  to America in the 1800's because they needed jobs and homes. The majority of the people that came to America came because of lose of food, jobs, and homes. These things are really important in like not to lose. If you lose these things of one of thesev things than you must comwe to America because it has all the stuff you need in order to survive.       Many peopkle cam e to America because of pulls and pushes. Pulls and pyushed are vary important in life too.  Pulls are those features of life that attract you. For instance gold brought millions of peiople around the worls. These include jobs, welth, oppotunities, access to resoyurces, and precieved freedom. Pushed are those features that drive people away from their homes. Such as harshy enviornmenmt, wars and other comflicts, and poverty.       In conclusion, people started to move to America in the 1800's because of starvation,  they needed jobs and homes, and of pulls, and pushes. Now you know what caused this outragiousincrease in population in America, in the 1800's. 	WRB VBD NNS VB TO NNP IN DT CD POS .

There was some bad things about it. Animals got in to your crops But every thing was good for everyone there.       They struck gold over in America. A lot of people went to get money. When they went they dug and dug and dug. A lot of people did not get any but they tried there best.  Gold is very expensive so a lot of people came to America because of that. Everyone thinks they are American but they have a little bit of something else.          Everyone came to America for some reason.  Maybe for a different life or freedom or even for gold. Lots of people had a nice life in America so, thank your grandparents for coming to America in is a great place to live.  These are some reasons why people came to America.

People move as often because Pushes are features of the life that helped people drive to their homes. Many of the push elements were made worse by a increase in the number of people in Europe. Pulls are features of the life that attracted people.    o        During the 1800s all of the working people who build farms, or invent all came to America in a ship.Technology in the 1800s was plenty for them to work in factories, to farms or to build things on land.The Germans made the largest single group of immigrants next to the Irish.One- forth of the whole population of Ireland came to America.All the Irish kept coming after the war.More than 1 million people kept dieing of starvation in Ireland. Later in the 1800s people started coming from other European countries.The Europe population doubled between 1750 and 1850.Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.In the total 26 million immigrants had come to America over a 50 year period.       The second half of the 1800s was a good change in America.The transportation had improved and the first railroad that had crossed the United States was completed.It became easier to move resources from west to the east people.  A trip like that just became easier.Travelers could now take a train right to a boat.People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move longer distances easily.Pulls are features that attract people.        The gold rush       The gold rush happened in 1848 along the American River in California on the property of John Sutter. Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret but word of the find soon reached San Francisco.Hundred of people left the city to go to the America River.January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. The California gold rush had begun.70,000 hopeful adventurers had arrived in California in 1849. 325 men from China. More of the Chinese came next year, and the next.    Immigrants came to America to have not worry about starvation, they didn't want to worry about anything, they came to America to fight for their rights and to be a equal right to this country.America is good for families to put food on their table a roof over their head and not to worry.That is why immigrants come to America and to have a free country.

People who are good at farming, building, and lots more sailed to America. People from Holland, Poland and many more countries came for religious freedom. Others came for work, shelter and food.                                                                                     Many people from Ireland came because of their failing crops. When the industry grew, a lot of immigrants came to America. Railroads were invented, so it made transportation a whole lot easier. A railroad actually crossed the whole United States! Lots of important products were moved across the United States, like lumber and silver.                                                             In 1848, gold was discovered in California. The word got around that their was gold, so lots of people came to America. Lots of the Chinese came, but not just for the gold. Most of them came from Guangdong. Guangdong was in the middle of two wars, so many of the Chinese left from Guangdong for gold, and to escape the hard life of poverty. The Europeans fled from Europe because of the rough conditions and problems. The Jewish left due to violent attacks and criticism.               As mentioned earlier, the Europeans were a big part in immigration. The Germans were the biggest impact, next to the Irish,who had 1.7 million come to America.                 The discovery of steam powered machinery had a big impact on immigration. Then came the printing press, that helped people make newspapers and inexpensive books. How convenient! Lets not forget about the telephone, which made news go around more fast. Lots of technology was developed over time, which lead people from all over to America.                As you can see, immigration had a big impact on America. Without immigration, most people in America wouldn't be here! In the time period of the 1800s, 26 million people came to America. 26 million people! Never forget that immigration helped America thrive.

Many people wanted freedom, a job, wealth and to escape a harsh enviorment. You will find out who immigrated to America, why, and the pushes and pulls of immigration.            Who immigrated to America?            Well, lot of different people from different countries immigrated to America like people from Germany, Ireland, China Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Sweden and many more. Out of all of these countries the Germans were the largest immigrant group. People immigrated to America for many reasons like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources and freedom. People also immigrated to America because of hard times in their home land like a bad enviorment, wars or other conflicts and poverty. These are called the 'Pushes' and 'pulls of immigration.            The Gold Rush.          The Gold Rush was another reason to immigrate to America, it made jobs and made some people rich. It all started in 1848 when John Sutter discovered gold along the American river in California. He tried to to keep it a secret but soon the word spread throughout the U.S. and to the rest of the world. By January of 1849, thousands of overland travelers and 60 ships were on the way to California. The gold rush had started. More than 70,000 people arrived in California in 1849. Among these people were 325 men from China. More kept on coming in search of a fortune in the California hills.            As you can see in the 1800s lots of immigrants immigrated to the U.S. Between 1860 and 1910 the population of America increased by 60,894,000 people. The 1800s were a key time for the U.S.                 	IN DT CD NNS IN NNS VBN TO NNP NNP NNS VBD NN , DT NN , NN CC TO VB DT JJ NNP NNP MD VB RP WP VBN TO NNP , WRB , CC DT NNS CC NNS IN NNP NNP VBD TO NNP .

Some immigrants moved to the United States because of job opportunities, food, welth, better homes, and saftey. When these people immigrate to the United States there population increases. It can also decres because of the disesius they can carry and many people can die.              Moving to a new state is not easy because it may not be the same as there other state! They will be hard to move from one state to another because the new languge they have to lean, making new friends, the diffrent foods, diffrent laws and diffrent culcure. There are many more reaasons like finding a job, hard to leave friends and family, making new friends and the diffrent money!!Why diffrent money you ask? well if they lived in Europe, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungary dont have the money that we americans have. So there money would be worthless.            Some people may ''push immigrants away from your home.'' Why you ask?? Well it really isnt why its more like how immigrants can move to diffrent states beacuse of wars they had, or there crops dont grow wich means they didnt really have many food. They had made an easier way for immigrants to travel to diffrent sates. So they can carry there important belongings.              Some people may 'pull immigrants'!! By all the things that attract people. Wich include jobs, money, freedom, better homes, and saftey!!That is why some people immigrate to the United States. It is better to move to the United States because alot of people from diffrent culcures immigrate here. Cuz' there is a little bit of everything.              Finally you can see how people immigrate to the United States of america. It is a very easy way of starting a new life! 	NNS NN . . .

The word immigration means when multiple people move from one country to another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The first reason is the harsh laws and ways these people lived back then. many people moved because of the opportunities that America gave to them like better jobs, more freedom, and a new start. This was true in Europe also. Travelers now could catch a train that would take them to a boat.                                                                                                                                                                    The second reason is the problems in the other country's. Next to Germany, the Irish  were the largest immigration groups, they moved here because the failing potato crops and the people dieing of starvation. About 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children migrated to America.                                                                                                                                                                                           Finally the attractants that took place in America like The California Gold Rush founded by a man named John Sutter, althoeugh Sutter tried to keep the discovery secret, word of the find soon reached San Fransisco, and hundreds  of people left the city to set off for the American River. the news spread to the rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world as well. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were heading for California. The California gold rush had begun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The American population grew a lot more scince 1860. In 1910 the population grew up to 92,407,000 people in the U.S. Many of people still immigrant today because of the wars, the starvation, and harsh laws.

Also they wanted to escape hars conditions in europe. The Russian jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the fom of pograms organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices.          In the 1800s Germans made up the largest single group of immigrant. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other european countries thet had not sent many people to America before.The secnod half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America.

For instance europians immagrated in amarica. Migrated means moved a long distance. Like eoropians moved from europe all the way to amarica.         Pushes and pulls are ways of migrating/moving. Pushes are features of lifethat drive people away. Like harsh environment,wars and other violence,and proverty. Pulls are features of life that attract people. This includes jobs, wealth, opportunities, acess to recourseshines,and percieved freedom.          Chinese also migraded but not in the same place as the europians. The chinese went to an amarican river on the property owned by John Sutter.Theres one particular reason though, GOLD! Gold was discovered in 1848 along that river. they went to the river to join the gold rush.                             	NNP PRP VB WP VBN CC VBN NNS .

I was scared when I got to school because, I though people will make fun of me and how I look.And that no one would say hi or bye. That they will talk behind my back.And one day a little girl came up to me and said what is your name,I was so happy.

Later on gold was dicoverd in California so lots and lots of Chinese migrants went to California to get out of poverty.We then later saw that resources started going up because we had more workers.This event was called the California gold rush,this is were most people made their money.                Here are some facts about this peroid in time.                      Number of people in the U.S. went way up from 1800s -1900s   30,000,000-90,000,000       Resources 20,000,000 tons- 400,000,000tons thats a lot right.

During the 1800s, people in other countries who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ships. The single Largest group was the Germans. Next to them were the Irish. Before the Civil War in the 1860s one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to the US. The Irish were desperate because Ireland crops were failing and there was a food shortage and more than 1 million people died of starvation.       In the later 1800s, more people from Europe started immigrating to America. The population in Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All of those extra people needed food, jobs, and homes. But there just didn't seem to be enough in Europe. Many came to the United States to escape hunger and to hopefully find work.       Others came for religious freedom. These included immigrants from Holland, and Jewish people from Germany, Poland, and Russia.(Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs.) Others came to escape wars that just made life too unstable and unpredictable. In total, 26 million immigrants came over to America in a 50 year period.       Sources: A History of Us. Hakim, Joy.

Many people were dying of starvation and lots of crops failed.People were also mistreated because of their religion and people wanted religious freedom from other people. Many people wanted freedom, jobs, and food they also heard about gold. People in China heard about gold in California and wanted some so the first year only 325 Chinese had come to North America.           The second half of the 1800's was successful because there was a lot of inventions that made it easier for people to travel to America because of things like the steam boat and steam engines that made it easier for goods and people to be transported across continents.People wanted to leave because of 'push/pull' factors that either pushed them away from their home and pulled them towards America.           Also the numbers increased from the 1860's to 1910 from population to number of daily newspapers,so many things changed in that time period.

Most of the immigrants came from the countries Russia,Ireland,Italy,Greece,Poland,Portugal,Chinese,Denmark,Sweden,and Hungary.   A lot of religious groups also came.A big group was the Jewish.     In the end the USA's population went up by 60,894,000 people because of the immigrants.

It was hard back then to travel thru storms and bad weather because they had no cars to drive them where they needed to go. They had to travel by foot, wagons, and ride horses to get to America. When the immigrants got to the U.S. they searched for jobs. They hardly ahd any money to buy food or feed their child. Once the immigrants got a job they had enough money to buy a home and was able to afford food to feed themselves and their children. More and more immigrants were able to get a job until many jobs started asking about their papers. Many immigrants got fired or sent back to where they came from. After several years immigrants started to get hired again. They had a better life now and were able to buy their own home. Immigrants now have good jobs and have a better future ahead of them and for their children too.

People had many pushs and pulls like for example. some pulls are,   jobs wealth opportunities access to recorces priceved freedoms   some pushs people may have considered are,   harsh inviorment wars hunger poverty no freedoms      There were many jobs avalible in America as traditions changed.jobs that were avalible were farming on rich soil,inventing things,working in factorys,and building great things.these jobs helped immigrants and America become well known.       Ierland,Germany,and Italy had people who migrated.   People also came for inventions like the   telegraph in 1844 the telephone in 1876 steam boats trains   These helped news and people get around faster. With the telephone helped people talk over long distances. Trains and steam boats carried people and resorces faster. America wouldnt be where it is now if it wasnt for some of these inventions.       All these things helped America become the great country it is now. If people wouldnt have had pushs we wouldnt be here. If people didnt have pulls we wouldnt be here. Also we wouldnt have the culture we have now. Its cause and affect.

In the late 1800s people from another European countries go to America because they have never go to America before. In total 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over 50 years period. The first railroad was built in 1869 which meant it became easy for people to go to another countries. The telegraph was invented in 1844 and telephone was invented in 1876only made news travel faster. Many of new European immigrants want to escape harsh conditions. Immigrants people hope that they have their new life and their family in United States.       The gold rush was discovered by John Sutter in 1848 along the Americain river in California. Some Chinese people heard about the gold rush so they move to California to find the gold. China and Britain had a war family, villagers help the china war. Britain was upset with China's Goverment. The chinese goverment have to raised taxes. Espically farmers couldn't pay taxes so had to sell their land. Their were lots of Chinese people joining the gold rush because they wanted gold. There were 325 Chinese people joining the gold rush but they were just some Chinese people that are beginning next year there were even more Chinese people there were 450 Chinese people arrived.

Second people wanted to go some were easier and America had the solution the first railroad track was completed in 1869. Third people want to get some gold so they went to California           First of all people want to have enough of important stuff like food. Another thing that people need is a home because if you don't have a home you don't have a shelter and with out a shelter you not protected from rain. Last is everyone needs a job so they can buy a house and get money because without a job you can't buy a house or earn money and people need that to buy important things like a house and food. And that's why some of the people moved to America.           Secondly people to places fast and easy people don't want to be late for there jobs. Even if they just want to look around they can just catch train that will take for a trip around California. Most of the people just used it for getting home and getting to there jobs. Some of the people used it just for a trip ended up moving there.And that is why some people moved to America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Finally  most of the people moved here because of the Gold Rush more than 70,000 people moved here because of the gold rush. People would call California 'Gam Saan' or gold mountains. most of those 70,000 people were Chinese. Some of those people even came over sea more than 60 ship filled with thousands of people.             This will conclude my essay so as you can see most of the people had a good reason to come to America some people came because they needed more resources some came here for an easier transportation and most of the people came for the Gold Rush.

Most people came to be free others came for work.They also were mistreated by other people like them.         People or immigrates came all over the world for different reasons and I I'm going to tell you one. Jews and Holland were  mistreated for there religious beliefs.  So that why they came to America to be free and not judged by the way they believe. Greeks also wanted to escape where home land to have a new life for themselves and families.       Others wanted to leave because there was not a lot of food were they lived. Like in Ireland many of their crops failed but mostly their potato crops. About 1 million people died of starvation. Also  Europeans   had a harsh time with food supplies but came to America to avoid it.        Many Chinese came to America.   There was about 77% of Chinese people living in California. Most of them came for the gold that they had in California so they lefted there home land. There was so many of them here that they made the very first train and rail road tracks. That made it easier to travel around in California.Also England made a rail road track..        Many people came all over the world to the U.S.A for freedom ,food and gold. A lot of them  are still here today enjoying life as it is today.  And glad they are in America that changed their life forever. That the many reasons way they are here now.

Every time they would build or invent something they would go to America ship after ship.Then their was this thing called Push and pulls.            Push was a feature that would drive people out of their homes ,and these include harsh environments and wars. pulls is a feature that attracts people like jobs and other great opportunities. And now you see why people wanted too come to America.            Also many people from Europe came and brought diseases. So many of the Native Americans died because of that. More than 70,000 adventures arrived in California.        The Gold Rush was discovered in 1848 in the American River. And that was under the name of John Sutter. And when the word got out hundreds of people left city for the river.            And now you know how crazy it was whenever the gold rush got founded and how many immigrants came to America. And the number of people in the U.S in 1910 92,407,000.And this is my story about America.

The largest single group was the Germans and next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest group. Before the American Civil War, 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children moved to America. They were moving there because their crops have died out. They were trying to get away from starvation in Ireland. About 1 million people died of starvation there.        Later in the 1800s, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and other places started travling from other European countries that had not sent that many people to America before. The population doubled between 1750 and 1850. They all needed homes, jobs, and homes. They came to America to avoid hunger and find work.        Others came for freedom. That included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Russia, Germany, and Poland. Others still came to escape wars.        The second half of the 1800 hundreds was a great increase in America. Many immigrants came on America's shores. Travelers could catch a train that took them right to a boat. The boat traveled faster now then before.        More people came aware of the world around them and the ability to move along distances easily, they moved more than before. The moved because of 'pushes' and 'pulls.' Pushes were features of life that moved people away from their homes. Pulls are features of life that attract people.        Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. Hundreds of people left the city and went off to the American River in San Francisco. By January of 1849, thousands of overland travelers and 60 ships were heading for California. The gold rush had begun.       The first immigrants from China were from Guangdong. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong had two wars between China and Britain. There were also rebellions against the government. The Chinese government raised taxes, but the farmers were unable to pay. They had to sell their land.       People felt hopeless. They listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. They called it Gam Saan or 'Gold Moutain.' They made their fortunes and returned to China.       The good news about that was many people China heard about it and wanted to join the gold rush. There was 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849. When it was just beginning. 450 more Chinese arrived the next year. Suddenly they came in greater numbers such as 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. In 1870 there were about 63,000 Chinese in the US. Although they could be found throughout the country most of them were in California.        That's what happened in the 1800s. Many people from other countries came to America. They came for jobs, better lifes, and for the gold rush.

After lots of immigrants moved to America , lots of things improved like transportation.It became easier and easier to travel place to place.Back then people could take a train to a boat to take them some other place.Even boats with lots of people would take them to America.            Also in the 1800s was the gold rush in California.During the gold rush almost every thing increased like the number of people in America to the Daily newspapers.There was about 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush.          26 million immigrants came to the united states in 50 years. one of the many reason is that they wanted freedom. A chance to get a job was also one of the many reason too.still some immigrants wanted to escape the wars they were living in the other life.          The number of people of people then and no in America is a jaw-drop er 31,513,000 was then and now 92,407,000.Also 77% was in California for the gold rush .the Chinese called it the 'Gold mountoin'.THE END.

The work that they wanted in America are people who could build, farm, or invent. There was plenty to do with the new technology.             Germans made up the largest single group immigrants in the 1800s.   The Irish were the largest immigrant group at the time. Before the Civil War, one-fourth of the population of Ireland came to America. That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. They kept coming to America during and after the war.           In the late 1800s, people started coming to America from European countries. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.

Many people moved because of religious reasons.   many other people moved because they knew that the United States is a Free Country, and they wanted a free life for them and their family.   Many other people moved because their crops have failed and they heard that the United States has very fresh and delicious crops here.   There are many other reasons that I know and i don't know why people moved here (immigration) to the United States.   Those were a few examples of why people moved here.   People are very grateful that they have moved here because they have a better life here.

Many people from Ireland were coming from there to America.The people in Ireland were very desperate.They were desperate because they had hardly any food.Thier crops were dying and finally if they  didnt have any food then soon many children and many adults would soon die from starvation.Not to long they didnt find any food and soon many people died from starvation.       People came from all over the world including Italy,poland,Russia,Demark,and more.Men and woman had excaped from war.The people who has excaped from war had  went to America and they made life unstable and unpredictable.the population doubled from where they were in the beggining.There were alot of men,childrenmand woman who had came from where they were to America.        Finally More than 26 million people had come for thier freedom and probroly from starvation and from thier crops dying.And to this day there are probroly even more people coming to America than there was before.The population from 1750 to the 1850 the population from America went up higher.Even the people from America needed extra homes for the more people that came to America.

Some of the immigrants were people like: Europeans, German, Poland, Russian, there were also Jews and many more people from many more different states.        We celebrate these people because they are the ones who gave our state more population. The number of people we had in the United States in 1860 was about 31,513,000. In 1910 we had about 92,407,000. We had 4,096,753 people come to America in 1860 and had 13,344,545 come to America in 1910.        Did you know that the Chinese people also came to America. They came to America in January 1849 in ships. There were 60 ships and thousands of travlers on the ships. All of those ships were headed toward California. They came because there was a war going on beween China and Britain. Most of China sailed over to California.The Chinese gave California a new name, Gold Mountain. Thats what they called California.        Over the years America has changed for the immigrants. Most immigrants got jobs and some even invented new things for all to see. Some people didn't always have good times though because the Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions in Europe. Immigrants hoped with all their hearts to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States.

All  those extra people needed food, shelter,  and jobs but there just diden't seem to be much of that.

Some did because they needed homes. lots of imigrints moved to America about 4,096,753. Imigrints also moved here for freedom, jobs, gold, and land.                      Freedom was one of the reasons many imigrints choose to come to America. In some countrys religion and beliefs are forced to obey. Such as jews germans and more. Freedom lets the people believe and do what they want by them selves.                      Another reason they came was the gold rush. Alot of chinese people came because the gold in America. Gold was worth a fortune. And still is today.                      The third reason is imigrints needed jobs. So they worked for people. Some invented things and some helped out with those type of things. Even building railroad tracks for train transportation. Land is also a big reason they came. They needed homes.                       In conclusion the imigrints get freedom, land, gold, jobs, and homes. America gave all those things to them. It also still gives today.

You could create, build a farm, or make a small town! There was new technology as well along with factories. There were many jobs open for all, and enough to pass around. And that's exactly what the immigrants needed. Jobs, wealth, religious freedom, and food.   Let's begin on the immigrant(s) that needed jobs and other things.   Europeans: Europeans didn't have enough jobs in Europe! That meant there wasn't enough money for families to buy food, water, clothes, etc. And for survival, they moved to America to gain the jobs they needed.   Next, is the immigrant(s) that needed wealth and other catagories.   Chinese: Many Chinese people traveled to America to escape poverty and gain fortune. Mainly, because there was the Gold Rush running around in California (which they called Gam Saan). Might as well try, right? It was a certainly better option then starving to death or getting placed in prison. China was raising taxes impossible for the people to pay and their crops were growing too low to even come close to the pay, so they had no other choice than to go to to America.   Last, but not least, the people who came for religious freedom.   Russian Jews: Due to the war against Jews, and wars made by the famous and Terrible Hitler. The Jews ran away in order to survive, and came to America. 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP DT NN IN DT CD TO DT CD , NNS VBD JJ CC VBN IN NNP NNP MD VB , VB DT NN , CC VB DT JJ NN .

It also might be because people were living in harsh conditions or were living on battle grounds.            A big reason why people wanted to move to America is because of oppurtunities. There was plenty of jobs. There was also advances in technology and their was also better ways of transportation.          Another big reason why people wanted to move to America is  because of hardships. People did not have freedom to have religous beliefs. Another thing is that innocent people were caught in between wars and living on the baatle fields. Alos people were struck by poverty and hunger.       Many people moved to america in the 1800s. Whether it was hardships or attractions that brought them here everyone wanted a better life.

Life is getting hard, and we don't have much time.  If we don't act soon, famine will soon come.  We are running out of time. Going to America will hopefully help us out with all of these problems.  So I'm going to take my family there.       When we were traveling, I noticed it was taking awhile to make progress on the trip.  It was really crowded with other families and cargo.  There were what seemed like huge family's trying to bring almost everything they owned because they could not bear the leaving their valuables behind.  I almost thought the ship would sink because there were so many people and cargo.  But, we were getting there.       Arriving at America was amazing, but also sad because we had just left our country where we grew up behind.  We were also confused with how many cultures were in America. There was a lot more freedom there than I could ever imagine.  We walked around and saw many worship places like churches.  The only step left was to get a job, and find a home.       Finding a job wasn't that hard; in fact it was very easy.  The only problem... I couldn't find a home.  My job payed well, but not well enough to find a home.  Instead, we found a homeless shelter. We slept their and ate very little, but this was better than the previous.        Looking back on the decision now, makes me proud. I know I could have done better, but we made it.  I personally think it was a good idea.  Life is better now that I've emigrated.  I really wouldn't do anything different!

Although, most of the time it is because of push and pull factors.  A push factor is when you are driven out of you home for various reason.  A pull factor is when you are pulled out of your home, often it is because greater things await.       Lots of people have to leave their country because of push factors.  An example of a push factor is wars. Some people do not like being around fighting so they often move so they do not have to deal with that.  Also, people often move because of religious freedom. In some countries, they make their people believe in only on thing, but sometime people have different beliefs, so the move so they are able to believe in what the want.  Some people move because of harsh enviorments.  Sometimes there is often random bombings, or shootings, and they are feel like they are in danger. Most times, people move because there is alot of poverty in their area, so they move to try and get jobs and money.  Often, there is a famine, therefore they have to move to be able to get food.       Several people move to a different county because of pull factors.  One example of a pull factor is that ther might be more or better jobs here in America.  Some people may be unhappy with their job in there old county so they move to find a better one.  Other people move because they will have lots of resources, such as food, water, and many other things.  Sometime it is even educational resoures.  Lots of people move because of the California Gold Rush. During that time, people were hoping to find gold and strike it rich!       Other times, people move just because they want to experience an adventure. They might want to start a new life with different people, in a different country!  They may be tired of doing the same things everyday, so they move to be able to change their lives and try somthing different! People often move so they can go to collage in a different country.  They often want to experience going to a school in a different country.       In conclusion, people move to different countries for lots of different reasons!

They were finally relizing that america was awesome and that they should come. Ireland was the first country to open their eye's, after that Europe came and said whats up. We let all of the imagrants in and that was our way of saying what up.       The emigrants came for more reasons than the U.S. being awesome. They also came for work and others for freedom of religion. They were not aloud to beleive in anything else in some countrys but here you can believe anything most of the U.S. are christain but they are not forced tho beleive in one god and jesus.

People can move from Africa all the way to America for religious reasons, it doesn't matter why. Its just like when the Germans went to America because they heard there is good jobs there. People will just travel somewhere just to travel.        Most people travel because of money problems,or they need a job. The Irish, they also traveled to America because Ireland crops were failing on them. Its kinda like the Russian Jews they traveled away from there home town to somewhere else because of religious reasons. There was very many reasons people left there homes for new homes.         In 1869 there was millions of people traveling from America because of the new railroad track that was just finished. The population was increasing every single day. Europe's population increased very much in between 1750 and 1850. More than 26 million traveled to the U.S.A. The population in places was getting out of hand.         A man named John Sutter found gold in 1848. The word spread across the globe,by 1849 60 ships and thousand of travelers were coming to get some. Chinese people were becoming poor because there crops were not helping. These Chinese people called the mountain with gold on it 'Golden Mountain'. The name stuck and to this day the mountains name is the same.         Immigration was big back then and it still is to this day. There are more immigrants today then there was 20 years ago. It is easier for immigrants to move today, because of a automobile and there is planes. Immigration will always be around.

They came ship by ship across the oceans to get to America. There was a lot of stuff for them to do. They needed to work in new factories,to work on land,build,farm,and invent new things.            The largest immigrats grups was Germans and irish. in 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of ireland came to america, they kept coming,during and after the war. the irish were desperate because in ireland crops had failed, especially potato crop.

First reason is because we had enough food for them to avoid hunger . Second reason why is because, we had enough houses homes and other places to live. The last reason is because they can get jobs faster in America.             Here are some more reasons why they moved over here. First they moved over here because their crops started to die and they sometimes got destroyed by floods. Second they lost there homes farms. Also because their countries made them go America. The last reason is because they kept losing their jobs.              Through 1800 and 1876 they have made a couple of things. The first thing is the railroad it help to get other places really quick. The second thing is they started to make a train and that made transportation much faster. Then they invented a telegraph. Then by 1876 they invented the first telephone that mad news go by faster.                In 1849 gold was discovered. They were trying to keep it a secret but soon reached San Fransisco. Around 70,000 people came they were called 'Forty-Niners.' 325 of those men where from china. More Chinese came the next year. The they made tales about it, it was called the gold mountain.                                                                                       In 1849 Chinese came over here because they were fleeing from poverty. Also because they were trying to escape the war. Also many of them were rebellion to the government. They were rebellion because they  started to raised taxes. Framers that were unable to pay had to sell there land. Last is that the population was unable to grow enough rice for people can eat.

Some people who didn't get a job, got one working with technology. One-fourth of Ireland came to America. Irelands crops were failing and so they were short on food supply. People died from starvation in Ireland. (more than 1 million) 1750 and 1850 the population of Europe doubled. There wasn't enough food, houses for all the new people so, Europeans moved to America to avoid hunger. Holland, Jews came to America from Germany, Poland, and Russia for religious freedom. Most of all the people who came to America were looking for Freedom and a chance to work.                People moved to California for the gols rush to come back to their home country with richness. I think it was very hard to move so far away from their home country. But i think if they were moving for freedom or to avoid hunger it will be easier to move away. Plus it was easier for people to move because of the faster tranpotaion.

There was lots of new technology in the 1800s. There was plenty of work for immagrants to do. There were factories to work in, Farms to build and things to invent. The germans were the largest group in America. The Irish were the second group of immagrants in america because they crops were failing. That included their biggest crop the potato. In the 1800s there were 1.7 million kids, men and women all togeter. They didin't stop coming before and after the war. There was food shortage all over. More than 1 million people died form starvation. Then Europeans started coming over. They were from Russia , Italy, Polan, Denmark, Sweden and Hungray. The population doubled in size. They all needed food, homes and jobs. They came for religios belief and to avoid starvation. Lots jews came for religios belief. In 50 years there were over 26 million immagrants in America.   In 1869 the first railroad was built. lots of chineses immagrants came over, to build the railroad. The chinese government also raised taxes. Lots of farmers lost their farms and came over to build the railroad. There were lots of family feuds because of the taxes tht the chineses government raised. China already had lots of birth rates. The chinese could not produce enough rice to feed al of the chinese. They could only have one child Then there was also the gold rush. 325 men from china went to discover gold. China was  in a war with Great Britian.  Another wave of chinese immagrants came . This time there were 400 men. 77 % of the chinese immagrants were diiging gold in california. In 1870 there were 63,000 chinese immagrants in America. Americans called it gold moutain. The chinese called it Gam Saan. Lots of them hoped to head back to china with arms full of gold. The chinese immagrants made 30,626 miles of railroad tracks.

One of the best reasons they came i think is because the gold was discovered.

Later Russia, Italy,Poland,Denmarkand Sweden,but not many.Europe started to get much more people between 1750 and 1850.they came  because it got way to fool. they came to avoid hunger. Others cain the Ame for religious freedom.Some were jews that came from Germany. Jews were often mistreated in there country .                       In 1869 the first railroad to cross the united state was done. It became much easier to move silver and lumber.People could also travel on the trains.It became much easier to go to far places.                       In 1844 the telegraph was invented.They started to make newspapers and books .this made them keep in touch . In 1876 the telephone was invented to.

The Germans made up the bigest single to wrone the immigrant in the 1800s.The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. others came for religious    freedom. But that's what they wanted:freedomand chance to work.              Transportation improved. This was true in Europe also.

At the time many wars going on ,so people tried to move away from that.

Your parents might not have a job or a high enough paying job for you to survive.               Going to school would probably be very hard sence you won`t know much about what your reading or what your teacher is saying. You might even get bullied because you arn`t as smart as the  other students.

Some they might have the 'push' and the 'pull' theory, and some moves because of there is more jobs over in United States when people had invented new technology. Gold was also discovered in California in 1848.             During the 1800s America has invented many new technologies which people came to work on. The United States built a railroad across the Country with mostly of the immigrants. It made people and silvers or lumber easier to transport. Even though they have also invented a steam boats which goes faster when you travel on water. In 1844 people have more ideas like they invented the tele graph in 1844 and a telephone in 1876. Telephones made news go faster around. Pushes are those features of life that people willl need to go away form their very own homes. Features of life that attract alot of people is pulls. It include many stuffs like jobs and more.             During the 1848 gold was discovered in California by a owner named JOhn Sutter. He tried very very hard to kept it as a secret but soon news from over the United States came from countries. There was more than seventy thousand peopole arrived in people in the next year. Chinese came in of a couple hundreds of people but it came alot more next year. Chinese goverment started ot raised taxes. by the 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese who arrived to california.

Well the Chinese came around like 1849 or also called the 49ers There was only 325 Chinese people during the first year, but after that thousands of people came to America for gold wealth and opportunities of business. everyone wanted gold some people went crazy and died  for digging. Then of people of immigrants there were 4,096,753 people that were immigrants.          Pulls are when people are attracted to things in America, like jobs wealth opportunities and more. These are what made America popular, they also helped with the economy. Pushes are when people are unattractive to America things like war environment and other conflicts these also drove away a lot of people and these are very important to be aware of in America.          The most popular people that came to America was the Germans in fact then the Irish and plenty more the Irish came because of the failure of crops and potatoes and they need people so most came to America and for fortune for gold. The Germans came because The need more space so most move to America or because of religious freedom and for more rights.      	LS `` WRB VBD DT NNP NN TO NNP IN DT JJ NN CC WRB JJ NNS VBD .

It was very exciting to the immagrants because they could start a whole new life in a whole new place. They became very interested. The main reasons that they wanted to immagrate, is because of the California Gold Rush, Economy, and some people just heard that it was a great place to live.               First, is because of the California Gold Rush. Many people heard that the most valuable resource was found in California. People came rushing to get it all before everyone else did. The population of California went from a big amount of people to a huge amount of people. Some people decided to move there and stay in case of more gold that was found. They were very quick to get to the gold and made alot of people immagrate.            Next, is because of the economy. Many people needed better jobs for more money because they needed more to make a living. They all rushed and migrated into America. It was frustrating for everybody to find what they wanted from the different countries. They all rushed to find what they needed. Most of them were satisfied, but some weren't. They all looked very hard for what they wanted. It was very diffiult for everyone.

With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all that.       Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. ( That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children)       Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on property of a man named John Sutter. Although Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River.       The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East.       In conclusion, the 1800s was a hard working time for all. In total, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Think about that 26 million!

More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.                Later in the 1800s people started coming from other countries in Europe. These people were the Russians, Italians, Polands, Swiss, and from Hungary and Denmark. These people came for many various reasons. Those people needed food, homes, jobs, and clothing. And their country didn't have enough of it for everyone. Some people came for religious freedom. These people were Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia.                Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California by a man named John Sutter. Many people soon found out about the secret of John Sutter, as he was keeping his discovery quiet. Many of the Chinese came to California in 1849 trying to strike gold because in Guandong they were in the middle of a war with China and Britain. Another reason why they came is because the Chinese government raised taxes and the Chinese couldn't pay their taxes and had to sell their land.                   It doesn't matter where you come from or why. Everyone deserves to live a fair life. It doesn't matter if you're Chinese, Swiss, Italian, German, Jewish, Black, or any nationality or color or if you believe in something someone else does not. Everyone was created equally and should be treated equally. Who cares if someone doesn't believe on something you don't? Who cares if the color of someone's skin is different to yours? It really doesn't matter. We're all human and should be treated like human.

Others immigrated from China in order to be involved in the California Gold Rush. There are several different reasons as to why people came to the United States.            Russian Jews came to America to have religious freedom. Jews left to escape prejudice and the harsh persecution and the violent attacks. They, along with many others from the European continent, were also sick of the harsh conditions that Europe had to offer. Everyone seemed to want to escape the hunger, unpredictable war outbursts, and of course having no control over yourself or desicions.            The Irish came to America to try and pry themselves out of the food shortage in their home country. They were willing to work wherever just to have a nice, hot meal in order to survive. Migrating to America seemed to be the only smart idea at the time for them, because everyone knew America was the free land that seemed to have everything in one's wildest dreams. Irish families were willing to do anything as long as it meant surviving, and if that meant going to America, then so be it.            Lastly, the immigrants of China got word the gold had been discovered along the American River in the great, sunny state of California in 1848. The Chinease decided the wanted to be in on the action, along with being free citizens, so, in 1849, various Chinease people jumped on one of 60 ships that were heading toward good ol' California. A little over 70,000 greatful adventurers arrived in California in 1849, also nicknamed the 'Forty-Niners'. In the huge group of 'Forty-Niners', consisted of 325 men from China, but the following year, California would expect more from China to arrive. The Chinease wanted to find fortune, as well as the others, to provide for themselves.            In conclusion, this essay provides information to prove how intriguing America must have been back in 1800s to foreiners from all over. For those who escaped peacefully must have found what they were looking for. It still amazes me today that America stands with open arms to anyone who feels like they need an escape from where ever it is they may be.

Most immigrants came to America so they could find work. When they arrived in America they rushed out to find work so they could farm, build land, and invent things. Immigrants was able to do all of this. Germans were the largest single group of immigrants next to Irish immigrants. The Irish immigrants came because there crops weren't doing well.         Second, changes in America got eaiser for immigrants. When the change happend transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was complered in 1869. The new steamships had made a trip to America much faster. Then, the invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 made the news travel much faster.         Third, was the gold rush. Gold was discoverd in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in search of Gold. The Chinese govenment raised taxes when no one could find gold.

All of Irelands crops were failing to grow especially the potatos. Another reason was the Gold Rush in California. One more reason was because of the wars. They also wanted to come to America because we have freedom. They also wanted to make new lives for themselves.                 Second, another reason was because of the increase for jobs. One more reason was all the wealth Americans had compared to their country. Another reason was that Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions of Europe. One more reason was that they could practice their beliefs. Russian Jews left to escape prejuduced persecution. Italians suffured from high birth rates and low farming losses do to lower prices.             Third, the Chinese fleed from Guangdong because of conflicts and poverty. People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweedan, and Hungary left because extra people needed food, homes, and jobs. The Chinese also had family and village feuds and many rebellions against the government. Many Europeans came to find work and to avoid hunger.

Immigrants left America for many reasons.       First of all, Most of the immigrants left their countries because their country was restricting their people's religious freedom. No one wants to be told what to believe in. Another reason why they left might be because their country let their people die of starvation.\       Lastly, the California Gold Rush had caused many people to leave their countries so they can go to California and maybe get rich. The Chinese were the majority to leave China. the called California Gam Saan, 'Gold Mountain.

Lot of people had many resons for that.       The first reason was that lots of Ireland moved to America was because there counrty had very little food for the people in Ireland. So they moved to America to avoid hunger and to have jobs.       Many people were attracted to jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resource, and perceived freedoms.That's another reason why many people moved to America.            Chinese immigrants moved to Chinese because of the gold that was found in the land of John Sutter. They wanted the gold because back home the government raised taxes, and lots of peple were unable to pay there taxes so they had to seelm there homnes/land.

Immigrants did all that.        People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily, the moved more than ever than before. the reasons they moved often characterized 'pushes' and ''pulls.'' Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes. These include a harsh enviroment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Many of these push elements were made worse by a rapid increase in the number of people in Europe. Pulls are those features of life that attract people.

I believe some of the reasons were because of poor living conditions, wars, shortage of money and jobs, and many other different reasons. People also moved to America for gold. More reasons they I believe they moved to America is because of some of the things that attracted them. Such as, gold/wealth, jobs, better living conditions, and how quickly information traveled. Another thing that I think was a reason immigrants came to America was because people were driven from their homes. I hope when people arrived here they got what they came for.

During the time countries were having lots of trouble except for America, so that caused people to migrate so immigrates from all around the globe came to America. Luckily for America that was when all kinds of new technology was here so that offered people jobs, like farming, working in factories, build, or even invent things. But it was worse for the Irish, because more than 1 million people died of starvation. And that caused one-forth which is 1.7 million Irish men,women, and children of the whole population of Ireland to come to America.           During the later 1800's people started coming from other European countries because of their start of food storage. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. And others came for religious freedom these included people Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total, about 26 million immigrants came to the U.S. in over a 50 year old period. And this is what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. And they got it.

When the most immigrants came to America was in the 1800s, most of them came then because that is when a lot of the country's were at war or just not being fair to the people who lived there. Did you know that the Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants to to come to America in the 1800s. Then the Irish, before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-forth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.) They kept coming, during and after the war. the Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. this included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweeden, and Hungary.            The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores.Transportation got better and the first railroad that crossed the U.S was completed in 1869. This was a sign that pretty soon traveling would be easier and easier. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. This was true in Europe too. Travelers   now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, however new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advantages in transportation made it possible  for more people to travel more easily. People became more aware of the world around them and the ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever before.                            Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. A man named John Sutter owned the property and he wanted to keep the gold discovery a secret. However the word got out and soon people from all over the world were looking for the gold. Most of the first wave was chinese and came from a place called Guangdong, an area on chinas south coast.

First i'm going to talk about why the Chinesse moved here.  Second i'm going to talk about why the irish moved to America.             The Chinesse moved to America in the 1800's.  They moved to America because in 1849 a man named John Sutter.  Although Sutter tried to keep it a secret he couldn't and in time 325 men from China came to America and each year it increased.  Most people came from a city that was at war with Britain.  They also moved because they were raising there taxes and didnt have enough money.              The Irish moved to America in the 1800's as well.  1\4 of the irish moved because tthere crops were dying. The patato crop was the most that was dying.

America's population grew by a ton of people, mostly Germans and people from Ireland. There were many reasons why people moved from their country, including health.       People refer to being forced away from their country as 'pushing.' Many people migrated to America because they were pushed out of their own country. Russian Jews were pushed out of their country because people started doing organized, violent attacks on them. Other people, such as people from Ireland, were forced to move because many crops died. Moving to a place because you want to live there, is known as 'pulling.' Many people also thought America would be a better place to live, so they moved there. Some other countries had harsh weather, causing people to move to America to get better weather. Other people hoped to find better jobs there, so they can earn more money to live.       The Chinese also came to America in 1848 to get some gold too. There were 325 men in all, and later, more people came.The gold was real popular at the time, and it became more popular as years passed.       America was not just popular for the gold though. The weather was way nicer in America than it was in a lot of other countries. There was also more jobs available in America, causing it to also be wealthier. In America, people could believe what they wanted to believe, without feeling threatened in any way.       Moving to America didn't just help the immigrants start a new life, it also helped America itself. From 1860 to 1910, America's population grew by over 30,000,000 people. Also, the amount of miles of railroad tracks grew by almost 210,000 miles! Coal production also grew about 400,000,000 tons!       People who live or migrated to America not only helped themselves, but they also helped America grow! Through the 1800's, people migrated more than ever in America. This helped America grow bigger, and it helped America become a stronger country.

Some places immigrants came from were Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Three details for this is the history of immigrants, changes in America, and the gold rush.        The History of Immigrants is that at  first only people that could build, invent, and farm came on ships to America. This was because America needed these types of workers for all the new technology they got. The immigrants came from many places around the world. A couple of the many places they came from are Germany and Ireland.         Two reasons immigrants came to America were pushes and pulls. Pushes are the features of life that drive people from their homes. Some pushes were harsh environment, wars, conflicts, and poverty. there were also pulls. Pulls are the features in life that attract people. A few examples are jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.          Another reason they came to America was because of a gold rush. A man named John Sutter lived on a property that had the gold rush. He tried to keep it a secret but that didn't happen. After a while the word got around San Francisco and hundreds of people moved to America. 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were on their way to California by January of 1849. That started the California gold rush.          Those three reasons were why all those immigrants came to America in the 1800s. Even though they traveled very far they got what they wanted. That was freedom and gold!          	NNP PRP VB IN IN DT CD JJ NNS VBN TO NNP .

Migration is in process!!!In the 1800's there was a lot of migration. Most of the time people migrated for many reasons like: shortage of food, harsh conditions, and more money.                     I'M SO HUNGRY! That is what a lot of people said in the 1800's. Back then, there wasn't that many resources, so one way to get food was to crop them, but a lot of the time it would fail. So, people were left with no food. Then, some people decided to migrate to America where the soil was better and their crops would grow better. This idea left people less hungry.                     Ouch! In Europe a lot of people migrated to America because of their harsh conditions. People were often treated very poorly. So, we can just say that in that country, you would be treated very 'roughly'.                Money, money, money!!! That is what everybody wanted! In 1848 the Gold Rush had started. People from China came all the way to California for gold. They all wanted to be rich so they could buy resources because back then, there really wasn't any resources that you could get for free.               After all this migration the United States became very popular. After 50 years of migration the U.S. population went up over 90 million people! WOW!             	NN IN DT CD POS NNP .

During the 1800's lots people started traveling like the Europeins, and people who are from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Still other came from wars that made them move from were they were at before. Alltogether, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States more than a 50 year period.                           Some of the people that lived in Ireland moved to the United States. They move because there was a hunger problem in Ireland, the crops didnnt grow any more there was no food so thats why Ireland had immigrents. Alot of people died from Ireland of the problems they had over there.There was 1 million that died of starvation.So thats why most of the Irish moved here.

This story tells about the Europeans who farmed, built, or invented in the 1800s. Also how they and their families moved to America to be able to do so. However not only Europeans migrated,; it was also Germans, Russians, and Irish. If you farmed you would move to have better soil and better weather. Not only farmers moved people such as Jews moved to get freedom of religion. While others came to escape all the pain, and suffering they went through in wars going on at their homes.                         The number of immigrants that came to America adds up to about 26 million; that was only in a 50 year time period. Many newcomers knew a very small amount of things about America. Actually the really only thing they knew about our wonderful country was that it was a land of freedom! That's exactly why they came here; to be free and have work!                                                          CHANGES IN AMERICA                             That was only the first half of the 1800s. The second was a time of great change. Many more immigrants just showed up in boats and boats full of people! Also many things improved such as; the industries, and transportation. Their was an actual railroad built in 1869 this made it much easier to transport things. Just encase your wondering the things they would transport were things like: lumber (wood), and silver. They really needed this railroad because the silver was migrated from west to east.                          It turns out that America wasn't the only country that got new railroads; because Europe got one too. When Europe got new railroads travelers could get on a train, which would take them to a boat, and the boat would take them to America. Now that you think about it railroads really just increased America's population and decreased Europe's. Railroads help America get more immigrants and helped form our beautiful country that we have today!                           News traveled fast in the 1800s, with the help of News papers and press. These press and steam power helped print books as well. Another thing that helped the fast as lightning speed of news traveling is the telegraph. The telegraph was invented in 1876.                           The most often reason the immigrants migrated is the pushes and pulls. The pushes are those reasons that make someone move out of their home, town, state, or country. The pulls on the other hand are the reasons that make people want to visit that place. Otherwise known as an attraction.                                                    GOLD RUSH!! CHINESE MOVE TO CALIFORNIA                                                         In 1848 something was discovered, something that caused more immigrants to travel to America than ever! That something is known as Gold. Gold was discovered some where along the American River in California on a property owned by a man named John Sutter. This man was stingy! He wanted to keep the gold for himself. Somehow the word got out all over San Fransisco. People wanted gold. So then started the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush is where people start a gold mine and dig for gold. More than 70,000 people came to dig, hoping to find just an ounce of gold.                           You know that football team the 49ers? Well the gold rush was in 1849 so they called the people digging the 49ers. Since the gold rush was in San Fransisco they are the Sn Fransisco 49ers.                            As soon as they heard the Chinese rushed to America and to the gold rush. The Chinese were, like many others, wishing on stars to find gold. The government raised taxes, because of all the immigrants coming. So in ways the gold rush was good and bad.                             Most felt hopeless and closely listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. They called California Gam Saan, also known as Gold Mountain. To some it seemed kike a land of riches. They wished to go, make their fortunes, and return home, to China. 63,000 joined the gold rush in all those years.                                    This was my report on Immigration, Immigrates, The Gold Rush, an the pushes and pulls. Remember pushes are things that push away, pulls that attract. Gold Rush is god and bad.               	NN . .

A lot of people moved to California in the 1800s there was a lot of reasons why people would move from their home to live in California. Some examples are: for food, for jobs, and many more. Many people move because of these reasons.             The rest of the reasons are that people want freedom, money, food, jobs, etc. and homes. Because of the 'pushes' and 'pulls.' Pushes are those things in life that make people move from their homes. these sometimes include a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Pulls are the things that attract people. Like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.             The Gold Rush brought a lot of immigrants over to California (mostly chines because 63,000 came over to California.). 77% of chines were in California at that time.People from near and far to get gold there forth there was a lot of immigrants. The number of the people in California went up from 31,513,000 to 92,407,000 (from 1860 to 1910.). For the number of people that born outside the United States of America went up from 4,096,753 to 13,344,545 (from 1860 to 1910.).

The exciting news about the gold rush was spread everywhere in china.people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to Mercia before.In the 1800,there was also rapid and important stuff and changes how quickly and widely they will be.They say they say they need more information about the golden rush.people became more aware of the world that they don't know and be hidden.Before Chinese goes to America they should learn how to speak English because no one well know there language.                                                                                   Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape prejudice and persecution,in the form of pogroms organized violent attacks.immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the untied states.most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangzhou,an area on china's south coast.people felt hopeless when they didn't able to speak English because they thought it was to hard for them to speak.

They moved to America ship by ship, luck them they got there just in time because of Americas technology. The railroads was probably the first. They also came here for religious freedom. In Europe King George did not allow different religions there so they were forced to move. Finally the immigrants population was 26 million people!       There were many changes in America back then one of them was transportation. Mail got delivered faster to the people because of the train. People got transported faster on car and train.The steamboat helped transport people across the water and to America there freedom.        In the 1800's the cold rush began.John Sutter was the one that found the gold and he want to keep to keep it a secret, but word got around and the gold rush began.More than 70,000 adventurers came to California to look for gold. 325 Chinese people came from china to work for the whites. Lots of gold was found but some might still be there.       All in all migrating was very tough. Many people had to leave friends and family and things they were most familiar with. Many people had to face the challenges that lay ahead of them.That is why migrating or moving is very hard.

One of those reasons were because they weren't accepted where they live. Also there might not have been enough food for everyone in the country. Or maybe they were kicked out of there country for there beliefs. Or maybe they left because they wanted too. So let me tell you more about this time period.        First, they might have moved because they were not excepted. like the Jews were not excepted in Russia. The people were prejudice and they were persecution. There was also violent attacked towards the Jews. They also had to leave a lot behind when they decided to come America. They migrated for there family's and there self's , because where they were was not a home it was a place where people like them were killed.        Next , there was also not enough food for everyone in Europe. The Irish came to America because there crops had not grown. 1.7 million Irish people had came to America too try new crops. They were desperate people in this time because they had no food in Ireland. More than 1 million people had died during this time. The population went down, down ,and down.        Then, they might have been kicked out or maybe they wanted to leave. In 1848 63.000 Chinese people were in America. They all came because the gold rush; more and more came as people found more gold. The people from Holland and the Jews left so they could have freedom in there beliefs. Most of the people were mistreated if they didn't believe in something someone else did. They came here to America so they could be able too believe with out being hurt or killed.         So now you see the people back then had a reason why they went or stayed some where. The Jews and the Holland people left so they wouldn't be mistreated. The Chinese came so they could get rush. The Irish came because they needed food. So now you see why people did what they did.

In fact one-fourth of Ireland was in the U.S. In the later 1800's other countries came like Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,and Sweden.       Others came for religious freedom. For instance the Jew's were often mistreated because of their beliefs in their home country. Still others came to escape wars that made lives unpredictable.       Over the last 50 years 26 million immigrants lived in the U.S. People still came to the U.S and they still do, but even though immigrants know little about the U.S they know it is home of the free.

In the 1800s people had made the other people to come to the united states they pull and push to come. Now that they had came they like it and now people come all over the world and still today people come . Immigrants come to America to make  money , have a job and make a better life for their family .                          First immigrants had came to America because they had freedom need a job,food and money for their family but be for they had came it was hard for them to came because you never know what language ,new school , new friends , mom and dad find a job , new rules and maybe the hard part is sometimes you have to leave your family.                  Then in the second half of the 1800s they made a railroad that crossed the united states it means that it became easier to move resources and they get to travel on trains too a trip to one place to another shortly and easily. Then later on they made more things that they could think of to help use like a book to read ,newspaper, telegraph and a telephone.People became more aware of he world around them and the ability to move long distances easily,they moved More than ever be for .The push are those features of life the drive people from their homes and other places.These include jobs ,wealth opportunities access to resource.                  Next the gold was discover in the 1848 along the American river in California.They tried to keep the discovery a secret word of the finding soon reached of San Francisco and thunderers of people left the city to set off for the American river.In  January 1849 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California and the California gold rush had begun. The chines government raised taxes farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their lands.The exciting news about gold mountain spread though out china many people wanted to join the gold rush.           Clearly know you know what had happened in the united states and the gold rush. 	VBG TO NNP NNP . .

Many years ago people migrated a lot over to America, 'Why?' you may ask, well I  will tell you right now.               About 200 years ago people from different places all around the world came here in America! America is known to be a free country because you can have any religous beliefs, we are a pretty rich country, we have enough food for everybody, and we have jobs. Most of the people that migrated to America came for those reasons.               In the 1800s 1.7 million people came from Ireland because their crops failed, there was a food shortage, and a lot of people died in Ireland from starvation. later on people started coming from many more countries like Russoa, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and more. Many Europeans came to America to find work and get food.               Other people came to America because of their religous beliefs. Many other countries do not have freedom like we do. Their president or king will make them believe how they believe. Some people will get thrown in jail or even get killed for believing in a different religion.              Other people came for money! The gold rush was very famous in America and many people came from China to get gold. The man who discovered it didn't want anybody to know about it, but that didn't last for long. So many people heard about this that over one thousand people came from China to get gold.              As you can tell a huge population came to America. In 1860 the U.S population was 31,513,000 in 1910 the population grew to be 92,407,000, there are even more people now because most of those people had kids and then they had kids! America is truly amazing!                       	VBG TO NNP NNP PRP MD VB TO DT JJ NNS IN DT NN , WRB MD PRP VB . NNP NNS IN NNS VBN DT NN IN TO NNP , JJ .

They came from a different country and they were called immigrants. Immigrants would leave there country and move in to a different country and live there in that country. Well right now we are going to talk about the immigrants that moved to America.               Some immigrants in America are Irish and European people. Irish moved to the U.S. because a lot of there crops died and people were dieing of hunger so they moved to the U.S. European people moved to the U.S. because there countries had not sent anyone that got kicked out to the U.S. They also came here because there was not enough jobs over there or food so the came to the U.S. to avoid hunger. And there two ways to become immigrants 'pushes' or 'pulls'. Pushes is when you are forced to leave the country or are those features of life and drive people from there homes. And pulls is when you or your family decides to leave to a different country or are those features of life that attract people. and those are the two ways someone could be an immigrant.                Well in the year 1848 a lot of immigrants entered the United States of America. the Reason why a lot of immigrants came to America is because a man found gold on the side of a river and then every one came to California to try to find some gold so they can get money and get rich.

Also the food they were given was old and moldy. So there for they wernt in good living conditions.   the russians came to America because they were bossed around and they couldnt do whatever they wanted. The russians decited to move to America because it was a free country and they were nice to there people.       Culture heritage day is about how the Russians and the Americans, Germans,and all kinds of other people were joined together to be a big country, so now they celebrate culture heritage day to supporte them. They not onley are a part of our country now but they are a part of this beautiful culture celebrating day.       When the russians, germans. and the irishes came to the americans they all welcomed them in. Now if the Russians went to Germany they would be shot because there not allowed in there country or state that they live in. So all of the Russians and the Germans and the irshes came to American to be FREE.

Most moved because of the problems in their countries and hoped to make a better life in America. In America, we had more advanced technology. That pulled immigrants into coming over here. We had things they didn't which they wanted. In Ireland, the potao crop failed and there was a food stortage. People starved because they didn't have enough food. The Irish decided it was enough and they were going to move to America to start a better life and have better opportunities to do things. One-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.) Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. (Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.) In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in United Statesover a 50 year period. Think about that...26 million ! Most of the newcomers knew very little about Anmerica except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.

Back in the 1800`s there where a lot of immigrant ted but it was hard because you had the people who would try to get you to come and some who didn't want you. We call that pushers and pull people. The push people try to do every thing to get you to not come but on the other hand the pullers try to get you to come by doing any thing they can. you also had new factories being made, people building more. you also had more farms in different places. The biggest was inventions their was a bunch of stuff being invented.before the civil war in the 1860`s, one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (the was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.)Some of the population change was really high. The U.S is 31,513,000 people in 1860 but then in 1910 the population grew to 92,407,000.

Many immigrants were needed for jobs, such as working in factories and or to work feilds and farm...            Germans were the largest group of immigrants to come to the United States of America in the 1800's.            Next to the Germans, came the Irish. One fourth or even alittle more of Irelands population came to the U.S. That was just about 1.7 million people..... Irish women, men, and children were in very depreate needs, due to crops failing. And more than 1 million people died because of starvation.            In the later 1800's European countries started to migrate to America. Through the 1750's and 1800's Europes population more than doubled.Many Europeans came to American, due to them wanting to avoid hunger, and to get good paying jobs.           On the other hand, people from Holland, and Jews came to America for religious freedom. Jews offten were mistreated and misunderstood when it came to their beliefs. Yet, still many jews came to escape war...

Most of the imagrant population was Germans , the second largest group was irish,however Irish came for different reasons such as starvation and crop ressesion,while Germans came because of wars.Many chinese men Came to America to try to strike rich on gold.Chinese families also came because China was at war with the British.       Many of these imagrants help shape America. Many Chinese men were involved in building the United States first railroad. Imagrants also helped invent quite a few things we use to day such as the BMW.          Imagrants are an important part in Americas history and help shape the beutiful country we live in today.

The reason for this is that Immigrants are not always from the same place I am or you are. They can either be from a different continent, country, state, and city/town. The information being written below is from the story 'Moving to America' by Joy Hakim. Immigraton began around the 1800's. Most of the immigrants were all heading to the same place Ameirca!       America was in the neccesity of people working for new technology. Immigrants were arriving at just the right time to help America progress. The immigrants were capable of doing all that was asked including working in factories, to farm and build on land, and to help invent new mechanism. The llargest group of immigrants was the Germans, then the Irish. Some immigrants moved to America from their home country because they came for religious freedom. But the most important thing was to help, create, and earn jobs.       This source of information in the next paragraph is from 'Changes in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants.' As he years would come and go in the 1800's many changes were happening. Immigrants continued arriving to America and indrust grew more and more. The ability to transport items such as news and material became more convenient....

This was a good change to most at first there were more resorces easyer to work and they had found gold. But then more people started plling in and resourecs droped and money was hard to handle most people moved and abandound all of that to go to other places.             During the 1800s working people who could build farm or invent came to America. They travled to America because it had lots of land and resouces they came out with new tequnoligy and there were much for them to do. The people came from europe and germany and many others, and those people came for jobs and money and power.             The second of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on americans shores. This ment a trip from one place to another with resouses or goods became easyer and soter. but this was also true in Europe. Travelers now could caatch a train that would take them right to a boat. But there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information travled , the came out with productus like the newspaper these were pulls they all started to attract people. The pushes on the other hand were diving people from there homes like the harsh enviorment and poverty.        The gold rush was probly one of the harsher times when they first discoverd gold in 1848 along the american river in california. When John Sutter discoverd gold most locle people became forty-niners (men from china that dug for gold). Then almost every one was on the hunt for gold this was called the gold rush during the gold rush most people were push out and taxes were raised people became angry.         During the 1800s the hole world was going through alot of changes from new jobs and tequinoligy to going crazy over a new thing called gold. These changes have made the world what it is today even thou it was so long ago.

The United States had advanced in technology, so people could invent new things. They could also build or farm. Ship after ship came to America, all carrying people that wanted a better life.            Another reason for so many people coming to America was that people were starving in their home countries. One example is Ireland. When their crops (especially potatoes) failed, over 1 million of Ireland's people died of starvation. As a result, 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children came to America.            People also moved to America for religious freedom. People in Holland, Poland, Russia, and some Jews from Germany, were all being treated unfairly for their religion. Other people came to escape wars that made life uneasy.            Other times people were pushed out of their country because of harsh environment, war, and poverty. Some were pulled by things that attracted them. These pulls included jobs, wealth (gold, etc.), new opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.            Population increased wildly throughout America. In 1860, the population was 31,513,000; but in 1910, the population was 92,407,000. Over a time period of 70 years, the population increased by 30,894,000 people! And that is why people moved to America in the 1800s.

Immigrants helped America with tecnology in the 1800's. Germans were the largest group of immigrants, next to the Irish who were the second largest group of immigrants. Before the civil war 1.7 million (1/4 of the population) Irish people came to America. The Irish came during and after the war, they were desperate because in Ireland crops failed, there was a food shortage (about 1 million died).       Later in the 18800's people were coming from other European countries that hadent sent many people to America before. Such as Russia Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweeden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All the extra people needed food, homes, and jobs. Immigrants werent helping Erope. So many Europeans came to America.       Some immigrants came to America for religious freedom. Especially people from Holland, and Jews from Germany, and Poland, Russia. Other immigrants came to escape wars. In total about 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. over 50 years. Many hardly knew anything about America except that its a free country and they can get a job.

It was hard because they could not communicate with them. So they had to learn a different language. They didn't really care because they heard about the gold rush. They wanted to be rich because most of them hardly had any money. So finding gold was going to make them rich. They didn't know what the money was worth.       some of them came to north America because they didn't have jobs. Also they didn't have freedom so they came over here. on the other hand some came for land because they heard of it. some wanted to get away from their family. on the other hand some had to come for there freedom. there were many jobs here in north America.       When they came they had new laws they had to learn. The freedom one they liked a lot. Some they didn't all. They cold live with it though.They liked it more over so they would have-to live with it because they didn't want to go back to there other country.       For the Chinese people it made it very hard because the numbers were different. also many other different countries to. they push some of them  so they came over here.they didn't give them opportunities.there  were easier ways to come so they came faster.       There were differENT cultures. there were also different heritage from different heritage. There were different food that they had to get use to. Somtimes they made some from home.

The wars were scaring people from their homes to even go to a different country.Some people had to stay in their countries and help fight the other country. Some of the Japenese bombed Pearl Harbor and all of the Japanese in America were sent to concentration camps.       The other main reason people immagrated was from the Gold Rush. People heard that there was gold in California and decided to try to get some. The chinese even came to try to get gold. The men who dug up gold were known as Forty-Niners.

All and all the immigrants had a hard time at there other country.it took them a long time for them to settle in to their new country.

One hardships the immigrants went through is the idea of starvation on the process of heading to America. Another hardship is the fate of death from unknown diseases, sickness, dehydration, and last but the most important one, is being STARVATION!!!                                     While the trip to America was hard, there will always be a return favor. For Example if you were Jewish you would be able to have freedom of religion. If you were Chinese you would be probably running away from either starvation, governmental punishment, or to start a new life.                        In conclusion the trip to America wasn't that bad. It came with there own ups and downs. The immagrants are now happy if they saw what they did to Amersica 	DT NN TO NNP VBD RB JJ IN JJ NNS VBN NN NN NNS WDT DT NN VBZ TO VB IN DT NN NNP CD NNS DT NNS VBD IN VBZ DT NN IN NN IN DT NN IN VBG TO NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN IN NN IN NN NNS , NN , NN , CC JJ CC DT RBS JJ CD , VBZ VBG NN . . .

People have  migrated to America to have a better life and jobs. In addition, people in the 1800s came to America on ships. Imigrants knew they would have a better life in America, beacause of the technology  there was lots of open jobs like factories, farming, etc. Most of the immigrants during the 1800s came from Europe.              Next, there where many changes in America , the US had more than enough population in 1869. There was now telephones invented in 1876 which only made news travel faster. People became more aware of daily news. Europeans now wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. More, ahead Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portguese, and Armenians also moved for a new/better life. Also, Chinese immagrants wanted a better life, because they found out that there was a land of gold and 325 men became whats called the gold rush, because they where also going through harsh times like, poverty and taxes.                        To Conclude, during the 1800s people migrated to America for a better way of living. Immigrants had to get use to  different language, culture, economy, jobs, food, and more.  People still suffer, because people who migrate have to leave there family and homeland. Even, though its hard people who work hard always get good in return.

America has given  them oppurtunities to start over with a better life.            Imagrants can come from all over the world. They can come from Mexico, China, and Europe. The rasons immagrants come can all be diffecrent. They can come for jobs, religous freedom, or wealth. These reasoes they come for are called pulls.             There are also reasons they want the to leave their homes. These reasons can range from poverty  to religouse rights. In Irealand many people died of hunger each year. As a result of this many people decided to the U.S. This is why the population in U.S is so large.              There are two sides to immagration the pushers and pullers. The pushers don't give people fair right so they end up pushing people away. The pullers offer fair rightse and freedom so peotple are attracted to this place.               Immagration has been around a long time. In the 1800's many people moved to the united states. The immagrants thought they would have a better life than at there birthplace. Ther many resons they decide to leave. After they immagrate once they usualy don't come back.

When you get to the new area you're in, you feel shy and scared because you do not know what to expect in the neighborhood. You go to a whole different school with new people! Now imagine that on a larger school from moving from a country to a country! Many people in the 1800s moved to America, a place of place of freedom for all people. The people over there speak a new language and culture you do not even understand! This action of moving from a country to another country is called immigration. Many people around the world immigrate for many reasons including to escape poverty, find new riches, religious freedom, or to find a job to support family. There are many pros and cons for immigration in the 1800s ,but which side is right about immigration?                 Many people think that immigration benefits people all around the world, but why? In the 1800, many countries had harsh conditions that made living there hard so they traveled to America for freedom. A rapid increase of birth rate made life even harder for the family will need more food to survive. However, in America there were many jobs available, so there are more jobs for immigrants so they can feed their family and themselves. Not only that, but people like the Jews have religious freedom so they can pick any religion they want. Also, people can get rich from treasures that await in America like the gold rush so people will not be in poverty. In America, immigrants hope to make a new life for themselves and families in the United States. Even though there are good reasons for immigrating, there are always the drawbacks of it.

Many people came to America in the 1800s for many reasons. They are split into two categories alled push and pull. Push is to drive people to go to America. Pull is to attract people to America. The next paragraphs will tell you why people went to America.      One reason people moved to America is because of the push.Push drive people from their homes. Many examples of pushes are harsh enviroment,wars,conflicts, and poverty.Some people were 'pushed ' to go to America since the population of were they lived keep on growing and they were lefted wth no choice but leave and go to America.     On the other hand, pull is the exact opposite of push. Pull attract people to go to America. Pulls include wealth,jobs,opportunities,acess to resources, and most of all, freedom. Immigrants moved to find gold and start over in America.     Overall, people move to America mainly because of the pushes and pulls. These paragraphs show why people move to America.

On the journey they have left a hard life in their old country to start a new and sometimes easier life based here in the united States. Of course they had difficulties arriving here and adapting to the new home.          Some families have come for freedom, others have come for labor, so many people have come to start a new and better life living here in the United States. As more and more people have come to settle in the United States, there has been more and more advances in technology. Ideas and inventions have been discovered from all the different cultures in the world. Slowly the country was growing into the society we have today in the United States.          If it weren't for the migrants, transportantion wouldn't be so easy today, the migrants also improved transportation when they would think of new ways of coming to the United States. Migrants have come to the United States to escape harsh livings, have their own beliefs, freedom, and to find new riches. If it weren't for the migrats most of us americans would not be here today.

In America, people are free to roam where ever they want. There   aren't any kings or queens that governed the United States until later. Many Germans and Irish people came to America due to food shortage in their homeland. For example, Ireland crops had failed, and there aren't lots of food. During the Gold Rush, at American River, California Chinese people from Guangdong because they were escaping from conflicts and poverty. Then, in 1870 there were six-three million Chinese people in the United States, and seventy-seven percent of them were in Calfornia. By 1910, the United States population was ninty-two million four hundread and seven people.       The Gold Rush in 1848 at American River, Calfornia was started on John Sutter's property, and spread to other parts of the world. Three hundred, and twenty-five men from joined most of them were from Guangdong, China. There are two wars and many rebellions, and the Chinese government raised taxes so they went there. In 1852, there are twenty thousand and twenty-six Chinese people in the United States. Germans and Irish decided to go to America as well because there was food shortage in Ireland. Other countries in Europe such as Russia and Italy had there population doubled, so most of them decided to go to America to avoid hunger, and find jobs.        Many countries went to America because they want freedom and find jobs, so they won't starve. In Guangdong, China they were many wars and the government raised taxes. So, they wanted to join the Gold Rush and become rich by gold mining. Others came to America by different reasons like Irish because of food shortage. Some of them also came for freedom.

This is why the population of citizens in America have been increasing over the past two centuries. the reasons will be backed up with information.      The Germans came to America for the food. The Germans get better treatment in America. The jobs are more available. Nearly, one million people in Germany died from starvation! That is a very good reason to come to America. The Germans came to America for better treatment.     The immigrants from China came to California because of the gold rush this gave the Chinese jobs that gave money to make a living and raise a family. The Chinese came to America because there were more opportunities and jobs in America than China.      The Europeans came to America because the trains and steam running cars. This made the Europeans come to America because the transportation to work rather then going on a boat this has increased the miles of train tracks. The Europeans came to America for transportation.      The increase of the population in America was due to immagration. This is why the population of the US is beacuse this country is advanced and fair. The immigration of the Chinese, Germans, and Europeans is becuase America is a good counrty.

They were either attracted to a place or pushed away from it because they didn't like it. Why a big amount of people migrated into America is because some wanted to escape harsh conditions, or find something you desire, or because food shortages.    One reason why people wanted to migrate into America because to escape the ways they were before. Russian immigrants left their homeland because prejudice and persecution. In Southern Italy, people suffered from farming losses or birth rates. If the first born male leaves, then their brothers and sisters will have no land that is passed on to them.   Another reason why people came to America is to find fortune. In California 1848, a guy named John Sutter found gold. He wanted to keep the discovery a secret, but soon people from all over the world came to California, only for gold. China was in the middle of poverty and conflict. There was a war between China and Britain, and there were many rebellions. Farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their land, while the population was increasing. They couldn't grow enough food for the community.. but soon, the rumor of gold spread to China, and they wanted to become part of the gold rush.    Finally, some people came to America because they had food shortages. In Ireland, they were in desperate needs because their crops had failed. More than 1 million people died. Also, in the 1800s, the population for Europe was doubled. A lot of people needed a place to live, employment, and food. So Europeans left Europe and went to the United States to find a job and to avoid starvation.    So why people left their land and migrated into America is because to escape hard conditions, find something you desire, or because food shortages. If people did not migrate into the United States, the population would of been lower, and other countries can struggle finding food, or a job, or a home to give to their people.

Some move because of critical conditions in their home or because of a better opportunity in the United States. The reason why people move from their home could be called pushes or pulls. Pushes are when people want to leave because of critical conditions. Pulls are the things that attract people enough to move.       There are many pushes that caused people to move to America. For example,  the Irish moved to America because crops have failed in Ireland, especially the potato crop, causing more than one million people to die of stravation. Another example is that Russian Jews left Europe to escape from the prejudice and persection from pogroms, organized violent attacks. The third and last example of a push is that suthern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses. Also, people became landless because of the tradition of leaving land to the oldest male sibling. Besides pushes, there are also many pulls that caused people to come to America.        There are many pulls that caused people to come to America. One of the reasons is that there were many job oportunities in America due to new technology. These jobs included needing people to work in new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Another reason is access to resources and the freedom to express religious beliefs. The third and last reason is the Califonia gold rush. People migrated from China because of dreams of making fortunes and returning proudly to China.        There are more than a few reasons why people came to America in the 1800s. There were many pushes that included harsh enviroments, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. There were also many pulls that included jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and preceived freedoms. These are just some of the reasons why people moved to America.

Some arrived simply just because they wanted to be here or were looking for a new house. Some were in war, and wanted to get it out of trouble. Then their was a time when chineese people from Guangdong an area of China's coast came to America.

The people who traveled a lot we're even named Nomads back in history. Many we're the reasons of this move.                          The reason to this movement called migration were money, food, and success. Why? You may ask the reason why they moved for those reasons well, people needed money in order to buy land and grow crops or their food. It eventually all falls into the category of money.                          For us now on modern days the hardest thing about moving, is the fact of having to carry things from one place to another , but for the people back then it was not a problem moving from one place to another if it was to make money and get food.                        Even though, many people think it is hard to adapt to a new place or to the people , people back then didn't mind doing so if it was for money or to not be as slaves. Good for us now adays we don't have much violence, and it is a little easier to find jobs.

There was people from Europe,China,Germany,Ireland,Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden,Hungary,Holland,Greek,Portland,and Armenia(a lot of places!).Europians came because of crowdiness.Irish came because of crop failure.Holland,along with Jews from Germany,Russia,and Poland came for religous purposes.                                                           If you add all of the people that came in for that 50 year span,there was 26 million!!!!Those people built more houses and industries.they made better transportation like trains for the first time.People loved these trains because of  how well it transported people and items.                                                       They also made new steamships!All of this stuff is still used today.And now America is populated!

In the paragraphs of Moving to America,it is about the 1800's, of working people who can build,farm, or invent,going to America in ship after ship after ship after ship and so on. They needed to work in factories to farm and build on their land,and to invent things.Germans and many other types of race as well went to America for the same thing.Jews where often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.Others had still came for their religious freedom.And fought wars that made life be unstable and underpredictable.         In the paragraphs Changes in America:The'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Migrants. The second half of the 1800's was a time of great change in America. There industry grew and many immigrants had arrived on America's shores.There transportation had improved,the first railroad trip that crossed the United States was finished in 1869.It became easier to move from one place to another.And people had gone to places easier.People had became aware of the world that was around them and since they had the ability to move along distance easily,they did so and moved along then ever before.       In the last paragraph of Gold Rush! Chinese moving to California is about how gold was discovered.American River in California was the place where they had found gold on the property of of a man named John Sutter.He tried to keep the discovery a secret but the rumor had spread out to San Francisco,and from there hundreds of people knew and left the city to go to the American river.And the news spread to the rest of the United States,and other parts of the world.Many people had traveled to California such as thousands of people and that is how the gold rush began.        In the last paragraph which is the chart helps you in understanding the story a bit better and it helps you with knowing the time of dates things had happened and when they had happened.Such as the number of people in the U.S. from the year 1860 to the year 1910.And the number of people who had lived in cities, and the number of people who were born outside the United States.Also with other things like coal production in tons,miles of railroad tracks,and the number of daily newspaper all from the same year of 1860 to the year 1910. So it helps you to get to know the story a lot better and to the time period of things.        In conclusion I hoped you enjoyed reading my article on Cultural Heritage Day to recognize those who were migrated in the United States.

Here are some reasons why they moved here.                              The reason why the Chinese moved here is because of the GoldRush.Then they told their families.In the late 1800s,people started coming from some other European countries.They haven't sent many people to America .Some of those countries are, Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden,and Hungary. All the people that came from those countries needed,food,jobs,and a home to live in.      Lots of Europeans came for a religious freedom. These people are from Holland, and Jews who are from Germany,Poland,and Russia. Others came to get away from the wars that were going on.  In total,26 million immigrants came to the United States of America. In just a 50 year period!                            People began to learn more about America and some had a very good life.

But all you can do is make the better of it and think of it as an adventure.   Differences:     Theres alot of things that change when you move like the town, money, languge, and even family because sometines you have to leave them behind and it hard for you to go back every time you want to see them. Also the mouney changes in the U.S its dollers and in Mexico its pesos or in China its yen its different all the time in different places.Another difference is your sorroundings it still has trees and buldings but it looks different than the home your used to.

(next paragraph 2)                   people do this because maybe they want to get away from annoying people or they want to just try something new. that's the reason my family and i moved away or maybe for the fun of it just go somewhere for the summer. i go to Washington every summer ever since i was little.its just a good getaway so i can relax and just think about the next day. well f course i am a kid i do have yo do chores but you don't so its not bad to always try something new every little once in a while. i try new things like every day!! maybe you should too. it never hurts try things at least every week. so that means you could try it too. really you should. it is 100% guaranteed relaxation and fun . i promise. it would be really fun i promise . =D   	NNP PRP VB DT NN IN NN .

Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.Irish were the largest immigrant group.In total,some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over 50 year period.Most of the newcomers knew very little about america except that it was a land of freedom.But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.There was a food shortage.More than 1 million people died of starvation in ireland.In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to america before.All those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe.Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.

Some, came to start a new life, while others came to escape poverty and wars from back home. Others, came to America to find gold and get rich. They all came for two similiar reason though. Freedom and a chance to work.            To  begin with, lots of people came to start a new life. People in Ireland came to America because there crops were crumbling and millions of people were dying of starvation. They thought that America was a chance to escape all that, and to find a chance to work. In addition to the people of  Ireland, people from Holand and Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came to seek religious freedom. Not only did people come to go to America for religious freedom and a chance of new lfe, they came for the riches of California. According to 'Gold Rush! Chinsese Move to California' , many Chinese people came to look for gold after getting news of a man called John Sutter, finding gold along the American River in America.             In addition, to the enlargement of immigration movement, many others came thanks to the improvement of things such as the industry and transportaion. This improvement created the first railroad in the United States in 1869. Not only did it help transportation, it helped trade! The new railroad made it easier to move things like lumber and silver from the West to the East! But, the possitive effects of the enlargement of immigration don't stop there, it helped people come to America easier by catching a train and then boarding a boat. Normally, this process would take months.               Not only did the immigration of others help transportation, it helped spread news fatsre. For example, the steam power and redesigning of the printing press helped make new travel faster. This helped make news and ideas available for everyone. Furthermore, this then led on the the invention of the telegraphy in 1844 and the telephone in 1876.                Overall, the enlargement of immigrants in America helped improve this country alot. Without, the new ideas of new people from different countries, America wouldn't be the way it is now.

Some people come to escape wars, an harsh environment, and poverty. And some people come because of our advances in technology.         The people who come seek a job. They probably wanted a higher paying salary. Or maybe they wanted to be able to feed their family because of the surplus of food. They might have seen or discovered an opportunity to get rich quick.         Other people come because they. Or maybe they were slaves somewhere are were poor and had no money and instead wanted to be rich, free, and respected for their talents. They might not have had any rights and were not given the right to speak freely.         They might have came for the advances in technology. Maybe they were tired of the old fashioned slow and dangerous way of transportation like horseback riding. they might have not had computers and have to write out everything slowly instead of typing speedily.                                                                                                                                People come to America seeking opportunities. They came to escape poverty and the government forced them to pay high taxes or forced them to do something. They came to do things faster and more efficiently unlike the country they were in. No matter the reason America is a good place to live. 	NNP PRP VBD WRB DT NN IN NNS IN RB TO NNP .

In 1869 the achivements improved their was more jobs for people and the places had developed over the time,jobs were more available a d people had more opportunities to be free to do what they wanted to do.77% of the jobs were in California.

Some have been coming here because the hard conditions they had during the civil war. Europeans have came to look for Jobs. Some immigrants came to get out of the war         During the 1800's so much immigrants came to America   that half the U.S.A is filled with immigrants. Some immigrants came to America because they didn't nowhere else to go,they have been kicked out of their home countries. Many have been deserted out of their homes. Some of them came to America to ask for help because maybe some of them were in war with another country or with their own.          Although, immigrants have been coming here for almost 200 years some have been just coming here just the nice conditions we had. In 1848 along the American river in San Francisco a man found gold then when they heard about it many people had came and the Gold Rush has begun. With the gold rush the population of the U.S.A has increased a lot.

There are two types of why people move: pushes and pulls. Pushes are the harsh conditions of their homeland that push people away while pulls are the better features in life that America pulls people to.The main reasons of why immigrants immagrate are: for the better future they might have in America or the harsh features of life       One reason why people moved to America was because of the features that drive people away from their homes. In 1860, the Irish were desperate because in Ireland, crops had failed like the potato crop. Since there was a food shortage, more than 1 million people died of starvation. In the later 1800s, people started coming from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary to find work and avoid hunger. Many new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions such as prejudice and persecution from violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered high birth rates, and farming losses from lower prices. Their tradition of leaving land to the first-born male left younger siblings landless. When the Gold Rush was going on, most Chinese of Guangdong took this as a chance to flee conflicts and poverty                	IN DT CD JJ NNS IN JJ NNS CC NNS VBD TO NNP , DT NN IN NNP NNP VBP CD NNS IN WRB NNS VBP : NNS CC NNP NNP VBP DT JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN WDT NN NNS RB IN NNS VBP DT JJR NNS IN NN IN NNP NNS NNS JJ NN NNS IN WRB NNS VBP VBP : IN DT JJR JJ PRP MD VB IN NNP CC DT JJ NNS IN NN CD NN WRB NNS VBN TO NNP VBD IN IN DT NNS IN JJ NNS RB IN PRP$ NNP NNP CD , DT NNP VBD JJ IN IN NNP , NNS VBD VBN IN DT NN NNP NNP RB VBD DT NN NN , RBR IN CD CD NNS VBD IN NNP NNP DT JJ CD , NNS VBD VBG IN NNP , NNP , NNP , NNP , NNP , CC NNP TO VB NN CC VBD NNP NNP JJ JJ NNS VBD TO NN NN NNS JJ IN NN CC NN IN NN NNP NNP NNP VBD JJ NN NNS , CC VBG NNS IN JJR NNP NNP NN IN VBG NN TO DT NN NN VBD JJR NNS NNP NNP DT NNP NNP VBD VBG IN , RBS JJ IN NNP VBD DT IN DT NN TO VB NNS CC NN	1		20131022091048	2367	1		20131022091052	2364	1		20131022101011	2405	1

However, not everyone traveled the same journey. Different people took different paths that were told in stories such as Moving to America, The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants and Gold Rush! Chinese Move to America.       In Moving to America people who could construct, farm, or invent traveling to America in ship. With the rising technology in America there were a lot of jobs to do such as working in the new factories, to do farmwork, to build, and to invent new creations. Germans were the largest immigration group,  after the Germans the Irish were the largest group. The Irish were in poverty because the crops in Ireland had failed, especially the potatoes. This caused a shortafe of food killing millions of people from starvation. During the late 1800s people came from many European countries, including Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The people all needed food, shelter, and a job to support their family. Many others came for religious freedom. Which consisted of Holland, and the Jewish. Over a period of 50 years about 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States.           In the other half of the 1800s industry rose and more immigrants arrived. The first railroad that crossed the United States had finished constructing granting an easierway to mover resources for West to East. People were also allowed on the trains making trips shorter and also easier. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it more sufficient to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. New European immigrants wanted freedom from harsh conditions in Europe. More immigrants started to arrive in the United States again, once again increasing the population.       During 1848 along the American River in California, a man  named John Sutter discovered a secret that spreaded to San Francisco attracting many people. The news start to spread all over the United States. The 'Forty Niners' were a band of men from China. Most of them came from Guangdong the men were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. They nicknamed California Gam Saan meaning Gold Mountain. These men were part of what we now know of the Gold Rush.       Along the immigrations of many people they encountered hardships and obstacles. Different people took different paths which were told in stories like Moving to America, The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants, and Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California. All these people moved from their former homes because of different reasons such as poverty, or war. In the end all these people reached their destination to find safe haven in the United States.

In America you could have a better career and much better life.When people where in their other country they didn't have that much crops. In there other country the crop that they needed most was the potato crop. In America there are so many things or materials provided for you. The only thing that going to be harsh is learning a new language.                 People also left from their countries because their was so may attacks. Even some people tried to escape from their countries. Another reason why thy came is their gonerner raised their taxes to high for them. People who were farmers who didn't have money had to sell their land. But in America Noel's their career could make them earn a better profit, then what they used to get in their other countries.

In Ireland crops failed,but especially the potato crop did.More than 1 million people in Ireland died of starving. After that, people started coming from European countries.

So, in total, there was millions of immagrants. There was 26 million immagrants in America.some immagrants came for religious freedom.on the other hand,others came to escape hunger.there is still many ways why immagrants came to America.

Many other people came because they wanted freedom. They wanted a chance to have a job and work. 26 million immigrants came to the U.S in over a 50 year period.            There was a great change in the second half of the 1800s in America. The railroad was invented and was used as transportation. It was a great way to migrate for immigrants. It was easier to move resources like silver and lumber to other places. A railroad was a great invention to migrate.           People started to become aware of the ability to move in the world around them. Reasons that immigrants moved is because of things that are pushes and pulls. Pushes are features of life that makes them leave because of harsh environment and other bad things they suffer. A pull are things that would attract people to other places. This is when there is good wealth, access to resources, and there may be freedom.            America really grew and changed between 1860 and 1910. The number of people in the U.S in 1860 was 31,513,000. There were a lot of people then in the United States. But, in 1910 there was 92,407,000 people then. There was a very great change between that 50 year period. The number of people. That were born outside the United States and came stretched from over 4,000,000 people in 1860 to 13,344,545 people in 1910.

The reason I think we should celebrate more often is because it happens every 200years and people want to participate. I think we should do this like about every year. Like our own b-day parties it happens nice a year people want to have more fun. It is really fun that is why people want more fun.      People should do that more because some people really want to party .since more people come because they are migrants or immigrants they want to get to know people.those people want to move for a reason most of the people move because they want to move to explore.

First the Jews came here to survive from the nazis . It must have bin hard to move away from the place you come from .these poor people lost everything they owned just beacuse of one man .My next paragraph is on the gold rush .       This paragraph is on the gold rush . In 1848 there was aginats china and britin at the same time a man found gold he tried to keep it a secret but, soon people found out. During the war many people were poor and hungry so the chinases told stories of the mountin of gold so the came here.Of course every year people kept coming . After years 77% of the Chinese were in California . In the end America is the most cultrly divers country in the world 	PRP$ NN VBZ IN NN CC IN WRB NNS VBN IN EX JJ PRP MD VB WRB NNS VBD CC WRB PRP VBD TO NNP NNP DT NNP VBD RB TO VB IN DT NNS .

In the United States there were 26 million immigrant's that arrived about 50 years ago.The new immigrants that arrived to America only knew a little about America.But they were happy because they had freedom no ruling no body tell's them what to do.Other people also wanted to go for freedom they didn't want  them to tell them what to do.In 1750 and1850 immigrants had to build a lot of thing's like the older people.Many Europe people had to find job's and avoid eating in America.

But it was hard coming to America because, there were alot of Immagrants that wanted to come too. Most of the immagrants were coming to America so, they could go get jobs or even live here. They had to get on a ship &amp; sail to America .          There are 2 types of immagrants that mostly come to America . 1 of them is a Push immagrants ,that come to America because they were driven away from their homes. The other type of immagrants is a Pull, that come to America because they need a job or a place to live. Many immagrants from other countries come to America because, they were driven away Fremont their homes. Some of them come to America so they could escape from getting killed.         America has over 63,000 immagrants from other counties because of the gold rush. Most of the immagrants are from china or Ireland . They hope to found some gold because they had risked their lives to come here. But there weren't any gold left because most of the Chinese immagrants had took most of them. But they were able to feed their people from china.

The reason people came here to  America because, there was food, work, and homes. People also left because of warfare in the east. America was then named,' The Melting Pot' because of so many people were coming to America. First, in order to come to the U.S. you had to take a long voyage that lasted for a month. Second, you had to go through a series of tests to com in to America. Finally, if you passed all the tests you were free to go to America.       Lots of people were saddly told that they had to go to their homeland. Lots of the officials did what ever they could to make them some how enter America. All these tests were ran in Eliss isand.

This is my paragraph:       Cultural Heritage Day       This is about migration, people from anotgher state would come to america to find work. That is called a migrate. Once they would come to work some types of jobs were:   Farming   Well that's pretty much it. Alot of bosses needed farm workers. So they would offer them to work. But, The only choice they really had was to farm work. They had to feed us!!!!!! Right.

So, in the following paragraphs, I will explain how and why these immagrants came to America.             During the early 1800s, Germans had one of the largest population at the time. After the Germans was the Ireland. But soon, the population of Ireland decreased and America's population increased. The reason that this happened was because food was dying in Ireland, especially the potato crop. So, while  that happened, America's population increased and soon caused industries to hire more people and farms had more foods to crop. Eventually, Europe began to do the same thing and more people moved to Europe. Between 1750 and 1850, Europe's population doubled and Europe just flerished. Around the 1860s, that all changed. About 26 million of the Europians moved to America.             That year, the first railroad tracks were finished which meant more people could get across America and gold and silver could be taken to the East from the West. After this phenemonon, steam boats were invented more people could travel faster. Sadly, Europe built their railroads and had steamboats to. Soon, in the mid 1800s, a rapid change in transportation happen. Steam powered machines began and a new, redesigned printing press made newspapers possible for more people. Also, inexpensive books were beginning to be made. Eventually, more people around the world became more aware and had the ability of moving long distances. Once people in Europe heard this, people wanted to leave Europe's harsh treatment and go to America. Immagrants soon came to America to make a new life and have families in the United States.              Once it became the year of 1848, a man named John Sutter. He was walking along the river and saw something in the water. He picked it up and saw that it was gold. He tried to keep it a secret but the word got out. Soon, it was all over the United States. Then, It was heard around the world. Eventually, it was heard in China. Once they heard about it, they all wanted to come to what they called 'the Gold Mountain'. The reason they wanted to go to 'the Gold Mountain' was because many farmers and Chinese people had to pay taxes. So, if people went to America and came back with gold, they'd be able to pay their taxes and be proud of it. Once this happened, not many farmers were still there and many starved from the little food that farmers have grown. Another problem was that a flood could cause all the crops to flood and die causing starvation for the people. While this crisis was happening in China, about 63,000 Chinese went to America to mine for gold. At the end of the gold rush, about 77 percent of the Chinese were in America.             So many of the world's immagrants came to America. Some for money, some for food, even some people came over here to raise a family and live a peaceful life. But no matter where your from or why you come to America, just remember that our ancestors went through same thing.

A lot of people came to America for freedom in which not a lot of people had back then. In the 1800s there was war and lots of fighting. For the people who lived in those places it was inhabitable. They also came to America because everybody could come and new inventions were being made. They also came for the good climate too. Lastly ,this is why America was the first place people could go to and not worry about major problems. This is why America was chosen.

Others came for freedom.While others came for space.            People came to America because they were starving to death and needed a job. They needed money so they have a house,jobs,access to resources and freedom.             Other people came to be free. This includes religious reasons. The government was probably a bad.           People also came for space. Were they lived it was probably crowded. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms organized violent attacks.

First, working people who could build, farms, or invent came to America in ships. With all the new technology there was a lot of things for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and to build on there land, and to invent things and the immigrants did all that. Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered form high birth rates and farming losses due to low prices. Immigrants hoped to make a new life fot themselves and their families in the United States.            These are all of the reasons why immigrants moved to the United States of America.

People came to America because they wanted better life. Like people wanted better jobs or have a better lifestyle. Also, some people knew how to invent so they came to America to see who will buy their inventions.  People had may more reasons why to come to America. Like people with different heritages came to America to learn something new.       Some people that came were Jews. Jew were mistreated all the time. Even though they were mistreated they stayed in America. Others came to America to escape wars that life made or that happen. In total let say that 26 million immigrants came to America.       Lastly, the good thing is that immigrants helped make America what it is ' Great Nation'. 1800's people dint know what was so special about America but people migrated. The first population of America were slaves which to them was torture. The child of the slaves were taken away and get sold. The parents always knew that if they were going to have a child not get attached because they might be migrated to another country or state.

They were needed to in new factories and invent things. Immigrants  did all of this stuff. Germans were the largest people it immigrant to America. Before the American Civil war, one - fourth of Ireland came to America. Later in the 1800s, other European countries came to America like Russia, Italy, and Denmark.   Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes. Pulls are those features of life that attract people. Gold was discovered in 1884 along the American River in California. Many travelers came to California to find gold. The most people who came to California was the Chinese. These are the numbers in the U.S in 1860 31,513,00 and in 1910 92,407,00.

To add on with all the new technology there was alot people can do. In the immigration process the Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants. Around the 1860's about 25% of Irelands population came to America (which was a group of 1.7 million people consisting of Men, Women, and children). The people in Ireland came mostly because crops were failing in their country and about a million people died because of starvation at the time. Europeans came because they had a massive population  growth and all the excess people needed life essentials. Some people came for religious freedom because the Hollocast was around that time and as you probably know they weren't to friendly to Jews at that time (Countries that had immigrants come for religious freedom included Germany, Russia, and Poland). People came for possibilities and came to escape terrible things in their countries. The Chinese came mostly for the Gold rush in 1849 and to escape poverty in their country. Immigration started to decrease as America became more strict on who to let in. The U.S. almost tripled in population, peopel in cities multiplied by almost 7 times. And many other aspects of the U.S. increased tenfold. In conclusion immigration was caused by wishes and fatal flaws in other peoples country, so they came to the U.S. for liberty and hope. :) 	IN DT CD POS NNS DT IN DT NN VBD VBG TO NN NNS IN PRP$ NNS CC VBG TO NNP TO NNP DT NN CC TO VB PRP$ NN NNP TO VB IN IN DT DT JJ NN EX VBD NN NNS MD VB NNP DT NN NN DT NNS VBN RP DT JJS JJ NN IN NNP NNP DT CD POS IN CD NN IN NNPS NN VBD TO NNP NNP WDT VBD DT NN IN CD CD NNS VBG IN NNP , NNP , CC NNS : .

This was called Pulls when someone wants to move to another place because of wealth, access to resources, opportunities and perceived freedoms. Another reason so many people went to America was be cause of Pushes when someone moves to another place because of war, poverty and harsh enviroment. between 1860 to 1920 the population went from 31,513,000 to 92,407,000. A very big increase mostly because of people from Europe. This also increased industrial growth and made more people come to America.

Some came for gold, others might of come for freedom. Some also came for the land, to grow their crops.        Most of the people came to California or America for the gold. The gold was their hope for a new life and family. When people from all over the world heard the news about the Gold Rush in California, they rushed to start digging for some gold themselves. By 1870, there was about 63,00 Chinese in California. The population continued to grow with more and more people hearing about the Gold Rush in California.       Some people didn't come for the gold though. They came for freedom. Some people were treated harshly because of what they believed, others came here for food, homes and jobs.The kind of kind of jobs that theses people had were to work on factories, to farm on land and to build on the land.     In conclusion, people traveled to America for many purposes. some came for gold, others came for freedom and jobs. America and gold changed the life of many people. It gave them freedom and most importantly, it gave them hope.

That's right immigrants did all of that. But the Germans made up the largest group. Next to them stood the Irish. The Irish were desperate because their crops had died and hunger spread through out Ireland. In the later 1800s the pop. of  Europe doubled. All those extra people neede jobs and other resources. So they came to America to avoid starvation and get a job. Others came for religiuos freedom. Still others came to escape wars.       In the second half of the 1800s, Industry grew rapidly. Travelers could catch a train that would take them to a boat. In earlier times it would have taken months for a sinle trip. Steam power and redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and news papers. News got aroun faster thanks to the invention of the telegraph and the telephone.           Gold was discovered by a man named John Sutter. He tried to keep it a seceret but word reached San Fransisco. By January 1894 thousands of travelers came to California to look for gold. Among these '49ers' were 325 chinese. MOst of the chinese were from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast. Its pop. was growing very quickly and floods often destroyed the crops. People felt hopeless and they listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. They dreamed of going there, becoming rich, and returning to China proudly. Each year more and more Chinese cam to California.

And in Europe they needed a faster way to travel to diffrent countries and states so when the railrpad to America was built they had a faster way to travel to those places and a faster way to move supplies.

Here I am going to tell you about why people left their country to come to America. I hope you will find this much rather informational.               One of the main reasons, I think, is because of  positives and negatives. by that i mean the negatives of their country and the positives in our country which is why they came here. Positives are also known as 'pulls', while negatives may be called 'pushes'.   For example a 'push' may be them having a war at their own country or like the population may be getting to big and there isn't enough 'space' for them. And a 'pull' can be like them getting wealthier in America, or also like having more land here.               There are a lot more reasons to why they came here. But i happened to find the 'pushes and 'pulls' the most interesting. For that specific reason is why i decided to tell you a little about them.

They do this because they need to find more opportunities or jobs, and also because they want freedom and to live a happy life. They make it easier because more people go to another state so there will be a better chance that there will be more opportunities.        There are a lot of reasons why people move to other places. There is also reasons why people stay. These reasons are called pushes and pulls. Pushes are features that make people move away from their homes, such as harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Pulls are the features of life that attract people, this includes jobs, wealth, opportunities, and perceived freedom.        Every time people immigrate somewhere else, the popularity of a state either increases or decreases. For example, when someone moves to Europe from Asia, the popularity increases in Europe but decreases in Asia. This happens every year, but it makes it better for the planet because there won't be so much people in one place, or too little people in another place.

They traveled by ship to America because of 'pushes' and 'pulls. Pushes  are reasons that force them to leave their home. Some pushes might be dying crops, war, or hard conditions to live by. Pulls are things that make people want to leave their homes. Examples of pulls might be freedom, farming, or riches. People believed that moving to America would grant them freedom and peace. In only 50 years, 26 million people immigrated to America.                 The fist railroad that crossed the U.S.A. was finished in 1869. It made it easier to transport things such as gold, silver, lumber, and people to other places. It once took months to get to America by boat until the steam boat came along. it made trips to America a lot faster. People used the train to move to California during the gold rush.                  The gold rush took place in California. The first gold there was found in a river in 1848. many people moved to California during the gold rudh. they thought that they would find some gold there. many people came home rich but some people came home without anything. they were called the 'Forty-Niners'. about 325 the people hoping for gold were chinese. they imagrated all the way from china so they could gett some of the gold. 	.

People came to America also when a war started and when it ended.The Irish came to America because there crops were dieing and 1 million people from Ireland died because of that.In the 1800`s people from Europe,Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden and Hungary came to America.The Europeans came for jobs.                  Some of the others came for freedom.All those people who came to America wanted a better life for them there familiy.There was a rail road built so it would be easier for people to travel. Years later GOLD was discovered in California on a property of a man named Jhon Sutter. He tried  to keep it a secret but people started to know and come on his land for gold.                                                                                   Then in other states started to know about the gold on Johns land. Then Chinese people came to California for the gold. Then some of the Chinese people stayed in California for a better life to. Then years later the population of America started to get larger and larger.

Maybe it is because there aren't enough jobs for them or there is a place easier to live in. For example, the gold rush caused a lot of people from different countries to collect gold for a wealthy life. In America people just keeps ofn coming so the populations just keeps on growing larger and larger.     Travelers from Europe,Russia, and other countries go for jobs, wealth, and others to live happily. The chinese went to California to dig for gold but later they have to move back to China because they don't have enough food to feed the people.

Not everyone who came to America had the same purpose of why they came. They all had different reasons. What you are about to read lists a few of the different reasons why people came to America. Whether it be freedom, wealth, or just because they like it here.           Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. After that were the Irish. They were the largest of all. Before the Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the population of Ireland immigrated to the US. That's about 1.7 million Irish women, men, and children. They came during and after the war. The Irish people left because the crop in Ireland failed, especially the potato. There was food shortage, and more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.            In the late 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America earlier. A few countries included Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and Russia. Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Europe had doubled. This meant that all those extra people needed food, jobs, and homes-but there just didn't seem to be enough for everyone. Many Europeans came to America to find work and avoid starvation.            Others came for religious freedom. Some people came from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their homeland. Others came to escape wars that made life miserable and unpredictable.            Overall, about 26 million immigrants came to America in a 50 year time period.                The 'Part 2' of the 1800s was a time of a great boost in technology for America. Industries grew, and many immigrants came for work. The first railroad that crossed the US was completed in 1869, making it easier to transport cargo and people to other places. Steamships were also invented, making a trip to America faster than before. The telephone and telegraph both helped news travel faster between people.            People became more aware of the world they lived in because of these inventions. The redesign of the printing press allowed cheaper books and newspapers to be printed, allowing even more news and ideas to reach the common people.            In the 1800s, there were two types of immigrants, 'Pushes' and 'Pulls'. Pushes are the features of life that drive people away from their home. These include harsh environment, wars, and other conflicts and poverty. Pulls are the features in life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.            Many of the people in Europe left because of harsh conditions. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution in the form of pogroms-organized attacks. Southern Italians struggled with high birth rates and farming due to lower prices. Hungarians, Poles, Greeks, Armenians, and Portuguese also moved to America in search of a happier and safer lifestyle for them.                When gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, excitement exploded all around the world. By January of 1849, almost 60 ships and thousands of land travelers were headed for San Francisco. This event is known as the Gold Rush.             There were about 70,000 hopeful miners who arrived in 1849. These people are called the Forty-Niners. Among them were about 325 Chinese immigrants. More and more Chinese came flooding to California year after year. Like everyone else, they were hoping to get lucky and find gold.             Most of the first wave of Chinese immigrants came from Guangdong, China. These Chinese people came not only for fortune, but to escape poverty and conflicts. Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britain. Many rebellions and infinite village and family fights left Chinese people with a dream that things will get better. They saw the Gold Rush as an opportunity to escape all the drama going on where they lived. In fact, the Chinese people even gave California a special name-Gam Saan, or Gold Mountain. They wanted to go there, find riches, and come home with pride.                 The 325 Chinese who joined the Gold Rush in 1849 was only the start. In 1850, 450 more Chinese showed up in California. The numbers increased until there were more than 63,000 Chinese living in America. That's a pretty big number, which is why they even founded a Chinese community. Today, it is known as China-Town. The Chinese played a very important role in building the first transcontinental railroad. Although Chinese people can be found throughout America, about 77% of them lived in California.

In the 1800s many immigrants from all the over the world came to the United States to find a better life.            In the 1800s large groups of immigrants came over from the European countries. Many of the European immigrants wanted to leave the harsh conditions of Europe such as wars. Some Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger. Others came to find religious freedom, such as people from Holland, and mistreated Jews from Germany and Russian. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to taxes.           Large groups of Chinese also came to America during the gold rush. When John Sulter found gold in California many people from all over the world came to California. People came from all over the world and among these men were Chinese. They came to flee poverty and conflicts. Many farmers were unable to pay the government taxes. The population was growing quickly, but there was no food to feed them. Hopeless Chinese heard about California, so they decided to come to California. They longed to get rich and return to China proudly.                  All the immigrants from all over the world caused the population of the United States to increase. Europenas, Chinese, and many other  groups of people came to America to escape their harsh conditions and find a good life in America.               	NNP PRP RB VBD IN WRB DT DT NNS IN NNP VBD IN .

With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all of that.       The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. The transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869 with the help of many other people.       Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. John Sutter tried to keep the find a secret, but word soon got around. Many people started to go to California. Many Chinese were planning to get some gold in their pockets then go back strong and proud to China. People soon got what they wanted.

Later in the 1800s, other European countries were coming to America. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary also traveled to America. The second half of the 1800s was greatest time of change though. More immigrants traveled to America, industries grew, and transportation improved. In 1869 it became easier to move resources from the West to East because the first railroad that crossed America was built. Though there were some pushes and pulls during this time. For example, a push would be the Europeans that wanted to escape the harsh conditions and the Russian Jews that left because of prejudice and persecution. One of the pulls would be inexpensive books and newspapers and the telegraph that was invented in 1844. One of the greatest things discovered by a man named John Sutter in 1848 was gold. More than 70,000 people arrived in California in hopes for gold and 325 of these people were the Chinese. In China, the government raised taxes and the California gold rush seemed to be the only help the Chinese could get. In the end, it was a success for the Chinese. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States with jobs and played an important part in building the first transcontinental railroad! In the beginning it seemed hard for the immigrants but as time went on it got easier and everything seemed like a success.

In America they help out with a lot of recourse, but  that is a hole other story.                 In the story, Changes in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants, the story is about Immigrants helping America make better recourse, like the first railroad that goes across the hole continent of America was built in 1869 so that it can bring lots of lumber and silver and to take people  places. Also the first steam boat was made, it helped to bring people places over water instead of land.   In the story, Gold Rush !Chinese Move to California, the Chinese here that someone has hit gold, and the Chinese go to California to get there fortune. They start out as alittle bit people, but in there years more Chinese come to  America. By 1870 more than 63,000 Chinese men have goen to America.

This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.  In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.  Most newcomers new very little about America except that it was a land of freedom.  But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.          Changing in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants        People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever before.  The reasons they moved are characterized as 'pushes' and 'pulls'. Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes.  These include harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty.  Many of these push elements were made worse by rapid increase in the number of people in Europe.  Pulls are those features that attract people.  These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.        Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe.Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution , in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks.  Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States.         Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California        Gold was discovered in 1884 along the   American River in California, on the poverty of a man name John Sutter.  Although Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundreds of  people left the city to set off for the American River.  The new spread to the rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world as well.              More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849.  Among these 'Forty- Niners' were 325 men from China.  More Chines came the next year, and the next. Like many others who came from the eastern United States, The Chinese hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills.             Most Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast.  They were fleeing fro, conflicts and poverty.  People felt hopeless and they listened closely to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean.  They called California 'Gold Mountain', or Gam Saan (in Chinese).  To them it seemed a land of unbelievable treasures and richness.  They long to go there and make their fortunes, and return proudly to China.             The exciting news about Gold Mountain spread through China.  Many people wanted to join the Gold rush.             The 325 Chinese who joined the Gold Rush in 1849 were just the beginning.  The next year 450 more Chinese arrived in California.  Then suddenly they came in greater numbers: 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852.  By1870 there were 63,00 Chinese in the United States, and they had played a critical part in building the first transcontinental railroad.  Although they could be found throughout the country, 77% of them were in California.                 Although immigrating to America was a difficult journey in the 1800s, many people uprooted themselves and moved here.

You would have had to been really brave to come over to america because you where leaving everything behind; your money, your house, your job, you language. Everything was new, sometimes you might have had to change your religon. When you got to America you might not know what the lanuage is, that is something you would have to learn in order to live hear.                                       You could come herer and have a really good life, or your could fail and not be able to go back home to your own country. Sadly many people ended up like this due to them not having that much money coming over here. The people like that were stuck in America until they could afford a ship home. Sadly most people never could get home.                                      If you where to have come here with a good ammount of money you would be able to afford a house and maybe get a good job. If you where to have made it in this country then you where very lucky. Many people in other countries did not have that much money to bring to America, so they became homeless.                        These is what it was like back in the old days. It was mostly due to money that people came to America because they were so poor inn there home country. Some made it, others didn't. This is what life was like in the 1800's.

So,one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America.Then,some of Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came,because of the need of food,homes,and jobs.many Europeans came to find work and avoid hunger.After them,the Jews came in for religious freedom.Jews were often mistreated because of their beliefs in their  own country.when they all came in at 1850-1851 we had 26 million immigrants!??       Secondly,immigrants in America also went through the push and pull factor.Pushes are the factors life that drive people from there homes.Pulls are those features of life that attract people.Immigrants went through harsh environment, wars,conflicts,and poverty(being poor).Russian Jews faced a lot of pushes like prejudice and persecution,in the form of pogroms or organized violent attacks.Southern Italians went through high birth rates and farming losses.So,they left the land to the first born male which left the younger siblings with no land.       Lastly,in gold rush most of the first Chinese migrants came from guangdong.they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.In the 1800's guangdong was involved in a fight between china and Brittan.Not long after,were there rebellious ones against the government ,and endless village and family feuds.The Chinese government raised taxes.The farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell there land.So many of them moved to America.The 325 Chinese that joined the old rush in 1849 were just the beginning.The next year,450 more came to America.Then there were more:2,716 in 1851,20,026 in 1852.Today you can find more than 92,407,000 Americans and immigrants in America.

In country's like England have Kings and Queens who rule them. In America no one ruled them there were laws of course but people of a higher class cant just go up to you and be like clean my whole house and I'll give you 3 cents. They cant do that unless you agree like if you give me 20 dollars I'll clean your house. In America its a good place to raise kids and have a family becuase they are and always will be free.

The war recently ending and the Irish potatoe famine were two other reasons that people moved here. The main reason though is to become wealthy. People who could build or invent come to the United States in multiple ships. With all the new technology there was plenty of work to do. They could start a saw mill or a factory to get rich quick.

These people were looking for many things, including jobs, gold, freedom, food, or homes. With all the new technology, and growing industry, there was plenty for them to do.       In the later 1800's, people from Russia, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and Poland came looking for homes, food, and work, many came to avoid hunger. People from Holland, Poland, Russia, and Jews from Germany came for religious freedom, and still many others came to escape the wars that were making their lives unstable and unpredictable. Before the American Civil War in the 1860's, one-fourth of the entire population of Ireland came to America. In Ireland the crops had failed, especially the potato crop, and more than one million people died of starvation in Ireland. The Irish kept coming to America, during and after the war.       Russian Jews came to America to escape prejudice and persecution, southern IItalians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. These immigrants were desperate for help in the U.S.       Guangdong, an area on China's south coast was involved in two wars between China and Britain. This led to many rebellions against the government and endless village and family fights. The Chinese government raised taxes, farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. The area could not produce enough rice to feed it's people, so when the Chinese heard about the gold rush in California, they were desperate, and 325 Chinese came to take part in 1849.       These iimmigrants from all over the world came to America with many things in common, a need for freedom, food, work, and to make their lives better.   They helped build America, and were able to work in factories, to farm, and had religious freedoms, and became inventors. I can conclude that the 1800's was a great time for these immigrants to arrive in America and have their needs fulfilled.

Everybody we're in America!' the captain shouted after arriving at America. People moved to America after finding out that there was gold in California. John Sutter was the first to find gold on the American River. Many people went to California to look for gold. They would rush there before all of it was gone. Millions of people were present in California looking for gold. There were many farmers who could not pay for taxes so they had to sell their farms. This would've been the perfect time for them to earn some money.           'Come on! We must hurry to California. There is gold waiting for us,' Captain Benjamin Arlington told his crew. They were a poor family that was looking for a way to earn money. They have been poor their whole life and this was the perfect time for them. They were a British family and had little money to pay for taxes.           The family rushed to the California gold rush and claimed a spot to dig. Captain Ben searched for gold morning and night. The 2 children and a mother tried to find a place to work.           'Momma, why won't any body accept you for a job? I am tired and hungry,' the youngest of the children asked. heir mother did not answer. She just continued walking and asking people if she can have a job. All of the answers were no. They just remembered about their father. They wanted to tell their mother, but they were scared that she wasn't going to answer. Finally, when she was about done asking for jobs, she remembered about Ben.           'Ohhhh Noooo! We forgot about your father. We have to go and find him. What if he is hurt? Who is going to help him. We have to hurry back to him,'their mother said. They rushed back as quick as they could. They found him and asked how much gold he had found.           'I found 32 ounces. This might be enough to buy whatever we want to. Do you guys want me to keep looking or should we go home?' Captain Ben told his family.           'We should go home now. I am hungry and tired. I think you can't find anymore anyway,' the oldest child said. The family went to the dock and sailed back to Britain. They could now afford to pay taxes.            Most families like the Arlington family traveled to America just to get money. The family got back to Britain and never had trouble paying anything anymore.

One reason they came over to America is because over in Ireland, the population has dropped because people has died of starvation. They can't grow their crops because the crops have failed to grow. The same thing is with Europe.      Another reason they came here is they want to escape the harsh conditions in other countries. in Russia, the Jews left to escape prejudice and ppersecution.They do not want to die because of religion.      The last reason they came over to America is for wealth. A guy discovered gold, and tried to keep it as a secret. But the word spread and also ended up in china.

A lot of new inventions were made like the telagraph and the telaphone. A lot of Europeon immigrants moved to America because they wanted to start a new life in America. Chiniese moved to America because a lot of people were poor there and they wanted to find gold in california and then return to china with gold and stuff. First there were 325 Chinies in the gold rush, then it turned 63,000 in 3 years the population growed between 1860 and 1910 in America because of the gold ruch and stuff like that.

People immigrated to America because of the industry, the Gold Rush, and religious freedom.               During the 1800's the industry grew rapidly and with that the population did, too. In the industry growth the transportation improved. People had invented better ways to transport people and other objects. It was also easier to move resources that people needed for everyday life. Also, along with the indusry growth came more jobs and opportunities. This drove many more people to the U.S. because they were desperately in need for money for their family. The Gold Rush was a very big event that drove people to the U.S. , too.              People also moved to America because a large event, the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush was a time when people had moved to America in search for gold. This attraction definately made the population grow. Even though this event attracted many people, it did not benefit. People hadn't found much gold if at all.This wasn't the only reason why though, people also moved to America for their religious freedom.               People in other countires had to believe what their country believed. Some people had not agreed with their country's beliefs so, they either protested or moved to America. Here in America we have religious freedom. In other words, we could believe whatever we chose.               People who moved to America definately benefited because they got a better industry, their own religous freedom, and they might even have possibly gotten some gold from the California Gold Rush.

Some people immigrated because of 'push' and 'pull' reasons. 'Push' reasons are when somebody is forced, or driven from their home. 'Pull' reasons are when there are new, better opportunities in other countries that could better your life. Wether for either of these reasons, immigration in the 1800's was very interesting.       Many people from Ireland (in fact, over 1.7 million, or one fourth of the population) came to America for 'push' reasons. These people from Ireland had to come in order to have food. Back in their home country, Ireland, these people were going through starvation. Over 1 million people had already died from starvation there. A new group of immigrants came from many different European countries. These people had to find jobs, food, and homes. There didn't seem to be enough of these things back in their home countries.       People from many different continents all over the world had come to America because of 'pull' reasons. In the 1800's, people had immigrated to America in hope of becoming rich during California's Gold Rush. By 1849, more than 70,000 'Forty-Niners' had immigrated to America. You'd probably be surprised to find out that most of these people were from China. Although many people were unlucky, and didn't find gold, these people were important in molding America's history.

If they were, I will be saying what caused immagrants to go from one country to the next.       In the 1800's the people who were able to build, farm, or invent came to America to do just that. Especially with all the technology, there was lots to do. They came to find jobs and be free so they can raise there families. The gold rush was another big cause of a 'pull'. When gold was first fond in 1848, and the word had already spread quicker than lightning, the next year, 1849, 60 ships and thousands of traverlers were heading towards California. Then the gold rush had started. According to Source #2, more than 70,000 hoeful adventures arrived in California 1849. There was 325 Chinese men in that astonishingly large mob of 'forty-niners'. The 'pulls' were usally the good reasons why people came to America.       However, 'pushes' are the bad reasons why people move to America. In the 1800's the Germans were the largest single group of immigrants. Aside of the germans, were the Irish. In the 1860's, before the American Civil War, 1/4 of the population in Ireland came to America because in Ireland the crops never grew and they were on a food shortage. Therefore, more than 1,000,000(one milliom) starved to their deaths in Ireland. Europian immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Euorope. In Source #2, it says that Russians Jews left to escape prejudice and persicutions, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. Italians from the south, suffered from high birth rates and farming losses.The chinese, from the gold rush went to California for fortune because of conflicts and poverty. The area couldn't make enough rice for all of the people, especially when floods killed the crops.These 'pushes' caused lots of lives, but it also helped even more.       These 'pulls' and 'pushes' were no fun for these immigrants lives that rush and flee from country to country. The 'pulls' helped a lot in there lives. On the other hand the 'pushes' destroyed and hurt lives because of conflicts, poverty, violence, etc. But with hard work, jobs, food, and chances in life, you can live a pretty well offed life in the free country, America.

They were desperate because the Irelands crop was no good. They were low on food. Over One million people die of starvation.           In the 1800s, people from the European countries started coming that have not been sent to America before like Russians, Italians, Polish, Danish, Swedish, and Hungarians. Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Europe doubled. This cause more people to be hungry, homeless and jobless.To avoid hunger, people came to America for more food, more homes, and more jobs.           Most people came to America for religous freedom. Most of the them came from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia. Also, other people came to ascape war. People lived through that.          Through fifty year, aound 26 million immigrants came to America. When people were about to go America, they didn' know anything. They didn't know that there was cars or computers or the other inventions but, they knew that it was a land of freedom.

Some people came to America because were ever the Europeans did not have that many jobs or homes or a job so thats why people moved to America.

Many of them had been pushed out of there homelands and came to America seeking freedom. Some seeking religious freedom, others seeking the freedom of speech and legal assembly. No matter why they came they all got a chance in the new world.      The pre-Civil War time period had the most immigrants from Ireland about 1/4 of the population of Ireland came to America. Thats 1.7 million people. They mostly brought out of Ireland because of failed crops. This is a example of a 'push'. A push is what drives the immigrants out of there home country. The 'pull' is why a immigrant goes to a certain place. A example of this is the famous 'California Gold Rush'. Many Chinese people came to America seeking a fortune they can proudly take back to China. By 1870 there was a estimated 63,000 Chinese people through out America. 77% of which were in California. Immigrants have many industrial values. Such as the coal production increasing to 417,111,000. Miles in railroad tracks increased to 240,293.Population grew to 92,407,000. All of these between 1860 and 1910.      To conclude my informational text i would like to sum all i said up. Many people in this world have qualities they need to put to use. So they came some where they could. It helped the population and industrial growth in America. In 50 years over 26 million immigrants had come to America. With out of which we probably wouldn't have all the cool stuff we have today.

The Europeans immigrants were trying to escape the harashplaces they lived in. Europeans were trying to get out of that harash life they were in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Germans made the largest single immigrant group. Before the Americans Civil War in the 1860s one-fourth of of the whole population of Ireland came to America. That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and childern. They keptcoming during and after the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, Russia, Gremany, Jews, and Poland. in total of 26 millions immigrants arrivedin the United States. They came for freedom and a change to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                Half of the 1800s was a time of the great change. Immigrants arrived in America's shore to have freedom . Some came by boat and some by train. This meant thatit would become easier an easier to travel. In the 1800s United States was completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Gold Rush! The chinese moved to California on the property of a man nameds John Sutter. Although Sutter really tried to keep the discovery a secret word of the find soon reached San Franciso. And hundreds of years of people left the city to set off for the American River. News spreads to the rest of the United States. By January 1849 60 ships and trains and thousands of overland travlers were headed for California. The California gold rush had begun.

With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the the land, and invent things. Immigrants did all that .    Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-forth of the whole plantation of Ireland came to America. They kept coming, during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. More than one million people died of starvation in Ireland.     In the later 1800s, people started coming from other Europeon countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs-and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europians came to America came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.    In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Think about that--26 million! Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.

More reasons why people came to America was to get away from their old place of staying ,like they came for better weather ,less wars ,and no conflicts or poverty.Russian jews came for no prejudice and persecution.Others have come because of food resources, violent attacks ,and also because they have no land.One more reason why they decided to come to America was because of how the government raised taxes.

There are many reasons why the immigrated out of their own countries. America was the place to go!       One reason is that many countries didnt have lots of food. Another reason is because there might of not been a lot of places to work. Not working caused not having food. Maybe some other countries did not have rich soil. No rich soil mean no good crops. Others came for religious reasons. Maybe they didnt like the way thy taught religiously. For exampe, Jews were not treated correctly because of their religion. So they hoped moving to a different country will give them new opportunities and people would treat them how they would liked to be treated. Another reason is maybe America had the fastest transprortation.       These arent the only reasons why some people immigrated out of their own contry. There are so many other reasons. Theses are just a few common ones. 	NNP IN CD JJ NNS VBN TO NNP NNP VBP JJ NNS WRB DT VBN RP IN PRP$ JJ NNP NNP VBD DT NN TO VB .

There was a time were immigrants had to face harsh conditions,like harsh environment and conflicts.There was another time where immigrants had good jobs,wealth,and opportunities.              In 1848 gold was discovered along the American River.Among the 'Forty-Niners' were Chinese.Soon there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States!Chinese have played a critical part in building the first transitional railroad.Although they could be found throughout the country,77% of them were in California.Also most of the Chinese participated in most building project in the U.S.     	NNS IN JJ NNS VBD TO VB TO NNP IN IN JJ JJ IN NNS VBD NN , DT JJR NN , CC JJ JJ NNS RB JJ , PRP MD VB VB NNS , NN IN NNS , CC JJ NNS RB VBN IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN VBD NNS VBD TO VB JJ NNS , IN JJ NN CC JJ VBD DT NN WRB NNS VBD JJ NNS , NN , CC NNP NNP CD NN VBD VBN IN DT NNP NNP DT NNS POS VBD JJ EX VBD CD JJ IN DT NNP NNPS .

During the 1800s, people could farm, invent, or build came to America in ships. Those people were immigrants. People in America had plenty to do such as working in a factory, farming, building, or inventing. The Germans were the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s. The Irish were the second largest group of immigrants. Before the the American Civil War in the 1860s, 25% of the entire of population of Ireland came to America. Altogether, that is 1.7 million men, women, and children from Ireland came to America. The Irish were desperate because the crops failed, especially the potatoes. That led to a food shortage so that caused more than 1 million people to die of starvation in Ireland.     Later, other countries sent people to America that didn't usually send people there. These countries include: Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Europe's population doubled in between 1750 and 1850. The people needed food, homes, and work. It didn't seem like there was enough food, homes, or jobs in Europe so many of them moved to America to avoid starvation and to find a job.     Others came to America seeking religious freedom. Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Others came to escape wars. Altogether, around 26 million immigrants came to America in only 50 years! Once the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed, transporting goods and people became faster and easier.     Steam power and the printing press allowed people to print inexpensive books and newspapers which allowed people to spread news faster. People sometimes came to America to escape pogroms-or organized violent attacks. Others wanted to make a new life for themselves and their families.     A man named John Sutter found gold in California and tried to keep it a secret but word spread to San Fransisco so hundreds of people headed for California in hopes of finding gold. More than 70,000 people came to California in 1849. 325 of these 'Forty-Niners' were from China. More Chinese men came the next year,and the next. The Chinese hoped to find a fortune in the California hills because they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.   By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States that all played a part in building the first transcontinental railroad.   By 1860, there were 31,513,000 people in the U.S. America has a rich history and it is a free country. That is why America has a rich and diverse culture.

Second, many people also moved because of the gold rush. Third, there are many other reasons too.The wars made people wnat to move.               The wars had an impact on many people. First, wars always make some people get involved in them. Many people got caught up in it. The Chinese migrants from Guangdong was caught up in the two wars between China and Britain. If they move to the United States of American, they wouldn't have to be involved unless they wanted to. Second, many people suffer from the wars. Wars make governments tell people to ration their food. Some people have so little to eat that they die from starvation. If they moved to the United States, the people can decide wether they want to ration their food or not. Even if wars had an impact on some peoples' lives, the gold rush turned some peoples' lives around.                The gold rush was a blessing  to some people. First, the gold rush let some people who were poor, get rich. The poor really enjoyed that. If they struck gold, they could win the love of their life or treat their sister's illness. The rich also enjoyed getting more rich too. Second, this was a blessing to the Guangdong. Since their population was growing, they needed money, food, and a place to stay. The gold rush got around, and before long, many people were striking gold! The Guangdong were also free of the wars.

From why people were coming, to what they did when they got here. In this article, I will be telling you about the things that I have learned. I hope you enjoy 'Coming To America'! You're in for the trip of your life, because we are traveling back in time, to1860, when imigration just started to become popular.       It's 1860 in America, and suddenly, there are strange people arriving in from boats that have traveled thousans of miles. You hear about the crop fail in Ireland, The American Civil War, and the religious hate that is going on all over the world. Your thinking to yourself, 'are these people here because of that?', and the answer is yes! These peole have come to America to experience the freedom that we have everyday.       There were many 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' that made forigen people want to come to America. A 'Push' is something that drives people from their homes. A 'Pull' us something that attracted people to come to America. Some of the 'Pulls' that were happening all over the world were harsh enviornments, wars, conflict, and poverty. Some of the 'Pulls' that were happening in America were jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. 	VBG TO NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP , PRP VBP VBN VBG NN IN NN IN DT NNP .

In the 1800s there was what you would call a hard time in life in the east of the Untied States. They were doubling in numbers quick. As they ran out of food, clothes jobs they really just came into poverty like most Americas are today but back then it was a lot harder .When they came upon a add in the newspaper they started to fly over . It was Mexico jump-en jelly beans it was crazy .As more people came over from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark , Sweden and even Hungary.A total of twenty six million people had came over to America. Most of them knew little about our country. They only knew that it was free and had money to feed there family's give shelter and a chance to work .              In the second half of the 1800s it was a time of change most of the immigrants arrived on the seashore but the first railroad was completed in 1869 and it made it a lot easier . Even as the process got easier times didn't get as easier as the United States though they had to life triple everything coal,money,cut trees and even make more newspaper.With a few  more inventions life became a little easier the telegraph and telephone in 1844 and 1876 made news travel faster.                When gold was discovered in 1848 beside the America river in California news spread all over the world as hundreds of people started to come over the Gold Rush had begun .More than 70,000 eager adventurers came to the America river to seek for there future. Many Chinese migrants came from Guangzhou. They were trying to get away from conflicts and poverty . Very slowly millions of Chinese had moved to country to get away from there bad life to seek gold in a fortune and a happy life and it was completed in the late 1800s To a ending total there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States. They could be found all over the place but 77% of them were in California living a happy and free life like they are suppose too.

The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America.Tranportation improved when the first railroad was created,and it helped people to travel because one trip to another became shorter for many people.In the 1800s,there was a quick change of how quickly and widely imformation traveled.Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many books and newspaper and Later in 1844 the telegraph was invented and in 1876 the telephone made news faster.          People became very aware of the world and with the ability to move long distances very easily,so they moved more than ever before.The reason they moved is the harsh environment,wars,and poverty and many of these diasasters were made worse by rapid increase of people in Europe.Many new European immagrants wanted to escape harsh conditions and Russion Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution in the form of pogromsorganized violent attacks.

The Germans made up the largest single group of people who came into the new lands in the 1800s. Also, People from European Countries such as, Russia, Poland, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary. 1/4 of all the people from Ireland also came because of food shortage, and the Irish people made up the second largest group of immigrants with about 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.       In source #2, the second half of the 1800s was a time of great changes in America. Industry grew, immigrants arrived on America's shores, and transportation improved greatly. Now, since the transportation improved, such as the first railroad that crossed the U.S was completed, people can now move resources such as lumber, food, and even minerals like silver. Once the people learned much about the world, they came to the United States, seeking a newer world with freedom and great jobs.       In source #3, once gold was discovered on John Sutter's property, thousands of people came to the State of California, of 70,000 forty-niners, 323 men were from china. Most of the first group of Chinese immigrants came from the town of Guangdong, an area on China's southern coast. The people from Guangdong were fleeing from conflicts, poverty, two seperate wars, government rebellions, taxes that were raised, seemingly endless family feuds. The rest of China was being very short on foods becaues floods often destroy their crops (such as rice or wheat) for their rapidly growing population.Each year, there were many more Chinese immigrants, first was 325 in 1849, next was 450 more in the year of 1850, then in great numbers such as 2,716 in 1851 and then 20,126 in 1852. The chinese played an important role in Califronia and the U.S.A because they helped build the first transcontinantal railroad(all across the U.S), and about 77% of all chinese in the United States are in the state of California. 	.

People came from China, Ireland, Germany, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. This day so called 'Heritage Day' is based on how many people came to America to live a better life. It reflects on how many immigrants came to America looking for wealth. Many were to avoid hunger for their kids and themselves.        In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries. The population of Europe doubled during these years. They needed extra jobs, food, homes, and there wasn't enough of them in Europe. That's why Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger.        Others came for religious freedom, people from Holland and the Jews. Others came to escape wars that made life hard.        In total, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States in 50 years. Some immigrants did not know a lot about America but that's what they desired freedom and a chance to work.         Chinese immigrants came for gold. The Chinese called California Gam Saan. When the gold rush started the word got around China first sent 325 men, then 450, then 2716,then 20026. By then there were 63,000 Chinese men in the U.S. The Chinese men built the first transcontinental railroad. 77% of California were railroads. The population in America increased a lot. Immigrants were history, they came about 200 years ago.

Our lifestyle is way different than ours and they shouldn't come into our city without the right, wrights. Most of the peolpe do not belong in some nice places and if they are poor then oh well because they cannot come to some other city and just take all of their food they must learn to share food and be nice and to buy food with there money.                My second source is 'Changes in America: Pushes and Pulls'   Well there are many different pushes and pulls in some cities and states and some do not belong and some people get mad and just get to pushy with the people. And some of the people just are like some mean they want to pull they people out of there place and just tell them to leave cause they don't belong here. And some of the travelers who come to the different cities and towns are not even welcomed to these places and just like walk in their when they are not even invited and try to take poeples food and just steal from every body. Some of the travelers just need to stay where they are or go live somewhere else like with grandparents or parents if they had any backthen.

This was a great time in history. Immigrants moved to the Americas for many reasons.                                                                                                                                                                           First, technology was very advanced and gave many job opportunities. Immigrants could work in new factories. Immigrants could also farm land and grow crops to sell such as potatoes. They could build things on land and they also invent many things. They invented things to use with this new technology.                                 Next, many things pushed people away from their home land . they wanted a better life. They live din harsh envciornments , and thought that the Americas would be better for them. they also suffered from poverty. Wars went on in the ir cities and they wanted to escape it.                                                                                  Finally, the 'Gold Rush' brought many immagrants  to come to the Americas beacuse many wanted to become rich. people came from all over the world. More than 70,000 adventures came. they were called 'fourty-niners' in hope of becoming rich. Some did become rich, but sdome didn't.

The reasons for coming to America is different for all the immigrants.        The Germans were the largest group of immigrants to immigrate to America. The second largest group of immigrants were the Irish. The Irish came to America because they were suffering a famine back in Ireland. The Irish were desperate for a better life, so the Irish immigrated to America. Soon after, people started coming from other countries. The southern Italians experienced high birth rates and farming decreases due to lower prices. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary were some of the countries. The people from those countries came because they all needed food, homes, and jobs. Some people from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia came to America seeking religious freedom. Jews were constantly mistreated for their religious beliefs. Overall, many came to America so they could escape their dreadful life back at home.        This sudden increase in America's population was ginormous! 26 million immigrants immigrated to America over a 50 year period. During the second half of the 1800s, even more immigrants arrived!        The reason for the immigrants coming to America this time was because of the American industry growth. People in America could now import and export products faster. The printing press was able to print books and newspapers which meant news could travel faster. By 1844, the telegraph was invented, and by 1876, the telephone was invented.        An example of immigrants immigrating because of what they 'wanted' is the California gold rush. News of the California gold rush spread throughout the United States. Over 70,000 people came to California seeking for gold in 1849. Many Chinese came the very next year. They were looking for fortune through gold.        Many Chinese came from Guangdong, China. They wanted to escape conflicts, and poverty. The people of Guangdong were rebelling against the government. The Chinese government raised taxes, and farmers who couldn't pay the taxes had no choice but to sell their land. For this reason, Guangdong couldn't produce enough food to feed its citizens.        As time passed, more and more Chinese came during the California gold rush. The Chinese played an important part in building the first transcontinental railroad.        In conclusion, America wouldn't be as diverse and technological if immigrants hadn't arrived. The immigrants were essential in order to accomplish many things in America.

These immigrants believed that if they moved to America their lives would get better.   In the 1800's immigrants from ireland were coming to America to find better places to grow potatoes. In ireland the potato crop was having a bad harvest every year due to harsh conditions. Due to harsh conditions they immigrated to America.   In the mid 1800's people were migrating from many countries in Europe. Some countries were Hungary,Russia,etc. The reason for their immigration was due to the population in Europe.   In the late 1800's the chinese imm igrated to america because of harsh crop growing conditions and they had heard the word about gold. Many came for gold others came due to harsh environment.   That is why many countries immigrated to America in the 1800's.

They have easier transpotation for the workers to so that made it a lot easier for the buisness to get peopel to want to work there.          The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just a beinning. The next next year ,450 more Chinese came along. Then suddenly they came more and more numbers of Chinese became more and more longer 27,716 in 1851 and in 20,026 in 1852. By 1810, there was 63,000 of them.

My grampa, Gregorio, immigrated from Mexico to U.S. because he was mistreated and wanted to live a better live with my father and his brothers and sisters. So he decided to pack all his needs, and immigrate to the United States.         The first thing they did before immigrating was to tell everybody that they were immigrating to the U.S. So after they told evetrybody they were immigrating, they started to pack all the stuff they needed so they can go to the U.S. They thought it was going to be easy packing, but it wasn't. After they were done packing, they went to say good-bye to al there family members and friends.          The second thing they did was go to the bank to go and get some money for the trip. They got the money and got prepared for the trip tommorrow. That night nobody couldn't sleep.They were worried about the trip and what was going to happen, how long it was going to take, would they ever make it to the U.S. But in the end they did and that is then when my sisters and I where born here in the United States. And now, my grampa is feeling much better here with me and his sons. 	NNP PRP VB CC VB PRP VB NN WDT VBZ VBN TO DT NNP .

Many immigrants moved to California becuase they wanted freedom and a job. Chinese people usually moved here becuase they called California 'Gold Mountain'. To them California seemed like a land of riches. the exciting news about Gold Mountain soread and everybody wanted to come to CA. in 1860, there was 31,513,000 people in the U.S. In 1910, there was 92,407,000 people in the U.S. The people population was increasing very fast. Other than Chinese people, there were also Irish people. Before the American Civil War, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. They kept coming during and after the war.

America was a free country. although that was a major factor the immigrants moved becasue of new outstanding technology. Telephones were invented and others such as printing press, and steam engines.That made information spread fast.The immigrants also moved because in their other country there was lack of food sources and there were wars, poverty, and other conflicts going on in there lives.       They looked for new lives and they wanted a chance to have freedom and have homes and food to eat. They wanted jobs and needed them. The hills of california drove many because of fine gold and other poverty.More chinese Fleed to America becauese the chinese government raised taxes.

I going to talk about the reasons why they immigrated to America. Also we will talk about the push and pull factors to why they immigrated.        People started building farms or invented to came to America. Technology in the 1800's evolved and there was plenty to do. Some technology was used in factories, farms and to invert. The immigrants did it all.       The two largest groups of immigrants was the Irish and the Germans.  Before the civil war more than one-fourth of Irish population came to America. The Irish to America because the crops was dead especially the potato. One million Irish people death to starvation. Later more people from countries come like Russia and Sweden.  Many of them came find work and food. Then Jews came from Germany and Poland to have religious freedom.       Around the 1850 the California gold rush happen.  Over 60 ship and tons of overland travelers went to California for the gold rush. 70,000 people arrived in California for gold in 1849.  Among this men 345 were chaise.

Europeans wanted to get to a safe area because adolf hitler was killing the jews. The germans could not hurt them in america. Ierland potatos were not safe to eat so they moved over to america to get new land and not get posioned by the potatos.

In the later 1800s ,people started to come from Russia,Sweden,Italy,Poland,Denmark,and Hungary .All of those people needed food ,jobs,and homes .The population in Europe doupledbetween 1750 and 1850 .More and more people came to the U.S. from all over Europe.Can you imagine boats coming to the shore right where you live and people getting off them and you don't know who they are?       Other people came for religious freedom .Jews came because they were often mis treated for their beliefs.Other people came to get away from wars.The total immigrants was about 26 million .Can you imaginethat 26 million immigrants .Thats alot but they keepcoming .       Industry keeps growing so that means trans portation improves.so alot more immigrants came .With the new technology came better printing presses.That made it possible to print better books and more newspapers.Then came the invention of the telegraph and the telephone. That made news travel faster.       Soon gold was discoverd in 1848 along the American River in California .Chinese people heard about this and wanted to make their fortunes there.the first year 325 Chinese people arrived in the U.S. The next year 450 more Chinese people came .More and more people came to make a better life .Thats alot of people who came to the U.S.I really hope you have enjoyed myt presentation.I know I have enjoyed reshearching this information .

Soon enough European countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.          The second half of the 1800s was when great changes happened in America. The first railroad was completed. Soon enough more immigrants came. Transportation changed.The telephone was created.         The Gold rush was happening in California and many chinease people came to America.77% live in California. The chinease played a part that is very critical. They created the first transcontinental railroad.By 1870, about 63,000 chinease were in America's population.

They came to America because they were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things, which immigrants all did. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the entire Irish population came to America, which was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. They kept coming, during and after the war. They were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage, and more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In total, after immigrants from Ireland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Germany, and more came to America, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period!            The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. The first railroad that crossed the U.S. was finished in 1869. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. In the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.            Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. Although he tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of it soon reached San Francisco. Later, the exciting news about Gold Mountain spread throughout China. Many people wanted to join the gold rush.

Those people helped create the world as it is today. Many people came for many different reasons. For example, many Chinese people came from 1849 to 1870 for the gold rush. Many people also came for new opportunities. Many people came for jobs, wealth, access to resources and perceived freedoms.       Many people think of immigration as 'push' and 'pull.' To push means to get kicked out of their homes or country. To pull is to get lured into another country. For example, many European immigrants got pulled into America because they wanted to escape their harsh living conditions. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution in forms of pogroms (organized violent attacks). Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower crop prices. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the U.S.       Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Stutter. After a while, word broke out around the world and many people came to California. In 1849, China 325 men came to America. After losing many homes and farms, people from China thought they could become rich if they find gold in America. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then in 1851, 2,716 people came for the gold rush. More and more people came year after year.       Now you see that many people immigrate, from all around the world. Those people helped make the world as it is today. 	NNP PRP VB IN IN DT JJ CD NNS , NNS IN IN DT NN VBD TO DT NNP .

Here are some of the reason why they came to America, there were many people who came to America to find work and aviod hunger, but it was mostly European's. Other's came for religous freedom.Some of the reason's why people left was because European immigrant wanted to escape harsh conitions, and many Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and perecution because of what they belived. Another reason why people from all over the world came to America was because,Gold was discoverd and many people including chinese people came to California to go and try to discover gold.  More than 70,000 people that were hopeful in finding gold came to Califonia in 1849. During the Gold rush 77% of chinese men and women came to find gold. In conclusion, thoses are the reason's why they came to America.

Some immigrants came for religious reasons too. For example, in source #1 people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, because Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. The population in Europe doubled in 100 years, 1750-1850. Also, in 50 years America gained 26 million immigrants. Most of them went to America because of freedom and they had a chance to work. In the late 1800s, in Europe traveling became much easier. You could catch a train and it would take them right to a boat. From Europe to America, earlier people thought that it took months to travel that far, but with new steam ships it doesn't feel like months and it is much faster! Also, in the 1800s, they made a new printing press so it was much cheaper to print books and newspapers. After the steam boat and the new printing press, that got people flowing with ideas, for instance, the telegraph was invented in 1844 and the telephone was invented in 1876. People became used to the world now with all the new equipment. the reason people immigrated was because of the pushes and pulls. A push is where people get driven out of their own home, maybe because of war and a bad neighborhood. A pull means something that attracts people, such as jobs, money, opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.

And number of people who lived in us cities.           I wonder how it was in that time period .   And ways they had to servive,hunt,and build homes.   It's like my video game,minecraft except I bet it's way harder than my game.           They probly moved to the u.s.a because are country was a free country.   I bet the immigrants were tired of all abuse.   Were they would become slaves and rought.            They most likely hated those unfair rules.   We came a long way from hatred and unfair punishments to a great,loving society.   Now are rules are fair and we live in a great world.       It makes me think how now were all spoiled how we had a roof over  our head these days.   Back then kids knew what was right they didn't need a reason to learn they knew what was right for there family.   In conclusion  i hope our society  finds the heart to help more peaple,and to develope a great and stronger country.         	DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ IN WRB NNS VBD TO NNP .

People have also come because the pushes and pulls.That has happen you might have come on a ship or a boat worker or as a ship worker train driver train worker.You might have bin forced to leave because the population grew so they forced you to leave.The American population in 1860 is 31,513,000 in 1910 it was 92,407,000.The number of people who live in city are 6,216,518 in 1860 in 1910 it was 41,9978,932.Coal production in 1860 is 20,471,000 in 1910 it was 417,111,000.the miles in railroad tracks are 30,626 in 1860 in 1910 it was 240,293.The number of people born outside of the US is 4,096,723 in 1860 in 1910 is 13,344,545.The numbers of newspapers produced daily is 387 in 1860 in 1910 it was 2,600.

Other people came to America just for freedom.Jews came to America because in their country they were being mistreated for their beleifs.Some people came to escape wars that made their life unstable.Industry grew and more immagrants came  to America.

People from Ireland, Germany, and other Europeans came to America at this time. Some reasons are... They were forced to. They were attracted to things in America. They needed more homes or jobs, and they came for religious freedom. These are some more reasons why they came to America.        The Irish came because in Ireland, there was a potato famine. Many people were dying of starvation, so some needed a place to go to. Later in the 1800's, many other immigrants were coming from different places in Europe. Some reasons were there didn't seem to be enough homes, food, and jobs in Europe. Some even came to escape hunger and illness. Later, the Jewish and other countries came for religious freedom. (They were mistreated for their beliefs in Europe.) Others came to escape wars that could be very unpredictable.         So now you see there were many reasons people came to America. Not just for gold. (Which people did.) Not just for lots of land or wealth. Lots came because they were forced by natural disasters and to escape the lives they were living in. Those were some reasons people immigrated to America.

This shows that immagration wasn't that easy as in presant time.Most of the populations in diffrent countries have lowered down because of war or harm right before many wars people moved to protect family and be safe.           After gold was discoverd in America many of the chinese had moved to find gold. The gold rusgh was really good for the chinese so they can build and create new things.And as soon as they heard many people had fled the country to discover gold.

Well, I have. Alot of things happened the 200 years acually. Alot of people went their own way and some just stayed in their country and dealt with what they got. Some countries had things happen to them that are really bad and didnt know how to fix it so they just did what they had to do, do their own thing.       The Germans were the largest single group of immagrants in the 1800s; the Irish were the second largest group.One-forth of the whole population of Ireland came to America because the crops in Ireland failed (Thats 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children). More than 1 million people in Ireland had died because of starvation.They were desperate for food and hoping that someone could help.       Many people came to Europe and doubled its population from 1750 - 1850. 26 million immagrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Thats a lot of people that came to the United States. The number of people went up by 60,894,000 people from 1860 - 1910. Think of how many people that is, and thats just a little part of the earth.       A lot of people that stayed in the country that their from needed help, jobs, food and a lot more things. They didnt know what to do. They were really scared and eventually, they died because of starvation and probably sickness. Alot of people just wanted freedom, a chance to work, and help, a lot of help.       The second half of the 1800s were good though. The transportation was improved and the railroad that crossed the United States was completed. Alot of good things happened in the second half of the 1800. Now, lets keep our fingers crossed that everything will be good.

Irish people, German people, Chinease people, and lots more have moved all over the world, most have migrated to the United States of America. There are still people migrating today from city to city, state to state, or even country to country. I think this has enhanced peoples cultures and ideas.            Germans started moving to the United States in the 1800's. Irland started sending people before the civil war which was in 1860's and even through the war. Later Europe sent people to America including Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. European people came for jobs, homes, food, ect..            People started making advancements in America such as the steamboat, trains, telephone, the printing press, ect.. Know people could trade faster on water with boats and trade faster on land with trains. This created more jobs for people.            More jobs are made by finding gold! People went out to find it. Chinease even came out to find it around 324 men. Thease men were called the 'Forty-Niners'. They were mostly from Guangdong a area of the southern coast of China.            In conclushion inthe 1800's people migrated and most were to the United States, like Germany and Irland. New things were invented like the steam boat and the train. and gold was found in California which Chinease migrates to America.

People from many different places moved to America because of jobs, wealth, freedom, and many other things.             The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850 and all those extra   people needed food, homes, and jobs, but there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe, so they came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Other people came for religious freedom. Some of these people were from Holland, Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total, about 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Most people didn't know much about America, besides the fact that it's a land of freedom and they'd have the chance to work.               In the second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America.  Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation also improved and in 1869 the first completed railroad crossed the United States. Transportation became much shorter and easier for many people. Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe, and Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States.       Information traveled quickly, especially when gold was discovered in 1848    along the American River in California. The owner of the property where it was found, John Sutter, wanted to keep it a secret, but soon it reached San Francisco, and hundreds of people left to set off for the American River. The news traveled across the United States and to other parts of the world. By January in 1849, ships with thousands of people on board were heading for California. The California gold rush had begun.       More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849, most    were Chinese. More Chinese people came year after year. These Chinese people were like the rest, they hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills.       Guangdong, an area on China's south coast, were fleeing from conflicts and    poverty. Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britain, and there were also many rebellions against the government, and endless village and family feuds, or fights. The Chinese government raised taxes, farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land, Guangdong's population was growing quickly, and the area could not produce enough rice to feed its people, especially when floods often destroyed the crops. People felt hopeless and they listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean and called California Gam Saan, or 'Gold Mountain.' To them it seemed amazing! No. More than amazing. Unbelievable! They dreamed about its unbelievable richness and they longed to go there, make their fortunes, and return proudly to China.

But they moved a long way.                It is hard people all people to move to a long distance. Because you might miss your friends and family. Most likely kids are going to be scared because the have no Friends.The Mexicans eat different foods so that would be a change for them to.               In the 1800s people came to America with like 30 ships well they just keep coming. The people who built the ship was the people who built the farm houses.The Germans where the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s. The other big group was the Irish.           Another change in moving is the money 5 bucks is worth a lot more in Mexico. Some culchers may not take American money.Then you will have to make money at that city, or state.that city might even have different laws and you could get busted.           Theses are all my reasons why moving is hard. Its hard in the food, money, laws and a lot more.

So now i will tell you how hard it is this in next paragraph.            first you have to learn the language(which may take awhile). then there is the cultures that are very different.   then the laws like from your other country you might be able to get away with stuff you cant get away with.            you must also get used to their foods.Which i find very hard. for me i would hate to move to another country and you see why.

I will tell you why those sre the most inportant reasons in the following paragraphs.           First of all, freedom is very inportant because if we didn't have freedom then our live wouldn't be the same. We wouldn't get the job, clothes, friends, or choses that we want. It would be like we are traped in a cage beacuase we wouldn't be able to do the thing we want. Other people will tell you who to hang out with, what to wear, and what you will be doing for the rest of your life. Thats why the peopole moved to the United States so they could have they freedom. They get to choose who to hang out with, what to wear, and what you are going to do for thr rest of your life.           Secondly, the food that they had were they used to live died. All their food failed to grow and they starved to death they almost died. If  they wouldn't have found the United States the they would have died and never survived. Luckly the United States has good soil so that they are able to grow crops for their familys.       Finally last of all, a place to live if they don't have a place to live then they would be very cool in tha winter. They would have nothing to keep them from getting wet like a roof over their head. Also they would have to have nothing to cook their food on like a stove or an oven. If they have a house it would blouck out the storms, strong wind, and rain.           In conclusion thats why many people have moved to theUnited States. Even today many people are still moving to the United States. IT has realy helped alot of people because of how much is provided. IT saved a lot of lives too and has helped people who don't have alot of money.

Another reason they came is because there were wars going on during the time also. A lot of people were dying of hunger too.                                                                                                                                                      Other reasons are because there was a big gold rush during 1849. So many Europeans for the gold rush to try to find a good fortune of gold. Most of the people that came were Chinese people because they were trying to find the big fortune in California's hills. A lot of people found gold and they where not in poverty any more and they found jobs in the U.S.                      	CD IN DT NNS WRB NNS IN NNP VBD TO DT NNS VBZ IN PRP VBD NN , NNS , CC PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NNP NNP JJ NNS VBD DT RB PRP VBP IN NNS CC JJ NNS TO VB NNP NNP NN PRP VBD VBZ IN EX VBD NNS VBG IN IN DT NN NNP DT NN IN NNS VBD VBG IN JJR NNP NNP NNS VBP IN EX VBD DT JJ NN NN IN CD RB JJ NNS IN DT NN NN TO VB TO VB DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP IN DT NNS IN VBD VBD JJ NNS IN PRP VBD VBG TO VB DT JJ NN IN NNP POS NNP NNP NN IN NNS VBN NN CC PRP WRB RB IN NN DT RBR CC PRP VBD NNS IN DT JJ .	1		20131022151017	2443	2		20131022151011	2352	1		20131024151054	2405	1

Before the civlir war in 1860s one foruth of the Ireland came to America. There was 1.7 millons of irish men, women,and childern. In america there was 26 millons of people who wanted freedome and wanted to work.                    In the second half of 1800s there was time of great change in america. The tranportation imporved. The travelers could catch a train that will take them to a boat. The invention a telegraph and telephone mad news travel faster. The immagrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and there families in the Uited States.                    The chinese goverment raise the taxes. The farmer who coulnd't pay the taxes had to sell there land. The chinese called california gam saaan, or the gold mountain. The chines wanted to join the gold rush. The immagrent wanted FREEDOME and wanted to work.That is my story about the immagrents.

Gold was another push for people to come to the U.S. Gold was discoverd in 1848 in San Fransisco. More than 70,000 people came to California. These people were called the forty niners.             From 1860 to 1910 a lot had changed of America like the population. In 1860 there were 31,513,000 people in America then in 1910 the population was overloaded to 92,407,000. during this time America was getting a lot of people from outside the u.s. In 1806 the people born outside the u.s. was 4,096,753 but in 1910 the population of imagrints shot up to 13,344,545. With that many people in the u.s. production shot up to... Coal production was in 1860 at 20,471,000 tons then in 1910 its was up to 417,111,000 tons!! Making railroads was also topping the charts in 1910 at 240,293 miles compared to the little they had in 1860 wich was 30,626 miles.                        People came to America for different reasons some came for religious freedom. People from Holland, Jews who came from Russia, Poland, and Germany. People made America change they made the first rail road that crossed the USA in 1869. in the 1800s there was more rapid change to America like the printing press the telegraph and the telephone.              As you can see America has surved many people and more to come. America...the best place on earth. 	CD , CD CD NNS .

If some of them had not, some of us could be living in Europe!     Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. The second largest group of immigrants is the Irish. About 25% (1.7 million Irish men,women, and children) of the Irish moved to America before the american civil war in the 1860s, due to the Great Potato Famine which took 1 million Irish lives. They kept coming, during and after the war. The irish were very desperate because the most important crop, Potatos had failed, along with most of the other crops.     In the later 1800s, people started coming from the other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. These include Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. This is because between 1750 and 1850 the populations of Europe nearly doubled. There just didn't seem to be enough food, homes, and jobs in Europe for them. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S over a 50 year period. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.   Many new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks, Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. The traditions of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and thier families in the U.S.   As you can see, lots of people Immigrated to the U.S., but the main reason is because high rates in child birth, crop failiure, and most of all, to get freedom. If these people didn't face the challenges of Immigrating to the U.S. some of us wouldn't even be in the U.S., we would be Europeans!

Also people from Ireland was the largest immigrant group. More than 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children came to america because of attacks and crops that had failed like potatoes. Irish famillies came over to America just to find food for their families because of the crops. There were 26 million immigrants that came to   America total! The newcomers knew very little things about America except that America was a land of freedom. The immigrants that came to America wanted freedom and a job.               In the 1800s, there was a change in America. There were more transportation like the steamships and the train that first crossed the United States. The train helped a lot of people travel faster. One of the big reasons why immigrants migrate is the pushes and pulls. One reason why some immigrants move to America is the wealth, the jobs, and the freedom. Russian Jews left because of the organized attacks.                      On 1848, gold was discovered along the American River in California. A man named John Sutter discovered gold on his property but then the word spread and immigrants from China came to California. On 1849, 60 ships were loaded with travelers. More than 70,000 adventurers arrived in California in the search of gold. There were 325 Chinese men came to America for the gold rush. The Chinese came over to America from Guangdong to flee from wars. One war was between China and Britain. The Chinese government raised the the taxes and farmers weren't able to pay the tax. Guangdongs population went up so high that they couldn't produce enough rice to feed its people. Floods often destroy crops in Guangdong. 450 more Chinese arrived in California. More and more Chinese people arrived every year. By then on 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States.            So the Chinese and other adventurers are in search of gold and the Irish people are starting their new lives with jobs. That is why immigrants migrate to America because of then land and the it is the land of the free.

My mom had trouble going to America because her family didn't have nothing so they had to walk through deserts and a lot of obstacles throughout the whole time. My mom missed the rest of her family that is in Mexico at the time but she knew that they might come back for a while or so to welcome us. It was hard when she had to bring nothing like her clothes,toys,or food because there was only five of them going to America. When she finally got ther she was glad not like ordinary people saying this place is horrible or it took to long.   Migrating or imagrating is tough because sometimes when you grew up in the same house for a long time and when you move the feeling goes away like when you have to move to a different state or country like you go to New York or moving to China just because of better needs or for are a better job. It is hard to stay strong when you are sad that you know your moving to a different house or place because you are going to feel different in your gut saying 'this does not feel right' or 'I want to go home'. When imagrates want to come in a certain area there will be differnt people and places so if you do not want to be home sick just get your favorite object and bring it and enjoy it while you can. In the beginging of knowing you are moving you are possibley going to be happy or depressed about  moving to a new place you have never been before. If the place you are moving to is far then you might be really sad because it feels weird in your gut and you are going to say to your parents why did we have to move.   It is hard moving to a different state like Oregon, Texas,California, or Florida. When you move to a state you will be surprised or sad to see new buildings or friends that you've missed for a long time. It can be hard when you are moving to a different state because there is your family back in your old house, like you have your favorite relatives like your uncles,aunts,cousins, and grandparents. You might have to go to a plane or drive all the way to your new house but when you do that it will cost money for a plane or a moving truck for your items that you own. When you move to a state always remember your family and the things that you have as a gift of life.   If you move to a different country it is going to be a lot of work to do when your there. When you move to a different country  you are going to have to learn a new language and a new religous. When you move to a country always remember to do your best of what you don't know if you go to a different school and learn something new. If you go to a country like China,India,or Russia then you are going to have to learn new things like rituals and celibrations. If you go to a different country then you are going to have to see new friends and a new home.   I always wonder how many people are in a state and in a country when I move somewhere or anywhere I go. When I move I always say how many people moved this time of year or decades. When I am in a new house I always want to think about people going somewhere in there life like in a different place. I want to count how many people went or came to the same location or time of this year. Finally when I move I feel bad for the people missing there things and stuff for themselfes also for there family.

They cane to America if they could build,invent,farm.While they were their the worked at factorize.Also at that time they had better technology         In the 1800s, it was one of the best. their were more immigrants arriving.Also they built a railroad track so that they can transpiration.The 1800s was also a very important time to.There were lots of changes.So yes their were lots of good things and a lot of bad things.         In 1848 the Gold Rush was discovered. It was discovered by John Sutter.He tried to keep it a secret but it got out.Then the news paper found out and spread it all over.So then over 70,000 auctions people showed up in America hoping to get gold.They were mostly from china.         During 1860-1910 some populations grew and some decreased.like in the U.S we started out with 31,513,000 and we increased to 92,407,000. But the one their grew the most was Cola Production in tons. Theirs was 20,471,000 to 417,111,000. so their was a big amount of people at a time an then decreased.         So how would you like to immigrate to somewhere new ans live and you would increase that sate?   .

Germans were the largest single group of immigrants. Next to the Germans were the Irish, t hey were also the larges immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, 25% of the whole population of Ireland came to America. 1.7 million men, women, and children of the Irish came to America. They kept coming during and after the war.             The Irish were desprate because in Ireland all of the crops had failed, ecpecally the potato crop. Because that happened there was a horrible food shortage. more than 1 million people died because of the food shortage.             Later in the 1800s, people started coming from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary in the European countries. The Erope population doubled between 1750-1850. All the extra people needed food, water, a home and jobs. the problem was that wasn't enough for the extra people in Europe.             In total, 26 million immigrates arrived in the United States. It took the immigrants over 50 years to get to America. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America exept thatit was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.

They wanted better items and storage. They wanted America.       In the United States population increased rapidly from immagrants from all over the world. Germans, Chinese, Japanese, Russian and many more countries migrated to America, but for what.? These countries had harsh conditions and were unable to have many rights, and America had those rights.       People begin flying in from all over. Farmers increased are food suplly. More jobs were made from builders to inventors. Almost everyone had a job. America's religious freedom was another reason for immagration. Easy transportation made in easy to get to America. The gold rush was a big population increase as well. When people came to America they didn't feel like moving so they settled in America.       Russian left to escape prejudoce and persecution. Italy suffered from high birth rates and farming loss due to lower prices. They would have a better chance at life and supporting their family. Religious freedom was a big push factor as well. America had choices from freedom of speech, religious freedom, freedom of press and more.       People from all over came to America, but for what? To have freedom, rights and escape harsh conditions. The other countries pushed people away while America pulled them right in. Population, the economy, industry, and production increased massivly.

Another main idea about this story is that the second half of the 1800's was a great time of change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores and Transportation was improving. They also had created a new railroad in which made things easier so that they could travel more faster and get to their destination quicker.       Then, there is a thing called The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants. Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes. These include a harsh enviroment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Many of these push elements were made worse by a rapid increase in the number of people in Europe. On the other hand, Pulls are those features of life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth, oppurtunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.       In Conclusion, what i think the point of this passage was is that the Immigrants had to move from their homes and go to different counries and states because of their wealth and oppurtunities they had in life.

First, during the 1800s the Irish started to come to America.There were over one million irish men, women, and children.The reason why the irish came to America was because in the irishlands they did not have enough crops to feed people.More than a thousand people starved to death.There was a problem when they came to America. there was not enough food jobs or homes for them.After a while it all worked out.      Then, during the second half of the 1800s was a great time in America.During the few years some people invented the telephone, the printing press and the telegraph.some of these items were popular in America so others from different parts of the world came to America.      Next, in 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in california.The man who discovered gold was john sutter. when people herd about gold they all went to San Francisco.Then the Gold Rush began.Many people joined in the Gold Rush. Then the chinese herd about the gold so they went to San Francisco.By 1870, there were 63,000 chinese in the United States.      Finally, after 200 years of immigration many people came to America.Many people were happy when they moved to America.After the Gold Rush 77% of the chines came to America. Many people traveled to America over these 200 years.

Immigrants were needed to work in the new factories, farm,  build on land, and to invent things.Only immigrants did all of that.When the immigrants left to America they got there right on time because there was alot of technology that they can use.              Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.The Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole immigrant group in Ireland came to America.They kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in ireland crops had failed to grow, especially the potato crop, then there was a food shortage. More than one million people died of starvation.               Later in the 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. That included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All of the extra immigrants that stayed needed food, homes, and good jobs.               Other Europeans only came for religious freedom. The people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The other half just left so that they can escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.

Some didn't have enough food and were dying of starvation. Some needed work for money to get food. Some needed homes. Others came to America because there was a war at their state or country. Also some wanted freedom to invent,work, have a home, eat, drink and relax. America became a place where anyone can go for anything! Work, food, water, homes and many more.   Immigrants came to America because of food,starvation. The Irish came to    America because their crops had failed, there was a food shortage.One million people died of starvation in Ireland. Food shortages are a bad thing, lots of people die,the population decreases and the state or country can't be there anymore. They will give the land to someone else.   Immigrants had working talents they could build,farm, work in factories,and    invent. People want work so they could provide for their families and earn money for food. They wanted to avoid hunger they did that by working.The Chinese government raised taxes, farmers couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their lands. Guangdong's population decreased they couldn't provide enough food.   Everyone wants and needs homes. Without one we would be cold, wet, and dirty.    Some immigrants moved to America to get homes. From Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary needed homes. It was easier to them if they went to America, got jobs and homes. So, they sailed to America.   Immigrants came to America also because there were too many wars in their    country or state. Or they came for religious freedom, Jews were mistreated because of their beliefs. Poland, Russia, and Holland also came for religious freedom.Because so many immigrants wanted to come to America they made trains. Trains would make it easier and faster.

In 1860 the population was 31,513,000, the # of people who live in the cities were 6,216,518 and the # of people born outside the U.S was 4,096,753, the coal production in tons was 20,471,000, miles of railroad tracks were 30,626, and the # of daily newspapers were 389. Also they talk about how people moved to America and they could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship. In addition, Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. The Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop.  There was many changes in America like pushes means features of life that drive people from their homes and pull which is a feature of life that attract people. The Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. The California gold rush had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California in 1849.

These include a harsh enviroment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Many of these push elements were made to worse by a rapid increse in the number of people in Europe.

They had came to America because they were needed to work in factories, farm,build, and invent new things. And these people were immagrants.    The Irish was the largest immagrant group.They were 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children.Most irish people were down because their crops hasd failed, but mostly the patato crop.After that there was a food shortage, so more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.    In the later 1800s, more people started coming from other Eroupean countries. That included Russia,Italy, poland,denmark,Sweden,and Hungary.The population had then doubled. There was not enough homes,jobs, and food for those extra people.Then many Eroupeans had came to America to find work and avoid there hunge.Others had came to America for religous freedom.    After all of that 26 million immagrants arrived in the United states over a 50 year period.It was alot of people.But most of the new comers knew very little about America.Most people knew it was a just a land of freedom.but thats all they wanted Freedom and a chance to work.    The second half of the 1800s was a time when America changed.The transportation had impproved, industry had grew, and many immagrants arrived on Americas shores.After that The first railroad was completed in 1869.This meant it was way easyier to transport to diffrent places.A trip to one places to aniother was way easyer and shorter.

Before and during the American Cival War, one fourth of the people in Ireland came to America, which was about 1.7 million people of both genders. More and more people came and by the 1800s people from other European countries started to come. Not many people have been sent to America from Russia, Italy, Pooland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Between 1750 and 1850, the population of Europe doubled. People needed food, jobs, and homes to survive, so they came to America. Other people though, came for religious freedom. Most of them included, Holland, and Jews that came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The rest came to escape from warzones that made them suffer. In a 50 year peroid, 26 million immagrants came to the United States.   Immigrants came to the US by pushes. Pushes are features of life that drive people from their homes. They used steamboats and trains, while others used Pulls. Pulls are features of life that attract people such as jobs, wealth, opportunities, access ot resources, and freedom.   In 1848, Gold was discovered along the American River in California. The news spread and more than 70,000 people came in 1849 to search for the gold. 325 of these men were from China.

Sometimes, there are good things pulled out of it. Sometimes, you are forced. Being puled in a country is better than being pushed. Pulled is when you are making good things out of traveling where you are. Pushed, on the other hand, is when you are living in war, poverty, or even harsh environment, and you are being forced, or you have no choice but to live in America. Moving to America in 1800's was clearly hard. America's population rapidly increased when alot of countries decided to come over 60 years before the Civil War. Several reasons cover this experiment, such as freedom. Therefore, the main reason is freedom and a chance to work. However, moving to America was trouble. They came from ship after ship after ship. But immigrants would do sacrafices for living in a great place, America. There are two different choices in going to America, being pushed, or being pulled.        One choice in going to America is being pushed. For example, the Irish came to America because they had food shortage, and they were starving. Failure was in crops, such as potato crop. Many came to America to search for a job and to find more food to aviod starvation. Another example is that they came for religious freedom. These countries include Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews, for example were mistreated in Germany for their own beliefs. Other countries came for freedom and to escape wars. To sum it all up, pushes are people being driven out of their country. Main reasons are a harsh life they live in, wars, problems, and alot of other negative possibilities.        The last choice in going to America is being pulled. One example is in the 1800's. Gold in California, America was discovered, which led to the gold rush. One country that really wanted to strike for gold was China. Their government raised taxes, which meant less money for farmers, and any other person. In that time, there was also war, which meant less homes, but the government still went on. By that time, a lot of people rebelled against the government. The climate there was also bad, which did not help the farmers any better. So that is when a lot of people started hearing about the gold rush in California. They started moving to America because of the gold to make fortunes, and return to China, arrogantly with all the gold. That was an example of being pulled, because they got something good out of it. Another example is because of the advance in technology. Being pulled means that you want to go to some country to get somthing good out of it, and it is your choice to go or not.        Two different choices in immigrating to a different country are called 'pushed' and 'pulled'. These two mean two whole different things, but that is what basically causes increase of population in America in the 1800's. Being pushed means you are forced to leave to another country, and being pulled means choosing to leave to a certain country to get something good out of it. One example of being pushed is because of a harsh environment. An example of being pulled is to get gold from a certain country.

America needs immigrants to grow there crops and they need them for farming also to be workable like others so its good to have immigrants moving to other states.immigrants try to come to united states by crossing the border and by others what america likes about the immigrants is that immigrants would do united states building and growing crops.kids from the out side of the countrys were 4,096,000 of people and this was in the 1860-1910 and scince united states is still freedom kids and family have bein coming from other places and they were brought to america and it wasnt no problem to america because it was freedom to come to america.

So to fix there prouble poeple moved from Eruope to America. But extra people needed  food and homes.         Also when they moved there was not much in eroupe they didnt have freedom .And in America they had alot of freedom.Also many people left so they can get job and avoid hunger.          Later in the 1800's it started getting easier for people to travle because they had invented trains.And people loved it because they they dont have to listen to poeple that say they can not go on the train.         Also what eles started to travle easier is the news.They had invented printers and they made newspaper and paper to send to other. News travled faster.                  Also the chinese goverment raised taxes.The caused that the goverment raised the taxes poeple staerted to get in fights and they started to get introuble.Some framers were unable to pay there there taxes.So they had to sell there land.They couldnt produce enogh rice because the crops had destroyed all of them.              In Conclusion,people just wanted freedom and job and avoid hunger!

During the 1800s people who worked that could build, farm, or who can invent went to America, ship after ship. The number of people who lived in the cities in 1860 were 6,216,518 and in the time of 1910 there were 41,998,932 people. The number of people who were born out of the United States in the time of 1860 were 4,096,753 and in the time of 1910 were 13,344,545 people. Finally the number of daily newspapers were 387 in 1860 and in 1910 there were 2,600 and that is what I wrote about when people who immigrated to the United States over the last 200 years.           In 1800s the Germans made up the larges single group of immigrants. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869.        The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in Calfornia, on the property of a man named John Sutter.

Right when they arrived, new technology came out. The immigrants were in factories already. People came to America from the American Civil War. 1.7 million people came to America because of the war.        Also other people came to America because some people came for religious freedom. But a total of 26 million people came to America.   People came to America for food,homes,and jobs. That's when the population in Europe doubled. Tats why people came to America.

Some people came because it was better in many was like better environment, health, and it was features that made them realize they could like better. One of the big reasons people stared coming to America was the gold rush. It was discovered in 1848 by John Sutter. He wanted to keep it a secret but it didn't stay one. People stared coming from all over the word to find gold. That's when a lot of people started coming.         In 1860-1910 the United States grew it went from 13,513,00 to 92,407,000. That was because of all the good qualities America had. In that time every thing multiplied the numbers of daily news papers and miles on railroad trakes. There was even coal production in tons ghost multiplied the number of people born ou side or the United States and manny more things. All these people made made the United States.

Some of the reasons are that there were bad conditions in there home country, and the california gold rush. So lets get into this essay.       People like the chineese had a reason to come here to america. The chineese came because floods and wars broke out and 'pushed' them out of there country. What that means is things happen that makesd them not want to live in china.       When the population grew it was because of the good things that were happening in america. The things that were pulling them to come were the california gold rush. The california gold rush was when alot of gold showed up at sutters mill.

In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This includes Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850.People needed food, homes, and jobs. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.

These reasons included things in America that attracted people, or 'pulls', and things in home countries that people wanted to get away from, or 'pushes'. People came from all around the world including China, Germany, Poland, and Russia. More than 25 million people came to America during the 1800s.          In the 1800s, people came from all around the world to come to America. People came from countries like Italy, Poland, Russia, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and Germany. People came for different reasons. Some people, such as the Jews, came to America because they were being mistreated in their home countries for their beliefs, and they wanted religious freedom. Others came to America to find work, because work may have been hard to find in their home countries. Some people, such as the Europeans, came to America to avoid hunger. However, in the mid-1800s, most people came to California to become rich.          In 1849, gold was found on the property of John Sutter. Once people discovered that there was gold in California, they flooded to California in search for gold. People came from all around the world, but many people came from China. In 1849, only 325 Chinese men were searching for gold in California, but by 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the Golden State. Most of the people that came from China came to find gold, but a lot of people came to get away from the Chinese government. At that time, the government had raised taxes and many people were rebelling.          From 1860 to 1910, the population of the U.S. almost tripled. There were many more employees and much more product production. Coal production became 21x more efficient. Railroad tracks became 8x longer. There is no doubt that population grew during the 1800s.

In the 1800s, people came to have well payed jobs, like working in factories. In the 1860s, people came to get away from war and starvation.There are many more reasons that people moved, like failures in crops.     In 1848 John Sutter found gold, which started the gold rush. By 1849, 60 ships had came in and over thousands of people went by land. One example is the chinese who also came.      That is only part of the many reasons that imigrants came to America.

Some wanted to escape to religious freedom (Russian Jews)-others dreamed of not living in starvation any longer (Irish). Here are some very descriptive examples on why different immigrants chose to come to America.       The Irish were known to come to America to escape food shortages because of their crops-which had failed. They wanted to escape starvation and regain what they once had. There were many food shortages and that caused over 1 million people to die out of starvation.       Others, wanted to escape to religious freedom and have the right to believe in what they did. Jews who came from Germany, Holland, Russia, and Poland were mistreated because of they believed in. In America, they had the right to believe in what they believed in.       Some Chinese arrived from an area in China called, Guangdong. People who moved from there, moved because of the two wars taken place there at the time. They were 'pulled' by the fact they could become rich if they got their hands on the beautiful gold found in California's rivers.       As you can see, people from many different places were especially determined to get out of their home country for many different reasons. Some were determined to escape from starvation and others from the fact of being made fun of for their beliefs.

During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America on ship. With all the new technology, there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in new factories, to farm, and build on the land. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.       People started coming from European countries that had not sent many people to America before.This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.The population doubled between 1750 &amp; 1850.All those extra people needed homes, food, &amp; jobs, in which there were not enough of in Europe.Many Europeans came to America to find work &amp; avoid hunger.The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America.Industry grew &amp; immigrants arrived in America.   The Chinese moved to America, because of the Gold Rush.More than 70,000 adventurers arrived in California in 1849.

The technology and opportunities that have been given. It could improve your life by a lot.            The first reason is that workers could actually have work. The technology was better to invent things in America. You had a chance to work rfor your family. It was a chance to achieve and get paid.             Next, the industry in America grew. There was better transportation as well. The first railroad was built in 1969. It was now easier to move materials.              Last, a guy named John Sutter discovered gold in Califonia. The news spread quickly. Thousands of men immigrated to California to seek wealth. They thought that they could find gold.              This is why the population in America increased. There was many great opportunities. It was a place where you could achieve. To some people it was a chance to start a new life and be happy.

People have risked thier lives and left thier homes just to come to America. They came a long way from their home or country to looking for somehting to help them.       During the 1800s many immigrants came looking for wealth, and luckly because of  all the new technology there were many jobs for them. Germans ,ade the largest group of the people who came the U.S.,then the Irish.And they just kept coming before, after, and during the war.       The Irish came because they were deprate for food they counrty was having promblems with their crops.More than 1 millionn people died in Ireland of hunger.       Later more people from diffrent Eupropean countries came looking for work and food.Other people came for religios reasons people from Holland, the Jews from Germany, Poland, Russia etc. .       More that 26 million immigrants came and made America what it is today.

It lets us know about other countries and religions we would never think about! During the gold rush so many people came down to California to migrate and stay for a while. During the gold rush are population status went up. Most people came here to live and get jobs cause work was really needed here. We came up with a thing called push and pulls.

Immigrant came to America because they wanted to start a new life.  Many immigrant come to America for a better life, or their country is in war. Back in the day immigrant came to America because they were pushed out of their country.        In the 1800's many immigrants came to the U.S because of two reasons they were pushed out or kicked out.Or they came to invent new  inventions with all the high tech gear.Most came to live here to start all over again to forget about what happened in the past.A lot happens in the 1800's but let's flash forward toward the year 1869.lots of people move to the U.S because they were pushed here or attracted here.        In 1869 the first railroad was able to take you from the east to the west. It was fast enough to take you where you were to a boat in the west. That railroad took immigrants from the boarder to where ever they wanted to go.The immigrants that came to the U.S came because they experienced difficult punishments. Others came in very harsh conditions to start over.        In 1848 John Shutter found gold that when the word got out  it attracted many immigrants.His secret got out and when it did the Chinese came to get it. The Chinese came because they thought that they would find good fortian. They also came to get away from the war that distorted their crops.That is why immigrants came to America to forget the past or to star over.

They worked really hard not to mess up.At night they would try to escape and go to the free land but if they got caught they got killed if they didn't get killed then they got severly beaten with the whip.Thats why they ran away at night to America.They had to make sure the houses they stopped by were okay with them there or else they would take them back the next morning.      If the poeple wre okay with them there they would let them stay.Sometimes they even give them rides but they had to stay away from the plantations wre they came from or else they would check your buggie.Then if they caught you in your buggie you were deafeanitly dead.

This also happened because of bad crops and high birth rates in other countries. America also had freedom which a lot of immagrints wanted because they were under dictatorship. America also had lots of jobs and work imaagrints could do for mininum wadge.That is why  many immagrints moved to America during the 1800's.

(1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children came to America)   The population of America was growing very fast.       In 1848 a man named John Sutter discovered gold in California. Lots of people came to find gold and become rich.  Some of these people who came included the Chinese.

The only problem was that they didn`t` have the technology we have today. The technology they made is what made ours so complex.       The steam locomotive made the ideas of freight trains and subways and amtrack. These aren`t steam powered any more. These trains we have today are deisel powered.

America was the best option because the many pull factors. A pull factor is a characteristic that appeals to people such as jobs ,freedom ,or resources.Most came for jobs and wealth ,and after 1848 gold was discovered in California which is another pull factor. There are many different pull factors.       Push factors are the opposite of pull factors. Instead of pulling people in they push people out. Some push factors are hunger or poverty.In the 1800s the Irish were driven out of Ireland because the crops would not grow we call this event the Great Hunger. There are many factors that can push or pull people to/from a country.

There was a lot of technology in the 1800's the was a lot of things for workers to do. Irish crops failed like the potato crop and there was food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800s people started coming from other countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, and Hungary.

Well some people came just to find a better place to live and to be able to find work or just to find gold. The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigarants arrived on America's shores. In the 1800s, there was also rapid,important changes in how quickly and widely information traveled. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. This made news and ideas available to more people. The invention of the telegraph in 1884 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster. 	DT IN NNP . . .

For example, some people came for wealth and rich soil to plant crops in. There are many other reasons too.         Let's start at the beginning when everybody wanted to come to America. In the 1800s, anyone who was a skilled farmer, builder, and inventor came here ship after ship. There was so much new technology in the 1800s that there was so much to do. Like farming, building, and inventing new things for the future. Although some people came for different reasons. Some people didn't have a choice because Europe had so many people there wasn't any jobs or food for them. It was either starvation or come to America. After a while people made the railroad and they traveled across the U.S. because some people had found gold in California. that motivated even more people to come to America. People also came from so many places such as Russia, Germany, Holland, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland, and so many more.

Another reason was because of the lack of food.  Ireland's crops were failing, and many people died of starvation.  One last reason was because of religious freedom.  Jews came from Germany, Poland, and Russia to escape prosecution.  A total of 26 million immigrants came to America.   The other part of the 1800s was a time of improvement.  More railroads were built, which made traveling easier.  Steam power and a better printing press was invented. The telegraph and the telephone were invented.  Also, European immigrants came to America to escape the harsh conditions.   During the gold rush, many Chinese came to California.  In 1848, gold was discovered on the property of John Sutter.  He tried to keep it a secret, but news soon spread.  70,000 gold miners came to California to seek their fortune. The news spread to China, and eventually 63,000 Chinese gold seekers had settled in America.

There were many hardships in their home country, so the people came to America in search of freedom. These people were from Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Russia. They were also from Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and China. People came to escape wars, poverty, and prejudice. They also came for wealth and the benefits of living in America.                  Jews from Russia, Germany and Poland came to America in the 1800s. All of them came for religious freedom. In their home countries, Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs. They left to escape prejudice and prosecution. Jews didn't know much about America, but still came. Their home country had pogroms, or organized violent attacks to get rid of the Jews. All they wanted was to make a new life for themselves and their family in the United States.                      There were many benefits in moving to America in the 1800s. One of the benefits was the industry growth. In 1869, the first railroad was completed. This made it easier to carry goods like lumber and silver. People also traveled on the trains, because the trip was easier and shorter. Information traveled faster due to the new printing press. People were able to print newspapers and inexpensive books. In 1844 the telegraph was invented, and in 1876, the telephone was invented. News and ideas were available to more people.                                                                                          Pushes and pulls were what made the immigrants want to move. The features that attracted people were the pulls. Some pulls were wealth, jobs, and opportunities.Other pulls were access to resources and perceived freedom. The features that drove people away from their homes were pushes. Some pushes included harsh environments and wars. There were also, other conflicts poverty. Due to the rapid increase in the number of people in Europe, the pushes were made worse.                               There were 4,096,753 immigrants in America, in 1860. In 1910, there were 13,344,545 immigrants in America. All the immigrants came from different countries. They all left for different reasons. What they did have in common though, was that they were strong-willed people. They wanted to have a good life for their family and themselves, without judgement in what they believed in.

With all of the new technology being invented, there was plenty of things that immigrants could do if they came here for work, wich a lot of immigrants did. They could work in factories and so on.   People also immigrated for food. 1.7 million irish men,women, and children came to the U.S. in need for food because the crops were dying and there was a major food shortage. Others immigrated for religious reasons. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution.            Many of the new Europeans immigrated because they wanted to escape the harsh living conditions that they had to suffer through in their home country.            In 1848, there were a rapidly increasing number of peopl in the United States, becase shortly, many people from all over the world found out about the gold in California. That was the beginning of the California Gold Rush. Thorsands of people came in order to find gold and wealth. By 1870, 63,000 Chinese people were in the U.S. looking for gold. Even though others were just in the Unites States to live there 77% of them were in California.            Over the years mabny people ahve immigrated to the U.S. in order to do many things. Some of them even immigrate to this day. Who knows what America has in store for new immigrants.

They struggled through the difficult sea, leaving there family and sometimes dieing to get to America. The trouble was unbearable before they came to America too. They had diessees, plagues and major sicknesses and sometimes war. I'm proud of the immigrants because anyone here could be apart of a immigrant family. I bet if immigrants didn't come half America's population would decrease.           Immigrants came to America for various reasons. Most immigrants came for gold, money, and work. The work in the 1800's wasn't that good in Italy. The people came here so they could get out of harms way. I mean yes America came be harmful but still it was best for them to leave the their country. In there eyes.              In the 1860's - 1910's the American population increased majorly. The number of daily papers almost doubled. The American population almost tripled. The immigrants were mostly happy when they got to America. Some were sad because they lost their families. The immigrants weren't always hoping to go to America.             When the immigrants were born they weren't called immigrants. They were regular people. The country they were in depended on what type of immigrant you were like if you were from Germany you would be called a German Immigrant. If you were from Italy you would be called a Italian immigrant. The immigrants were very curious coming to America. They wanted to know what was what. Some stuff they knew. Some not really, but the immigrants learned.

In their countries they might've been mistreated by the way they looked, thought, or what they believed in. As a result, they moved to free land in Oregon.       Further into the 1800's, great change happened. More immigrants arrived to America and the transportation improved. They built their first railroad track in 1869 that crossed the United States wich also helped people who caried resources get to another place quicker.       In 1848 they discovered gold. Soon after the secret broke out, thousand of people had come to be apart of the gold rush. In the following year, even more people showed up. Including those people were the Chinese men. After the gold rush had settled down, people could then farm and relax.

Well this article is all anbout how it was back in the 1800s when the immagrants came to America [this was around the gold rush time].               Well back in the 1800s the Chinesse came to America as immagrants beacuse of their food loss and no more places to plant food. So they came over here to America to start planting food because we have more places to plant here. They also came because we just had started the gold rush so everybody wanted to come over here.                During the gold rush everybody wanted to come over here to America. This shows that America is a huge part of history.                	NNP PRP RB VBN WP PRP VBD IN TO VB DT JJ .

There was many on the boats to come to America from Britan but only half of the people survived.Disese really hit our men and women. But the people who survied fought on for there lives and in the long run it paid off we now have our own freedom and a lot of history that our teachers can teach us because of the pilgrams.        Most people moved to America to seek beter lives because in Britan they had a king and they didn't want to have to listen to him they were ready to be free.The king made them pay outragous taxes and and made them do free labor so they moved to america.

MOst would even die trying to get to America for there feedom.                    Most immergrants moved to America because they needed food, homes, and jobes.     Others came for religious freedom. Immergrants that moved to America did not know that much about America they just wanted to be free. And to get better jobs, also to give there kids better   education.Most of the immergrants old homes were poor.       Also we were comeing up with more technology to make peoples lives more easyer.Transportation at that time in America was better than walking.In the 1800s there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled.Some countrys were under pverty and war   wich made them want to move to America.       the next big thing was the gold rush in the American River, in California.

Many came for better life and others came because they needed new homes. If you could farm, build, or invent that means you probe came to America.                The Germans made up the largest group of immigrants that came to the U.S. another large group was the Irish one forth of Ireland came to the U.S. [1.7 million Irish men, women, and children came.] The reason four the Irish to come to America is because of the huge shorten in crop like the potato plant that made up the most of  Irish crops.            After all the people in Ireland came other close  country's in Europe immigrated to the U.S. People in Italy, Poland , Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungery are all examples of places that had people that moved to America for a better life.            In all the total number of people that came from other country's over the 50 years was about 26 million people altogether now the U.S. has all those languages and cultuers the imigerents brought with them.

They came here to find jobs, relgious freedom, wealth in mining, peace, and freedom of marrige.       They got here by sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. The first person to sail here was Christopher Columbus in 1492. Another one of the first explorers was Waun Ponce Delion of Spain. In the early 1800's, many of the immigrants were Germans, Russians, Italians, Polish, and Hungaians.

Whether they wanted jobs or wanted freedom. Everyone came for their own reason. They were all suffering and just waiting to get out of that jail cell they called home. Luckily, they found America. The place that answered all of their problems. 'Why did they come?' you might ask. Here's why.             There are many different reasons. One of them is: oppurtunities. People were attracted to having oppurtunites. Their own homes didn't have as much oppurtunites as America. America was their hero.            Another reason why people came to America is because they needed jobs. The Irish were desperate for jobs because their crops had failed. They needed to support their family, but how? The answer was simple: America.  How would they get what they needed without jobs? They came to the U.S. for jobs.            In addition, people came to America because they needed food. Without a job, how could they pay for food? In Ireland, more than 1 million people died of starvation. Can imagine that? Having no food is terrible. That's why they came to America.            Furthermore, they came beacuse they wanted freedom. Russian Jews left because of harsh conditions. They hade to escape prejudice and persecution. People discriminated them because of their beliefs. What would they do? Where would they go? They went to America. In America they could wander around without being discriminated. That is why they came.            Lastly, people came because they wanted wealth. People from around the world heard about California and its gold in 1849. They wanted to find gold and become rich. Chinese migrants from Guangdong who couldn't pay for their homes came to America in search for gold. California became known as 'The Golden State.'            In conclusion, many people came for many diffrerent reasons. For wealth, food, jobs, and oppurtunities. They were all thankful for America, for America had given them so much.

People kept coming on ships after ship after ship they all came in time. In 1800s with all the new technology there was a lot to do back then. The people were needed to make new factories to build on the empty land. They needed to invent things and all the immigrants did that. Germans made groups of immigrants in the 1800s it was the largest single group there.            There was also large Irish immigrant groups they all wanted to help. Right before the American civil war in the 1860s,one-fourth of the whole population of Irish people came to the u.s. The Irish people were very desperate because their crops had failed.They were  very desperate when they found out that their potato crops had failed.                More than 1 million people died of starvation Ireland. Later in the, 1800s people came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All the left over people needed homes, jobs, and food. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.                Others came for freedom these included people from Holland, Jews who came from Germany.People just came to avoid the wars and escape them.  In total of all the people 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. Thats why they wanted freedom and a chance at work. Jews were also mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.            Transportation improved the first railroad was made it crossed the U.S. The railroad was first finished in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber. They could move these items from West to East. People traveled for trips from one place to another and it became shorter.

One of them is because people in ireland were having a rough time and were having a famin with pohtatos and other crops. They heard that america was wonderful there are set sail. Another reason is because people wanted to see all of americas wonders and mystrious. Lastly, because people were looking for jobs despertly. That is why people from Europe moved to America.

One reason why people immigrated is because people were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Another reason is because their transportation had improved and they wanted to go out and explore the world withoit having to pay to much money. The last reason is because gold was discovered! The gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.         Imagrants weren't very rich back in the day. So, when they heard that there was a brand new transportation and it wasen't very expensive they jumped on the oppurtunity. Other people just needed to get a new job to make money and to use that money to take care of their family. Chinese people moved to California for the gold that they have found on John Sutter's property.  The population did increase because of all of these events. The number if people in the U.S. in 1860 was 31,513,000 between 1860 and 1910 the population increased to 92,407,000! the biggest increase was in coal production (in tons), it went from 20,471,000 to 417,111,000!

During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship. In the new technology, there was plenty for then to do. Germans were the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. One fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America (that was 1.7 million Irish people). Later people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom.             The second half of  the 1800s was a time of great change. Industries grew and transportation improved. Once the first rail road was completed, it was easier to move resources and people's trips became shorter and easier. The invention of the telegram and telephone only made news travel even faster. The reasons are characterized as 'pushes' and 'pulls'. Pulls are those features that attract people. They include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom. Pushes are those features in life that drive people from their homes. They include harsh environment, wars, conflicts, and poverty.               Lots of Chinese people moved to California because of the gold rush in 1849. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849. Among these 'Forty-Niners' were 325 men from China. More Chinese came next year, and the next. They hoped to find a fortune waiting for them. The first wave of Chinese came from Guangdong, an area in China's south coast. The Chinese called California Gam Saan or 'Gold Mountain.' By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States.               As you can see, there were many things that contributed to the growth in population of the U.S. These included, the pushes, the gold rush, the improvement in transportation, and the new technology. This was a significant time period in history because of the huge increase in the population of the United States.

In this article i will tell you some of the things that I learned.        People left their home town because sometimes there were conflicts. Some of these conflicts mgith include starvation, no work, or maybe even war. These people moved to America in hope for a better life. In hopes of jobs, food, and freedom.   People also left in hopes of riches. Things like The California Gold rush gave them hopes of becoming wealthy.   In conclusion I ahve given you some of the reasons people moved to America.

Some people came for religious freedom, some came to escape war, and there are many other reasons why.        Working people who could farm, build, or invent came to America ship after ship, looking for jobs.  Wit hall the new technology, there were many things they could do.  In the later1800's, other European countries sent many people who needed food, homes and jobs.  Some people came for religious freedom to stop being mistreated for their religions. Many people came because they were driven away by harsh enviroment, wars, and other conflicts.  Many Chineese people came to California during the Gold Rush in a hope to get rich.  In 1849, 325 Chineese men joined the Gold Rush, and in 1851, 2,716 Chineese men joined, and by 1870, there were 63,000 Chineese in the United States.  By 1910, there were 92,407,000 people in America and 13,334,545 of them were born outside of the United States.

The largest amount of immigrants were the Germans.Next to them were the Irish.   Before the American Civil war one-forth of the population of Ireland came to America.That was 1.7 million Irish men women and children! And more were yet coming during, and once the war had ended! The reason the Irish people were coming was because their homeland was having a food shortage. More than 1 million people from Ireland died of starvation.                                          Technology advances           The second half of the 1800s was full of change in America. The first railroad   that crossed the United Sates was finished in 1869. This made transportation much easier and faster. And it made transporting resources easier.           The steamboat was made making it a lot easier  and faster to travel on water.   The earlier way to travel would have taken months but with the new steam ships travel was a lot faster.       Some of the other technology advances include...           The telegraph The telephone Steam power Redesign of the print press       These were some of the things that attracted immigrants.

Other people suffered high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. People had hoped they could have a new and better life when they moved to America.                  When the first railroad was complete it made easier trips, which aloud immigrants to go to America. When they arrived at America immigrants they were given freedom and a chance to work for a living. They were also looking forward to religious freedom.       When people first came to America they were happy. They were free as long as they worked they were ok. Alot changed during that time for many people. During the gold rush many other people like the chinese. The Gold Rush was a big thing and that is another reason why many people moved over to America.

The decisions people had to make to move to America was very hard because you don't really know what the land is like. If you go you leave every thing as you know it and you travel across the sea to get a piece of junk land or what you have heard about (lush farm land that is bound to make you rich).  Most of the immigrant's in the 1800's were German's and Irisians (Irish) they came by the ship load to America.  1/4 of the population of America was the Irish. The Irish had 1.7 million male and female come to America.                    The more people came to America the less food they get so after more and more people came to America the more food shortage there was so people died of starvation.  Land was becoming scarce because of the many people that took land whrn they had the choice.

There are many reasons for why many people had moved to America. It can be a problem, company failure, not enough jobs , slavery , or it can be anything to urge humans to come to the U.S.  Maybe they want to go there because there were many unique things here in America, or we have more jobs than the other countries in the world.                                                                      Immigrants came here for benefits in America, especially the mistreated and the unlucky. Germans made up most of the population of the immigrants who moved to America for freedom. Hundreds of Jews ran away for freedom from the Nazis. In Guangzhou of China, the government raised the taxes, making farmers unable to pay taxes. Crops in Ireland were failing, and millions of people had died from hunger in Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                      News had broke out everywhere in the world about the gold rush in California.  In Guangzhou, the Chinese were trapped in taxes. Farmers cannot produce rice to feed people.The population was growing , and many people feel hopeless.The Chinese heard rumors about the gold rush in California, and wished they can go there. Later on, their wish had been granted. Now they can go to California!  The Chinese quickly populated California, doubling each time they come.  Meanwhile in  America, technology had increased. The invention of the telegraph and the telephone had news travel fast. Newspaper companies had increased.  The population in America had tripled during the 1800s.                                                      	IN DT CD , JJ NNS VBD VBN TO NNP NNP NNP .

Many immigrants came to America for religious freedom, or simply because they wanted a second chance, or an opportunity for work. for work they had. The mid 1800s were also a time of explosive industrial growth. The inventions of trains and steamboats improved transportation to and within the US. Steam power and more modern factories made more jobs and, well, more reasons to come to America. During the California Gold Rush, many Chinese also came to America hoping to find their fortunes, but most did not and were put to work building railroads. In conclusion, many people came to America for a variety of reasons during the 1800s and helped our growth during an age where progress was rapid and the world was changing.

They were provided with many things such as open land and places to get resources. The first people that came were mostly from European countries.        In the 1960's Ireland was in really bad condition because of war, which made over one-fourth of their population travel to the United States during and after the war in need of land, freedom, and jobs. Crops had also failed in Ireland, especially the potato.         Before these hard times, in 1848 gold was found in California, which was a big reason people came to the US a hundred years later. The main people that came for this reason were the chineese. They came for gold, but while they were getting gold some helped build a railroad across the United States from the West coast to the East coast. This helped the people transport goods such as food and lumber.          By the end of this time people all had reasons to leave their countries and had better reasons to come to the US. There was a total amount of over 26 million immigrants that came to the United States over a time span of 50 years!

During the 1800s, working people who could build, farms or invent came to America in ship after ship. With all new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrants group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one- fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.in total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S over a 50 year period. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that in was a land of freedom. That's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. The second  article is about Changes in America: The 'pushes' and 'Pulls' for immiratnts. The tird article is about a book about Chinese immigrants. Lastly the last article is about Burau of the Census.

There are many reasons why people came to America.The Irish people came because their crops, mainly the potato crop. The Chinese came because they were at war with Britain and other Chinese people Many other Europeans came because they were looking for jobs and freedom.         There are many other ways but those are some of the most common ways people came.

During the 1800s, working people could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship. And just in time! With all the new technology in the 1800s there were plenty for them o do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and to build  on the land, and to invent. Immigrants did all that.      The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops failed to grow, especially the potato crop. There was a food stoage though more than 1 million people died of starvation. People wanted freedom and a chance to work. That's why so many people came to America for a better life.

With that, many immagrants started migrating from their foreign countries to our America. Population increased and so did technology. Trains were built and so were rails. The number of railroad tracks had rocketed to 240,293 sice 1860.         Industrial growth boomed!                             	IN CC VBG RB PRP VBP . WRB NNS PRP VBP .

Stuff that happened with Americans, Europeans, and even Chinese people. Here are some things that happened.     Moving To America,   During the 1800s, working people could build, farm,and invent came to America. The new technology that was produced in the 1800s there was plenty more for them too now. they were need to manage factories or build things. the immigrants came in handy for that. Germans were the largest group single to immigrate to America. Before, the American civil war in the 1860s a fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. All the people that came caused a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Now, in the later 1800s people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included many countries like Russia, Italy, and Poland. Lots of the Northern European countries.  The population doubled between 1750 and 1850. Many of the Europeans came to America to find work that would help them avoid hunger.  many others came for religious freedom this included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total some 26 million immidrants arrived in the united states over a 50 year period.     Changes in America; pushes and pulls   The second part of the 1800s was a great change in america. Industry grew and many more people arrrived.

There are many reasons why people from other countries wanted to come to America. Other countries are not like America. They don't have amazing oppurtunities and technology like we do here. Countries like Mexico do not have much food like America. They do not have amazing oppurtunity like getting a house. People in other countries do not have as nice as people as in America. Other countries like Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador do not have air conditioning in all houses like in the U.S. There are also better transportation opurtunities. Although there are more better life expieriences in America, now in 2013 the technology and other stuff have been passed down to less fortunate countries.

Alot of the chinese came to the Gold Rush because it was their only hope.Then they got pulled away to build the railroad track.the railroad track was used to get silver lumber and shipments.This made it easier to get stuff.

In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. That would be an event I would draw a picture on, or about many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. I think these are very importanat to me because its talking about history, and what happened, the pass was very important because people move, and came to, or from America.

So with more people and less food, people went hungry. Many people were out if jobs because of more people. The loss of jobs caused poverty, and taxes went up. When they came to America, though, there was plenty of work. The word got around, and people started pouring in.      People also moved to escape wars. They caused an unsafe and unpredictable lifestyle and home. Others came for freedom. Whether it was religious or not it still promised a happy and free life for many.        Some immigrants came to America to find opportunities and wealth, such as gold. The promise of riches was to great an opportunity to pass by.                                                  When transportation improved, it just made traveling easier. It was easier, faster, and cheaper to travel by steamship. Which meant more immigrants. The printing press made printing newspapers and books cheaper. The invention of the telegraph and telephone made news travel that much faster. And people come in that much faster. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There were plenty more jobs now.                       Without immigrants, America wouldn't be the melting pot, with all the different cultures, races, and heritages, is is today without them.

They had a lot of technology a the time. And at the time many immagrants came to settle down to live her.              Germans made the largest amount of immagrants at the time. Before the Cival war the Irish made up more than 1/4 of the population. The Irish had a bad time becuase of the crops they flooded and were ruined.Many Irish people died from starvation.               The Americas learned a lot of technology, the trasportiation growed and the first rail road was built. This train let people travel across the country.             In 1848 gold was disvovered and the gord rush begane China heard of this gorl rush and sent sttlers to go get some gold for wealth, be 1849 70,000 adventeres went ot go get gold. In 1870 77% of the chinies who came to America were in Califoria.

The people who came to America are people from Germany, Ireland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and Holland.         People from Germany came because of the war.  People from Ireland came because their crops failed and they were starving.  People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary needed food, homes, and jobs, so they came to America.  Other people came for religious freedom and this included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.         Some other reasons people came to America was because of the gold rush.  In 1848, gold was discovered and was very valuable.  In 1849, Chinese people came to America in search of gold.  They also came to America to flee from conflicts, poverty, taxes, and food starvation.          Later on, when many immigrants came to America, industry grew.  For example, the first railroad was built.  Another improvement was transportation got easier and easier.  Books and inventions were also made too.           In conclusion, many people from different countries came to America.  Because of them, now we have new inventions, books, and other items.

The largest single group was the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. the the later 1800s people from other European countries came to America, which were the Russians, Italians, Poland ,Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. the population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. many others came from religious freedom. in total the number of immigrants that came to the United States of America grew a lot. 26 million more came to America with in a 50 year long period.       About 50 years later Gold was discovered along the America river in California, on the property name john Sutter, although Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret. At the time of 1849, January, 60   ships adm thousands of tracvelers came to California to get gold, and then... the gold rush began.       Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area one China's south coast. they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. Guangdong was involved with two wars with Britain. then the gold rush was heard around in China, and more Chinese immigrants came to America. the amount of Chinese population in America has grown a lot.       Anyways, the people from all over the world has come to America in the last 200 years because for the freedom and thew rights that Americans can own. Also they came because of the history of the United States of America!

Some people were getting mistreated because the were a Jew. Other people came to America because of harsh environment, wars, or other conflicts. Those are called pushes. Pulls are things that attract people like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also came to America.            In 1848 gold was discovered in the American River in California. The news soon reached San Fransisco. In 1849 more than 70,000 people came to California. There were also 325 men from China. More Chinese came the next year, and the next. The next year there were 450 more people from China. The next thing we knew there were 63,000 people from china in America. 77% of them were found in California.       There were 31,513,000 people in the U.S. in 1860, but there were 92,407,000 people in the U.S. in 1910. 6,216,518 people that lived in cities in 1860, and in 1910 there were 41,998,932. That is the differences from 1860 to 1910 in number of people in the U.S. and number of people who lived in cities.

Like cell phones,computers,Tv's (television),video games and so many more.         Okey so what I read and got information out of was article one is that Germans immigrated here, because they probably didn't like there home place for many different reasons. Some also moved because of the civil war that was about to begin. Some of people from Ireland moved because there crops failed even there potato crops and sense there crops failed they didn't have noting to eat or hey children so they moved here.         What I have read and got information about in article two is that many other people from many other places kept on coming and so the word got around by news paper and telegrams. One of the good things that happened in this time was that books were invented. So most of the good book writes started writing and were famous from that time.         Okey so article three we have learned about in reading and I really like it and it is about the Californian gold rush. One of the big events that happened there was that like I don't know half of china moved  to California. And some of this reasons is because of the gold or because they didn't like China at all but I think mostly because of freedom.

The 3 main reasons the 1800's was the start of major population and industrial growth in America is because people needed to move out of crowded countries escape hunger, gain religious freedom, and to have a chance to get rich.           One reason people move into America was because the countries they were living in were too crowded. The European population had doubled between 1750 and 1850. Europe couldn't handle all the people the had back then. They couldn't proved enough food or jobs for everyone. So, many of them moved to America.          Another reason people moved to America was to gain religious freedom. These people were often some German, Polands, and Russians Jews because they were mistreated in what they believed in by there home country. Russian Jews left to America to escape the risk of pogrom(organized violent attacks).          The last main reason people moved to America was to 'strike it rich'. In 1849, news about the California Gold Rush spread to China. About 325 Chinese men came to mine for gold. Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong to flee from conficts between China and Britian. At the time, Guangdong was getting too much people and not enough rice, so they moved. Most of them got gold and returned to China.          In conculsion, the 1800's was a time of major population and industrial growth in America. People came to escape crowded countries and hunger, while others came to gain religious freedom. But in the end, The 1800's was a time of change in America.

Well one reason that people moved in 1800s to America was because they went to work. The immigrants worked hard.With all the new technologies in the 1800s there were plenty of work for the people to do. Some people worked in farms, new factories, and other people worked to invent more other things.The people did all that. American excepted that it was a land of freedom but that's what they wanted. People wanted freedom and a chance to work in America. The people had a chance to work with the new technology. People had to work so they could have money and food to eat. People from Europe came to America to work too. Many people from other places went to work to America. The population from America increased a lot because people started to come to America.                                   The second reason that people moved to America in the 1800s was because people wanted freedom and of the new technology. So people started to move to America because of the new technology America had. People could travel faster to America. The advance transportation made more people move to America and for people to travel was easier. The reason people moved often ccharacterized as pushes and pulls.The thing in the 1800s at America were going good and people did not like to suffer so they went to America.                                The third reason that people moved to America was because of the exciting news about the Gold Mountain. The news spread throughout China and other places. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. So some people moved to America because about the gold rush. Three hundred twenty-five people joined the gold rush. The America population was increasing more and more. Then more people were joining in the gold rush. The Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. Everyone wanted to join.                                In the 1800s America was so popular and had a lot of population. People just kept going to America. I think that in the 1800s America was the place that had more population. In America people had a lot of things to do like work. First people traveled with ships. Then they traveled in trains and maybe in cars. America was a place of freedom.                                As you can see, I wrote about why did people move to America. My three reasons are that because they went to work, they had freedom, had new technology, and the gold rush. In the 1800s there were plenty of population. I hope know you understand why did people move to America.                                      	VBG IN CD TO NNP NNP VBP PRP VB IN NNS VBD TO NNP .

If you do, then this article will answer your question.               According to the article of 'moving to America', one reason is that they came because they wanted to avoid hunger. The Irish were desperate because there crops had failed especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.Int the 1800 people started coming to America people form Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food,homes,and jobs, and there just didn't seem to be enough for them in Europe.              In the article 'Gold Rush! Chinese move to California' it says people also came to America because they wanted to find gold. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. John Sutter tried to keep it a secret but the word spread and soon reached San Francisco,  and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. The news spread to the rest of the United States, and to the other parts of the world as well. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed to California. The California Gold rush had begun.            In ' Changes in America : The pushes and pulls for immigrants'it says people came to America to escape harsh conditions. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form pogroms, organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices  the tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless.Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life foe themselves and there family in the United States.             Those are some reasons why people came to America. I told you that people came to avoid hunger, that People came to look for gold, and that they came to escape harsh conditions. 	WRB NNS VBD TO NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WRB NNS VBD TO NNP .

Germans made the largest group of immagrents in the 1800s.In the later 1800s people came from European countries that had not been to America before. Countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Swedan, and Hungary. All those people came to America and most of their familys still live here today.Most of the Europeans came to America to avoid the hunger problems and the people dieng over there from starvation.Alot others came for religious reasons and to get away from  their religion and to break through it, people from Holland, and the Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russa.A sad thing was that Jews were often mistreated because of their beliefs in their home countries.

When the gold rush came immagrants moved from China to California just to get gold. They was not that much news in California. In America there was only 387 newspapers that came. Every day they would only get 1 newspaper a day.        The first part of change in America was a little good. They each had to work in new factories to farm and bulid. More than one million people died over stavation. A lot of people came to America to avoid hunger. 36 million immigrants arrvied in the United States over a 60 year period. They all wanted to have freedom but only a little know about it.     	NNP PRP RB VBD IN WP DT JJ VBZ .

People who have moved to america have seeked jobs.These jobs would make them wealthy.   People who where wealthy had good lives.People seeked jobs because of unenployement at other countries.People seeked jobs at america all around the world.        People wanted to live in america because people who lived in bad lands would suffer and die of starvation.People moved to america because we had good land and crops.People also moved to america because of the gold mine we had.People had a chance at striking gold.

The u.s. was a good place to settle because back then people wanted flat areas for agricultural purposes and to bulid farms and bulidings. Also transportation, for example travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat or even a plane. A trip to america in the 1800s times it would have taken months but the newly bulit and advanced steam boat made the trip alot faster. These modifications made it easy to travel.    The one modification that spread news was the telephone.   These are hoe peole got news and why they moved to the u.s.

These people came because of hardships in their country, opportunities in America, and of Americas modern technology. The United States is a country that many people immigrated to and this is why.         Many people immigrated to the United States because of hardships. For example, Russian Jews came from Russia to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of violent attacks. These people came to America to be safe from harm. In addition, Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates, since the traditions was to give land to their first born son, it left many peoples children landless. These people came to America for their children to have a better life. Also, many Europeans came to America to escape conflict and poverty brought on by over crowding. These people came to America to have a better life for themselves and their children. This is the many hardships immigrants faced before they came to America.          In addition to hardships, many people came to America because of opportunities. To show this, people came to America for jobs. Many Europeans came to America to find work, since over crowding in Europe lead to job 'shortages'. Furthermore, people came to America to avoid hunger. A food shortage in Ireland killed 1 million people from starvation. People used that as a wake up call to move to a better place with more food. Finally, people saw  an opportunity in resources. People packed up their belongings and came to America for more resources for them and their families. A great number of people immigrated to America because of opportunities.         Finally, people immigrated to America because of the new technology in America. For example, from 1860 to 1910 over 200,000 miles of railroad tracks were layed across America which meant for easy travel . In addition to railroad tracks, Over 2,200 newspaper were delivered daily from 1860 to 1910. People found that new technology and the printing press made it easier to get news in America. Lastly, people came to America because of the new technology in factories. Jobs were needed in these factories and immigrants were ready to work. People came to America to get their hands on this new technology.         In conclusion, many immigrants came to the United States between 1860 and 1910. The hardships in their own countries 'pushed' them here, the opportunities and new technology 'pulled' immigrants to come live in America. America was a very promising country to the people between 1860 and 1910.

During those times it was hard to travel not in America! we had thousands of miles of rails and steam enjenes witch brought people to and back across the united states.which also sped up coal production and made more jobs for the immigrants. then we had the Chinese come to California to get wealthy and come back to china proudly.These are all the things that made America a magnet for immigrants.

Those people are called immigrants. They moved away from their homes and most of them went to California. Germans were the largest group that came here. They came to America in the 1800s. The other large group was from Ireland.They both came here because there was a lot of war going on. People were starving and they thought they had a better chance here. Other people from Europe, Russia, Denmark, and China moved to America because of the same reason.                                                                                        I think that they all came here, because they heard that they could have freedom and liberty. In the passage it said that most Chinese people heard that they can get freedom and which ever religion they want.                                                                                      They could have also come because their crops weren't growing, so to get more food for their family, they moved to the free country, America. It could have also been because of the gold rush. Since many people were coming, they had to make transportation easier. So they built a railroad track to help them. That is why people fom all over the world came to California in America.

They coul farm, build or invent Alot was going on during the time like the gold rush, and migration. Lots of people migrated to america from many different places for free living. this also had some problems along the way.   Like the scarcity of crops and people dieing of starvation.   But it also had its good things to like the improvement of tranceportation.

Green card don't mean anything it just has your name,age,height,weight,eye color,hair color, and a bunch of others thing it especially asks for your rase.           The government doesn't have to know everything about you.Thats just wrong.An they should mind their own buissness cause what people do in their life should only matter to them not to anyone else.So what ever happens in people's lifes shouldnt matter to anyone else.           The government should mind their own buissness because nobody asks what happens in there life in whatever their in.So thats my opinion on immigration.So that's all I got to say about immigration.Immigration is about rase and raseism.           One more thing I got to say about immigration is that it they only care about is what rase you are because they don't Hispanics,Asians,and other kinds of rase in their state cause they might smuggle illigal items in their state and they don't want that to happen.

In my opion traviling would be very hard because,if you tried to travle you would proibly have to travil by a hourse or buy a boat mabe even walking but in our time we have cars and airplains motercycles. basicly we have newer tecnology.                   In the later 1800s, people started coming from other eurpean countries that had not sent many people to america before. this included russia, italy, poland, denmark, sweden, and hungary. the population of europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. all those extra people needed food, homes and jobs- and there just didnt seem to be enough of them in europe. many europeans came to america to find work and to avoid hunger.                     Others came for religions freedom. these included people from germony poland and russia. jews were often misteated for there beliefs in there home countries. still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. we should be able to believe in the things that we want to believe in and not be hurt because of it . and we should not have to leave a country because of a war.                      In total some 26 million immigrants arrived in the united states over a 50 year period. think about that- 26 million. most of the newcomers knew very litte about america except that it was a land of freedom. but thats what they wanted; freedom and a chance.

I have and I think the immigrants are hard working people that come for a better life.  Immigrants are also a very important part of history.              The Irish were some of these immigrants too.  The Irish came to America before the Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America.  The Irish kept on coming to America during and after the war because their crops had failed.  Many of the Irish died of starvation.that is what happened to the Irish.               People from Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary started coming to America for a better life.  Many people needed homes, foods, and jobs to live but Europe could not offer those things.  Some even came so they can have food and a home to live in and so they wont die of hunger.  Others came to America to for thier religious freedom.  That included the Jews, from Holland and many other countries.  For example Germany, Poland, and Russia.  There were about 26 million immigrants that immigrated because of the conditions in thier land.               Many were driven from their land because of the harsh conditions or conflicts, and poverty.  this was called 'pushes'.  Some were even attracted to the things said in their land about gold and riches.  These are called 'pulls'.  Because of these pushes and pulls many were driven from their land.               The Chinese were also immigrants in America.  They came to America in search of gold.  That all began when they heard that a man named John Sutter had found gold in his property.  Sutter tried to keep it a seceret but word came out.  By January of 1849, 60 ships were traveling to California to mine for gold.  There were about 325 men from China that came to hit 'yurika'.                  These were some of the immigrants that came to America for a better life.

They could work in factories, on farms, and invent things. The largest two groups of immigrants was Germans and Irish. Irish came because of crop failures in Ireland. Europeans started coming because needs of jobs, food, and homes. Europe didn't have enough of that over there. But many came for work and food. More came for religious freedom. In Germany, Poland, Russia, and Hollands Jews came. There Jews were punished for their thoughts. Over 50 years a total of 26 million immigrants came.           1800s second half American had a great change. Many immigrants arrived because of the growth in industry. Transportation also got better. 1869 the first railroad was completed that crossed the United States. That made it easier to move lumber and silver from West to East. Boats also improved so it easier to travel to and from America. Printing press was made too. It made it possible to print many books and newspapers. The telephone and telegraph was invented for communication. Immigrants wished to make a better life for them and their families in America.           In California 1848 gold was found along American River. 1849 travelers headed for California. That began the beginning of the Califonia gold rush. People that looked for the gold were called the 'Forty-Niners'. Some of the Forty-Niners were Chinese men. They called California Gam Saan, or 'Gold Mountain.' After becoming rich the Chinese went back to China. The Gold Mountain spread throughout China and more Chinese wanted to join the gold rush. The everybody was going to California. 77% of America was in California during the gold rush.

It is a free country and provided many jobs in the 1800's. America gives immigrants a chance to start over, give them a new start on life. Its the land of opportunity.                 Immigrants had not much to do in the old country but immigrating to America would change that. There were a lot of new inventions and many jobs. Many new factories were being built which provided many jobs. Also crops grew and gave farmers a chance to get a job. The 1800's was also a big time for inventing. There were many crops for immigrants to farm and to plant crops. Ireland had a record high for immigrants in the farming community. Over one fourth of Ireland's population left to America to farm. (Hakim)              As much as immigrating is good  it also has the down turns. Just like a ball goes up it also must come down. These are the pushes and the pulls of immigrating to America. For example pulls are the things that attract people in life such as transportation grew and made resources easier to access. Also the telegraph was invented so now people could communicate easier and faster. But there are pushes in life also or what drive people away like the poverty in Europe. Also wars and other harsh conflicts. Many things in Europe 'pushed' them away and new technology 'pulled' people to America.             The Gold Rush was happening in the 1840's which attracted the Europeans and the Chinese. By 1849 many people were on their way to America to find gold. Over 60 ships set sail and thousands of travelers were already on their way. The nickname for these gold miners were the 'Forty-Niners'. Many people, especially the Chinese, came to hope to find a fortune in the Americas. More than 70,000 people with high hopes landed on the coast of California. The Gold Rush was a big attraction for many travelers.             Although there are many upturns and downturns the Europeans and Chinese made. They may have had a lot of trouble but they made it through. They provide crops, found gold, and made factories. Immigrants are a big part of America society and helped very much.

You could settle on land where people don't judge you on what you belive in. You could travel where you want with out getting worried someone might take you away just because of where your from.                   Some people came from religious reasons. For example 'Jews who came from Germany,Poland,and Russia were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home contry'. this shows that people couldn't be free in some countries so they came here to try to be free.           others came for freedom of land. You could settle from place to place. You could grow your own crops. You could also trade and sell what you wanted like veggies, fruits ,bread, and boats.              people came and go with the drout and other land disasteres. most of them stayed in the land of the free what most of us call home america.

When they got  to America their were about 26 millon immagrents in about 50 year period and vary little have barly heard about America except that it was a free country and a chance to work and they got to work faster cause of trains and it was alot faster than boats and runned on steam power. And in 1844 the telegraph and the telephone was soon made after in 1876 and only made news travle faster. People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily helped them even more. In 1848 along the American river in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter although he tried to keep it secret but word got out soon and everyone wanted it. After the discovery over 70,000 hopefull travalers were heading to California along with 1849,60 ships in 1849.Among them came the ''Forty-Niners'' they were 325 men from china and more and more came every day. And soon started fights over gold and rebeliens against the goverment. By the 1870s their were about 63,000 Chinese in the united states.

A lot of people needed more freedom and there corps failed. Some different people got treated differently then others because of their beliefs.   They had ships to travel but it would take days to do it. And some people would die because of starvation and getting sick and not enough water. They would have to drink salt water which would everoprate in your month really fast. And you would end up drinking a lot of salt water.           My school is celebrating Cultural Heritage Day. To tell about the stories that happened in the 1800s. I would like to tell about the difficult they had during that time. One major difficulty they had is they did not have enough land to farm because all of their crops were dieing from crop failed. They also did not have enough work for everyone. And that really hurt the economy. So most people left to get better pay and more and more work.  A lot of the countries went into war called the civil war to fight for more freedom. More then 1 million people died. The Chinese government raised taxes.            But it got even better more thing began to grow. Like the new railroad system easier to travel. And a lot more safe.It would also make it a lot faster to go on. The printing press came out to print newspaper that gave people new ideas and everyone knew about everything in the world. They were steam power and redesigned. They also came u with the telephone that everyone used. To talk to people like 5,000 miles away. Now that is COOL!It makes things travel faster. And a lot more jobs opened up for people. And more freedom to do what they want to do. And believe in. And even more WEALTH! It also helped families not worry about what if they are going to live tomorrow. And they can got to sleep with food. They can eat tomorrow.           Another reason people traveled to different places is China discovered something that everyone wanted it was gold!!! They had people rebel against them for it. It was crazy how much money it could be for. Farmers who were unable to pay taxes had to sell land to get food. They had to produce rice to feed people.             There are a lot more reasons fro why they had to travel but its is to many to name. But a lot of the population grew bigger and bigger. Foe example the number of people i the united states. And how much more babies were being born. It increased by a lot. To celebrate a special is very important to the people that died and to what they gave to us in this world. They gave us new advancements and technology. And a lot more if they wouldn't have done that we would have never had the stuff we had today!

Also the people from other places moved to America. They started to move sinse almost when they discovered America. They moved because they were getting treated badly. For example the italyans left because the government raised the taxes. Also the Jews were getting treated un faily so they moved here.        Then the Chinese people started to move to California. They were moving to California because they heard about the gold rush. So they started to steatel in California to try to get the gold. They were hear trying to get the gold from the mountains.

Moving to another place can be really hard too because you have to leave you best friend or the ones you love. Also moving here you have to lean a new language. It's hard to speak another language when your used to speaking one you already know really well.

The Germans,Irish,Russians Italians,Polands Denmark,Sweden, and Hungary all traveled to America in the 1800s. Before the American Civil War one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland crops had failed especially the potato crops. There was a famine. Over a million people died of starvation. Later in the 1800s people started traveling from other European countries which had not sent many people to America.            Many people in the 1800s came for religious freedom. This usually included Holland,Germany,Poland, and Russia. Jews also came to. Overall some of the 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.

First, I am going to be talking about the immigrants in America. During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship after ship. With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. Immigrants were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Irish men, women, and children kept coming, during and after the war. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.                 Next, I am going to talk about Changes in America. The second half of the 1800s was time of the great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved and the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but the new steamships could make the trip much faster. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. People became more interested of the world around them and with the ability to travel long distances easily, they moved are more than ever before.                 Finally, I am going to talk about the Gold Rush! Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man by the name of John Sutter. John tried to keep it a secret but word soon spread to San Francisco, and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. More Chinese came the next year, and the next. Most of this first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guandonb, an area on China's south coast. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britain. The Chinese government raised taxes. Farmers who we're unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. Guangdong's population was growing quickly. The area could not produce enough rice to feed its people, especially when the the floods destroyed the crops.                  In conclusion, the 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just beginning. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then all of a sudden they became a greater number: 2,716 in 1851 and 20,026 in 1852. Although they could be found throughout the country, 77 percent of them were in California.

The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America,industry grew and more immigrants arrived in America. Transportation also improved like the first rail road that crossed into the United States was done in 1869,so it became easier to travel with resources like silver and lumber from East to West.Europe travelers can now catch a train and that train would take them to a boat,the trip to America might have taken months but the invention of steamships made the trips much faster.

For example, the people from Europe moved to America because all those people came the population kept growing bigger. If the U.S. grew more there would not much food,jobs, and/or property. So the more immagrants come the more trouble the population would be.     Another example I got was that in the gold rush many Chinese people came and China had starvation,war,raised taxes,endless village and family feuds [fights].Many people started to rebel against the government.So this what happens if we have too much immagrants.

Many people moved to America because they wanted a better life for them and for there kids. By a better job I am referring to freedom or a better education for there kids.Not only did they want an education they also wanted jobs were they could get payd a fair amount of money. Other people also wanted to move to America because in America they could be in any  realigin they wanted. Other people moved because they wanted a home. Many people moved to America for many reasons in general some moved because they wanted jobs or others for homes etcetera.

Because back then there was ok tecnology so they needed to work in new factories. Well back in 1860's the  Irish men, women and children were move because the war was going on. They were moving during and after the war and that was only 1.7 million of the people.Also they were very dis appionted because their crops did not grow and that was a shortage for most of them.        Later on the  Europeans came to america to find jobs sothat they can get food. As well as Russians,Italians,Polanders,Denmarkers Swedens &amp; Hungaries. But  the Jews really didn't treat  thier counrty like home. Years past and more immigrants came to america. and that was a 50 year time period.    Lastly new comers didn't know much about the US.Such as Mexicans all they spoke was spanish. The very first rail road had crossed in 1869.

The Irish were the second largest group. Other immigrants came from Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Why did they migrate? There were many reasons like shortage of food, better crops, jobs, and freedom. there are many different reasons. Many people wanted to come because of all America had to offer, but some were almost forced. Living conditions in some countries made their lives difficult. To try to improve those conditions, they migrated.       In these times, one big thing was farming. People from Ireland mainly migrated due to farming. Many of their crops had failed, especially the potato crop. This was a big deal because if the crops died, then they would have no food for their families. More than 1 million people died of starvation. Before the war in the 1860's, a part of Ireland migrated to America. There was about 1.7 million Irish people at the time. They kept coming during and after the war. Later in the 1800's, European countries started sending people to America. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Before they migrated, the population of Europe almost doubled to 1,800. They all needed food, homes, and jobs. There was not enough for everyone. They then migrated for jobs and to avoid hunger. Greeks, Portuguese, and Armenians also migrated hoping for new lives for them and their families. People even came because America had religious freedom. People from Holland and Jew who were from Germany, Poland, or Russia. Jews were often hurt or arrested for their beliefs. They figured they would at least have a chance here in America. In total, 26 million immigrates had come to America in a 50 year period.       In the 1800's, America had many improvements. They called these 'pulls'. They are features that attract you to people and to socialize. Transportation was a big deal once it improved. They had just created the first railroad. This made it easier to transport resources like silver and lumber from West to East. People were also allowed to travel on the trains. Traveling was now faster and easier. Later there ere trains that could take people straight to boats. Transportation improved even more when the steamship was invented. Migrating to America would usually take months, but now the trip was much faster. News was hard to get around. In 1844, the telegraph was invented. This just made the news travel faster. America really improved over the years!       Although migrating to America helped a lot of people, there were, however, challenges. They called these 'pushes'. These included rough environments, wars, poverty, and other problems. These conflicts worsened once the population in Europe increased. Europeans left due to harsh environments. Russian Jews escaped from prejudice,  persecution, and violent attacks. Southern Italians faced high birth rates and farming loses because of lower prices.       In 1848, gold was found along the American River in California by John Sutter. Although he tried to keep it a secret, it soon got out to the people of San Francisco. Many of them left to go to the river. It later spread through the rest of America. By the beginning of 1849, thousands of people were taken by ship to the river. The California Gold Rush had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers, called the 'Forty-Niners', which had 325 Chinese men among them. This may have seemed like a 'pull', but was also a 'push'. Soon the Chinese government raised taxes which made farmers have to sell their land because they could not pay for it. The population had started growing quickly. Soon they could not produce enough rice to feed the people, especially when it flooded. Many Chinese people joined the Gold Rush. This helped fix the problems.

Well, I had.   Many people came to start a new land of their own. They needed new soil that will helped them grow their crops. A Lot of other people wanted to invent new things. They thought that this land was gonna chane their lives.                                       Alot has happen since the 1800s begun. The very first railroad in America was completed in 1869. There was also a invention called telegraph and the telephone which was invented in 1876. People around the world heard about the new things invented and moved to America. The word that characterized them were push and pull. Push, means why the people left their countries. Pull, on the other hand means what attrated them to come.For example the Gold Rush.                       The Gold Rush pulled alot of people from where they live. The man that discovered the gold was John Sutter. He wanted to keep it a secret, but soon the whole world knew. Over 70,000 people came to America in 1849. These people were named '' Forty-Niners.''Some people were hopeless. People from China called California Gam Saan which means ''Gold Mountain.''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A Lot of Chinese came to California for gold. Only 325 men were from China in the Gold rush. All of the men from China were from Guangdong. they wanted to go there, make their fortunes, qand return happily to China. the men that went to the gold rush were the beginning of Guangdong. Next Year, More chinese men came. In 1851, 2,716 and 20,026 in 1852. By the 1870s there about 63,00 chinese in America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Alot had change from the 1860s to the 1910s. The number from people living in the America in the 1860s was 31,513,00 and in 1910 was 92,407,00. All those things really changed America. That is is how people came to America in the 1800s. Now America is a country known for its gold Rush and its freedom.

But there was some down sides of that like the disceases they had. Another one was the great war of americal. But also the good part was that they had there freedom. Now let me tell you about those goods and bad.            One of the bad part of moving to America was the disceases. The disceases killed many people in America. It started when imigrants moved to America. They gave the disceas to the people that lived there and then they die. They couldnt get cured because they didnt have any tecnolegy to find the cure.             The second bad part was the civil war when Europe wanted to take America over. The natives didnt want to give America to them because they didnt want America to look like Europe. The war went on for a really long time that took days and months. Many people started to die every day because of the war. But then the war ended and America won and Europe left America alone.          The good part was the freedom after the war. People were able to do alot more thing then what they had to do in Europe. In Europe they had to mary the person the king picked for them. The people had to go to a certain church that the king picked for them. People were happy in america because of thier freedom.          So that was what happend in the 1800's. There was a lot of disceases that killed people. There was a civil war between Europe and America. Then more people went to America because of there freedom. So as you can see the 1800's were very intresting to learn and read about.

Another reason was in a time were people needed money and America needed production, and America had faster transportation for, people that needed jobs. One more reason is because of the California Gold Rush. It was way people would get jobs and money.            First of all, America needed people to invent things. And there was so many people around the world that came. Some even made ships to transport, instead of Sails they made steam ships. There was also more rail road tracks. It made it easier to transport resources to people.            Second of, another reason people came to America was a time of money and need jobs. And America needed lots of workers for production. And many people were driven forward by this. And America coal production was massive. Then more people came to America for jobs.            Lastly, the reason why people came to America was the California Gold Rush. It brought people from all over the world. The whole point of people coming was to make money and settle in America. Another reason was that people bought land. And the benefit to America made a huge population.            The whole point of this essay is to tell why people came to America. Like the Gold Rush. Or the jobs for people that were poor. Or the inventions waiting to be invented by people.

People would tell storys of gold beyond the Pacifc Ocean. They called California Gam Saan, or 'Gold Mountain.'' In the 1800's people from all around the world would come to America because they lost jobs and did not have no food. Before the American Civil War in the 1860's 1.7 million Irish men, women, and childeren came to America because Irish crops had failed, especialy potato crops and they did not want to die of starvation. That is how diffrent types of people ended up America.

But most came from Europe.       The reason they all came was because it was new land. And they wanted to find out what new item that they might not have. And what could they build. They desided to build things like: Railroads, Boats, and Printing presses for newpaper. Its good to have Immigrants. Even to this day we sitll have immigrants moving from one country to another.

The first reason is the Europeans were in harsh moments.They wanted many new things in their life.They wanted no violent too.They wanted to be free and do something with their life.That's why they came to America for a new life.       The second thing is they wanted a new life in America.They were looking for jobs to work.They needed to feed their family and a new life.People that came to the free country to made their life easy to live in.That's why people came to America.        The last thing is that in 1896 they made a new transportation.They use the train to go places faster then usually.Many people used the train if they didn't have car.They also used the train to go to some boats.That why the came to America.

Most Europeans came to find jobs and escape hunger while the Jews came to escape Germany,Poland,and Russia who mistreated the Jews beliefs in their home countries. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary are some of the countries that left for America so they could have a better home at America. Most newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.       Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogrom-organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. Some Hunagarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians are some of the others who left for America. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and families in the United States.       Gold was discovered along the American River in California at 1848 on property of  John Sutter. He tried to keep the gold a secret but word got out that there was gold in the American River. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of immigrants were headed for California. The Gold Rush had begun! More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849 for the Gold Rush. Among these 'Forty-Niners' were 325 men from China.       Some of these Chinease immigrants were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was involved in a war between China and Britain. The 325 Chinease who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. The next year the Chinease arrived in California. Then suddenly they came in great numbers:2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinease in the United States.

There was a lot of new technology in 1800s so there was plenty for them to do. Lots of them were needed in factories, to farm and build on land, and to invent things.          Germans were the largest group of immigrants in 1800s, then the Irish. Before the American Civil war started, one-fourth of the whole Irish population came to America. Which means there were 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. Many Irish were desperate, there was a food shortage.       Later in the 1800s, other people from European countries started to arrive in America. Including Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Poland, Russia, and Hungary. All of those people needed food, homes, and jobs.And mostly to avoid hunger.       Others came for religious freedom, such as Holland and Jews from other European countries. Still others came to escape wars, that made their lives harmful, and unstable.       26 million immigrants came to the United States over a 50 year period! They came for a chance of freedom, and a change in their lives.                                       Pushes and Pulls       The first railroad that crossed America was completed in 1869, this meant that resources would lumber form the West, to East. People would travel on these trains too, it made one trip from one place to another easier and faster.       People became more aware about the changes and world around them. With the ability to move along distances easily, they took advantage of it. Most reasons why they moved often were ' Pushes' and 'Pulls.' Pushes were things that drove people away, like harsh environment, wars, and other conflicts. Pulls were things that attracted people, for example: jobs, wealth, opportunities, and perceived freedoms.       Many of the new Europeans immigrants wanted to escape the horrible conditions in Europe. Southern Italians wanted to escape their sufferment from high birth rates and farming losses due to the low prices. Greeks, Poles, Hungarians, and Portuguese also moved. They ( As well as other immigrants ) hoped to make a better living for their families and themselves in the United States                                              Gold Rush!       There are a lot of pulls for the immigrants as may already know, but one of the most biggest pulls for the immigrants was the California Gold Rush! Many of the Chinese moved to join the California gold rush. The gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. The property was owned by John Sutter, even though Sutter kept the secret to himself, the word spread to San Francisco and once the new spread all over the United States, and to other countries all over the world, hundreds of people left the city to go join the gold rush!         More than 70,000 hopeful adventures came to California in 1849. Among of these Forty-Niners were 325 for China! More Chinese came year after year! The Chinese hope they find some fortune in the California hills.

America is full with new jobs, different religions, different languages, and much more exciting things.             In the 1800s, there were many immigrants that came from all over the world. Some came from Poland, Germany, Ireland, Russia, Italy, Denmark, China, and a lot of other places.             People came to America for freedom, wealth, a new environment, a new life, to escape wars, jobs, opportunities, avoid hunger, crops, and other things.             Wealth was one thing that brought very many people to America. For example, in 1848 there was a big gold rush in California. A big amount of people from China came to the gold rush. One year after another, the population of the Chinese going to the U.S. raised higher and higher. Many people from China came to find many different things, but 77% of them were in California.              Another reason why there were so many immigrants coming were because of people getting out of wars or fights. People were coming to find a new life, without violence. Would you want to live in a place being attacked by bombs, or being beat because of what religion you choose? I don't think anyone would! That's why people came to America! They found safe homes for themselves, and their children.              Jews were getting mistreated because of their religion. Everyone is different in some way, so don't treat them differently! People from China came to America to get away from conflicts and poverty. China had 2 wars against Britain in their country. No one wants to live through that! China also had rebellions against their own government! Or they had village or family fights! Who in their right mind would want that in their village? Those are a couple reasons of why the Chinese came to America. Also, when they came to America, they got what they wanted!        People also came because they couldn't pay taxes or their bills. Farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their land. Where are we going to go? the farmers thought. The only place they could think of was America. They got their land and were happy with it. That's what America is all about... making people happy.              Things were hard in immigrants own countrys, so they came to us... AMERICA!

There was a lot of technology for them to use. They needed to work in factories, farms, build on land, and invent things. Immigrants did that.           One- fourth of the whole Irish population came to America before the Civil War. That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops failed, the potato crop was low, and there was a food shortage. One million Irish people died of starvation.           In the later 1800s, people came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The extra people needed food, homes, and jobs, There wasn't enough in Europe.           Others came for religious reasons. These people were from Holland, and the Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews were mistreated because of their beliefs in their home countries. But, people still came to escape wars that made their life unstable and unpredictable.           The total number of immigrants that migrated to the United States was 26 million over a 50 year time period. Most knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom and chance to work.           The second half of the 1800s was a great change in America. Industries grew and a lot of immigrants came to Americas shores.           Many European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews had left to escape prejudice and persecution in the shape of pograms. Pograms were organized violent attacks.           The Gold Rush started in 1848 along the American River in California. John Sutter discovered it. John tried to keep the gold a secret but the word of the find soon reached San Francisco and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. Quickly, the news spread to the rest of the United States and to other parts of the world. By January of 1849, 60 ships with thousands of travelers were going to California.            More than 70,000 adventurers arrived in California in 1849. These ' Forty- Niners' were 32 men from China. More Chinese people came over the next year, and the eastern United States. The Chinese people hoped to find a fortune of gold waiting for them in the California Hills.             Most of the first wave of the Chinese migrants were from Guangdong. Guangdong was in area on China's south coast. They were leaving from conflicts and poverty.  In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was in two wars between China and Britain. There was also many rebellions against the government and endless village and family feuds. So, the Chinese government raised taxes. The farmers were unable to pay their taxes so they had to sell their land.           The 325 Chinese that had joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. Over the next year, 450 Chinese came to California. Then suddenly the came in huge numbers. 2,716 in 1851. 20,026 in 1852. By 1870, there were 63,000 i the United States.           As you can see, there were many different types of immigrants in the 1800s. Irish, Germans, Russians, Chinese, Jews. During the 1800s, there was a huge immigrant sprout in America as you can see. The immigrants helped form our country that we have today. They invented things, built things, and created our culture.

As you read my essay you will find out the events and learn about them.            This paragraph will be about the people who move to America and why they moved here.Before the civil war about one-fourth of Irelands population moved to America because the crops in Ireland were failing and the crops here were good. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries such as Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweedan, and Hungary. Many of the people that came to America come to find jobs, and avoid hunger. Others came for religios freedom such as Holland, and Jews that came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total about 26 million immagrants arrived in America over a 50 year period.            This paragraph will be about the changes in america. The second part of the 1800s was a time of great changes. Indusrty grew and many immagrants arrived in the american shore. Transportation also improved, like the first railroad was completed in 1869. This meant it was easier to move resources like silver and lumber from west to east. People could also travel on these trains too. In the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely info traveled. Steam powered ships and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspaper. This made news and ideas available to more people. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.            This paragraph will be about the Gold Rush and why the Chinese move to California. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the proerty of a man named John Sutter. John tried to keep this discovery a secret, but word of the find spread and reach San Francisco, and hundreds of people set of to go to the American River. Word also spread around the world and on January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overload travelers were heading for California and the California Gold Rush had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful travelers arrived in California in 1849. Among these 'Forty-Niners' were 325 men from China. More Chinese came the next year, and the next. like the people the people who came from the eastern United States. Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on Chinas south coast.            As you can see, alot of events happend in the 1800s and alot of immagrants came to the United States of America. And that is why i think the 1800s are so special.

They all needed to move to america for a reason.       The irish came because thier crops had failed. Espeshally the potatoes. A lot of people died in ireland because of starvation. Infact more than 1 million people died. As a result, they moved to America.       The others came for religious reasons. Espeshally the jews because they were mistreated in Germany, Polland, and Russia. They wanted to be free from that so they came to America. All of them needed homes so they needed to build them, and they did.       They all came to America for food and freedom. They needed to help build houses because they all needed them so they built them. The irish got there food and the jewish got there freedom. They were all problibly very happy.       Everyone that comes to America is free because America is a place that is free. Im glad that i live in America because if I lived in china i would be dead because im the 3rd sister and they kill any girls that are after 2 girls. Russia is just mean.

They came 325 in 1849,450 in 1850, 2,716 in 18,51 ,and by 1870 there were 63,000.the 325 chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the begining. I never thought the chinese will make it here walking i thought they brought there cars but they didnt have that back then.         2.          In the 1800 the working people had lots to do since they built lots of technoligy . they needed to work on there factorys and invint new things. a few years later eurpians started going to chinese village   it also included Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden, and Hungary.others came from religious freedom.          3.In total , some 26 million people came to United States over a 50 year period. many of those people did not know much about America except they did know it was a free country. the people didnt like the native americans it was because of there skin colos and there persinality.          4.More than 70000 hopeful adventures arrived in california in1849 among these forty niners were 325 men from china. those 325 men werte in the gold rush and were the beginners or possibly even the leaders.many people went for the houses and for the food. they traveled by ships and boats but they mostly came by ships.            5.Now that some of the chinese immigrants have made it they have made houses and relaxed from all the walking and working and finding gold .

In 1800s there was alot of things to do there was new tenolghy. The germans made up the largest group of imigrents in 1800s. More Imigrents came after the war. Other people came from difrient relegiouns to the USA. In  the 1750 and 1850 people were hungray there were no jobs.                During the 1800s people starting working imigrints too. When there was the civil war in 1860 more people started coming after it was over. There was more than a million crops grown but they dide. More than 1 million people dide of starvtion. Becaue there was no food.            \      In the 1800s people started coming from European in the 1850 jobs were aviable in the USA. There was extrea food,houses and clothes left. Other people came from diffrient religeions and jews people started to come. There was freedom to work in the USA some works were wanted they neede help to work. There was a totoal of 26 millions.            There was a change made in the 1800s there was many expensieve books sold. It was on the news thats what made more people buy them. In 1876 The imigrents traveld faster to the USA ship after ship came full of imigrents. Many of the new immigrants wanted to esceape harsh condiddions in Europe. Immigtants wanted to start new lifes if they esceaped.         The gold was discoverd in 1848 by John Sitter. John wasnt really going to tell noboady but it was all spread around the world by januray 1849. People in ships were heading to the USA to look for gold. People left there house to come to amiricea.

The push factor is something that happens when a house is damaged or its not liveable anymore. Once a house is old and it looks like its getting ready to fall down the people do a push factor they leave thst house for another house and then they leave that house for another house thats why people move so much. And when they get tired of staying in that country they do another push factor and move to another country its not because of other people or anything its because of the house thats not liveable for there kids if they have any    And thats what a push factor is so all you people that think there moving because of you its not here is somthing to read incase you think of that one day.

In the 1800 many imagrants came to America because they were tring to find a new job or bring there invention to the world. Other people came because of the conflicts in there country.        In Europe alot of people in swedian came over the borders because of a potatoe famine that caused many to die. In China people came over because they were in a war with another country called Great Britian. When they came over the ywent to calafornia and started one of the main reasons why people came to west in 1849. The famous Calafornia Gold Rush.       The people that moved east wanted jobs in citys so that they can support there family but most immagrants didn,t get the best of jobs in the world. They mostlikely worked in factorys or as your neighborhood store clurk.       In the middle of the country there is a place called the Great plains. Alot of people moved there for farms and the western Movement. The farms had corn and good natural reasorces that made them a nice profit and gave them alot of money.       In conculson, the immagration in the United States increased the population by alot. The immagration caused  America to be like it was today and if some people didn,t immagrate you wouldn't be here.  So immagration was a good thing to happen. I like cheese.

Even if it's, how we act, how we've changed, or freedom. In the 1800s many people were fighting in the war for their life. People didn't know if it was right or if it was wrong to do all of the things they were doing. Now and days, almost everyday now people still fight over the war, saying its never going to end or in the 1800s it was just the beginning. However, it was not just the beginning for as we know it right now. America has freedom and rights now. Many people, now are confused of what will and is always going to be going on. People have been confused and lately, I've been confused from all the threats we are just suddenly getting again from South Korea. Immigrants and Emigrants are a really big deal today. Immigrants are people who enter the United States. People refer to the 'I' in immigrants to refer as 'inter' even though it is spelled differently. Also, Emigrants relate to the 'E' because if you are an Emigrant that means that you are Exiting that country. It's very easy though to see how much the USA has changed since the 1800s. Then, you can see how easy it is. In the next few paragraphs, you will see how and why the people would move in the 1800s. You may be shocked you may be surprised you may have known these things. It just all depends on what your knowledge is and how you use it. In the next paragraphs also, we are going to see what and how people do stuff like this. It's actually pretty cool to hear/see how they would move if you have to force people to show you how, you can do all of these things and how you can do different things with it.             People now like to go and try new things out by moving. Now we can do push or pull resources. A push is when someone is pushing you to go somewhere like, they are forcing you to go somewhere to move. A pull is when someone is trying to attract you to go somewhere by, telling someone even a two year old that if they move there they'll get them new toys or something. They will think about it and if they say, 'yes!' then you can do whatever to it and they'll help you fix whatever you would think you would need. It depends on who you are and what you do if you can do whatever you can to make sure that you know what your doing so it will be more capable to do these kind of certain things that you can do with moving from country to country.Which makes it easier to do certain things with the war going on in the 1800s it was much more reliable to do stuff with people and make sure that we can do many other things with what you think that we are doing in the different time zones. In the next two paragraphs, well the exact next one I'm doing all I am mostly going to be talking about are the 'pros' of being an immigrant for a new country. Then, the one after that are going to be 'cons' of being and immigrant and moving to a new country and the 'pros' of a push and pull. In the third one with the 'cons' I also will be talking about 'cons' of a push or pull.              Pros of being an immigrant a pros of a push/pull. Now, people are trying to decide pros and cons.Pros: you can see more, you can have freedom, not be in the middle of the war. All those are some really good reasons why we are who we are and have done what we have done. We all have different reasons why we are doing what we are doing! We can always make sure we know what we are doing, while we are doing it. We are making sure that it is easier for people to make sure how they do stuff is how we can leave it. So, that it is possible for other people to do these type of things to make it easier for people to do these things so that we can do different things before the end of the war.         Last, it was as if people can do whatever people can do when they are trying to do what they can. People have been very good at this subject since people were doing everything they could to do these things.

They did not want to go through starvation and illness at the time. Another reason they came is because World War 1. They came to look for food, homes, and jobs-and there just didn't seem to be anough in other countries. A lot of people died during that time.   Also, there were other pushes and pulls at the time. Lots of immigrants came to America because of the Gold Rush. They thought that if they came they would find gold and have a better life in America. Which I think is right because there was a lot of gold at the time, which I call, 'Butter Nuggets!'   Other pushes are like a harsh enviroment, wars &amp; other conflicts, and poverty. There are other pulls like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom. A bad thing about leaving your country is that you might not be able to bring everything that you got, leave your family behind, loose your pineapple under the sea, or your pets like my pet that I lost when I moved to the Bakini Bottom. I lost him because he is afraid of water. It was a sad experiance.   Back to Immigrants! They also came to America to bulid railroads. So, that's why immigrants moved to America.       P.S. I ate my goldfish!

We are going to talk about how the European immigrants came to America in the 1800's.How they crossed the Atlantic ocean with some people died. Then how the population increased in America. Aand some EEuropeans live in America today.                The Europeans were not harmful at all, all they wanted to do was have a better life and made sure that their family's and friends would be okay. All of the EEuropeans had no electricity because, it was the 1800's there was no electricity back then. So when they didn't have any electricity or gas there were no motors. But they did know how to paddle with the paddles. They paddled all the way across the Atlantic ocean just to live in America.                         When they were at sea some of them were sea sick. A lot of them died because they got decease that can kill you and hurt you badly. Plus they starved from the little food and water that they had. But still a lot of them made it to America and survived without dieing but some still got sick.                 Once they got to America they were so happy and they all ate some thing. Then after that America increased the population from 20,471,000 and now with the Europeans it cudropled  92,407,000. That's a lot of people that moved to America. Yep that's a lot of people who moved from Europe to America.                 Now even though some of their family's died and i know its sad but there was nothing they could have done excepted that they were all going to die but they were lucky that they didn't. And still a lot of Europeans live in America.

Their wasn't much space where they lived so they want more space, land and homes.people that invented wanted to do something better their life moved to the untied states. their was pulls and pushes. one pull was jobs. one pushes was conflict in their countries.             The gold rush cause a lot of people to go to California. the gold rush was not sposed to be discovered it got every where and a year later 60 ships. a man named Guangdong he got involved in two wars britain and china.he destroyed crop and made floods.

A trip to one place and a other became shorter and easier for many people. people now can take a train to take them to a bout so they don't have to walk. It was also rapid and important chang in how quickly information traveled. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster. Peoplembecame more aware of the world around them with the ability to move long distances easily. European immigrents wanted to escape harsh conditions in europe. Gold was discovered in 1848 in the american river in california. More than 70,000 adventurers came to california. There were 325 chinesethat joined the gold rush in 1949 thats a lot.

They migrated to America for better crops, food, work, money, and a better live. The total of immigrants that migrated to America is at lest 26 million or more that came for a better live for themselves, and for their families. Even till now there is still immigrants.      In 1869 the first railroad that crossed the US (United States) was completed. This meant it was easier to find more resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. Now it was easier for people to travel to place to place. In 1844-1876 telegraph and telephones were made. In time new tech and transportation will be made.      In 1848 gold was discoverd along the rivers of CA (Califirnia) on the property of a man named John Sutter. By Jan 1849  60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for CA, it became a gold rush. 325 men from China more of them came in the next year most came from Guangdong. People felt hopeless and they listen to the tales of gold beyond the pacific ocean . the call CA gam saan or Gold Mountain for it's unbelievable richness.      Through 1860-1910 there were 31,513,000 people in 1860 in 1910 92,407,000 people. In 1860 4,096,753 were born in 1910 13,344,545 were born.

These immagrants and and all of these changes, have transformed America into the oustanding country its today .           To begin with,  Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's. People started coming from other European countries, this included Russia Italy, Poland, Denmak , Sweeden and Hungary. All of those people came for a reasoon though. For example, food , jobs , homes and alot more.  Others came for religious freedom. Especially Jews becasue they where mistreated for there religon. Also, some cameto escape wars that made there life unstable and unpredictable. Those are some very good reason to immigrate to America. In all 26 million immagrants arrived in the USA over a 50 year period! Thats crazy.          Next, the second half of the 1800's was a great change. Immigants arrived and insdustry grew, transportation improved meraculosly. People could now travel here by boat, train and car. The invention of the telegram made it easier to communticate with relatives and friends. Many European immigrants wanted to escape the harsh conditions found in Europe. Also, some Jew where attacked, just because of there religions. Southern Italtians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. They all went to see if they could find a better life here in America.         Finally , the gold was discovered, and the Chinese moved to California. A man named John Sutter was the person who discovered gold. He tried to keep it a secret that he discovered it, but soon after ther word reached everywhere. Hundreds and thousands of people left to see if they could strike it rich. By January of 1849, 60 ships carrying over thousdands of followers where headed to California. It started a boom town , the gold rush had begun. The Chinese came a few years following after the gold rush. They came because of pverty, food and taxed. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the USA and they played a critical part in building the transcontinential railroad.          In conclusion, there are many reasons why immigrants traveled to America during the 1800's. Each immigrant group has a different story to tell, and they have all played a big role in American history.

People from around the world came to california and tried to strike it rich.  If they reach gold in the california hills they wont need to get a job.  They could just get some food and a home.

These cultures went to America for many different reasons, sometimes referred to as 'pushes' and 'pulls,' such as hope for wealth or avoiding conflicts. These events causing these immigrants to travel to America made up a very important segment in history that will be remembered.

Do you ever wonder why those people decide to move America? There is always a reason or more why immigrants, people from different countries that move to America, decide  to move to America. Here are some reasons why the immigrants decide to move to America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Many people from different countries decided to move to America because of a 'push'. A 'push' is something that drives someone from their home.What can cause a 'push' is a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts,and poverty. One of the main things that can cause a 'push' is that if there is a large population of  people in where ever you live .                                                                                                                                                                                           Another reason immigrants decided to move to America is because of a 'pull'.  A 'pull' is something that attracts people. An example of a 'pull' is a job,wealth,opportunities,access to resources,and perceived freedoms.If you go to America you will be sure to find all of this sometimes if you try your hardest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        A reason why people from different countries moved to America is because of something that happenned in California. What happened in California is the Gold Rush. Many immigrants came to America because they wanted some of the gold. Over 63,000 people came because they heard aabout the Gold Rush.

Like for instance if someone from Europe wanted to move here and let's say he did, he would be called a immagrant or if there were more than one imagrants. Also say that a young boy was born in in France than at the age of 6 he had to move and then lets say 20 years later there is a voting for hoom should be the next president in America.           He wouldn't be able to vote because him and everyone else that wasn't born in America wouldn't be able to either.So now you you know what a imagrant or imagrants is.

The population increased by over 26 million in America, mainly because of the immigrants. There was a lot of immigration in the 1800s. This was especially in America.        People were pulled to America by jobs and wealth mainly. Other reasons were hunger, freedom, and access to recources. For example, the Irish were the biggest group of immgrants to come to America. Many Europeans were pulled to America because they needed to find work and also avoid being starved. Others were pulled to the U.S. because of religious freedom. For example, Jews had come from Russia, Poland, and Germany because the were mistreated for beliefs. The Chinese were pulled to America because of the Gold Rush in Califronia.        Others were pushed from their homes by many reasons. Some immigrants came to America because they wanted to escape from wars in their countries. This also refers to the Jews because there was a war starting in Germany because of their religous beliefs. The Irish were the largest group of immigrants to come to America. They were pushed to America by the failing crops and a famine beginning in Ireland.        Those are mainly the reasons that people had migrated to another country. Basically, they were pulled or pushed because of reasons like wealth, finding jobs, freedom, and hunger. People were really smart to migrate to another country because they could have died if they did not. Immigration was an important part of history and we would not have this great of a country without all of the different cultures we can learn about and so can they.

People from different countries were immigrating to other countries, such as America and Europe, for different reasons. Some came for religious beleifs. Some came for jobs. Others came to escape harsh times. Read on to hear about immigration in the 1800's.             A very big reason for immigration is religious beleifs. Prejudice was starting to rise in countries like Germany, Poland, and Russia. Jewish poeple from these countries started to immigrate to free countries, such as America, to get way from prejudice. Jews were horribly mistreated. They finally decided to flee their countries.             Another big reason for immigration was to get jobs.

So when they heard that gold was being found in California they thought that can settle to migrate to come to California for the gold so the Chinese and others would come. So that's why the people decided to come to America to get the gold and to also get a better society they can follow and get more money.

In order to provide for their family they had to get a job. So they imagrated to the United States to go looking for a job. Many imagrants were so happy to find jobs and be able to eat great food. These imagrants imagrated from all over the world. They wanted to have a good life so they came to the USA.   Next, is freedom, they wanted their own beliefs. They wanted to have their own religious beliefs they did not want to be told what to believe in. Also, they did not want to be held back any longer they did not want to follow so of these silly laws. In some countries if the king did not like you he could kill you, but in America you could get a fair chance.   Now, is they did not want to be held back, They wanted to be free like I said in my last paragraph. They did not want to be bossed around all they wanted was to have a great life, have a family and more. They were treated cruel in their countries for no reason. But in America you were treated equal no one was treated unfair.

Irish wanted to move to America bec?ause the wanted war versus their country. Irish kept coming during the war .The Irish were desperate becausetheir crops had failed. More than 1 million Irish had starved to death.       Many chinese people moved to America be cause of the gold rush. Gold was discovered by John Sutter on his property on the American river. Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret. the word found its way to San Francisco city and hundreds of people left the city to go to the American River.

The first people that started to come were in Europe.  The greatest amount of immigrants came from Germany and Poland.  Most of the people come because of money, jobs, or religious believes.                               The Italians left because of high birth rates.  Russian jews left because of prejudice and persecution.  The tradition of leaving land to your first born boy left them landless.  And so many people died of hunger.                     Most of the emigration came when they started making steam boats.  In 1848 70,000 Chinese came to the USA for the gold rush hoping to make money.  The first of them come came from Guangdong, China.  Another reason so many people came because the US was in industrializing.

Many of the crops were dieing and the potato crop was the one the most that quite on every body. 1.17 million Irish people came to America including men, woman, and children. They kept coming even before and after the war others had come from religious freedom these included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. (Jews were often mistreated for there beliefs in their home countries. still others come to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. the second half of the 1800's was a time of great change in America industry grew and many immigrants arrived on Americas shore. The first railroad that crossed the united states was completed in 1868. So it was easier to move silver and lumber from the west to the east. A trip to America back then would have taken months, but the new steamships could make the trip even faster. Also in the 1800's there was very rapid and important change in how quickly and widely  information traveled. Also the possible redesign of the printing press made it to were you can and could print many inexpensive book or newspaper. Then came along the invention of the telephone which was a very big help it made news travel a whole lot faster then before. Now people are becoming more aware of the world that we all live in and it is becoming better and better each and every day so we should really take care of our world they did.

What I'm going to tell you first is about Americas freedom. No country had the freedom we did. We let our citizens talk how they wanted  do what they wanted and even have there own religion. So we obviously we had freedom in our country. Other countries wouldn't even let there people talk without permission that why we have the people we have now.                      I'm also going to tell you about our awesome gold rush. Our gold rush mostly attracted the Chinese. In two years there was over 63,000 Chinese people in America. The Chinese are the ones who built most of the first railroad. The Chinese were very hard working people that would do any thing for the gold by the American River.                      Last but not least I'm going to tell you about how we had jobs at this time. China, Germany, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, and the rest of Europe did not have any jobs. So they all came to America where there was jobs and money and places to live. The only job Europe had was sailing a boat and giving out tickets to got to America.                          All in all you now see why the population has grown in America. It has has jobs, it had the gold rush, and it has freedom. If I lived in Europe in that time I would be trying to get there so fast that I would run on water. Well back to the important stuff America is good!

There was not enough food. A lot of people died of starvation in Ireland.                      In 1848 gold was dicovered along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. When word got out a lot of people came,Most of the people were Chinese.

There are many advantages and disadvantages for moving to another country. Some advantages are that your country might have a food shortage so you could move to a different country that doesn't have a food shortage, there might be a really bad disease going around that's deadly and you wouldn't want to get it, or there might be a better job opportunity. Some disadvantages are: moving to a different country could be hard because you would have to sacrifice leaving family and friends, finding a job or a way to get money, not knowing the same language as the people in the country that you moved to, transportation, or the different time and climate changes that your body isn't used to. Now, lets see how people in the 1800s managed to do this, and why.       In the 1800s, many people migrated to America. There were many reasons why they did. Some did so that they could build, farm, or invent new things. The largest group of immigrants were the Germans, and then the Irish. Many of the Irish people migrated to America just before the Civil War, there was about 1.7 million families that came at this time. They came because there was a food shortage in Ireland so people were dieing. Many other countries came to America for this reason as well. Some other people came because of there religious beliefs[the Jews] because they were mistreated because of what they believed in.       In the later 1800s, America started to have many changes. Many things started to improve, and many more things were invented. Transportation improved, the telephone was invented,and printing books and newspaper became less expensive. Then, in the mid 1800s, gold was soon discovered.  In the next year people from everywhere around the United States and other countries heard about it and soon went to California for gold. This is when the Gold Rush began.       So, this is how and why immigrants migrated to America in the 1800s. For gold, jobs, because of prejudice people in there country, and many other reasons. So, now we know why all this happened!

Mostly  it's not bad at all. An immigrant is a person or group of people that move from there home to a new home in a different country. Usually when a person immigrates it's because of a  pull or a push but that's something we are going to look at that more later.   Pull                   When someone is pulling something you are bringing something to you or attracting something to you. That's pretty much what in this case a pull is. A pull is when something amazing has happened or is happening. For example in 1848 all over the American  River was gold and John Sutter found it. Not long after word broke out that Sutter struck gold! This news was sent all the way to San Francisco and soon the gold rumor got all the way to China. This news attracted or pulled the Chinese to America. in only the first year 325 men immigrated to California.      Push                A push is a lot like a pull but still very different. unlike the pull a push is when something is going terrible wrong in there own country and they have no choice but to immigrate. when the immigration from China came from Guangdong. Many of the lands in China where not producing good crops and the Chinese Government started raising taxes. So the people had to move or that would be the end for most of the Chinese. They moved to the US to restart there life and face new problems.   What is immigrating?                    So in the long term an immigrant is jest someone that moves from one country to the next because the want to or even have to. So stop thinking that immigration is bad. The most likely where pulled in by freedom to work or pushed out of their own country because of a bad cause. Immigrants are not as comon as they did in the 1800's but there are still some today.

During the 1800s,working people who could build,farms, or invent came to America in ships.Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the late 1800s.In the later 1800s,people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to the America before.Others came for religious freedom, these included people from Holland,and Jews who came from Germany,Poland, and Russia.In total some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom.

There were many problems in America, but not everyone went the same way as other people did in these stories like Moving to America, Changes in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants, and Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California.          In Moving to America, people came to America y and with the technology there was plenty for them to do. One-forth of Ireland came to America.  The Irish came to America because their crops failed so more than 1 million people died of hunger.  Other immigrants wanted religious freedom like people in Holland, Jews who came from Germany, Poland and Russia. 26 million immigrants went to America over a 50 year period.       In Changes in America: The  'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants, industry grew, many immigrants came and transportation improved.  Travelers and other people could travel by train and there were steamships.  Many people or immigrants wanted to escape their 'pushes' or the features of life that drive people out of their homes.       In Gold Rush! Chinese Move to America, gold was dicovered in 1848 along the American River in California and John Sutter the man who own the property, tried to keep it a secret, but the news spread out.  Many people went there and many found gold or did not.

Over the years ,well,actually centuries,almost all of the countries have had immigrants.But this time were going to talk about America's immigrants.When we started to have technology, we needed to have people to run all of the things that we needed done.Like all of the railroad tracks being done,new factories needed employes . The more technology there was,the more people we needed to run it.                                                                                                    All over the world, people have been running from starvation,prejudice ,persecution,and harm. But America had found a way to protect those people who had went through that. America had let other people come into it to work , have a family,and over all, start a new life.To this day, we still have immigrants, living ,and working with us.And there are still more and more places to work and there always will be.                                                                                          In the 1860s 1/4 of all the Irish people came here ,because the food was low and most of the crops had failed  especially the potatoes. People from Holland,Germany,Poland , and Russia all came to start new lives. Russian and German Jews left prejudice and persecution.While Holland people came for religious purposes.And some people came because of wars.                       In 1848, a man called John Sutter found gold on his property.He tried to keep it a secret, but by 1849,January, thousands of people got there.325 , out of 70,000 of these people were Chinese. Though that was just the beginning, next year there were 450 more Chinese.Then in 1851,2,716 people,then in 1852,20.026,  by 1870,63,000 Chinese were in California.                                You see, we've always had immigrants,but we don't know how much they've helped us.They have done all the things we don't want to do.From building railroads, working at factories, and harvesting crops.If we had not had immigrants,America would not be here.And neither would you.

During this time technolgy has grown for instance, there was the redsign of the print and press, the telgraph, and telphone.There were other reasons other than industrial advances such as religious fredom and ect.         The groups who first came to America other than George Washington and his followers. After word got out about the country of freedom more people came some where 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. They came because their crops failed, but the single largest group that came where the Germans. In the later 1800's  people started coming from European countries that had not come yet such as, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary all these people to ind work and avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom for instance Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia that was 26 million who came in 50 years.          Now the other reason this was a time of change in America the indusrial revoltion. Transportation had improved. The first rail road that stopped at America this ment it would be able to be easier to move matrials and form people to move. The first steam ships where first invented and the steam powered redsign of the printing press was invented which made books less expensive. Now news were available to more people. People learned more about the world around them and being able to go places far away more quickly they moved more than ever. These resons are often refered to as pushes and pulls pushes make people leave or abandon there home pulls make people want to go to that place.Some pulls where jobs, wealth, oppertunties, acess to recources and precived freedoms. Some pushes were harsh enviroment, wars other conflicts, and poverty. When people from other counrnties got fed up with there pushes they came to America.          In 1848 gold there was a discovery along the Americian River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. He tried to keep it a secret, but cat was out of the bag and every one came to have there luck at finding gold. By January 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travlers were headed to America, and the gold rush had begun more than 70,000 travlers came in 1849. Among these Forty-Niners were 325 men from China Every year more Chinese came to find a fortune. The Chinese also came because of pushes such as conflicts property and at the time China was at war with great Britian also taxes and ect. But when people heard af tales of gold in America they quickly migrated to California Gam Saan, or gold mountian they wanted to find gold then come back to China. The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush were only the beginning. In 1850, 450 more Chinese came then there were; 2,716 in 1851, 20,026 in 1852. By 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in America, and they helped in building the first transcontinental railroad.  More than 77 percent were in California.          I hope you learned about the foundation of our fair country.

In the 1800s, workers built new technology. they did it in factories. Farmers did their work. The thing is, these jobs were done by immigrants. Most of the immigrants were Germans and Irish. The Irish wanted to farm in America because their crops failed.                Later, more people from other countries started coming to avoid hunger. The problem is, there was not enough jobs left. That is when the population doubled.

Many things such as jobs, opportunities, freedom and access to resources brought people to the United States. States. Most people came looking for jobs and wealth so with all the technological advancements the people had so much to do. There were many of opportunities for people coming.       Another major reason why people came to America was other countries didn't have their freedom and that the gold rush occurred. The people living in Europe wanted their freedom so they traveled to America and settled there where they had religious freedom. The Gold Rush also attracted many people to the western part of the United States mostly California. people were looking to get wealthy of of gold.

America is one of the few places immigrants loved to settle in.Immigrants   love America because of its Transpitation,Freedom,and the gold rush.This was a great time for America.           To begin with,Immigrants like settling in America because of the transpitation.Trains were a new part of transpirtation because the first traintrack had been built in 1896.There are also steamships that also made transpirtation a lot faster.       Next,Freedom was also a big aspect because freedom means no slaves and no slaves means Immigrants can get paid for doing jobs.(If they wanted a job).Or they can just be free and not have a job.       Also,there was a Gold Rush in 1848 in the American River on the property of a man named John Sutter.Although he wanted to keep this a secret the word got out and by January of 1849,there were 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers headed straight for California.

These people wanted to move to America because they had job options These people could have a job as build,farm, or invent things. They also neede factories and people to farm on land. They also needed people to invent things. This made people want to immigerate so they can work at something that they can do well and have been working as there whole life                                 They also had a lot of new tecchnology advances. They had technology advances that other places might not have had. They had cvome up with pushes and pulls. What a pull does is pulls things that you need back to where you lived.they also had trains so that they can get home easier.                                They can find work to do so you and your family won't starve. I don't think that anybody would like your family starving. So this was pretty helpful. You can get a lot of diffrent types of jobs. This is why people immigrated.

For example , there were many wars back at the time and many people were losing their own lives. Also because some people were also losing their jobs and dieng of starvation .Many places were also running out of food and trying to move to America to avoid starving to death.                    In  the 18oo's many people started to come to America from many parts of the world including Russia , Sweden, Denmark, Italy , Poland, and Hungary .There were also new technology which ment there were more jobs to offer . In Europe the population was between 1750 and 1850 and many of those extra people started to starve and lose their jobs . So many people from Europe decided to move to America to have a much better life than the had at Europe .Since Ireland was running out of food almost the whole population decided to move to America.                     Many countries went through many rough times and most of the  people that lived in those countries felt that the only way to leave their problems was to move to America . Inconclusion , many people moved to America to escape their problems and to live a much better life than where they  lived before and to find a job and to avoid hunger.

Germans where the largest group to move and the Irish was right next to them.They wouldn't stop coming because the Irish where desperate from all their crops where failing.Later, once there was a great food shortage more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Many started coming from European countries, but others came for religious freedom. Then over a 50 year period there where over 26 million immigrants where in America. Now in the second half of the 1800's begins with the new inventions and progress of the immigrants. They now made transportation so much easier like the train. It got people everywhere so much faster.Same with print and press. It was a tool for newspapers and just paper.Some of the reasons why other immigrants from Russia and others was to escape the persecution and mutiny.   Now we are getting into the part where there was an amazing rush for a very valuable mineral or rock.It was at the time of the Gold Rush.It was first discovered in 1848 along the American River in California.When someone couldn't keep his mouth shut spilled thew news that there had been gold in the river, and a whole lot of it.More than 70,000 people came to America in 1849. Among all these people there was 325 Chinese people at the time.Some where coming to escape poverty and conflicts all the time.The government raised taxes in china and farmers had to sell their land just to survive.People felt hopeless from the tales of gold across the pacific ocean.Soon California was named 'Gold Mountain'. The 325 of the Chinese was only the start.Then they came in greater numbers. 2,716 in 1851. and so on. By 1870, there where 63,000 Chinese immigrants in the United States.They helped a great part in railroads although only 77% are found in California.

Most immigrant groups moved to America because of the great changes going on. For example, there was the factories. Which ment more jobs for poor people. Or even rich people.         When the American Civil War happened one-fourth of the entire population of Ireland moved to America! As you just saw, some people moved to America when wars start up. Like in the passage 'Moving to America' it said that the Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops died. The potato died off worst, but all of the crops were gone.         Other immigrants came for religious freedom. The people of Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews probably came because they were mistreated for their beliefs in their home country. Still though other people came because wars can be unstable and unpredictable.

For a place to stay or a new life or a new start.  People came to America because thy want to escape a war or from a harsh climate or a really mean leader. Many people come here for a reason. they go on a boat (because planes weren't invented yet.) and take their family to the state we know today.                                 changes in America: the 'pushes' and 'pulls' for immigrants          When immigrates came here to America there was some bumps in the rode while move moving. Like in south Italy they suffer of high birth rates and farming losses. And in Europe they escape form the harsh climate.There was few pulls to this problem.Like a fresh start for a new life.                                                 gold rush! Chinese move to California                                    In 1849 a lot  people came to California to find gold. By the time china found out they set out to find gold for wealth. they called California gam saan or 'gold mountain' in Chinese. More than 325 Chinese join the gold rush. some people made companies to get gold because they use them as money.

Most people wanted jobs and those were slaves or were treated badly wanted there, freedom. Many immigrants wanted to start new life. They tried to look for good farm land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Most immigrants were not wealthy and had little. So they thought maybe if they went to America they would get wealthier. That is why there were so many immigrants moving to a America during the gold rush. To pan for gold was the best source to get wealthy in that time period.people came to work in America and find work ,mostly for good pay. Some like Jews were mistreated and wanted freedom so they came to America.They also wanted to find good pieces of farm land to start new life.most good pieces of farm land were expensive and were hard to find so they did little with what farm land they could afford                                                                                          the reasons immigrantscame to america were wealth,work,farmland and freedom.They got there wealth from gold searched for jobs bought farmland,those who wanted freedom got there freedom granted.Those who searched for wealth dug for gold and America was great for starting new life                                                                                                                                                                                                            	WRB DT NNP VBD TO NNP NNP VBD TO NNP IN JJ JJ VBN NN , CC DT JJ NNP NNP NNS VBD NNS CC DT VBD NNS CC VBD VBN RB VBN EX , NNP NNP NNS VBD TO VB JJ NNP NNP VBD TO VB IN JJ NN NNP NNP NNS VBD RB JJ CC VBD NNP NNP PRP VBD RB IN PRP VBD TO NNP PRP MD VB NNP NNP VBZ WRB EX VBD RB JJ NNS VBG TO DT NNP IN DT NN NNP TO VB IN NN VBD DT JJS NN TO VB JJ IN DT NN JJ NN TO VB IN NNP CC VB NN , RB IN JJ NNP NNP IN NNP VBD VBN CC VBD NN IN PRP VBD TO JJ RB VBD TO VB JJ NNS IN NN NN TO VB JJ JJ JJ NNS IN NN NN VBD JJ CC VBD RB TO VB RB PRP VBD JJ IN WP NN VBP PRP MD VB DT NNS VBD TO VB RB JJ , NN , NN CC JJ NN EX NN IN NN VBD IN NNS VBD NN , DT WP VBN VBP VBN EX NN NN WP VBD IN NN NN IN NN CC NNP VBD JJ IN NN JJ NN	1		20131023101009	2367	2		20131023101008	2363	0		20131025151050	2483	1

They  to traveler to different places.The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1896. It meantthat it would become easier and easier to move resource like silver and lumber from the West to the East. The people did not like the way they were treated.

They came because of better business oppritunities. Germans made up the biggest percentage of the immigrants. The second biggest group was the Irish. One-fourth of the population came to America. Millions came after and during the war. Most Europeans came to America to find better business, and to avoid starvation. Others came to be able to freely practice religion.                 With so many more people coming, America's industrial business improved. There was easier ways to transport silver and lumber. More people could travel in a faster and easier way. The first railroad was finished in 1869.                 More people means easier ways to send information. Books and newspapers were made faster. News and ideas were easier to grasp than ever. The telegraph was finished in the designing in 1844. The telephone was created in 1876. It was much easier to transport information.                 Many came to esxape harsh conditions. They would be whipped in some countries. The people would rather move to a different country than always get persecuted. Those are some of the main reasons millions upon millions of immigrants came to America.

That is what the immigrants did. Mostly Germans and the Irish were immagrants. Before the Civil War one-fourth of the population of Ireland moved to America. Irish people were desperate in Ireland there was a food shortage and crops had failed, more than 1 million people died of starvation. Later people started coming from all over to see and live in America.         Why do so many people want to live in America? It has great land, crops are doing very well, and there is alot of food. over 26 million people came to America.

There are many reasons why people traveled to America, some people came to farm, some came for safety, some came because they wanted to find work, a home, and food, and some came to seek a fortune for themselves. Many others came for religious freedom. They came from Ireland, Europe, and China by the shipload. In total, over 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. over a fifty year period.         In the second half of the 1800's, the immigrants came to America either by push, or pull. When immigrants come to America by push, it means they are coming to escape from something. Some examples of what people might want to escape are, poverty, harsh environments, wars, and other conflicts.When immigrants come to America by pull, it means that they have been drawn to something. Examples of what immigrants might be drawn to would be, jobs, wealth, opportunities, freedom, and the Gold Rush.                                                             In 1848, a man named John Stutter found gold on his property.  The word spread quickly, and soon, immigrants from all over the world were being pulled into the U.S. by the chance of striking it rich. Most of the immigrants came from China. The reason why so many traveled to California, is because taxes were being raised, and many of the people started rebellions. Since many peoples homes were no longer safe, they went to the Gold Mountain with hope. The 1800's and the early 1900's were a very important time in our history.

There are many different reasons why they came to America. People were so desperate to come to America the European countries started to come. Like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.                Well the reason why people were so crazy is because of technology. People who could farm, build, and invent things came just in time. Work needed to be done fast so all the immagrants came cause they did all that work. Germans were the biggest group of immigrants.Next were the Ireland people They were so desperate because in Ireland their crops had failed. They were so short on food more than one million people died of starvation. The reason Eurpean people came is because they needed food, homes, and jobs badly.                  Also inAmerica the industry grew big time. Once the immagrants heard that they rushed on over to America. Also transportation improved too. The first railroad that crossed the United States had finished and this was to move things like silver and lumber. People could also ride in this train too to make transportation go alot faster than it did. They also made the new steamships to make transportaion even faster.                 The most biggest reason people came to America was the GOLD RUSH. There was this guy who was named John Slutter and when he went down to the river. He seen a gold shiney thing in the shape of  nugget. John tried to keep it a secret but some how in San Francisco the word got out. So millions of people came to the river hoping to find gold and become rich. More than seventy thousand people came to America. After the gold rush happened in stead of  Gam Saan they named it Gold Mountain                  That is why a lot of people came to America. I named three of the most important things why a lot of people came to America. If you want to learn more do some resaerch of your own and get more ways people came to America.                             	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB DT NN IN NNS VBD TO NNP IN DT CD .

Irish also made the second most largest group of immigrants. One-fourth of the population in Ireland came to America. That was almost 1.7 million Irish men,women, and children. Irelend crops had failed that mede the men desprate. About 1 million people died because of food lost and starved to death.        Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger. The extra people needed food,homes, and jobs. Other came to America for freedom. Other people came to escape wars which made life uneast to live in. Most people whanted to live in America but there was not to much to offer.        As you can see life wasn't easy back then it was hard. Later in time inventions started to occur which increased their way of life. One of their inventions was the telegragh which was invented in 1844. Years later in 1876 telephones were invented. Telephones were used to comunicate with others.        Chinese immigrants had come to California in search for gold. Lots of tales were made like gold being beyond the Pasific Ocean.

There were lots of job opprtunities and there was freedom the crops were also doing well there.       Job oppourtunites        There were many immigrants moving to america because there were many job oppurtunities. There were many chinese people that went to a river in calofornia for hope of finding gold down in a gold-rich river, and many other americans came to the river for hope of finding gold. The industries were also gaining money. Many people from around the world were working at the big industries in America.       Freedom        The thing people from around the world wanted most was freedom. America was the place to go there was freedom and there was lots of money to be made. Many parts of the world didnt have freedom at this time but America had won the war for independence from Britain.       Conclusion   As you can see there many reasons why people from around the world would want to move there. There was job opportunities, freedom and America had a good army, it was protected and was a more or less rich country. These are the reasons why there was so many immigrants traveling to America.

They faced many hardships while moving to America, they had reasons why they moved to America. The pilgrims left their original country because of the hardhsips they faced over there. While coming to America, they faced lots of difficult times, but they kept going because they saw a new life and lots of money ahead of them.                      During the 1800s, people who knew how to build, farm, or invent came to America. Lots of people came to America. The Irish sent a fourth of their entire population to America. The Irish came becausde the crops had failed in Ireland and 1 million people died from starvation. Lots of people also came to Europe, and Europe couldn't feed all those people, so they had to send them away to America. Many others also came for religions freedom. Most of those people came from Holland or were Jews. About 26 million people came to America from 1860-1910.                       America had a great boost in inventions when immigrants came. America had a railrooad system for transportation to become easier. They also invented steam power and the printing press. They even made a telegraph in 1844 and a telephone in 1876. People wanted to come to America because they got jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to reasources, and perceived freedoms. They also could move away from places with harsh enviornment, war and other conflicts, and poverty.                      The Gold Rush also attracted lots of people. Gold was discovered in 1848. News spead and millions of people came in 1849. All these peopel were called 'Forty Niners.' Among them were 325 Chinese men. Every year, more Cinese men came in search for gold.                    This is how the population of America grew. 	NNP PRP RB VBD TO DT JJ NN .

Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American river. There was 31,513,000 people in the U.S.A. There are over 1000 immigrants that had tried to take over the U.S. The U.S. got payback on them. they stopped trying to take over the U.S. They gave up on trying to get more power on the U.S. The American won the immigrants lost.       The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the  beginning. the total amount of people is 63000. During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship after ship. And just in time! The exciting news about Gold Mountain spread throughout China. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. People felt hopeless and they listed closely to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before.

They also moved here because of food shortages in their countries. They also had family and village feuds in some countries. Some had floods were they lived.            The Irish faced food shortages and crop failures so many of them died. The Europeans needed food, homes, and jobs because there was not enough of them in Europe. The Chinese had family and village feuds and heard gold was found in California. The Jewish came for religious reasons because they were mistreated in other places for their religious beliefs. China couldn't produce enough food and rice to feed people when floods hit and destroyed crops. Others needed to escape war, hunger, floods, and hatred.            These are reasons why immigrants moved from their countries to be in the United States of America. This was a very good place for them to come. And that is why immigrants moved to America.

People had different reasons, but these are the main reasons they moved all over the globe to the U.S.A specifically.            Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, 1.7 million+ people came to America before and after the war. The Irish were desperate because their crops failed and because they had a food shortage, a million people died of starvation. In the later 1800s, European countries that hadn't sent many people to America before kept on coming to America. The population doubled in Europe. All the extra people needed food, homes, and jobs so they came to America because Europe didn't have enough. Other people from Holland, Poland, Russia, and Jews from Germany came for religious freedom. In total, twenty six million immigrants arrived in the United States over a fifty year period.            The second half of the 1800s was a great time of change for America. Industry grew and many new immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved, like the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. So people can move to places faster. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 made news travel faster. People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever. The harsh environment, wars, and other conflicts, and poverty drove people away. Jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms attracted people.

These countries like Italy, Poland, Denmark etc.Some others came for religious freedom, especially Jewish people, because they weren't treated nicely. In all,a sum of 26 million people came to the united states in an estimate of 50 years.                Half way though the 1800's,there was a great change in America's industry.Business was booming.Also, the transportation grew.That meant that more immigrants would come.This growth in transportation also made it easier to travel.Then, there was a important change in how quickly new spread around the world.No, I do not mean like channel 7 ABC news.Many people were either pushed or pulled to America.To be pushed to America is when a natural disaster or a man made disaster hit a town or country and they are forced to move to America.A pull is when business wealth, jobs or resources bring a person to America.                Last but not least, the California gold rush brought a lot of Chinese immigrants and a whole lot of other people from all over the world.These people were also called the Forty-Niners, who participated in the California gold rush to bring back gold, and fortune to there families.Finally, about 77% of Chinese people were in Californa.Amazing right?!

People were to work in factories, to farm and build on land, and          invent thing    2.) People starved from food shortage causing 1 million people to die    3.) The Chinese Government increased taxes, due to that farmers couldn't         afford to pay the taxes so they took their land away, so their were not much rice to         feed the people    4.) People went to the California Gam Saan to join the gold rush    5.) Southern Italians suffered High birth rates and farming losses    6.) Some people moved to America for freedom    7.)Crops were destroyed by floods    8.) People came to escape wars                                                     Why People Moved to America in the 1800's       People have their reasons for moving to America. Germans had to work in factories to farm, build on land, and invent things. There was lack of food so people died from starvation. Jews were mistreated due to their beliefs in their home countries.The Chinese government increased taxes so some farmers couldn't pay taxes so they had to sell their land away, due to that they couldn't feed the people.When they lost hope they went to the California Gam Saan to join the gold rush.Southern Italians suffered  high birth rates and farming losses due to the lower prices.Some people didn't have freedom so they went to America for freedom.Crops were destroyed by crops due to floods so the people couldn't feed rice to the people.Europeans came to America to avoid hunger and to find work.Some people left to escape wars that might cause life to be unstable and unpredictable.People came to America because of these reasons.

Before the American Civil War in the 1860s one fourth of the whole population of ireland came to America.They kept coming, during and after the war. The irish were desperare because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.   In the 2800s, people came from other European countries that had not sent mny people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Polan, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.   In totaly 26 MILLION immigrants arrive in the united states iver a 50 year period. 26 million. Most newcomers knew nothing about America. Except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted, Freedom. And a chance to work.   So, overall I think people came to America because their crops died and didn't want to die of starvation and they probably knew that America has good crops so they came to plant and live in America so they could live their happy, healthy lives.   Another reason why they came is because of wars. They wanted to get away from the wars so it wouldn't disturb their families.   The last reason why I think they came is because, they wanted freedom. They wanted fairness, freedom, and a chance to work. So they came to America. For freedom without anyone telling them what they can and cannot do so therefore I think they mostly came is because...   America has Freedom,Fairness.Good crops and are sure to make people healthy. It's their getaway from the wars that they're scared of. So they come to America, To get away from it all. They all have a chance of getting a job so they work. Not because someone is telling them what job they HAVE to have but because they just want freedom a chance to pick their own job.So they come to American, Great jobs, Great crops, Freedom, Speech, Education. America had it all.They wanted their Family to have great lives, so they chose America.

According to the text, one purpose is the condition in your homeland like for instance a stable food supply or for new jobs. For example, in ireland, the crops had failed and people died of starvation. A example of people needing jobs is that, America have more jobs because of the new inventions so people immigrant there. In other words having a lack of food will let you suffer and die of hungerness. Also if the weather conditions are bad, your body will change and get diseases that are sometimes uncureable.             Another example, is that some places like America have good transportation or other resources like paper and good weather conditions. This example means that, people who are tired of waiting a long time to go to one place to another can come to America to go to places faster. By having faster transportation, people will have more time for other needs and important jobs. Also by having good resources of paper, you can read newspapers that are printed out and lots of books.             Lastly, most of the people who immigranted to America, wanted freedom. By having freedom, people can do whatever they like and not be slaves for one another. Freedom makes people's lives happier and fun than sad or depressed.

Did you know that all the immagrants in the U.S.A that are living or that lived were either pushed or pulled by something in their lifes? Some immagrants in other countries were pushed by these situations pavorty, starvation, wars, freedom, jobs, religious beliefs and a place for good crops. Also some immagrants were pulled by these things good crops, gold, money, homes, food, freedom and goods jobs.                                 Some countries that immagrants came from were Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and Ireland. most immagrants in Europe came to find work and to avoid hunger while others came for religious freedom. Trains and other types of transportation helped immagrants to come to America too.                    Some people like the Russian Jews were escaping Europe because they were escaping persecution and prejudice, in the form of pogrims which were organized violent attacks. all immagrants hoped to have a better life in the U.S.A for themsleves and for their famalies.                    All these examples prove that all immmagrants came for a purpose to america. All immagrants have the right to be here in the u.S.A. :) 	WRB NNS .

Immigrants were needed to farm, invent, work in factories and build things like the telegraph and print newspapers.  People could also help build things like railroads.  In America there were inexpensive books and newspapers so many poor people moved here.             Another reason people moved to America is that they suffered in there old countries. Dutch people came to America because of the potato shortage.  Over one million people died in Ireland because of starvation.  Russian, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungary came to America to work and avoid hunger.  People from Holland and Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came because they were abused because of there beliefs.  Southern Italians suffered form high birth rates and farming losses because they had to sell at a lower price.             Immigrants did not just plow fields and print newspapers.  They became rich. In 1848 a man named John Sutter found gold in the American River in California.  70,000 'Forty-Niners'.  Included within thesee men you could find 325 men from China.  These Chinese people came from Guangdong a place among China's south coast.  In this country the government had raised taxes with the increased population there was hardly enough food to go around.  These Chinese people came to America to become rich and return to China rich.  Th Chinese people called California Gold Mountain, and the prospects of Gold Mountain spread throughout China.  In 1850 450 more Chinese came to America.  Then suddenly they came in grater numbers, 2,716 in 1851 and 20,026 in 1852.  Chinese played a major role in build in the transcontinental railroad though 77% could be found in California.

Immagrants also had a good chance of getting a job since there were many jobs available.Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's.     Irish came because they were deserate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop.There was a food shortage.More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland In the later 1800's people from other Europeans countries that had not sent many people to America before.The population of Europeans doubled between 1750 and 1850.All those extra people needed food,homes, and jobs-and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe.Many Europeans came to America to find work and advoid hunger.Others came for religious freedom.     The second half of the 1800's was a time of great change in America.Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores.Transportation improved.The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869.This meant that it became easier and easier to resources like silver and lumber from West to the East.People could travel on these trains too.

Another reason why people came to the US was to get away from the wars and the harsh envierment. For example in China their main crop rice failed because of the harsh conditions, so people started moving to North America to find a better life.   They also moved because of the increase of the population in many countires leaving many people jobless. Because of this they heard about the oppertunities in the United States and the access to resources around them. My last reason is when they created steam boats and railroads the transportation was easier and safer to get to the United States so everyone now wanted to travel because of the oppertunity that was put in front of them. Those are some reasons why imagrants moved to the US.

They were needed to work in the factories,  to farm and build land, and to invent things .immigrants did all that. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. In the 1800s  people started coming from other European countries that had not had sent many people to america before. this includes Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark, sweden, and hungary.       others came from religious freedom. these included people from holland, and Jews who came from germany, poland, and russia jews were often mistreated for their belifs in there homes and countries. still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. in total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in there united states  over  a 50 year period. think about that 26 million! most newcomers knew very little about america  exept that it was a land of freedom and a chance of work.  the second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in america. industry grew and many immigrants arrived.       The first railroad was completed in 1869 it was the railroad that was the first that crossed United states . travelers now could catch a train to take them to a boat. a trip tp america in earlier times would have taken months, but now steamship could make a trip faster.

In the 1800's people from all over the world came to America for good fortune, but never got it.  People also wanted to get away from their past life and start all over even they don't get what they wanted they have so many chances to start all over. Most importantly they can still live their life in their own way.          Germans, Jewish, Europeans, Irish, and Asians came to America for wealth, freedom, or a chance to work.  In the 1860's the American Civil War took place and still people cam to America before, after, and during the Civil War took place.          About 26 million immagrants came to America in the1800's.  Anybody who wanted to start a new life came to America.          In 1848, the American Gold Rush started and now everybody came to America just to get a little gold so they can take care of their families.  Soon the people had no money to care for their families and their past life became their new life all over again.

They had plenty of work to do because of all the new technology. Some of the jobs they had to do were work in new factories, farm and build on land and invent things.              There was many different religions and countries that had come to America. Some of the countries that moved for religious freedom was Holland, Germany, Polland, and Russia. Others came for wealth opportunities with gold. A total of about 26 million people came to the USA over about a 50 year period.               In the middle of the 1800's was the time that changed the most. Factories grew and many immagrants came to the USA. Lots of transportation inproved, as did comunication. The first railroad that crossed the US was completed in 1869. The telegraph was invented in 1844 and the telephone was invented in 1876. The second half of the 1800's was a great time of change in America.               Gold was discovered in 1848, in Sutters Mill. More thn 70,000 hopeful people arrived at America. The men were called the forty-niners, because of the year. only 325 Chinese workers were sent from China, but more and more were sent each year. Lots of excitement spred through China during the Gold Rush. 77% of the country was founde in California.                   These are some of the reasons lots of things changed in America. Lots of things were invented that helped change the US.

But before we have some fun I have to ask a couple of questions!            1. Did you that California was the biggest place to gold mine in the 1800's?            2. Have you ever done research on America?            3. Did you know that people came from everywhere to live here? (even from china)            4. Did you know that Germans made up up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's?            5. Did you know that before the Civil War in the 1860s one fourth of the whole population came from Ireland?                         The America is so old it is crazy but no one discovered it until the 1800s. But in the Americas many good things have happened any many bad things have happened too. Some good things would be the gold rush. The finding of America!! I could go on and on and on but I'm not because I do not have all day. But some of the bad things are the great depression, all the hardship. Again i could on all day but I'm not. So anyways The America is a very amazing place!

They have a big culture in America.Some of the 26 million immigrants arrived in America. It stated about a 50 year period. The seconds half came in the 1800s. They had a great change in America. The first Railroad crossed into America was in 1869. Thats a big difference. From place to place most prople took a train that brouyght them into America. In 1860 31,513,000 people lived in America. In 1910 92,407,000 people lived in America. The popilation grew alot from the 1860s to the 1910s.

People from european countries are coming to america.            The immagrants are coming for specific reasons and those reasons are called the ''pushes'' or''pulls''.The pushes is what drove the immagrints from their home like from being in wars. The pulls are what made them want to come so bad like wanting to become wealthy.these are why so many immagrints came.                 Gold was discovered in california in 1848,by a man named john sutter on his land. many people heared the news and thought that this was amazing.So they decided to go to the land and start digging.The chinese where hoping to get a boat load of gold from here so they came down to california. Most of them was tring to escape proverty so they came to california to find some gold.            Thier was an amazing numbetr of immigrants from everywhere to come to americ. Some  even took railroads to get their.Many heared about america through the news paper.       In conclusion, immagrants traveled and heared about america and came.

People from Germany, Ireland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary were some of the many immigrants who came to America hoping to seek a new life. Immigrants came for the land, food, people, jobs, or maybe even just to get away from disasters.       In the 1800s, the two largest groups of immigrants who came to America were from Germany and Ireland. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group, one-fourth of the people from Ireland came to America. They kept coming during and after the Civil War. In the later 1800s, more people from Europe arrived to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Other immigrants came for religious freedom like the Jews.       The second half of the 1800s was a time of great changes for America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived. American transportation improved after the first railroad was built. It became easier to travel and to ship resources to other places. There was also a rapid change in how quickly messages traveled. Steam power and the redesigning of the print press made it possible to print books and newspapers. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 was also a big improvement.       In 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in California and hundreds of people set for the American River. By January, ships of thousands of travelers were heading for California.   Many of the people hoping to strike it rich were Chinese immigrants. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States but 77% of them were in California.       Many immigrants have traveled to America in the 1800s. But that doesn't mean that there won't be anymore. More immigrants will travel to America and our technology will improve.

So they came at a perfect time,they would have plenty to do in America. The Germans were the largest group of people that would  immagrent to the U.S. The other countries came because of the Civil war in the 1860s. America was the safest place to go.                             The Irish came because the crops started to fail and they had nothing to eat. America had better life environment and had more food to eat than Ireland and Ireland was in a  bad place and had a civil war going on. Later in the 1800s European people started to come to America that was like Italy and Poland and around that area.Others came for religious reason or they had religion laws in there countries.         Then the Jews and the Germans came to immanent in America they also didn't like that there was no work in there countries. Then Russia and Poland came too. They came because they wanted to believe in a different religion. And they couldn't find any work.                 In total there was over 26 million agreements now in America. they all came to America because where they came from it was different and was a bad place. It was a 50 year period that they came in. All they wanted was freedom and to work.                I think that all of the countries and different race people came to America because you are free to what you want to do.You also get rights and believe in what you want to believe in. There is also a lot of work to do in the U.S. It wouldn't be hard to get a job because there was a lot back in that time.

The immigrants were people who left their homes in different places and moved to America, but why did they do that?                   Some of the immigrants moved to the U.S. for religious freedom like the pilgrims came from England. Others came to build homes, farm crops, or to invent something.              Some of these people came for the items that were invented in America. Other came to get away from the harsh environment or to build their home and farm in the fresh soil.                    One other reason that they came is for the gold in tunnels like the 'Forty-Niner'. Well, in 1860, 31,51300 people were in America, then in 1910, 92,407,000 people were in the U.S.                   Today, there are more people coming to America.

I beat early poptropica in less than five minute's.   in poptropica you can win games against friends and befriend poptropicans. the more friends you have the easier the islands are. some islands are hard but they get easier all the time. if you have beaten a island and you lose your password. you can make another account and do it again. when you do it again it is easier to beat.

America is only one place out of seven continents.' Well, America provided freedom, new opportunities, transportation, food, and so much more. Other countries had their own problems such as poverty, land, religion and other reasons to leave to an amazing place. During the 1800's, it was not an easy time to live.       In Europe, times were hard like taxes going up, poverty, religion and other reasons to live. In America, new technology was developing making transportation easier. In 1848 gold was discovered and people wanted gold to start new lives, to pay taxes and use the gold.        America gave immigrants a chance to start a new life and to live a better one.

All in all, there are many reasons why immigrants came to the U.S.A. and why they left their homes.

I would like to recognize stories of immigrants who immigrated over the last 200 years. Several facts and information will be explained why immigrants immigrated to America in the following article.        During the 1800s, many immigrants immigrated to America to escape slavery, finding opportunities, and religious cultures. Before the American Civil War in the 1800s, one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. Ireland crops had failed, especially potato crops, which caused more than one million people starve. In the later 1800s, people started to come to America to find jobs, avoid hunger, find homes, and find opportunities. Other immigrants came for religious freedom that included Holland and Jews. In total, over  26 million immigrants arrived in America over a 50 year period. This information would explain why immigrants immigrated to America.        The secong half of the 1800s was a great time in America because their industries grew and many immigrants arrived in the U.S. As industries improved, transportation improved as well. Many workers completed the first railroad that crossed the United States at 1816, which caused to attract many immigrants to travel to America. Also, this meant that it was easier to move food stocks, lumber, and other resources. Travelers now could catch a train to America or ride a boat. Soon the population of America rapidly changed and widely information traveled. Steam power was soon invented and the printing press made it possible to print inexpensive books. Then, people became aware that they could get jobs, wealth, opportunities, and develop resources. Some immigrants fro Europe wanted to escape harsh conditions and moved to America. Russian Jews left there homes to  escape prejudice and persecution. There are much more reasons why immigrants immigrated to America, but these some main reasons why.        Soon, gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California by John Sutter. Sutter kept his discovery a secret, but the word soon got out that gold was discovery. Other parts of the world found out that gold was discovered in San Francisco in California, so people quickly reached California to find wealth, which caused the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush was mostly involved with the Chinese. The Gold Mountain stories were spread throughout China and caused the Chinese to join the Gold Rush. As the Chinese arrived at California, the population of California increased by 77% and most of them were Chinese. When time passed, the population of America multiplied from 1860 to 1910 and as a result about 92,407,000 people lived in America at 1910. In the following years people wondered how immigrants ended up living in America, well these are some reasons why they are.        In conclusion, many immigrants had different reasons why they immigrated to America, well they may wanted freedom, wealth, or even jobs. As conclude my essay on why immigrants immigrated to America, people had tough choices to go through whether immigrating to another country or staying.

This is called immigration. They came here for many reasons such as for farming land, building and to invent new technology. A lot of the people also came here for the telephone, trains, and motor boats. Some people came here to get away from a drought or any natural thing.                          It could be to give their family a better life by getting a good job. Pushes are things that push people away like to many people or not enough food or not enough jobs for every one so thay can make money for food and to support their families. Pulls are things that pull people in like trains, jobs, food, or any thing you would want. Some people immigrate a lot because of work or other things. Immigration is when you leave one country and come to another its kind of like moving a long ways away.                           In 1860 there was 31,513,000 people in the US. In 1910 there was 92,407,000 people in the US. In 1860 there were 30,626 miles of rail road. In 1910 there was 240,293 miles of rail road. This is because of people immigrating and building.

It explains how they lived in the 1750s-1850s. With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do once they were shipped to the U.S. Source #1 mostly gives information on how the immigrants lived once the came to the U.S in the 1800s.         Source #2 gives information on how the immigrants advanced and found better ways to transport goods and ideas from place to place. It also tells about how and why immigrants moved from place to place. They moved from place to place because they had opportunities or jobs in other places.

Well, lets start with the conditions in the home land.  Depennding on the country, the conditions there  were not the best. people were injured because of their beliefs and some country just simply ran out of food. A good example of the country that experienced a major famine was Ireland.  what happen is that their main crop, the potato, started to stop growing, which means a major supply of Ireland food was cut off.  This resulted in as much as 1.7 million Irish to move to America.   OK, we see that immigrants moved to America because of conditions in the homeland, but did anything else persuade them to move here?                                         Yes! job opportunitys played a big role in immigrants moving here. not least of which being the great Californian gold rush, which, resulted in over 70,000  asains moving here for gold.   Not only did the prospect of making millions in gold get people to move here, but the railroads did too. 63,000 of those 70,000 came to work on the transcontinantal railroad.  good, we have seen the gold, railroads, and  homeland conditions have persuaded people to come here, but has anything else?                       Again, we say yes, other things have influenced immigrants making the decsion to move here. One big one was religous freedoms. An example of peopel moving becasue of thier beliefs was russian jews, who were mistreated becasue of what they believed in.            In conslusion, we  see that  homeland conditions, the prospect of gold, and other things have influenced immigrants moving to america. now, i leave you, and hopefully you have been entertained and have hopefully learned something.

People who could build farms or ivent ships.Germans and Irish people were the largest group.Before the American Civil War one fourth of the whole population came to America. States were free on those times there was war and those who lived by left their country to protect their chieldrens. In the later 1800 people started comming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. By that time there were other religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total , some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over 50 year period.       The second half of the 1800 was a time of great  change in America. industry grew and many immigrants arrived on Americas shores. Those were hard times for immigrants to get jobs, money, or homes. So they used trains to travel all around to find a place to live. They became poor and finished everything they had done by that time they never finished what they started on. From those times now their was pulls and pushes. Pulls are those feutures of life that attract people.Many European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States. These advances in transportations made it possible for more people to travel more easily.       Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. The gold got more valiable during time everything became hard to find while they waste things. Now China had a full of gold and was the first one to. The gold rush started at China.It made alot of immigrants come to China just for gold. Alot of them were their helping ,but they thought they were gonna be able to get gold and leave with it. Intead they just got way less than what a piece of gold cost.

And that was a nother reason that the American populat got larger,becasue so many people came form diffrent places and not just 50 people it was like thousands and thousands.And the gold wasent the only thaing that made them leave, it was hunger and war. Many Eurpons  left becasue of hunger and that they didn't have many jobs so they came to Aemrican to have jobs,food,and freedom. The Chianesse left because thaey wated a better live and hearing bout the 'Gold mountains ' they thought that having gold they could pay for land and have a better live stock. Wicth did happen, A nother resaon was they were in war aginst Britten and they also wanted freedom. Jews left from Germany because they wanted to have freedom alos, because they were being mistreaded for their beliefts in their home countries.

The people are going to America because for gold and richness.Travelers now could catch a train that would take then right to a boat.The reasons they moved are often characterized as pushes and pulls. The gold rush was a big thing. Families moved to the united states just for gold. People called California Gam Saan, or gold mountain. To them it seemed a land of unbelievable richness,        Many of the European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe.Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of programs organized violent attacks. So lots of people are traveling to America in earlier times would have taken month, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States. 	. WRB VBD DT NNS VBD TO VB TO NNP .

You may have heard the saying 'Home is where the heart is', but sometimes home can be the situation instead of the solution.                Your parents always want the best for you. That's why some immigrant parents move away from their home countries. During the 1800s, parents immigrated to give their children or families a better, brighter future. Another reason is poverty. They wanted to be able to live and survive, so they moved for jobs.            In some countries family is the only thing that matters because that's all they have. Some immigrants left to escape war and bloodshed. When people from other countries invade, they usually don't care about your beloved; the immigrants wanted to protect their loved ones. Freedom is the gift they wanted to give to the many generations of children to come.                In order to provide for your family, you need money. To receive money you must work hard to earn it. You also need money to escape poverty, which is what many immigrants intended to do for their family. In order to provide a home and food, you need to work. In some of the countries, there was a scarce that drove them to the U.S. to work for the finer things in life.                Immigrants needed a better life. They came to America so they could survive and strive in society.

In America there are many different people of all shapes and sizes, but there are people who didn't grow up in the United States like some of us. Those people are called immigrants.            A long time ago in the 1800s there were immigrants who were coming to America to find work, food and a place for there family to stay. The reason why they came to America is because back where the lived the were being kicked out of there houses and didn't have work. Then the heard that America was the freedom country so the went to America.           There are these things called 'push' and 'pull' and a push is when something happens like you get kicked out of your house. A pull is when you hear of something good and exciting and you want to go and see it. When the Chinese heard about the freedom country they came and moved to get work and food.            Then there was a gold rush in California and when people heard about it and they came from all around the world to find gold. There were more than 70,000 adventurers that came to collect gold and bring it back to there home town.             In conclusion immigrants are a big part of our world and country. If we didn't have immigrates there wouldn't be much her that is different. Immigrants make our country, our country. So if some day you are wondering about immigrants I hope you read this and learn what you want to learn.

In America the number of people is increasing.The united states of America is now famous because they hear stories about the 'Gold Rush'' and how they can become a citizen in that state right away but that wasn't true.The people that go there are obligated to work and work because they are not citizens.people do that because they know that they are citizens.As you have read people treat immigrants unfairly.                                                                                 Immigrants come to the USA because of their hope and illusions they have.For example dreamers come here because they want to make their dreams come true.People also come because of the work they think they are going to get,but in some cases they don't get a job and they are deported back to their original home.Unlike other people immigrants suffer in this new state because they don't know anyone and they don't even have food,a shelter,or their family.       Immigrant also want to give their families a better place where to sleep,a better place where to eat,and give their families clothes to wear.They want to give their families a place to sleep because maybe they live in a cramped house where only half of the family stays and the rest of the family stays outside.They want to give their family a better place where to eat because maybe they eat in the floor.They also want to give their families what to wear.They want to give their families what to wear because maybe they don't have anything to wear.As you have read immigrants want to give their family a better place where to sleep,eat,and also what to wear.       As you have read immigrants come to the USA because they want to be successful people and want to have a better life here in the USA.They also want to give their families a better life and also bring them over so that they can also get the education that maybe they didn't get as children and give then a place where to  sleep,eat,and also give them clothing to wear.As you have read they want to achieve many of their goals.

The ''pushes'' and ''pulls'' for immigrants       In the second half of 1800s their were great things happening like industry grew transprotaning improved and the first rail road that crossed the U.S was completed in 1869. this meant everthing was getting better for everybody people can come to the U.S faster and more jobs can be made.Alot of new technolgy was being made or improving more and more.Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspaper.This was crazy back then when they invented the telegraph in1844 made news travel faster.

Frist during the 1800s German, Irish and more imagrated to the United States. How they imagrated is by huge boats that took about  two mounths to get to America. But the reason why they moved is because the wars, lost of job, no land, farming is failing or just that they could have freedom.                     Then the changes that the immagrents made was a change for the people and America. The immagrents envinted trains so its easyer to travel their sources and also themselfs. But it was also hard because the pulls and pushes in life. The pushes drive people from their home. And the pulls are features that attract people such as jobs and land.                     Last is how the chinese immagrated.   How they came to united states is a vary interesting story. It was because John Sutter owened a lake but he found out that their was gold im it. He traied to keep it a secreat but it spread across America and soon to china. Chinese people wanted gold for foutune and to go back with reachness. The first who came was in 1849 and their were about 325 men, women and childrean then it multiplyed ontil their were 63000 chinesee in the United states.                     So i hope you know how your cultur became apart of the United States.

This was true in Europe also.In the 1800s there were also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled.The reason they moved are often characterized as 'pushes' and 'pulls'.Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh condition in Europe.The news spread to the rest of United States, and to other parts of the world as well.More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849.Most of this first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast.People felt hopeless and they listened closely to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean.The exciting news about Gold Mountain spread throughout China .The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning.The next year, 450 more chinese arrived in California.Then suddenly they came in greater numbers:2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852.

Germans made up the largest amount of immigrants. Beside the Germans, the Irish were the population. Before the Civil War, 1/4 of the Irish population was in America.   (that is 1.7 million Irish families with men, women, and children) In Ireland, the crops failed. Especially the potato crop. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the 2nd half of the 1800s, p-people started coming from other European countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Many Europeans came to America to avoid starvation. Others came for relkigious freedom. Like Holland, and Jews from Germany, Polland, and Russia.

They came because of pushes and pulls, or things that forced them to come, and things that lured them into coming. The pushes and pulls include harsh conditions and the finding of gold. Lots of immigrants came to the United States for these reasons!              One push reason causing immigrants to come to the United States were caused by of harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape 'organized violent attacks.' Italians went through harsh farming losses due to lower prices. Even the tradition of giving the land to the first baby boy was a mistake, since it left younger siblings landless! Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved, hoping to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States. Europeans experience harsh conditions in the 1800s.              A pull reason that attracted people was gold. After gold was discovered in 1848 by John Sutter, it attracted huge amounts of immigrants. 70,000 hopeful adventurers came to California in 1849, and 325 of those men were from China. More and more Chinese came as the years went by, hoping to strike rich. Due to this event, by the 1870s, there were almost 65,000 Chinese in the U.S. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that there were only 2,716 in 1851. Gold clearly attracted immigrants.              As you can see, immigrants settled in the United States by pushes and pulls. The Europeans were forced to by harsh conditions, while the Chinese were attracted by the chance of sudden wealth. People in the United States need to be thankful for these events, for without them, where would we be without them?                  	NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNS VBD TO DT NNP NNPS IN DT CD , CC WRB .

There were things people wanted to be a part of, and also things they were trying to escape. America was seeming better and better by the day!               Some people came here to escape from harsh conditions in their home country. For instance, as it says in 'Moving to America' by Joy Hakim, 'The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop.' This was starving the Irish people, so many of them came here for food. But food was not the only problem. From the same article, 'Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.' Many of the people moving here were mistreated in their home countries and came for freedom.               Other immigrants came here to seek wealth and happiuness. To quote an excerpt from a book on immigrants by Ronald Takaki 'Gold Rush! Chinese move to California,' 'Like the people who came from the eastern United States, the Chinese hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills.' Many people looking for money came here to California for the gold rush. Not only the Chinese, but '70,000 hopeful adventurers' settled down in California during this time.               Still more people just wanted to get a taste of everything going on in America. It helped that 'The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.' ('Changes in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants') There was now news about everything great in America travelling at high speed everywhere. 'The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America.' Who wouldn't want great change? America is starting to pull ahead insustrially, and everyone else wants a part of it.

Over 1.7 million people from Ireland left their homes to live here. There was about 200,000 more tons of coal produced in 1910 than in 1860. Between the years 1860 and 1910 America grew; a lot.           Between 1860 and 1910  travel was easier along with many other things. There were about 8 times as many miles of railroad tracks. This shows that there was a big improvement in the ease of traveling. This is important because if travel didn't get easier the west coast might not be American territory. About 9 times the number of daily newspapers existed. This shows that printing got a lot easier. This is important because, there would probably be less papers today if printing didn't get easier.       The gold rush made America grow, in a big way. The gold rush brought many people to California, 'more than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in CCalifornia in 1849.' This shows that this helped the USA grow. This is important because the US would be a very different place. Many Chinese left there homes for California, 'by 1880 there were more than 63,000 Chinese in the US.' This shows how much the gold rush made the USA grow. This is important because the Chinese are a big percentage of our population.       Over the course of 50 years America grew in many ways.  Many more resources were used in 1910 than in 1860. Over 27 million people left for America in 50 years. Europeans, Italians, Irish, Chinese, German and many more ethnic groups came to America for many resons.

In the later 1800s imigrants started to come from other eurepeian countries that had not seen america before.

This included Russia,Italy,Poland,Demark,Sweden and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs-and there just didn't  seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.        Other came for religious freedom. These included people from Holand, and Jews who came from Germany,Poland, and Russia. Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.       In total some 26 million immigrant arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Think about that 26 million!. Most of the newcomes knew very little absolute America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's whatever they wanted:freedome and a chance to work.       Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were largest immigrant group. Befor the American Civil war in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of a Ireland came  to America. That was 1.7 million Irish men, women and children. They kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of  starvation in Ireland.

There was 26 million immagrants that were fighting in war but then they lost so they had to move to a differnt place and they chose the United States of America they lost alot of people in war and they died. So this is my short story about immagrants.        On the chart in then story it says that like how many people live like the population of how many people live in the United States now. Also on that same chart it also says the number of people that lived in each city and they also new the miles of the rail road and the number of daily news papers.Other country's like china and stuff are fighting war still.That is about the chart in this paragraph.         Immagrants also got a lot of soldiers and stronger ones from United States so now they have a stronger army for war.Now for war they have over 30 million soldiers for war it is always good to have more then you need so that way you are always ready.Another thing is that they made new and better weapons and they made bombs and everything so they were ready for war.So this is another paragraph about the imagrants.       This is what I wrote about the imagrants and what they made and how their wars were.Imagrants needed more people for there next war so they wouldn't have to love California. If they lost California they would have no where to go because the land they lost and the land they have now was there only homeland.So this is my story about imagrants.They need to win in war.

The other half of the year the immigrants came to America so things changed.People had found out that the world is so big because there are better places to live.They also knew that they had the capacity to move even though its a long distance from home.The immigrants read about pushes and pulls and that persuaded them to move to another counrty.The people who were immigrants wished themself to have a better life in the United States.Chinese moved to California because they had found gold.       People felt sad and hopeless because they did not find the gold.More and more people wanted to join the gold rush.By the next year more chinese arrived to California.Immigrants did feel sad to move to other countries like the United States.They felt bad to leave there family alone and there friends.In the 1860s the chinese people went back to there home rich and happy.Atrip from one country to another had become shorter and easier for many people.       Immigrants have died because of hunger so they need money to surrvive.The money that they need to surrvive with is to buy a house and to buy food.People who came to California for the gold rush left home right away to support their family.In conclusion people that move to a different country improves their life but,they still remember what they left behind.

The immagrants needed a job so they came to America because, they had plenty of jobs for them with the new technology. Before the American Civil War 1.7 of Irish men, women, and children came to America because, their crops had failed. The immagrants from Germany, Poland, and Russia had reloigious freedom when they came to America. The total of immagrants moved to America was 26 million over a 50 year period. The first railroad biult in America was in 1869. This meant people could travel much faster. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster. The pushes drove people from their homes to poverty. The pulls are those  features of life that attract people. The pulls include jobs' wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American Riverin California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. the 'Forty-Niners' were 325 men from china. the chinese kept coming year after year. In the middle of 1800's, Guangdong was involved in two wars between Chin and Britan. There were also many rebillions against the government, and endless village and family fueds {fights}. The chinese government raised taxes. The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. The next year, 450 more chinese arrived in California. They suddenly they came in greater numbers:2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. Although they could be found throughout the country 77% of them were in California.

Like Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Others came from Germany, Poland, Russian (Jews were being mis treated for thier beliefs in thier home countries). Still others came to escape wars that made life unsuitable and unpredictable.In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period!Think about that 26 million!

Another reason, i think they moved here is because in America you can belive your religion and the ability to speak freely without worrying about getting hurt or killed by the government.They also maybe are a different skin color and are tired of racism or they want to start over in their lives.or maybe they just wanted to move to a new area in the world.       I also think alot of people came to the USA because of of the3 gold rush. This was a time where in california there was a lot of gold in an area in northern california. The people came from everywhere in search for the gold. They even left their familys to go find some gold!

After the war of german more people keapt on comming. Their was food shortage. More than 1 million of people died of starvation in Ireland.

Immigration is a big thing for all over the world.One reason is because people that are good at building or invent immigrate to another country to get more opportunities.                                And for the inventors it was good in the 1800's because they just invented new technology,so other people can advance that and make it more helpful for other people.They worked on what they can do to make things better.For example they improve factories and make more projects to make farming easier.                 But it wasn't only good for the inventors it was good for the people that built too.They paid them to built buildings and farms.People paid them to built anything they wanted.Well not everything.                Did you know that the Germans made up the largest group of immigrants!Well now you know.The second largest group of immigrants was the Irish.                One-fourth of the population of Ireland moved to America before the American Civil War in 1860's.But it doesn't mean they didn't come after the war.They did.People moved out of Ireland because the crops there had failed.The one that more failed was the potato crop.About 1 million people died of starvation.                Later in the 1800's,people started coming from other European countries that hadn't been to America before . They came from Poland, Denmark, Italy, Russia, Sweden, and Hungary.This made the population of Europe double during 1750 and 1859.This people came to another country like every immigrate.They came for foods, homes, jobs, and sometimes for religious freedom.About 26 millions immigrants came to the U.S.A in that time.                 People also immigrate to California for the Gold Rush.People found gold in the American River  in California.They found it in John Sutter property .Suddenly everyone from all over the world immigrated to California.More than 70,000 people came in 1849.And 325 of them were mens from China.More people from China came.               As you can see people immigrate a lot from all over the world.And you might do it in the future.I know i did all ready.

Some because the hardships of war made them leave. Others because farmers couldn't pay taxes and lost all thier land and crops. But most were because of the Gold Rush, the Gold Rush attracted many people to America,14 million people traveled to America.                     First reason people moved to America is because the war made many people from Poland,Italy,Denmark,and even Russia move from thier homes. The reason for this is then Jews weren't allowed,if they were found they would be relocated. So that caused many Jews to be smuggled out of their state or home and head for America. Life with freedom was what those people wanted so they went to work and some achieved and some failed.                     Next, people moved to America because there was a food shortage. Crops had failed. Or the farmers did not pay taxes and got everything taken away. Which caused people to leave to America.                      Then people moved to America because of the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush made nearly 14 million people came to America for one reason GOLD! People from all over the world came mostly China. The Gold Rush made the population skyrocket. A whole lot of newspaper articles and and visits happened. People came to get rich and lve rich for a long time. The '49ers' kept digging and digging. John Sutter (the owner of the property) tried to keep  it a secret but it didn't work out. Word got out and it was a new place to go.                      In conclusion, people moved to America for three reasons. The war that caused Jews to leave. The crops or taxes that leave farmers with hunger. In the end the Gold Rush was the main reason for immagration. All in all many people came to America for thier own reasons.

I think I know why! People migrated to America to look for jobs, reduce their hunger, and have a better community. During the 1800's there was 31,513,000 people who lived in the U.S. I'm guessing probably half of that are immigrants from other countries. People who have migrated to America had a better life for them and for their families.                 My first reason why I think people moved to America is because of low food source in their country. They said one fourth of the population in Ireland moved to America. Their reason why is because of hunger! The crops they harvest in Ireland have failed and there was only a little bit of food. It also stated that more than 1 million people died because of HUNGER! Now you know why people moved to America during the 1800's.                 An addition to my first reason, people came to America because of decreasing job offers. In the 1800's there was a lot of job offerings! A few of them were working in factories, farming, and to invent things. Many of the immigrants did all of that just to provide their families. Mostly Europeans came to America just to avoid all the hunger they have been through and all their sufferings. All of that came to an end because they migrated to America.                 Lastly, people moved to America for a better community. If you were them, would you want to live in a place where danger is? Obviously, I don't, so why would they? All they want to do is keep their families safe from danger. That is why they moved to America! Now do YOU know why people migrated to America during the 1800's?                 I have stated what I think the reasons are on why people moved to America during the 1800's. Now think, what are the real reasons why they moved? Once again, the immigrants moved to America because they were looking for jobs, reduce their hunger, and have a better community!

If you have you were lucky.   In the 1800s people who could build, farm, or invent things came to America. America had new technology in the 1800s. There was plenty for them to do. they were needed to work in factories, farms,building, or inventing.                    The Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants. The Irish were the largest immigrants group. Before the American Civil War 1/4 of Ireland came to America. They kept coming before and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland there crops had failed. There food was short. More than millions of people died of hunger.                    The second half of the 1800s was a great change in America. The industry grew and immigrants arrived on the shores of America. The transportation improved. the  first railroad crossed the United States.

Transportation would be improving day by day. The even started to build a railroad that crossed the United States and was completed in 1869. News traveled by the telegraph made in 1844 and the telephone made in 1876.         In 1848, gold was discovered along the American River in California. It was in the property of a man named John Sutter. Sutter tried to keep it a secret, but the word reached San Francisco and the population started to migrate to the American River. That is when the California gold rush began. In 1849, more than 70,000 people were in California searching for an amazing discovery.         During the late 1800s other European's were migrating from their country. These was the Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary people. Between 1750 and 1850 the population of Europe was starting to double. All of those people needed jobs, home, and food. Many of those Europeans came to avoid hunger and fins jobs. Other Europeans came for freedom. Those people were from Holland, and Jews who were from Germany.         With all of the technology they have created, there was plenty of things to do. Some either worked in new factories, farmed, built on land, or invented new things. All of the immigrants did that. Before the war in the 1860s, 25% of the whole population of Ireland came to America.         There were about 26million immigrants in the United States in a 50 year period! And finally, in 1910 there ended up being 92,407,000 people living in the U.S.!

Better lives. People have moved on in search of better lives and they found it here. Some people may be looking for work or others for food. But America is where they came to start over and live better lives.       One very important reason why people moved to America was in search for work. And that is what they found! America just found new technology for them to work on. New factories, they could even be farmers, builders or even inventors. Places like Europe needed work and homes and food because their population grew and there wasn't much to do but leave. S they left and found work in America. They came just in time to work on bridges for easier transportation. America was their chance for work and freedom.        Food is important for people too. It fuels us and gives us nutrients! Not many people had food where they lived, sadly. So, they moved to America to find something to fill their bellies. Some places, like Ireland for example, were stuck with soggy crops due to floods. They moved to America to grow food on farms. Luckily, they found the food they needed to live. Poor immagrants hoped to find a better place to live in for themselves, and their families.       One day, a man named John Sutter found gold in 1848 along the American River in California. He kept this as a secret but the word spread that gold was found in California. Soon, The whole country knew and to other countries. Once people knew, they packed up there things and headed for California to find gold and riches. China was one of the countries that found out and they headed for California as soon as they heard. Lots of the Chinese came because they wanted to escape poverty and conflict. The Chinese came in greater numbers to particpate in the Gold Rush. Many of the Chinese could be found throughout the U.S. but 77% of them were in California. The Gold Rush improved the lives of many and changed history greatly.       Overall, people from all over the world came to the U.S and just because of gold. They were in search or food, work, homes, and freedom. And that is exactly what they found. America is the ever changing, ever growing country and is perfect for people who want to find better lives.

In the chart below in the essay, in 1860 over 31 million people were in the US.  In 1910, there were over 92 millionv people in the US.  A huge change in the population; right?       In source 1, people came ship after ship to America.  With all of the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do.  Some people came for religios freedom.(ex. Jews).  About 26 million immigrants came to the US!       In source 2, transportation improved.  this meant transporting idems were easier.  and traveling was easier.       In source 3, the Chinese moved to California for the gold rush.  Over 70,000 people arrived in California for the gold rush!       In source 4, it`s a chart showing the American population.

Many people were starving, cold, over crowed, needed work, or just thought it was better here. Some people got away from judgmental people and poverity. Most of the time when they arrived, it was already better. They just had to keep their head up.        Like people in Ireland, failing crops and starvation were normal to them. Some people wanted to get away form all of that. Almost 1 million people died during this time. So most families left to help them or their children.       Something drove people away from their home country and somethings pulled them to America. Russian Jews wanted to get away from attacks, prejudice, and persecution. It all pulled them away from their home. Some people knew there was wealth, land, and better opportunities for them and pulled them to America for the better.       People in China, liked in poverity and hunger filled towns. They heard about the gold rush and took the next ship over. They earned jobs building railroads and working in factories. They took the hard, but little jobs that were needed to make the country run. 	IN PRP VBD DT JJ , CC JJ NN TO DT NNP NNPS , JJ NNS VBD DT NN CC NNP NNP .

It would be hard to leave my family and friends, The boat ride would be terrible and it would be hard to find a job or home once you got to america.      I believe it would have been hard to move to america back then because you had to leave family and friends behind. It would be hard because you did not have phones or anything like hat so you could never see or talk to them again. Also people did not live as long back then because of all the diseases.        On the boat ride thier you would get sick and it would be harsh. it is way different from today because you can just hop on a plane. but back then you had to get on a boat with all the diseases and nothing to eat but old and rotten things. The water was not good ether. It was salty which meant it would only make you thirstier. Plus it was very nasty and dirty because they could not clean thier water.        Once you got to america it would be hard to find a nice job and  home. If you meved for the gold rush it wuld be very hard to fing any there fore you would go bankrupt. The best thing to do when you got there was be an auntripinuer. You could also live with your family you have there untill you got your house and job, if you had any family there.        Now you can se why i would not move. I would not leave my friends or family, tthe boat ride would be terrible, and whe you got there it would be very difficult to find a jod or house.

Most of them were needed to work at all the factories,since in the 1800's they had invented new technology. The Irish and the German were the biggest immigrant groups. One fourth of the group were migrated to America. The Irish migrated over to America because in Ireland their food was rotten,      Most of the Irish migrated to America because of a food shortage. Their crops were getting destroyed and there was no way to grow them anymore, so because of that many people, even over 1 million, died because there was no food to eat! Others from Ireland and Germany migrated because they were to work in the factories.      Chinese people started migrating to California because they heard about gold! Someone named John Sutter had owned a river filled with gold.He wanted to keep it a secret but the word got out. Someone found out about it and told about it. Everyone started to migrate to California for gold. People were able to get gold and now the river is known as the Gold Rush..                                           Some other immigrants went to California because they hoped they would get good fortune if they went over there. More than70,000 people went over there. Only 325 were Chinese out of 70,000. They were known as '' Forty-Niners''. They believed that a good fortune was waiting for them up at California hills.      If it wasnt for these immigrants, America would have never been invented. I am glad that i have learned about the history of America and the immigrants. Today i learned a lot about them and I hope to learn more some day.

With all the better technology in the 1800's you could do more. People needed to work in factories or farms for money. Others came for there religious freedom. Jewish people were always not treated well because of beliefs in their countries.     People started to be aware of the world and that they could travel easier. They moved a lot because people were struggling. Many of these elements were made worse by a rapid increase in the number of people in Europe. It includes jobs, food, and money.     More  than 70,000 adventurers arrived in California in the 1800's. Among these people were 325 men from china. More people from china started coming. The Chinese people believed to find a fortune.     People started to feel hopeless. They started to listen closely to peoples story's about gold. To them it seemed a land of richness.     A total of 26 million immigrants came to the united states over a long 50 year period. A lot of the people didn't know very much about America. They liked America because it was a land of freedom.

Ships were sailing people were moving just to get to a safe place. They had to build farms, Factories on the land around them.  European countries that had not sent many people to America before.              The number of people in America had tripled from the year 1860-1910. In the 1800s people were dieing cause of sickness, lack of food an money. All of those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs-and there was`nt enough of them in America so they went to America.             More than 70,000 hopefull adventures arrived in california in 1849. Among these ''Forty-Niners' were 325 men from china. more chinese came the next year. Like the people  who came the eastern united states, the chinese hoped to find fortune wating for them in the califronia hills.             people felt hope less and they listend closely to tales of gold beyond the pacific ocean. they called california gam saan, or '' gold mountain.''

The immigrants build and invented thousands of new things.The irish people keep on coming and coming, even when war was still at battle.     Billions and billions came and the land was all taken. Then in Ireland 1 million died of starvation.The popaulation in Eroupe started to double. People needed jobs, food, and even homes ,but there wasno room to fit that much people.     Thats when Europeans decided to come to America and find what they were looking for that they couldnt buy or get in Europe. Some people wanted to live in a religous land. Some people also survied the war and they lived on the land that they could find. Immigrants came to the Untied States over a 50 time of period.         Most of thyem didnt know much about America. They only knew that they had a land of freedom. Then time flew by and then pepole started to live on the shore. People could also travle from trains from place to place in a different way besides sailing in ship.     Usings ships took a lot longer than a train does. If people used the trian it would be easier and faster to travle. People became more satasfied with the world with all its transportation that got much better and easier than the world could ever imagine. Thats when the 'pushes' and the 'pulls' were invented, like the car pushed you some were and the housed pulled you to it. The Italians were suffing from high birth  birth rates.

There was a food shortage  in Ireland because many crops had failed. They also came because they were desperate.            Some Europeans came because of harsh conditions.

People from the country of Ireland mainly left their country because of the huge amount of Irish people staving. Plus one million people died of starvation in Ireland. They were very low with crops ans that is what caused it. The other people of Eroupe were pushed becuse the needed food and shelter, and they did not have it where they were. This includes the countries of Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Many imagrants also came because a man in California named John Sutter found gold and many immigrants wanted to strike it rich by finding gold. 325 chinese men also came. This is why they came, but why would they stay? Well in Ireland many people stayed because they simply did not have the money and couldn't leave their homes and just move to America. People didn't come to Califoria because there were already so many people already there and there was a ver very small chance of them finding gold and more than likely they would just waste money coming out to California, unless they were lucky and they found gold. This is a few reason mainly why some people went to America and why some people didn't.

Some came for gold, some for the new technology, and some came just for a better and easier lifestyle. Many different people from different countries immigrated here. These people include Chinese, Germans,  the Irish, Russians, Italians, Polish, and much more! There was a great population increase between 1800 to 1900.               First of all, immigrants came because they needed a better and easier lifestyle. So much of Ireland migrated because their crops had failed. More than 1 million people died because of starvation. Many Europeans came later on because people needed homes and jobs. There wasn't much in Europe at that time. They wanted to avoid hunger and also they needed those jobs which America offered. Others from Holland, and also Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came because of freedom of religion. Jews were often mistreated because of their beliefs so they came here for freedom and equality.            Second of all, the technology in the 1800's changed rapidly! Industry also grew. Transportation improved greatly. There was trains now which allowed the migrants to catch the train and move faster and much easier. Information traveled much more quickly now that they created steam power which made it even simpler to create things to receive information by. People started creating newspapers and books. Also, the invention of the telegraph and the telephone made news travel its fastest.             Lastly, the so many of the Chinese migrated to California because of the Gold Rush. Chinese believed that they would find a fortune immediately! They also moved because of conflicts and poverty. So many people from Guangdong were involved in two was between China and Britain. The Chinese raised taxes which were also trying to got away from.            In conclusion, in the 1800's the population rapidly changed and America gained many new people and cultures. America had jobs, freedom of religion, food, and gold. What more could people want that were living in despair?

During the 1800's working people can build, farm, or invent. All of the new technology. The Irish was the largest immigration group. They kept coming, during and after the war. Later in the 1800s people started coming from European countries that had not sent many people to america before. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.       The second half of the 1800s was a time of the great change in America. Traverlers now would catch a train that would take them right to a boat. A trip to America in earlier times would take months, but now steam ships make the trip way faster. People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distance easily. Mant of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in form of programs.

In the 1800's people started to immigrate to America, because they needed jobs. Some of them immigrated because of religious reasons. Germans made up the largest immigrant group. In my opinion it is sad that the had to come because of religious reasons. The second largest immagrant groups were the Irish.        The Irish came to Ireland because of the potato famine. Before the American Civil War, one-fourth of Ireland moved to America. That was 1.7 million people of all ages women and men. More than 1 million people in Ireland died of starvation during the food shortage. They helped build our railroads a little bit along with China immigrants.        Chinese immigrants came because of the California Gold Rush. At first, the person who discovered the gold was going to keep it a secret, but before he knew it San Fransisco knew about it. Then, the east coast, and finally in some other parts of the world. That is called a pull when people are attracted to parts of the world for something.        Migrating to other parts of the world is sometimes difficult, especially when it is during something big. We should be thankful that we live in a free country and not somewhere that tries to take control of us. Being able to live somewhere that we do not have a lot of trouble is amazing. I am very thankful for that. Everybody else should be too.

Many cultures of immigrants come to the U.S like Jews, Brish, Chinese, Italians and Europeans.       The Jews came because of  they were mistreated for their beliefs in thier home countries.       Many Europeans came because they needed to find work and to aviod hunger.       The immigrants came to America through the sea on a boat or on the train.       Chinese came to a specific part in America. It was California, went there to find gold. Somthing interesting about the Chinese is that each year the came their population got hiher and higher. One year there was only 325 and then 450 next, 2,716.       That year there were 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.       In Conclusion, that same year more than people 31,344,545 immigrants had came to the United States in the year of 1910.

In the 1800's many people from different countries came to Amerca such as people from Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Many people came to America just to escape disasters like different attacks or because they weren't being treated right in their home countries.

They wanted the freedom to be able to choose their own religion. Back at their other homes, they didn't get the freedom to choose. They would get punished for being a certain religion. It wasn't fair; Other people could choose their religion, but they couldn't. They were singled out and harassed for being the religion that other people that was wrong. I know I wouldn't want to live there, either. I'd move to America the instance I heard it was available.    The people who moved here also wanted to have richer, better soil to plant crops and what-not. Back at most of their homes, they didn't have the correct land materials and soil to plant and make money.    There was also the issue of having tax. Most farmers couldn't pay, so they got punished. It was unfair, for they didn't have the right nessecities to gain money and pay.    Within these reasons, I tell you why people moved to America.

Others try even making it out, that was because during that time it was 1860's, and that meant civil war.Not only it was because it of the war, but on top of that the crops wouldn't grow so no food. They were short of food; more than 1 million Irish people died of starvation.            Some  made people leave Europe to migrate to America just because of their religion or race; they felt they had to leave every piece of memory, family, friends, they had to leave. that's why its called 'pushes' because they push them out of the country. the 'pulls.' On the other hand is somewhat different than the 'pushers.' The 'pulls' are those who attract people with opportunities and freedom. Southern Italians had problems from high birth rates because their lower incomes.Their were some siblings who had a home and others who were homeless. Hungarians, Greeks,poles,and Armenian moved to America. immigrants were praying to start a new life for themselves and their  families in the US.            America got a little too good in 1848. A man named John Sutter found that gold was planted on his property; he tried to keep the gold a secret.Not long before San Francisco heard; many many people left the city to go to the mans property of gold.You think that was bad, every country, state, village, streets know about the gold rush now. there were many fights.  lets start with the fact that Chinese people are raising their taxes. more than 63,000 people migrated from china to the united states. about now you should know a lot about history back then.

Maybe they just didn't like  the country where thay used to live. Maybe they thought this would be a better place for them and for their kids. Perhaps they thought they could get a really good job, maybe strike it rich. Most people's reason for coming here is the same. Here is why they came here:         People moved to America during the Gold Rush hoping to find money, then go back to their city. But most people liked it here so much that they stayed. Most of the people who came for the Gold Rush came from Guandong. They were hoping to make some money, then go back. But most of them stayed, and that's how America grew even more in population. Another reason people came from Guandong was because they did not have a good job there, and the crops were failing from constant floods.         Another reason people moved out of their home country and into america was because of religion. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms- organized violent attacks. These also included from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia.         This is why people have came to America and America has expanded.

Other people like Jews came to America because they wanted to escape from the war that was going on.They want freedom and a chance to work.And thats what all of them got.

About 1 million people died. they kept coming and coming. we did not know what to do with them. Later we had an gold rush. people started coming from all over the world. Jobs were all gone and the population just kept increasing. So they built rail roads so all kind of stiff could be transported. That how it was.

Well, there was a time in history where the United States was a place everyone wanted to go and live. Why? because of how much freedom we have.People that come from one place from another are called immigrants. Some people would come to get  a job, or would come because of there   religious beliefs, and maybe to even dig for gold.It didn't matter when or where you came from, back then people would come for they wouldn't get judged by color of skin, religious beliefs,or how they looked.They came for freedom and that's what they got.       Germans made up the the largest group of Immigrants, the reason that Germany had so many Immigrants was because of the holocaust, which is when Hitler put all Jews in camps.  Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group , because for them the Civil war had started and  crops had failed but even after  the war and food shortages many Irish people kept coming. In total 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year time period.           The gold rush started in 1848 a man named John Sutter discovered it. This is when California mostly got there population,John tried to keep it a secret but didn't by January of 1849 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. Many Chinese people from Guangdong came. Guangdongs population was growing quickly Guangdong could not produce enough rice to feed people. So, that's why most people from china came.  First it was only 325 then the following year was 450 then suddenly 2,716 then by 1870 there were 63,000  Chinese were in the USA.             	NNP PRP RB VBN WP PRP VBD IN RB RB .

With all the new technology there was plenty for them to do. the could work in factory's, farm and build, or invent things. These people were called immigrants.       Germans were the largest immigrant group in 1800s.Irish were the second largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the population of Ireland came to America. the Irish came to America because the Ireland crops had failed. More than one million people died in Ireland because the crops failed.       In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those people needed homes, food, and jobs but there wasn't that in Europe. Many of them came to America to find that.       Others came for religious freedom. these included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.Some other people came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.       In total, 26 Million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. That's what they wanted though they wanted freedom.

There was 1.7 million men, women, and children who were in Ireland but came to America. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary did not send many people to America. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. The second half of the 1800's was a time of great change in America. Tjis was true in Europe also. Travelers now could catch a train that would take them right into a boat. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.

But when they left their population, their area decrease and America increased more people were coming. Every single day Americas population increased. Human beans loved it in America because there was freedom, no slavery.          Even when war world II was going on and they still came. That shows you how much people want their freedom; everybody in the world should be able to have freedom . But their will still have to be boundaries and laws. Did you know in the 1800's some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States Of America over a 50 year period. But can you Believe that, that many came to America because that's a lot of immigrants.           A lot of chinese people came over the years for the gold. They called  California 'Gam Sann' or ' Golden Mountain'. By 1877 there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States. Plus more people from all across the world were coming and it's like we had one of each in their population ' state'. In plus America made the first Rail Road. That really helped because now human beans can get faster transportation to go somewhere faster then being there like in days and they made the boats that steam could come out of it so the boat ride really went quick for you don't have to arrive in America in months.             People move to America for they can grow former crops because in there own state there used to be a lot of floods or accidents and they can't really prevent it from happening so........ they came to America to grow and sell better crops for money. In plus they really need the money for a living.                 One forth of the whole population of Ireland came to America because their was a food shortage and 1 million people died of that for starvation. That was 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children came. but little people knew much abut AMERICA because all they came for was for Freedom. But that's why many of millions of people came, just for Freedom and believe me i would to.

Imgrigants from almost every were,were trieing to get to America. Most of imgrants died of starvation. Most of the people needed food, jobs, even homes. It didn't seem that there was many jobs and homes in Europe. The second half of the 1800 was an awesome change in America because many imigrants were free and got to go to America it took them months to get to America. The number of people born in the United States were 4,096,753 that was alot and most of that people were imigrants yes, it is sad! But the number of people in the U.S were 31,514,000 thats way more people than the people that were born in America. Also the number of people who lived in cities are 6,216,518 and most of those people got tooken away from there house. Will thats all i got to say about imigrants. Hope to learn more again sometime about imigrants and how they got America.

The first reason that people moved to America for was that in Ireland,crops were failing and especially the potato crop.Because of that, there was a food shortage. Other people came for religious freedom.       People also moved because of the transportation improvements making it easier to move around.       The last reason that people moved was because of the gold rush in 1849. Alot of people moved because of that, including alot of chinese people.

The gold rush was crazy so what happened was that a few hundred Chinese people where in America and they found gold.so they tried to keep it a secret and they got more and more.so they called the mountain they got it from the golden mountain.and then more and more Chinese have came to America.by the time of 1870 there was 63,000 Chinese in America.they all became rich and they alot of money in there pockets.

Gold rush was about how gold was found in a river along california. it was on the property of John Sutter. He tried to keep it secret. But it soon spred to all around the world, more than 70,000 adventures came in California.        In the 1800's there was a change in how quikly and widely information spred. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpencive books and newspapers. This made news and ideas avalible to more people.The telephone made information travel faster.         Many of the new European immigrants wanted to excape harsh things in Europe. Russain jews left to excape the prejudice and persecution.

People moved to America to get reasons. They also moved to get food. People moved a lot to get jobs. They moved to get freedom and land too.             The reason people moved to get resources was because they didn't have all the resources we do here in America. Everybody needs reasons like trees to build homes to live in. We also need plants so we have something to eat. Resources are also used to have books to read so we can be smarter.              People moved to America to get jobs. They might not of had jobs where they lived. Maybe they did have jobs but they didn't get much money. Most people like the jobs we have here because you get payed more. We are not forced to work all the time like they are over seas and when they do that they die because they have to work so much.               People move to get food. You might wonder why they move to get food. People move to get food because they do not have much food. Sometimes its because they are starved where they live now.                People move to get land and freedom because they do not have that every where. Some people don't like to live with a lot of people around them. Some people like to live in the city where you alway have some one around. If you live in the country you have a lot of freedom, but if you live in the city you don't have every much freedom.

There was more living space in America. There was more work in America. They were also trying to aviod going hungry by going to America and leaveing there old country.

In nineteen ten the population of America was ninty two million four hundred and seven thousand.

In the later 1800's people started coming from othor European countries that have not sent many people to america before it included Russia,Poland,Denmark,Sweden,and Hungary.All those extra people needed food,homes,and jobs many Europeans came to america to find work and avoid hunger.Others came from religious freedom this included people from Holland,jews who came from Germany,Poland,and Russia.Still other came to escape wars that made life hard.Most of the new newcomers knew very little about america exepet that it was a land of freedom thats what they wanted:freedom and a chance to work.        Industy grew and many immigrants arrived on america shores.The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869 this meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the west to the East.People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distance easily,they moved more than ever before.The reasons they moved are often characterized as 'pushes' and 'pull'.Pushes are those features of life that drive people homes.Pulls are those features of life that attract people.                       The gold rush was discoverd in 1848 along the americn River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret,word of the find soon reached San Francisco,and hundereds of people left the city to set off for the American river.The news spread to the rest of the United States,and to other parts of the world as well.By January of 1849,60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California.

They probably didnt have good work anad they got payed in a low ammount. Their job was probably way to hard for them. For freedom, they probably had to follow the religion mthey didnt want to follow. Or politics, they didnt like politics. And space, there was probably way to many people. The population increased maybe.Thats probably why they left there country.

Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children.) they kept coming, during and after the war. The Irish were so desperate because in Ireland, crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850.             Next, there was great a change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. People could travel on these trains too. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advances in transportation made it possible for more people to travel more easily.            Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of  a man named John Sutter. Although Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundered of people left the city to set off for the American River. The news spread to the  rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world as well.  By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousand of overland travelers were head for California. The California gold rush had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California in1849. Among these 'Forty-Niners' were 325 men from China. More Chinese cam ethe next year, and the next. Like  the people who came from waiting for them in the Califoria hills.

Germans made the largest group of immagrints here. Irish were the second largest group. For the United States it was a good thing because new invention were being developed and the United States neede more people so they could work in factories. In the second  half of the 1800's it was a time of great change in America. Immigrants had a hard time, but everthing got better for them.

Many people accross the U.S. are very good and try to do better at their Religion. My mom is a Cambodian and I have trouble speaking inglishy and Chinesey. I even go to Chinese School to learn the ways of Ninja-Higa and Samurai-San. In China, my dad sais that in order to be a citizen, you have to work super super super super super super super super super super super HHAAAARRDDDDD~!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So hard that you have to get things and throw them like in the Olympics. Many of my friends think that China is very strict in rules, but it isn't art all!

Many immigrants moved to America to start a new life because of something bad. Germans, Jews, Irish, and Chinese immigrants arrived America in the late 1800s' to start a brand new and better life in this country.               One reason why these immigrants came to America is to start a better life because of bad economy, hunger, and poverty in their home country. The second reason why the immigrants came to America is because they were mistreated. The Jews came to America because in Germany, they were tortured because of their beliefs. Finally the third reason they came to America is because they were looking for gold in California during the time of the Gold Rush. The Chinese came to America because China had a war with Britain and became very poor. Then they heard stories of mountains of gold being found in California, so they moved to America.                In conclusion, I learned that immigrants that came from different countries because of different, but sad reasons. These are the reasons why immigrants came into the U.S. I hope you learned something important after reading this report.

New technology would just be waiting to be used! Lots of attractions, also known as ''pulls'' would bring in many immigrants. Since information and news were quick to travel around the world, people were more aware of America. As a result, America attracted many visitors, immigrants, and especially increased population and industrial growth by a lot!                             Even though America was supported by its pulls, it was also supported by ''push.'' Others came to the country for religious freedom, people like Jews. Religious people were often mistreated for their own home countries. Even some came to escape wars, which put their lives in danger at home.                                Later on, time in the 1800s was a great success for the USA. Many got their footsteps on America. Technology improved, especially transportation: the first railroad was completed. Resources were meant to be easier to move. Advances like boats and steamships made travel much more easier and faster! News and information traveled very soon around the globe, resulting to be more aware of the world around them.                One great period of time led the population uprising! This decade was known as the Gold Rush. Gold was discovered and word spread quick. The most hopeful wave of immigrants were the Chinese. These people hoped to find a great fortune waiting for them in California. The Chinese also moved not only because of the gold, but they were in poverty.                   All of these successes led to the growth of the population, especially the industrial growth. The population went uprising! Population went high than never before. Thanks to all the spread, it led America to a good future in 1910. 	CD VBD DT NN WRB NNP VBD NN IN NNS WDT MD VB JJ NNS , NNS , CC NNP NNP NN MD RB VB VBG TO VB VBN .

Many other people come to America because they are looking for opportunity, jobs, wealth, and freedom. The most of people who came to America were Europeans they wanted to find freedom, wealth, and jobs. They also wanted to make batter decisions with they're own family or because they just want a better life to live in America. Also some poeple aome from China. Many chinese people came to America becausew they heard of a story of gold mountain which is actually gold that was discovered in the American river in California. The reason many Europeans came to America was manly the reason they sailed to America. Either many people were expeiriencing hardships, wars, or poverty those were the main reasons Europeans were sailing on a six month journey on a sail boat to a new land named Elis island.

My mom was a miggrant she needed to move from Mexico to Los Angelas because she neede money to suistane her mom. Traveling in ships was very difficult because it would be to croweded and some people would even get seasick. Ones the got to America they had to look for jobs because they had no one to sleep with.

They also came over here for better job and more money to take care of their families. Before immigrants were allowed to come in they had to stop at a checkpoint which is Ellis Island. If they did not meet the needs they would have to be sent back to their homeland.                        Once Immigrants came into America they had to live the struggles of not having a job for a while. Soon Immigrants did find a job but they were not paid that much. Later on they found better jobs and got paid a little bit more.                                       The Germans and the Irish were one of the largest group of Immigrants in the 1800s. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 Million Irish men, Women, and Children.) They kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because Irelands crops died, especially the potatoe crop. More than 1 million people died in Ireland due to starvation                          In the 1800s people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. They included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs.                            Others came for religious freedom. These include people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. (Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.)

Tons of immigrants from foreign countries came to America in this time of new advances.  The largest group of immigrants were Germans.  The Irish were largest next to the Germans to come to America.  Religious freedom was a very large part of all the immigration.  Jews were the most targeted religious group in Germany which caused them to immigrate.        In the eighteen hundreds America was developing by the minute with industry, transportation, and the expansion of finding resources.  In Europe the transportation developed just as well.  People could catch a steamship to go to America instead of having to travel by feet for months.  News and information grew as well.  The telephone and telegraph were invented in 1844 and 1876 (telegraph first).  Most immigration in Europe and Russia was caused by religious persecution, high birth rates, and farming losses due to lower prices.        The Chinese moved to California for a huge gold rush.  Around 70,000 immigrates moved to California for the gold rush. They were soon called 'Forty Niners.'  In the middle of the eighteen hundreds China and Britain were in a raging war against each other. This was kind of a 'Push' for the Chinese. Forced to come out of their own country by 1870 there were sixty-three thousand Chinese in America 77% in California.  The total population of the United States by nineteen ten was ninety-two thousand four hundred.

Even in Russia Jews had to leave because of their race and there was even violent attacks that killed them sometimes. In Italy they were suffering from high populations and farming losses. So many people moved!! Hungarians,Greeks,Poles,Portuguese, and Armenians all moved to America for a better life.                    Allot of people moved to the America but that was just the beginning! In 1848 gold was discover in California by John Sutter in the America River. He tried to keep it a secret but the secret reached  San Francisco then thousands of people set to the river. The news spread that there was gold in California all over America then all over the world!                 More thane 70,000 people arrived in California in hope to find gold. 325 men were Chinese some of them weren't for the gold they came from poverty and conflicts of their government. They also left because the government was at war so they raised the taxes and their population was growing to quickly. After three years there were 63,000 Chinese in California.                  Although the 1800s were crazy and all they adapted and things were better. The Chinese built the first transcontinental railroad. So bad things may happen but theres alwas good.

To them they thought it was getting crowded in their countries. America sounded like a good place for them, so they wondered if they could move their. Then eventually they were on their way.        Back then their was not a bunch of supllies like we have today like technology. We have a bunch more transportation now too. Airplanes get us over seas very well. Cars let us carry lugage like trains. Back then they did`t survive on a long boat trip across seas.         These people that survived are now in America living the life they wanted and they don`t have the same government or ruler. They don`t live in the same environment or the same food.They now have to get comfortable in their new place. 'Enjoy your new stuff says american people!'          This is why you may not be a full american blooded.Their were 4,096,753 people born outside of the United States in 1860. By the time period of 1910 the number of people in the U.S was 92,407,000. Isn`t that amazing! You might be blooded by two different parts because of marriage and them having children.

First reason was that many people came to work or to invent. Although they wanted to invent and a chance to work, all that thyey wanted was freedom.         Second reason why people came to America, was to escape the state of poverty and hunger. Many immigrants came to America because in their home country, they had a lot of people which meant more food and more money. Many people couldn't work in their home country and came to America to find work and avoid hunger.          Third reason why people came to America was for religion freedom. Those people that came for religious freedom was because back in their home country, they were either persecuted, or mistreated because of their religioun beliefs.         Fourth reason was because they avoided war in their home country. That made life for the citizens unstable and unpredictable.         Fifth reason immigrants came to America, was their attention for the Gold Rush.   That all started because one man found gold. Then word came to many other countries.         Those are the reasons why immigrants came to America.

There was so many things to do in America such as, people worked in factories,people farmed and built many things on the new land, and people spent time inventing things. there was also so many things to see in America.       Germans and the Irish were the biggest group until the Civil War started.   then came along Europeans. they came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. others just came for religious freedom. the Russians started to come to America, and the Jews from Germany. Also Italians, people from Sweeden,Poland, denmark, and Hungary.       Over 26 million immigrants came to America. most of the newcomers did not know much about America. America was a land of freedom.       in the second half of the 1800s, the industry grew, transportation improved, people built railroads, and people sailed across the seas. trains made it easier for Europeans to come to america. peoples inventions were used around america, such as the telegraph and the telephone.       people became aware of the world around them. the reasons they moved are often characterized as the 'pushes' and 'pulls.' this was mostly in Europe. the chinease often come to America because of this to.       then, the gold rush happened. people came to America just to find gold. Gold meant that you were wealthy. it still does today. the American river carried to gold. people would come and search for gold.

There was also many jobs for them like factories, farms, and inventions. In such ways, these are reasons why people came to America in the 1800s.       The largest group of immigrants single groups were the Germans. The Irish was the largest immigrant group. The Irish were coming to America because of food shortage and many people died.       Later, people started coming from European countries. In the 1750s, the population of Europe doubled and there was not enough food, homes, and jobs. They came to avoid starvation.       Peopl came to America not only because of starvation, but for religious freedom. Jews were mistreated for their beliefs.       About 26 million immigrants came to the United Stares over a short time. Many people came to America for a better life.

Some wanted to move away because of their religion. At first, it was only the Germans and Irish that moved to America. The Irish came because their crops had failed, creating a food shortage. Later, many other groups moved in. When John Sutter discovered gold in 1848 along the American River. That attracted a lot of people. Most of the majority of the people to come was the Chinese. They believed that San Francisco was the Gold Mountain                                                    The Changes in America      People made lots of advances. Transportation helped more immigrants to move in. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many books. The invention of the telegraph and telephone helped news travel even faster. The people also made the first railroad that crossed from one end to another of the United States.

There are pushes, features of life that make people want to leave their homes. There are also pulls, features of life that attract people to a new place. things like the gold rush attracted people to America from there old town that may have had some pushes.   In the 1800's many people came to america when their was many new technology. Most of the peole were from Ireland, because crops had failed and they were so desperate they came during the Civil War. People from other places in Europe also came because they couldn't find jobs or house. Other people came for religious freedom or lower birthing rates.   Later in the 1800's industry grew and many more people came to America. New transportation has been mad to make it more convenient for traveling. Now it is much easier for people to move to America. They could take a train to another method of transportation to get to America. The printing press was also invented at that time to print inexpensive books and newspapers, so that opened up a job opportunity for someone that is looking for a job. Also in 1844 someone invented the telegraph and in 1876 they had invented the telephone. Now the people in America can keep in touch with their family back at their home town.   In 1848 gold was discovered in California, so that brought even more people to America. More than 70,000 people came to search for gold which brought the population up much higher. Many people have moved to America for many different reasons, and now Ameirica has close to the highest population out of all of the counries.

This was true in Europe also, travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. A trip to America would've taken for ever but thanks to steamships the trip is much faster. In the 1800s,there was also a rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. People became aware of the world around them and with the ability to move longer distances, they moved more than ever before.

Many europeans came to America for work and to aviod starvation while others came for religuos freedom.Like the Jews who were persecuted in there home countries so Jews from Germany,Polland,and Russia came to Amereica to aviod persecution.Though some just came to avoid wars.In a span of 50 years over 26 million immigrants came to America.       The second half of the 1800s was a time of big change as industry grew and even more immigrants came to America.But a big thing happened in tyhe second half of the 1800s.The California gold rush began.A man by the name of John Sutter discovered gold by a river.He tried to keep it a secret but eventually everybody found out and even more immigrants came to America and a lot more chinese immigrants  also came to america.All of them looking for gold.They all wanted to find gold and sell it for a lot of money.

Before the civil war one third of ireland came to america to live. The germins had the biggest immigrantion move. In irland 1 million people died of starvation because the potato crop died out. Others came for religious freedom.        In the middle of the story they talked about the pushes and the pulls in america at the time. Pushes are events that make people leave anmd pulls are things that make people come. Many of the European immagrints came because they wanted to escape the harsh conditions.        In the end of the story they talked about the gold rush. The gold rush was a huge pull because everyone wanted to become rich. 70,000 people came to try to find gold in Califonia in San Francisco. They called California Gam Saan or Gold Mountain. many people felt hopeless when the gold rush ended.

These country's/ states are Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. many of the people that came to America came because of need of work, and to avoid hunger. A great deal others came to find religious freedom. All these factors can be put into two different categories, Pushes and Pulls.        'Pushes are those features in life that drive people from their homes'. These include a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty'. Those two sentences were copied from the http://worldhistoryforusall.sdsu.edu and http://www.learner.org/. websites. 'Pulls are those features in life that attract people.' and 'These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms'. Those two quotes were from the same websites.        When people first came to America some came for religious freedom, as I said earlier. Those people that came originated from Holland, (and the people of Jewish religion originated from Germany), Poland, and Russia. The Jewish people immigrated mostly because of the way they were treated back home (poorly). The people of Ireland came as well because of all of there crops dieing back home. By the 1860's, one-fourth of the entire population of Ireland had came to America.

What would you do? Many people decided to move to America.   Many people immigrated to America in the 1800's including people from Europe, China, and other countries. They came for a variety of reasons, such as promises of food, shelter, jobs, freedom, hope, and after the Gold Rush started, some came to find gold.       The Europeans made up a  very large group of the immigrants coming to America in the 1800's. Europe's population doubled between 1750 and 1850, so many were in need of food, shelter, and jobs. An Article called Moving to America by Joy Hakim states that many Europeans moved to America to Avoid hunger.   Those were not the only reasons why they moved to America, though. Some came to seek religious freedom. Some of these people included the Jewish people, who came from Germany, Russia, and Poland. They were often times discriminated and mistreated for their beliefs and religion.       Another group of people who came to America in the 1800's were the Chinese. They mainly kept their eye on California, where they hoped to get rich after the Gold Rush started in 1849. As it says in the article Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California, the Chinese called California Gam Saan, or 'Gold Mountain.' They heard about all the gold that was found there, and they craved to go to 'Gold Mountain', find a fortune, and return to China with their riches. According to the same source, 77% of the 63,000 Chinese  who lived in America in 1780 were living in California.   Some other reasons why the Chinese came to America could be to escape the oppressive government and the extensive village and family fights. In the mid-1800's, Guangdong was also involved in two wars between Britain and China.       The industry grew and transportation was improved in America in the second half of the 1800's. The first railroad to cross the United States was completed in 1869, and that meant resources such as silver and lumber could become more widely available. The redesigning of the printing press, steam power, the telegraph, and the telephone also helped information travel more quickly and widely. These things attracted immigrants too.       As you can see, many people from China and Europe emigrated from their own countries and went to America for with their own reasons; from seeking religious freedom to finding gold. The number of  people born outside the United States who were living there went from just over four million to over thirteen million from 1860 to 1910, just a fifty year period! America was the target for many people seeking a new start in the 1800's.

There were also many rebellions against the government, and endless village and family feuds. The Chinese goverment raised taxes. Farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. At the same time, Guangdong's population was growing quickly. The area could not produce enough rice to feed its people, epsecially when floods often destroyed the crops.'

Some people wasn't even given that much food, because of their skin color, or because their planting went wrong.     Around the 1800s Irish people were desperate for food, that is because their crops have failed, they didn't grow or anything.   More than 1 million people died by starvation.     European countries had little things for people. Like food, they didn't have enough for everyone to get a whole meal. They couldn't get a home so fast, they had to do many certain things to be able to have a house. And jobs, not everyone had jobs. Kids didn't go to school or anything.     Some people didn't get to choose their religion because of they're skin color, or because the government didn't approve that. If they decided to choose their own religion, they would get beaten or killed.    Over a 50 year period, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States. The newcomers only knew a little bit about America. But they knew it was a land of freedom because that's why they wanted to go there.        In 1869, the United States finished their first railroad, so it was much easier for them to move resources, like silver and lumber.   It was also must easier for the people to travel, because they can go in trains. It was easy for the people to go to one place to another.    It was also easy for Europeans to travel because there was a train that will take them right to a boat.    In 1844 the telegraph was invented, and in 1876 the telephone only made the news travel faster.   It was much easier for the people now, they had the ability to move long distances. These were often called 'pushes' and 'pulls'. 'pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes' Like the harsh environment, war and other problems like that. They pushed their self to accomplish those things, even if it causes death.    'Pulls are those features of life that attract people.' Which is talking about jobs, wealth, access to resources, and of course perceived freedoms. People often pulled them self in doing those things because they didn't like how they been treated. They didn't like how they get beaten to death if they didn't do what their ruler said, or how they would die because they didn't get much food.    Most people in the European countries mostly wanted to escape, because a lot of people were suffering and they didn't like that.           Italians suffered by high birth rates, and farming loses. 'The tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless.' The immigrants hoped to make a new life and have a family in the United states so they traveled to America.        'Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.' John tried hiding the discovery a secret but the word went around fast. And a lot of people left their homes to travel to the American River to be rich. By January 1849, 60 ships were heading to California. That's when the gold rush had begun.    For China, if the people couldn't pay their taxes the Chinese government will raise their taxes. For the people that wouldn't be able to pay their taxes, the people would have to sell their land. The area couldn't even produce enough rice to feed the people. Especially because floods often happened, and their crops got over flooded and failed.    The news about the Gold Mountain was spread around China and many people wanted to join to become rich.    In 1849, 325 Chinese joined the gold rush. After a year 450 more Chinese people arrived in California.     1851-2,716 people, 1852-20,026 people, and in 1870 there was 63,000 Chinese in the United States. 77% of them was in California.                                              Population   Number of people in the U.S.A.- By 1860 the population was 31,513,000. But more people of all kinds traveled to America making the total of 92,407,000 by 1910.

Another reason was because in the 1848 people started to discover about gold. I think that's why most people went there. The person that discovered the gold was a man named John Sutter. He found the gold along the American River. Many many people went there but because the eastern united states people went a lot of the Chinese people went and hoped to find fortune. Many Chinese men went over there because the wanted to join the forty niners. Chinese people migrated because the government raised taxes and many people couldn't afford it so they had to give up many things that they owned and loved. It was really hard for everybody because it was really hard to grow crops because the floods that they had would often destroy them. It was even harder because their population was growing and growing and they really couldn't control it. People didn't really know what to do so when they heard about the gold rush that's when a lot of them came and some became part of the forty niners. and that's some reasons why people moved here instead of staying were they came from.

Not all of them knew what America was like, but they knew this: America was a land of oppertunity and freedom.   Germans made the largest group of immigrants in the 1800s. The Irish were the next largest group. they came to America before the Civil War. They came because they were desperate for food: they had a crop shortage and more than 1 mil. people died of starvation. They continued to come, during and after the war.   Transportation improved thanks to the first railroad. Same as Europe. Anyone who wanted to come to America in Europe could now take a fast train to a boat and set sail.

I cant say all at once because that would be really confusing! So one at a time will have to do . Lets start with the Irish and why they moved okay its really factional.      During the 1800s the working people moved to America because their homelands were either being ruined, rundown, poor, or just because they wanted to . Well the Irish was one of the largest immigration groups that was back before the war of course. More than one-fourth of Ireland's people moved to America!!!The reason they moved was because their crops had failed ,mainly their potatoes --gasp--!! More than 1 million people died of starvation ( that's not good)!!!       So later in the 1800s some of the Germans moved because of their rights to have their own religion ( let them be FREE!!! ). Also a lot of people moved to escape the wars that made life UNPREDICTABLE, DUN DUN DUUNN!!! Sooo in total 26 MILLION!!   immigrants moved over a 50 YEAR PERIOD ( say whaa!!!). Most people knew that it was ' The Land of the Free' (and the-e home of the-aa braaave)       As America changed (as in changed i mean the transportation grew larger mmkay).   many many many immigrants arrived to share with us the place we call home!!! witch was also true in EUROPE ( ooh-ya). Travelers can now take a train to a boat ( witch takes them to America by the way mmkkaayy). It would have taken months but new STEAMSHIPS!! make the trip as easy as pie . Also the way of getting information change quickly . The redesigning of the printing press made it totally easy to make like cool newspappers and magazine articles plus the making of books made it an easy way to make a little bit of pocket money for the little ones so they can become BIG STARS. As people became more aware to the world around them they became really really happy that they decided to move to America .       So lets talk about gold mmkay yeah that will be fun!!! Well gold was discovered in the mid 1800s in guess where AMERICA yay!! A man named John Sutter discovered it one day and the news spread all over ( this is the beginning of the California gold rush!!) Now this is the part where the Chinese come in yay!   So the Chinese immigrated  because they were really poor and homes were being demolished . Farmers had to sell there land to pay taxes witch left then no were to plant food and no plants to sell to make money . So we got some poor hungry farmers that dont know what to do , here comes the good news. Wait for it Wait for it EVERYBODY HEARD ABOUT THE GOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND IMMIGRATED TO FING GOLD AND BECONE RICH!!!!! In the end there was a few problems but not big enough that you would have to go to war ( or did they DUN DUN DUUUNN) 	WRB VBG TO NNP IN DT JJ CD DT NNP , NNP , NNP , CC DT NNP VBD IN DT RB JJ NNP PRP VBP VBP DT IN RB IN DT MD VB RB VBG .

Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungary were the countries that were sent. There were 26 million people total that arrived in the United states over a 50 year period.                   Transportation improved the first railroad that crossed the United States was in 1869.it was easier to transport people and things from one place to another.The steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpinsive books and newspapers.The invention of the telegraph was in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 only made news faster.                         In 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in California. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California, the gold rush had begun.                      Over the years population and production has grown. People that came to California and people that were born already. The coal production, miles of railroad tracks and how news was given.

Many germans made up the largest group of immigrants.The irish were the the largest immigrant group next to the germans.Before the American Civil War in the 1860's,most of the people from Ireland came to America.Right after the war the irish were desperate, so they had to come back to America because they're crops had failed.More than 1 million people died because there was food shortage, so they died from starvation.Since the crops had failed there was more Irish going to America.                                  Second of all, the second half of the 1800's had a great change in what we call America.The industries grew, and a whole lot of immigrants arrived at the United States.In 1869 the first railroad was completed that crossed America.Since the railroad was finished it became easier to transport resources like silver and lumber to the East.A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people who ride a train.                            In 1848 gold was discovered along the American River.Hundreds of people left the city, and went to the American River to find the gold.All the news spread all over the globe.In 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travelers were heading for California.The California Gold Rush had just begun.More than 70,000 travelers arrived at California in 1849.               In conclusion, the 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 was just the beginning.During the years 450 more Chinese arrived at California.All of a sudden they came in greater numbers : 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852.By the 1870's there was already 63,000 Chinese humans in the United States.Although they could be found throughout the country, 77% of the Chinese humans were in California.

They went through a hard jorney to get here and changed our country alot. They brought lots of new inventions here and invented lots of things here. It is a great day to praise the immigrents that came here and changes they made.     In the 1800s, Germans came to America and were the largest single group to come. The Irish were next and one-fourth of them came to America and that was 1.7 million people. The crops in Ireland were failing and they had to come or else they would starve. They were the people that came because their homeland were having a bad time, but others came for religious freedom. The people included Jews and people in Holland. About 26 million immigrants arrived in USA over a 50 year period. Most of the people either wanted freedom or a chance to work.     In that period when the people were arriving, industry grew, transportation improved and the first railroad to cross US was completed in 1869. They could move resources easier and shorter for many people. This improved also in Europe and people could more easily travel from Europe to USA. The telegraph and telephone made news travel fast and faster. It became easier to travel long distances and they moved faster than ever. More people traveled to the United States from around the globe.     While all this was happening, another thing attracted people,the Gold Rush! People traveled all the way from China to come. n 1849, 70,000 hopeful adventurers looking to strike some gold arrived. The 325 Chinese people were just the beginning, the next year, 450 more Chinese arrived looking for gold. Then a whole bunch more came and by 1870, there were 63,000 Chinses in the US.     In 50 years about 60 million people came, 10 million born outside of the US. They prouduced huge amounts of coal for the 400 million more train track for the trains. And much more newspapers were prouduced. All in all a superb amount of people flourised in the US.

Like, people who came to America could've worked in factories, invented new things, and farmed or built on the land. So, there were many things to do in America that brought lots of immigrants to it.          The Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to them were the Irish. The Text directly states that, 1.7 million Irish men, woman, children came to America. That is one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland! During the Civil War, many people kept coming, during and after the war. For example, according to the text, the Irish were very desperate. A reason for this is because in Ireland many crops had failed, especially the potato crop. Also there was food shortage. A huge amount of people died in Ireland (over 1 million people) because of starvation.          Also, later in the 1800s, people started coming from European countries. Many people in Europe needed food, homes, and jobs. And there wasn't enough of those things in Europe. These people included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. So, many people from Europe came to the America to find work and to avoid hunger.           Many others came for religious freedom. This included people from Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews were often mistreated in their home countries so they came to America. Also, others came to escape wars.         In conclusion, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Many people arrived here because America was a land of freedom. Also, others came here for a chance to work and get money. So, many immigrants came to America for freedom, a chance to work, and get money.

Irish were next to the Germans. And many other countries so on. this passage is mainly about moving to America. our school would love to have someone who experienced this before explain to us what actually went on during these  times. I understand that the person might be really old, but that is okay because she or he will give us all the information recalled. We will get an ear full of what happened in Denmark , sweden, italy, poland, and germany. That will be a great experience for us and all of 2019 hopefully we can find someone still alive .       { :       There was something that developed in america about 100 years ago . These things ar called pushes and pulls. Pushes are things thta would remove peole from their countries and push them away from their homeland. A pull is something that will make u want to satay somewhere, those are things such as wealth, new findings and better industrial living, people move to these places because because they feel they can have a better life. Travelers aalways seem to find what they are looking for when they move from place to place.

They needed good jobs and good paying ones, something that can pay for your house and food and ect. At first I  bet they were scard to go somewere they havent been. They didnt now anyone or anything. Then when they say the staue of liberty they knew they were in america. They thought that was a good sign it was. When they arrived in new york city they had to go to a island called Ellis island. They would get checked up on, see how much money they had and ect. When they passed they were enterd in america. I know they felt happy. They finally made it to america, but not all the time its not good. If the baby is not healthy or somethings wrong with it they will send it back from were it came from. They did start in the 1800's with all this. So there was about 1.7 million irish men,women,and children go to america. Thats alot! One reason they left was because the food was shortage,1 million people died from starvation in ireland. In the 1800's there were people who came to eropean countries before they came to america. Which was Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden,and Hungary. All thoses people needed food,water,and a house to live in. Others would come for religious freedom. They had 26 million who came to the United States. Thats alot! Then they wanted freedom and a chance to work. Then there came chinese people who came to america. They came because they herd there was gold in the rivers. It was called the gold rush. There were 325 chinese who came ans joined the gold rush. The next year 450 came and joined the gold rush. Then  there was 2,716. WOW! That became alot if you can tell. So now you can see hoe msny people imagrated to america because all these wonderful things.

In the last 1800's, people stared coming from other European counties that had not sent many people to America before. This included  Russia Italy Denmark ,Sweden ,and Hungary.

With their new technology, there was plenty of work they could do. they were needed to work in the new factories, farm, build on land, and invent things. The immigrants did it all.       Most immigrants moved more than ever because of what they call 'pushes' and 'pulls.' A push are the features of life that drive people from their homes. They include harsh environments, wars and other conflicts and poverty. A pull are the features of life that attract people. these include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.       Many of the European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of Pogroms. Southern Italians suffered high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. The tradition of leaving their family to the first-born male often left younger siblings without land. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. The Immigrants hoped to make a better life for their families and themselves in the United States.       Chinese immigrants lived in poverty and conflict in their country. The Chinese were rebellious against the goverment. Also, they had endless village and family fights. The Chinese government raised taxes. Farmers who were not able to pay their taxes had to sell their land. The population in Guangdong was growing quickly and the area could not produce enough rice to feed its people. Especially when floods destroyed the crops. The people felt hopeless and they listened of the tales of gold over the Pacific Ocean. They longe to go their to make their fotunes and proudly return to China.

The second hate of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. In the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. This was also true in Europe. Travelers now could catch that would talk them right to a boat. A trip to America  in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. People became more aware of the world around them and the with ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever before.                                                                                                     Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions is Europe. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of  a man named John setter During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm or invent came to American in ship after ship after ship. Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Russia.More then 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849.In the middle of the 1800s, Guangzhou was involved in two wars between china and Britain. Most of this first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangzhou, an area on china's south coast.                                                                                                   They were fleeing from conflicts and property. People felt hopeless and they listened closely to tales of gold beyond the pacific Ocean. The 325 chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. Then suddenly they came in greater numbers: 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. The exciting news adout Gold Mountain spread throughout china. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.In total, some 26 million immigrants arri ved in the United states over a 50 year period.

People all over the world have moved to America during the 1800s. Today some people dont even know why they. The reasons people moved are very interesting. When the people moved to America thy were from Europe. Now lets see all of he different reasons people moved to America.                         A lot of people moved because of 'pull' and 'push.' 'Pull' is that people are attracted to features of life. For example jobs, opportunities, wealth, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. 'Push' is people that drive from there home for features of life too. MAny of new Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions. Even Russian Jews escaped because of prejudice and persecution. Thats why the Europeans moved to America.                         The Chinese moved to America because of te gold rush. 63,000 Chinese moved to California by 1870. to Chinese California seemed to be a land of richness.                         Many people have moved to America and California, total during a 50 time year period some 26 million people moved. when the people moved to America they didnt really know anything about it, all they knew was that it was a land of freedom. It didnt really matter to them because the people just wanted freedom and to have a job to make money for their children. Thats why so many people moved to America.

Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants.The Irish were next to the Germans of being the largest group. Before the Civil War started one-fourth of the the population came to America.[Thats 1.7 million people.] The Irish crops failed especially the potato crop.That food shortage killed more than 1 million people that died of starvation.Later in the 1800s people from European contries started to come to America.The people were from Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden,and Hungary.About 26 million immigratnts came to the United states in a fifty year period.Those immigrats wanted freedom and a place to work.     In the second half of the 1800s it was a great change. Industry grew for immigrants.The transportation improved for immigrants on the shores.The first railroad was finished in 1896.This became easier for resorces to be move from state to state.Also trips became shorter for travel.They also evented the steam ship to travel to country to country.They made steam powered printer to make inexpensive books for poor people.The pushes were known to drive people from there homes and start something new.Pulls are features of life that attract people to start a new invention.     The gold rush was found when a man found a gold nugget in the ground and to keep it a secret and word got out gold is on the streetspeople went crazy.

There were 325 men from China who hoped to find a fortune of gold. There were lots of fights going on to get the gold.

Immigration has helped the economy because new cultures come to our country and teach us new ways and traditions that they can share to us. I think that if immigration wasn't available to anyone than the world might be different because people wouldn't be treated right and would not have the same rights we have today.       Immigration is important. Immigration is one of the most important type of moving to a new country to be free or find freedom. Immigration helps immagrants find freedom, new laws, new rights. Immigrants can even share new cultures or traditions to other people who want to learn that culture.

Many people moved to America because in their own countries they had problems, with starvation and much more.   When people started to move to America it was around the eight-teen hundreds.  In America there was a lot to like, build, invent, and farm.  The people who came to America are called immigrants, Immigrants did all the things that need to be done, like farming and inventing things.               There are many immigrant and the Germans made up the largest group.  The Irish was the largest group.  In eight-teen sixty hundreds the American Civil War broke out, and one worth of the population of Ireland came to America.  One forth of the population is 1.7 million people including men, women, and children.  The reason why so many Irish immigrants came to America is because their crops had failed.  They re lie on the potato crop and on that year the potato crop failed. So why did they come, well they came because more than one million people had died from starvation in Ireland.                   Later in the 1800s other immigrants came from all over the world.  They included Italy, Russia, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and more.  In Europe the population has doubled in the last decade.  These people need food, and homes.  Many more immigrants came for other reasons like religious free dome.  Jews were often mistreated, for their beliefs.  The total immigrants who came all over the world,  there was 26 million people who arrived in a fifty year period.                        The reasons why immigrants came to America is because of a push or a pull.  A push is a reason why some one leaves their country for bad reasons.  Some of the bad reasons include, wars, starvation, a harsh environment, and other conflicts.  The Irish left Ireland because of starvation and bad climes.  A pull is a feature of life that attracts people.  Some pulls are jobs, opportunities, and free dome.  The Jews came to America so they can be free, to practice their religion, and beliefs.                      A big pull for the Chinese is, a gold rush.  A gold rush is where some one discovered gold and other people want it.  More than seventy hundred thousand people wanted gold because it coated a lot of money.  That was a very big hit in the late 1800s.  That was a very good pull for every one.  There is many reasons why immigrant came to America, with pushes and pulls it all worked out.

Some of these people included: German's, Irish, Russian's,Italians, Pole's, Denmark's, Swedish, Hungarian, Jews, Holland, Greek's,  Portuguese, Armenians, and Chinese. There were 'pushes' and 'pulls' to come to America.As you can tell, America was a growing country!         Germans then Irish were the 2 largest immigrant groups. They were coming because of war,failing crops,food shortages,and starvation.America had plenty of good soil for these people because most of it hadn't been used yet. They couldn't starve and die with all of the food being grown.Later in the 1800's, European countries were sending people that hadn't before. All of these people coming needed: jobs, food, and shelter. There was lots of undeveloped land that could be used to put up shops and even makes houses.          Other immigrants were coming to find religious freedom. Mainly Jews, because they were mistreated for their religious beliefs in their countries. Life that was unstable made many others move to America.About 26 million people came to America in near 50 years!Many saw America as a land of freedom and opportunity.            Gold Rush! Gold Rush! Read all about it! In 1848 John Sutter discovered gold on his home estate in California. Since he found all of this gold, news spread around. Many Chinese moved to California searching for gold. Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong, trying to get away from poverty and war conflicts. And even many rebellions against the government, and raised taxes.Once they struck gold, and collected it, they went back home.             There were multiple reasons people moved to America. Like, searching for gold, religious freedom, food, shelter,etc. America made hopes and dreams for many people, but not everyone got what they wanted.By 1970 ,63,000 Chinese moved to the us, so imagine how many total people moved to America-that's a lot! From 1860-1910, 60,874,000  people moved to America! Now we now how important America was to people without many opportunities.

With all the new technology there was plenty for them to do.   The Germans and the Irish came in the largest groups. Before the Civil War, one-fourth of the Irish population came to America. They kept coming to America, even after the war, because their crops had failed, even the potato crop, causing a food shortage. More than one million died of starvation in that period of time.   In the later 1800s, more immigrants came from all over countries in Europe, such as Russia, Iraly, Sweden, and other countries. Many Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger.   Others came for religious freedom.   In total, about 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. over a 50 year period.   In the second half of the 1800s, transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. It made it easier to move resources like lumber and silver from the East to the West. People could travel by trains too. Taking a trip by train made traveling shorter and easier for many people.   People discovered that steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print inexpensive books and newspapers. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 made news travel even faster.   Gold was discovered along the American River in California in 1848. Although the people of the discovery tried to keep it a secret, word got around very fast, starting the California Gold rush.

Here's why certain groups of immigrants moved to America.   Around 1860 in Ireland, a lot of crops didn't grow, resulting in   food shortage. Irish people came to America because of this and after that kept coming. Later on in the 1800's, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to the U.S. because of need of food, houses, and jobs that there wasn't enough of in Europe. The people who didn't come for jobs, homes, or foods, came for religious reasons or to escape horrible wars.   A lot of Europeans wanted to get away from harsh conditions   in Europe so they came to America. Russian Jews escaped in pogroms from prejudice and persecution. Italians in the south had high birth rates and farming loss because of lower prices, which caused them to start their lifes over in the U.S.   In 1849, tons of Chinese people came to the U.S. to find gold   that had been found a year earlier. But some Chinese came because of problems with wars and poverty. People rebelled against the government. There was endless village and family fighting. Their government raised taxes, which caused farmers not able to pay them have to sell land. During all of this in Guangdong, China, the population was growing rapidly and the area couldn't grow enough food to give the people since the crops were getting flooded.   Of course all of this immigration caused the population to   increase. In 1860 the population was 31,513,000. By 1910 the population had almost tripled to 92,407,000. But the population wasn't the only thing to increase. The number of people who lived in cities in 1860 was more than 6 million and by 1910 was almost 42 million! The number of people born outside of the U.S. in 1860 was a little over 4 million and was up to 13 million in 1910. The coal collected in 1860 was almost 20.5 million tons. In 1910 more than 417 million tons was collected. That's more than 6 times the amount collected in 1860!! The miles of railroad track in 1860 was 30,626 and 240,293 in 1910. The number of daily newspapers in 1860 was 387 and was up to 2,600 in 1910. All of these things increased a lot in 50 years- and a lot of it was because of immigrates!

There is a lot of freedom and natural resources found here that are not found in other countries.Most people moved from the late 1700s to early 1900s.Many people love this country.            There are many reasons why people moved here.These reasons are called  'pulls'.There are also reasons why people left their homes.These reasons are called 'pushes'. People leave for both of these things.                Immigrants came to America for various reasons.They left their homes because they wanted freedom and a chance to work.For example, the Irish left their homes in the 1800s because they were desperate because in Ireland farm crops failed and there was a shortage of food.According to an excerpt from A History of Us, more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland during this time period.  In European countries people from other countries moved there.  Because all those extra people needed food,  there wasn't enough to feed everyone.Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.I got this information from A History of Us.Others came in search for religious freedom.These included people from Holland, and Jews from Germany.                 There were also many 'pulls' that attracted people to move to America.Many of these pull reasons are jobs,wealth (The Gold Rush in 1848), opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom.According to American Population and Industrial Growth, 1860-1910, a chart from the Bureau of the Census, the number of people born outside of the US were 4,096,753 in 1860 , that increased to 13,344.545 people in 1910.These were allot the people who came to America in the second-half of the 1800s,wanting the new technology that was being manufactured at this point in history.                       As you can see, many immigrants suffered the consequences of leaving their homeland, but gave it all up for the freedom of this proud country called America.

People came here because of the gold rush. People from china came here for gold and other people from other contries came to avoide hunger.The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made travel faster.because of that migration moved faster than ever before. The reason they moved are often characterized as push and pull. pushes are those features of life that drive peoplefrom there homes. Pulls are those features of life that attract people.These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access, to resources, and perceived freedom. This is all i know so I think this is the end.

They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land and invent things to survive. Germany made up the largest single group of immigrants.        Most of the people in Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary and many more were immigrants. There are features of life that drive people from their homes. For example the harsh environment.

In other country's like Germany, and China people felt 'pulls and pushes' A pull is something that makes you want to leave your old home behind such as wealth, and searching for religious freedom. A push is something that makes you leave your home, an example would be wars, wars played a big role on people leaving their homes, towns, and country's.       A couple examples of pulls would be in 1849 the California Gold Rush was discovered and immigrants from china rushed over to America in search to find wealth, and jobs working in the rush. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California on a mans property, named John Sutter. John tried to keep the gold a secret, eventually the word that gold was found in his property reached San Fransisco like China hundreds of people set off to the American River in search for wealth. By January 1849 60 ships, and thousands of overland travlers were headed for California.       In the 1800's America had produced lots of new technology and made it very easy for immigrants to come in to America. Many people left just in search for a new beginning in many things such as religious freedom, wealth, and to get our of the wars that could be occuring in their countrys now.       When the new immigrants came in to America there was plenty for them to do like work in the newly built factorys, farm on the lands (plant crops), build on the lands, and also invent things, immigrants did all these things. Many Germans came to America due to the Civil War occuring in Germany.       In the graph i noticed that from the 1800's to the 1900's the numbers overall went up. The number for how many people in the US went from 31,513,000 to 92,407,000. Some of the other things shown on the graph could contribute to the numbers of immigrants entering America like the railroad tracks, people from other countries such as Germany could enter America by railroad.

Immigrants could do all of that. Germans were the largest group to immigrate to the U.S. in the 1800s. The second largest group is the Irish, one/fourth of the whole population came to get away from war. That's 1.7 million Irish men,women,and children. They kept coming, during and after the war. In he later 1800s people from Europe started immigrating to the U.S. People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary also came to the U.S. around this time. All of these European people needed food, homes, and jobs, because there wasn't enough in Europe.                                                               The second half of the 1800s was a time that everything changed in America. Americas industry grew and many more immigrants arrived on America's shores. One of the first railroads that crossed the united states was completed in the 1869. This made it easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to East. Having this railroad also made it easier for people to travel to far distances and make the tip shorter. If you want to take a train right to a boat you can and the trip wouldn't be as long as it would have been without the railroad. A trip to America in the earlier times the trip would have taken a very long time, but no with all the technology the trip would have been much much faster.                                          In the 1800s, there was also a rapid and important change in how quickly an widely information traveled. Now with a steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. This made news and ideas available to more people. The telegraph invention in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 made news travel faster. With the ability to move long distances fast and easily, people moved more than ever before. The reason why they are moving more than ever is because of  'pushes' and 'pulls'.  Pushes are those ways of life that kick people out of their homes. those reasons include harsh environments, wars, and many other conflicts, and poverty. Pulls are the features of life that attract people, such as, jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.

It has been a problem for some people, like the U.S. Government. Mexican people want to get to their dreams but they can't because of the law. Sometimes they get killed when they're passing the border, but some survive. So that's why I suppose that they should let them in.           Some people have come to here and had been living here, but then they have been deported back to Mexico. And some have stayed here. Some people say that living here in the United States is a danger for some people. But now the U.S. is trying to let people from Mexico in here, but only if they have good records.           Some people work in fields for growing crops to earn money so that they could live in a house with their family. If people don't work they could be living in the street instead of being cozy inside. Or they could be picking trash or picking cans from the street and if they do that maybe they could get infections on their hands of the trash.           Or instead of doing that like living in cozy homes or picking up trash they could even make drugs and they could even go to jail by doing drugs or doing crimes they're not supposed to be doing. Like me I would not like to do that would you like that or not ? That's why the U.S. Government should let people pass to the United States from Mexico or some other country.

They wanted to be wealthy, and they had harsh lives back at their home. At their homes, they faced many harsh things. They were excluded out by race, and by religion. Some people did not like the laws of Christianity, so they moved to America, so they could be free. Jewish people were excluded out because of their race. So they moved to America, where they hoped they would be treated  properly. Also, these people were also poor, so they moved to America, where they hoped they could be wealthier. These people were hopeless; America was their only choice to get a better life.

Another reason is for religious reasons.            One reason that people came to America was because of the gold rush. The Chinese were in poverty and wanted to strike it rich. For example, in the text it said farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. The Chinese also left to flee from conflicts. For example, in the text it says they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.            Another reason is for religios reasons. The Jews moved for getting made fun of. For example, in the text it says Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. People from Holland moved for being greatly mistreated also. For example, in the text it says others came for religious freedom. People from Holland came to America for that.            In conclusion, immigrants from all over the world came to America. One reason was the gold rush. Another reason is for relious reasons. Happy Cultural Heritage Day!

People moved to America in the 1800's because of the the lack of jobs, food ; the avoidance of hunger and the Chinese mainly to find gold. America back then was well known for a fair country, the citizens in America got treated with more respect than for example in Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Russia and Poland, the Jews from their countries were not treated fairly for their beliefs. People in America didn't pay much attention to the Jew's religion as for in their country it was a 'bad' thing.                The first reason why immigrants traveled to America was the very little jobs in other countries. The people who immigrated to America would leave others behind with no working jobs nor a big population. People who were good at working mainly moved to America. without many people in some countries the jobs were no longer in service and everything started to fail little by little.             A more devistating reason was the lack of food provided in the countries. For example Southern Italians moved beacuse of faarming losses. When people farmed they provided food, but without them nothing was produced. There was also a food shortage in Ireland which killed millions of people. The immigration was not a very good thing to the people left behind in their countries. Everybody needs food to survive, most European people left and came to America to avoid starvation.            In 1848 gold was discovered by a man named John Sutter. The word of finding gold spread quickly, before you knew it hundreds of people traveled to California to find gold. A year later gold was discovered by a women 	VBG IN CD NN TO DT VBD RB NNP NNP VBD TO NNP IN DT CD POS IN IN DT DT NN IN NNS , NN : DT NN IN JJR CC DT NNP RB TO VB NNP NNP RB RB VBD RB VBN IN DT JJ NN , DT NNS IN NNP VBD VBN IN JJR NN IN IN NN IN NNP , CC NNP WP VBD IN NNP , NNP CC NNP , DT NNP IN PRP$ NNS VBD RB VBN RB IN PRP$ NNP NNP IN NNP VBD RB VB JJ NN TO DT NNP POS NN IN IN IN PRP$ NN PRP VBD DT JJ '' NNP NNP JJ NN WRB NNS VBN TO NNP VBD DT JJ JJ NNS IN JJ NNP NNP NNS WP VBN TO NNP MD VB NNS IN IN DT VBG NNS CC DT JJ NNP NNP WP VBD JJ IN VBG RB VBN TO NNP IN JJ NNS IN DT NNS DT NNS VBD DT NN IN NN CC NN VBD TO VB JJ IN NNP DT JJR VBG NN VBD DT NN IN NN VBN IN DT NNP NNP NN NNP NNP VBD NN IN VBG NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP VBN NN , CC IN PRP VBG VBD NNP NNP VBD RB DT NN NN IN NNP WDT VBD NNS IN NNP NNP NN VBD RB DT RB JJ NN TO DT NNS VBN IN IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBZ NN TO VB , JJS JJ NNS VBN CC VBD TO NNP TO VB NNP NNP CD NN VBD VBN IN DT NN VBN NNP NNP NNP NN IN NN NN NN RB , IN PRP VBD PRP VBZ IN NNS VBN TO NNP TO VB NNP DT NN JJ NN VBD VBN IN DT NNS	1		20131024091006	2352	1		20131024091014	2372	1

What would've you done? The Europeans were staving, no freedom  for religion,  and they had no jobs.

People who could build, farm, and could invent things came to America.With the new technology there was lots for them to do.   Chinese people immigrated to America because the Gold Rush   started. When the Gold Rush started the Chinese people moved to America because they needed money for crops and cotton. If they had no cotton they would have no clothes or blankets. If they had no blankets they would get cold. But when they immigrated to America they were in big groups so it made if noticeable so people started to join on. They had no food so more that one million immigrants died of starvation.   The second half of the 1800 was a time of great change in    America. The first railroad crossed the United States was complete in 1869. This meant it was easier to get around and move lumber. People could travel on these trains. People could travel on boats too. It was much easier and faster. The printing press was invented. That is when you can stamp something without having to write it. also newspapers were invented. this was when news came out for everyone to see. The telegraph and the telephone was invented. the telegraph is was when you wrote a message and sent it off like mail, and a telephone was a phone you call some one on.   The Gold Rush was a time period when Chinese people   moved to America. The Chinese people went to California to look for gold.They needed gold for money to get cotton for clothes and blankets. It involved two wars between Britain and China. They were battling over the gold. They were also rebailing against the government. The war was over who got the most gold.   Some countries need gold or have wars. The gold rush was   important. It was important because it helped find gold. China needed gold for food and clothing. The war will stay in history forever.

Immigrants came to America for many reasons. Some were 'pushed' to America by conflicts and harsh enviroment; while others were 'pulled' to America by the religious freedom and many  jobs. I would like to explain how these immigrants came to America and their stories.        Imagine this: you are a German child living in a world with harsh weather, no religious freedom, and tons of conflict. Your family cannot take your country anymore and decides to leave Germany for America. In this situation you are being 'pushed' to America. Irish immigrants were 'pushed' from their country due to crops failing and a shortage of food. After that, many other Europeans left to go to America so they didn't die of starvation. Other immigrants also left for religious freedom because America was known as the land of freedom. Some immigrants left their home countries to escape the war and find jobs. Over fiftey years 26 million immigrants were in the US. A majority of the immigrants were 'pushed' to America.        Imagine this: you are living in China, when word comes to you that in America there is riches beyond your belief. You pack your stuff and buy the next ticket to America, the land of freedom. In this case, you are being 'pulled' to America. Many immigrants left for America because of all the oppourtunities to become famous and rich. At this time, most of the inventors were immigrants. Famous scientist, Albert Einstien was an immigrant from Germany searching for a job. Many of the Chinese sailed to America because of the gold rush in California. Other immigrants left for jobs to support their family. Lots of immigrants were 'pulled' by America's jobs and riches.        After reading this passage you will be able to understand why immigrants came to America and their stories. When immigrants came the population flourished and the amount of production blasted up. Before immigration, not a lot of people were born outside of America, but after immigration a majority of the population was born outside of the US. I think immigration truley made a majoe impact on the united states.

Now lets go back in time to when many new things were happening such as the Gold Rush and the industrial revolution. during the 1800s many immigrants traveled to America ship after ship. the many reasons they might have come here may have been because of the profound freedom they may have here from high taxes or because of their specific religious belief, or maybe it was because of the double in population, hunger, harsh environment,wars or other conflicts. These are known as ''pushes'' beacuse these things happening  their homeland pushed them to find a new home. There are also things called 'pulls'. ''Pulls' may include jobs,wealth,opportunities,access to resources, and freedom. these are called pulls beacuase it made the immigrants get pulled into America.Now we fast forward in time to the Gold Rush. in 1849 a man named John Sutter found gold along the American River on his property.despite his intentions of keeping his discover a secret word soon reached San Fransisco. By january 1849 many people were sailing and taking wagons from all over the world to get their hands on some of ''Sutter's gold'', however many of them were unlucky and went home even more broke than before. In this time though, more than 70,000 miners and their families arrived in america increasing the population quite a bit.in conclusion, almost everything in America doubled,if not tripled, between the years of 1860 and 1910 ,and still today many of the proud Americans still live here because of their immigrant ancestors and their brave decissions.

They needed to work in new factories,  to farm and building on land, and to invent things too.The Immigrants can do them all of that stuff.       Just before the American Civil War in 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America.They kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland their crops had failed, especially their potato crop. More than 1 million people died  from starvation in Ireland.It was very sad for them all.   There was a food shortage for them. Also some people got dived out of their home, incude very harsh environment, wars, and other things.Last but least some of them want freedom most of all.       Gold! In 1848 gold was discover along the American river in California by a man name John Sutter.He try to keep it a secret, but the word out. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousand people came for the gold.more than 70,000 adventurers arrived in 1849.The 'Forty- Niners'were 325 men from China who came for the gold.

It all so talked about that they invent came in to America in ship after ship after ship. There were technology in the 1800s and there were plenty for them to do. There are allso many people (That was 1.7 million Irish men,women, and children.) There's also a part of this befor the American Civil War in the 1860s there was all ready one-fourth of the population of Ireland came to America.        Now on the Sources#2 is that it says that the second half of the 1800s is the time fo the greats change in Americ. There was the very first railroad that croos the United States wich it was finnished in 1869. For the people that wont to take a trip to a other place became shorter and easier for many people. That the advances in the transpor tation made it possible for people totravel more easily. There was also a quickly widely information that traveledin the 1800s.        For Sources#3 it talks about the Gold Rush that a Grown up men named John Sutter khow discovered the Gold Rush in 1848 in the American River. Then one year past then over 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849. Later there was 325 men from China among these 'Forty-Niners'. Like the people who came from the eastern United States, and the Chinese hoped to fined fortune. The most of the wave of China's south coast.        Now for Sources#4 is all about the peoeple who lived i the U.S. and the people who came to the U.S. It's talking about the year in 1860-1910 to see the Growth of people of who came to the U.S.The reason that ti was talking about the Growth like this 31,513,000 people in 1860 then 92,407,000 people in the 1910. Like this the Number of daily newspapers 387 in1860 and the 2,600 newspapers in1910. This is all about th Growth of numbers.        Now this is for Sources#1,2,3,4 all the Sources have some thing in comein thay all related to the past in the 1800s and the 1900s. Soueces #1 is all about the History of the U.S. and Recostruction. For the Souerces #2 is all about the web sits to find ot moer information about the Changes in America. Now for the Sources #3 is all about the Gold Rush with the Chinese. Now the Sources#4 is all about the numbers of people.

First the Irish immigrants moved because of the American Civil War, and their crops were destroyed. Many people from Eureope came to America to find food and jobs. Other people came to America for religious freedom. Many people came to escape the wars. Over 26 million immigrants came to the United states  in over 50 years.           Next some immigrants migrated because of the 'Push and Pull,' and the improved transportation. Some other people left because of wars. Some people left because of wealth or jobs. Other people left to America because of the floods. People also laft because of the Gold Rush.           Finally, people left because of he miles of railroad tracks. People also migrated because of the number of daily newspapers. Also, the coal production in America is in tons. the people left because of the number of people in a city. People migrated because of the population in Eureope.           In conclusion, these are the reasons I wrote about immigrants. It tells everyone how and why they migrated.

UN- reliable food sources in Ireland, hard living conditions in England, and religious restraints in Germany. the only place anyone could think to move to is America. America was full of advantages that people took for granted. The popular America was changing rapidly. the gold rush started and even more people fled into America. the people that fled knew very little about the America, but they knew they had freedom there.          many people were very pleased with their switch, but some others were regretting it. some people even moved back to their homeland, or just rebelled against the American government. whatever, the case may be America was a relief for many people and i am honored to be a citizen of this life changing country!! :) :)                 	NNP NNP DT CD DT NNS IN JJ NNS VBD VBG NN CC NN IN DT NN .

All the people needed food, homes, and jobs so they came over here to find homes, jobs, and tried to avoid hunge. Other people came here just to have religious freedom. this included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. (Jew people were often mistreated for their belief in their homes countries.) still other peaople came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total 26 million immigrants arrived in United states over 50 year perode. think about those 26 million!. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America exept that it was a land of freedome. Thats wat all the people wanted freedom and to work and make some money. The secound half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores transporting improved. The first railroad that croSsed the United states was complete in 1869. It made it easier when people and silver or lumber they put there stuff in the train and go to United states it was much faster then if they went on a boat or what ever there use to come to United states. 31,513,000 people lived in U.S in the 1860 that is a lot of peple who lived hern at the time the railroads were long they were 30,626 in 1910 the railroads were 240,293 now thats a lot. In 1910 92,407,000 people lived in U.S thats is a bunch people who lived in the cities in the 1860 was 6,216,518 you think thats a lot well in 1910 people lived in the cities was 41,998,932 now thats a lot.

The question is, why did they move from Europe to America. There are several reasons why. Most of the immigrants were German and the other was Irish. The Irish moved here because the crops there were failing. We called this The Potato Famine. Their people were dying from starvation. The Germans moved here because they could not find any jobs. In America, they became entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur is a person who starts their own business.               Another big immigration was China. China moved here because they also couldn't find jobs. During the 1850's, they started on a railroad track. The track extended from the eastern part of America to the western part of America. The Chinese were a big help with it. The railroad track took 15 years to complete.             The last big migration of immigrants were the Jews. The Jews were treated harshly for what they believed in. Russian Jews were worked to death and they starved to death.Even the Jews in America were treated harshly. Most of Americas population today are mostly Jews but they don't get treated badly like back then. During WWII, Adolf Hitler prisoned the Jews and put them in concentration camps. Very few survived. Hitler believed in people with blue eyes and blond hair. He hated the Jews because they did not have blue eyes. They would stick needles in their eyes to change the color of them.

Back in 1848, along the American River in California John Sutter had discovered Gold!  Even though he tried keeping it a secret, the word about the find had soon reached San Francisco. After the exciting news hundreds and hundreds of people had set out to the American River. By then, the word had gotten around the U.S. and to other parts of the world. Around January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travelers were headed straight for California. That's when the Gold Rush had begun.            70,000+ adventuerous travelers full of hope finnaly arrived in CA in 1849. WOW it took one whole year to get to CA! Among 'Gold MIners' were 325 men from China. Next came another year and more Chinese came and then the next year came and more and more Chinese came.Like people who came from Eastern U.S., the Chinese hoped to find great fortune waiting for them in the CA hills.              Hopelessly, people listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. People had called CA 'Gold Mountain' because to them it seemed like a land of unbelivable wealthiness. They said they would go, make their fortunes, and return back to China. Throughout China news spread about Gold Mountain and many people wanted to join. Thats why people moved to CA because of the Gold Rush.           	NNP PRP VB WRB NNS VBN TO NNP . NNP , PRP NNP NNP VBD TO NNP IN IN DT NNP NNP .

The Germans made the largest group of the immigrants, but the Irish were the largest immigrants of the group and there were1.7 million Irish in America mens, womens, and childrens. When the Civil War started in the 1860's, the Irish were desperate because their crops died and especially the potato crops. More than 1 millon people died of starvation in Ireland.          Later in the 1800's, people started to come from other countries that had not sent many people to America before. It included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The populations increase between 1750 and 1850. All of the extra  people needed homes, jobs, and food. They were all hunger, but they were trying to avoid the food and try something else.           When the second half of the 1800's, it was changing in America. Industryal immigrants arrived on the America's shores and was transported to their city. In the United States, they made railroad tracks that cross all around the world. It was more easy than walking and starving in the hot or cold weather, but now they have railroad tracks to relax and eat along the way to travel to somewhere else.             When there was citys and buildings, it was rapidly changing and going fast because there was steam power everywhere. People came more aware of the world around them because it was more easy for them to travel instead of walking all day long. In this environment, there was going to be wars and other conflicts that other people are trying to access jobs and freedoms.

The way they did that was by crossing the boarder by jumping the gates just to come to America.           When people got here and some got caught by the law or by having drugs or going to jail. Some of them were looking for homes so they can hide for a long time like going to friends houses or even on the streets.

One of the reasons was, there was the California Gold Rush. Many people from China decided to immigrate to America for gold.               Another reason people moved to America is, transportation improved. The first railroad in the United States was completed in 1869. This made it easier to transport resources such as, silver. These trains and other new transportation made it easier for people to transport things and to travel easier.                The new print press design made more print books and newspapers less expensive. This made people more aware of news and ideas in the United States.                  Another reason people immigrated to the United States in the 1800s is, there was much more new technology, factories, farms, and to invent things such as, the telephone. Some people immigrated to the United States because they were trying to avoid leading to starvation.                    Some people even came to the United States for religious freedom. America was known as the land of freedom. They came because what they wanted was, freedom and work. They needed a chance to work. They also came to America for coal production.                     Some people came to America because their crops failed and there was a food shortage. Some people came for homes. Some people came to America to escape wars that led them to an unstable life.                      A lot of people came for wealth, and opportunities. They would have better access to resources and harsh conditions. They also came so they wouldn't have violent attacks. They all came for a new life for family and themselves in America in some way.

I decided to do a essay explaining why immagrants moved to America.           To begin with, One reason that immagrants moved to America maybe was because of war. People started coming from Europian countries like Russia, Italy and more. It was hard because they had to have a home and food and Jobs and there wasn't enough of them in Europe. Many Europians came for work so they coukd get money fot food. So they could avoid hunger. Some came from religious freedom. People from Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland and more. They came to escape wars that were hard to live through.           Next, twenty six million immagrants moved to the United states. Those people knew very little about America. Except the fact that it was the land of freedom. They wanted freedom and the chance to work and earn money. The second half of the Eight teen hundreds was great. Industry grew and immagrants moved more and more into America.           Finally, Now there had been more immagrants it would be easier to move silver and lumber from east to west. The trips became shorter and easier. Travelers could now catch a train that would take them to a boat. A trip to America would have taken so much longer in earlier times. But new steamships make the trip faste. The advances in transportation made it easier for people to travel quicker. People became more intersted in the world around them with the ability to travel distances.       In conclusion, The eighteen hundred changed a lot from the first half to the second half. The first half they didn't have as many people and were just getting immagrants. The second have of the eighteen hundreds had increased im people. They had gotten over twenty six million immagrants.

There is a reason for every thing that you will ever do. During the 1800s, many immagrants that could invent or people who could biuld great farm for money would come to America. Those people were mostly needed for the new factories, and to invent new things.Immagrants did all of that  very very hard work.They also came over because of push and pull factories. like when the gold rush happend. Now you know why immagrants came to america.

That is called immigration. Immigration is when someone is born outside the United States, (China, Japan, Mexico), and brought in. After 50 years, over 26 million immigrants moved in the United States. They came to the United States for one thing, freedom and a chance to work, and that's what they got. That's why we are celebrating Cultural Heritage Day.

Others, like the gold rush, were used for greed and pride, not for survival.  In this paper, I will talk about why the immigrants came, for good or bad.            Many people from all over the world came to America during the Civil War and before.  Over all, the Germans made up the largest single group of all of the immigrants in America.  Right behind them, was the Irish. In the 1860's, one-fourth of Ireland's entire population came to America right before the Civil War.  SO many of them came because the crops in all of Ireland had failed, especially the potatoes.  Of the ones that didn't come to America, the three-fourths, 1 million men, women, and children died of starvation at that time.              Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary, all European countries, sent many people to America.  Before that, the population of Europe had rapidly increased, almost doubled, between the years of 1750 and 1850.  All of those people needed food, homes, and jobs, which were running very low.       Others came for freedom, which included people from Holland, German Jews, (Who were badly mistreated for their beliefs in Germany.)  Poland, and Russia, but there were still some who wanted to escape wars that ruined some people's lives and were unpredictable.

They came to America to work or to find a new life. Some of them got killed and some of them stayed alive. Most of them came during the Civil War. One-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America.                             They came cus every thing that they would have failed like there crops and there homes so they would come to America and people would build it for them so they were happy. So more and more came to America and get stuff out of us.                   In total there 26 million immigrants in the United states and over a 50 year period.

Irish came before the Civil war which was 1 fourth of their population that was 1.7 million men and women and children came. The Irish came for food  because the soil at Ireland is bad so the crops died; 1 million Irish died from starvation.

Well during the 1800s America had a big population boom because people from all over the world were coming to America for many different reasons including the gold rush.                                        People moved to America for two reasons either pushes or pulls. Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes, like wars,   conflicts, and more. Pulls are those features of life that attract people, like wealth, freedom and more.                                         During the 1800s there was a lot of new technology which opened up more   jobs for people. Many people in different countries were at war so came to America for peace. Some people even came for freedom. In 1848 gold was discovered and word was spread so people started rushing over here for gold.                                          During the 1800s people from all around the world came here to America for many reasons, including peace, freedom, new jobs, better technology, wealth and more.

Germans made up the the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's. Next to the Germans  the Irish were the largest immigrant group. More than 1 million people died in Ireland because of starvation. In the later 1800's people started to came from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population increased, all the extra people needed food and shelter and careers.        Others came for religious freedom. Like people from Holland, and Jews. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Most didn't know much about America besides it is a land of freedom. But all the people wanted was freedom and a chance to work.         The second half in the Americas was a period of changes. Many immigrants arrived on Americas shores and Transportation grew. Travers could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. In the earlier times it would have took mounts to get there. Steamships made it easier to get places in short amount of times.        By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California, the California rush had begun. Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangzhou, an area on China south coast. The Chinese government raised taxes. People felt homeless and they listened closely to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. Many people wanted to join the gold rush.        Number of people in the U.S, 31,513,000. Number of people who live in cities, 6,216,518. Number of people born outside of the U.S, 4,096,753. Coal production in tons,20,471,000. Miles of railroad tracks 30,626. 	VBG TO NNP VBD JJ .

Even if they didn't want religious freedoms, many people wanted to be able to do whatever they wanted.           The majority of Europeans came to be free. Freedom was something that made the Europeans want to come to America. A few things that might've made the Europeans want to leave Europe could've been wanting places to work so the could pay for food.

And in time! With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. In the later 1800s, people started comeing from other European countries that not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. the population of Europe doubled between 1750. All those extra people needded food, homes, and job-and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Think about that-26 million!. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. The seconed half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. People could travle on these trains too. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. This was true in Europe also. Travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advances in transportation made it possible for more people to travle more easily. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. Although sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundred of people left the city to set off for the American River. The news spread to the rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world as well. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. The California  gold rush, had begon.  The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the biginning. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then suddenly they came in greater numbers: 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States, and they had played a critical part in building the first transcontinental the country,77% of them were in California.

As well as changing the place for benifits and then we got more people too come and are population has expanded by many humans. The gold mine in California ruined alot of inportant things, but when they fixed it up there population expanded as well. All those imagrents like the chinesse are better now thanks to America and thanks to those small moments we now have succeded are world. Thank You!

Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.               Next to the Germans , the Irish were the largest immigrant group. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the united states over a 50 year period. in the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. more than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California in 1849. among these 'forty-niners' were 325 men from china. most of this first wave of Chinese came from Guangzhou, an area in china`s south coast the exciting news about Gold mountain spread throughout china. many people wanted to join the gold rush in the 1860 there were 30,626 miles of railroad tracks then in the 1910 there were 240,293 miles of railroad tracks in the 1860 there were 387 numbers of daily newspaper and then in 1910 there were 2,600 numbers of daily newspaper they were needed  to work in the new factories , to farm and build on the land, and to invent things . immigrants did all that.           Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. before the American civil war in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. in the later 1800s, people started coming from the other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. this included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. the population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. all those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs -- and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. many Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger.           others came from religious freedom. these include people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. still others came to escape wars escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. think about that -- 26 million! most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. but that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. this was also true in Europe also. travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. Hungarians, Greeks, poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the united states.

The new phone and printing press made it easier to communicate with the rest of the country. In most countries there was war, poverty, starvation and no freedom.

Well people are moving to America because of the work for there family won't die of starvation. Others move here because of religous freedom. In other places work was hard to find but in America everybody was asking you if you wanted to work for them. Immagrants came for everywhere . In the 1800s Eurapeans made the biggest imagrant group. People who didn't have religous freedom came to America to have it. Thats why people were moving here to America. 	NNS IN DT IN DT NN VBD RB TO NNP NNP NNS VBP PRP '' WRB VBP PRP VBG TO NNP .

I will include why they came and what they had to go threw to come here.                                                                           First, I'll describe why the immagrants came to America. They first came to America because they needed a job. Luckily the 1800s were a time of technology and the could of worked in the new factories, farming and building on lands, and inventing things. They needed money to feed their families. They also came because the needed food to feed their families and themselves. Some even came in seek of freedom from their country and religiously. After industries grew more people came in search of work. When they came it was great because a new way of transportation was invented, the railroad, subway, or train. This was great because it was a faster way of transportation than walking. The main reasons they came were jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. The final reason they came was the gold rush. They came to the gold rush because they really needed the gold because they were really poor. Those were the reasons why they came to America.             Now I will explain what they needed to go threw to get here to America. They needed to first find a ship or boat that was going to America(that was the only thing available for them). They needed to go in storage class, where it was all crowded and cluttered. In order to get to America the needed to be well as in not ill because they were afraid that you would spread your illness like a virus( if ill you would be forced to return from wherever you came from). It was a dream for some but a nightmare for others. Once you got to Borneo Island you reached your long anticipated journey of getting to the land of opportunity, America.              That was my article on why immigrants moved to America. The dream, hope, tragedy, and the unbelievable truth that your now there.

Curtural Heritage Day is about how people came to America to fight for us.Different people went to battle like the Germans. We were going against Russia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and Hungary. All the other people needed homes, food, and jobs. Also they wanted freedom. There were around 6 million imagrents coming to the US.            This battle was around the 1800s. Most of the immigrants wanted to leave the strict rules in Eropes. Also the Southern Italians. Around that time there was a gold rush and it was discovered on the American river in Ca on the property of a man named John Sutter. He tried to keep it a secret but it spreaded like bees. The word spreaded to San Francisco.            Now this is my essay of my opinion so in conclusion I am happy that there is a holiday for those people.

Travelers now could catch a train that would take them to the boat. These advance in transportation made it possible for a lot of people to travel more easily.People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distance easily.The reasons why they move is because characterized as pushes and pulls.Many of the European Immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses to lower price.

Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong,an area on China's south coast. They were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.In the middle of the 1800s,Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britain. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in california, on the property of a man named  John Sutter. The 325 Chinese who joining the gold ruch in 1849 were just the beginning. Then suddenly they came in greater numbers: 2,716 in 1851, and20,026 in 1852.

It was a journey for them to get here. Some of the people came to America for their family. Many of their countries must have had problems. Many of them needed a home. America is their home.       Many of the Europeans had to come here for very important reasons. Many of them were from different places. Most of the Europeans in the 1800s were Germans. Next to them were the Irish. The half of the Irish population from Ireland came here during and after the civil war because of food shortages and more than one million people died in Ireland because of that. In the later years more people came from different places in Europe. Some came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Many had to come here because of food shortages, over crowded population, freedom, work, and many things more. This is the land of opportunity and liberty.       More and more immigrants came to America. America has changed, the industry got bigger, there was more transportaion, more jobs, and more immagrants. Many people had to push themselves to come to America because they needed to. Others just pulled them selves             	TO VB , JJ NNS VBD RB IN NNP IN DT CD , PRP VBD TO VB RB IN IN JJ NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN PRP TO VB NNP NNP IN DT NNS VBD TO NNP IN PRP$ NNP NNP IN PRP$ NNS MD VB VBN NNP NNP IN PRP VBD DT NNP NNP VBZ PRP$ NNP NNP IN DT NNPS VBD TO VB RB IN RB JJ NNP NNP IN PRP VBD IN JJ NNP NNP IN DT NNPS IN DT CD VBD NNP NNP TO PRP VBD DT NNP NNP NN IN DT NNP NN IN NNP VBD RB IN CC IN DT NN NN IN IN NN NNS CC JJR IN CD CD NNS VBD IN NNP IN IN NNP NNP DT JJ NNS RBR NNS VBD IN JJ NNS IN NNP NNP VBD IN NNP , NNP , NNP , NNP , NNP , CC NNP NNP VBD TO VB RB IN IN NN NNS , IN VBN NN , NN , NN , CC JJ NNS NNP NNP VBZ DT NN IN NN CC NNP NNP CC JJR NNS VBD TO NNP NNP VBZ VBN , DT NN VBD JJR , EX VBD JJR NN , RBR NNS , CC JJR NNP NNP NNS VBD TO VB PRP TO VB TO NNP IN PRP VBD NNP NNP RB VBD PRP VBZ	2		20131023171019	2352	1		20131023171010	2483	2		20131025111021	2405	2

Also immagrants came to America to farm, build on land, and invent things.  The Germans made up of the most of the immagrants in the 1800s. Also the Irish were another group of immagrants.  Later people started coming from other European countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.  Over 26 million immagrants came to america in a 50 year period.  Thats what they wanted freedom and a chance to work.  Many Europeans wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and presecution.  Gold was dicovered in 1848 along the American river in California.  On a property of a man called John Sutter. Although he was keeping it a secret, word of the discovery reached San Francisco.  The news spread through out the rest of the united states of america.  Thats when the Gold rush began.  Mostly chinese dreamed of coming to California because of poverty and the legendery mountain of gold in California.  That was just the beginning Because 77% of chinese were part of the gold rush. Those are  the reasons people immagrated to the united states of america.

Moving from one country to another either from force or pleasure is referred to as Migration. Immigrant migrate either because they lost their jobs and are look for new ones or that they want to get away from war and conflict. During the last few centuries, migration to America has become more and more popular because America has lower unemployment rates, more money and product, and it just become better and better, Of course with all these things, word spread. And that's how it all started.             In 1790's America was known as a brand new country. So, people took advantage of that. By the 1800's Immigrants were coming by ship loads, looking for jobs and money. The largest group of immigrants were Germans. Then There were the Irish. The Irish came to America because they were desperate for fertile land. Potato crop failed, so they decided to grow them somewhere else, so they came to the new land. LAter  in the 1800's other races of people came. Soon enough, every kind of person from Europe came to America. Russian, Italian, Polish, and others came to America. Jewish people were killed off in Germany, so to avoid conflict, they migrated to America. Later on in that century, going to America became fairly easier.

Would you choose to stay or leave? This is the choice all people immigrating in the 1800s had to make. There are many reasons why people wanted to move to America in the 1800s. Some of them include the opportunities, freedoms, and what people can escape.     If one were to move from a country to America, one reason why they would be doing it is because of the opportunities they would gain. Firstly, they would be giving their children the opportunity to live a life free of poverty and depression. This is important because they will be happy knowing that their children will have a chance to be rich and without the knowledge of terrible things, such as homelessness. Secondly, they would be able to get a job. Unlike their country, where it is usually nearly impossible to get a job, they will be equally able to get a job as that of the person sitting next to them. Lastly, the person will be able to gain the opportunity to become rich, just like the Chinese hoped. This is important because they will be able to, just like Source #3 says, 'return proudly to China.' Not only would the person gain many opportunities, but many freedoms too.     To many people, freedom of many different things is extremely essential. This is one of the main reasons why people came to America. First of all, people would gain the freedom of religion. This is important because they will be able to practice their religious beliefs without having to worry about being punished. Second of all, they will gain the right to defend themselves in court. This is also important because in some countries, people aren't allowed to defend themselves and even if they are not guilty, they are sometimes sentenced to death. Last but not least, people will have the freedom to vote for their 'leaders.' Many people believe that it is important to be ruled by a fair leader, but when they are not able to vote, a cruel leader may come to power. People came to America in the 1800s for many reasons, one reason is because of what they can escape.     When people come to America, they not only think of the opportunities and freedoms they will gain, but also what they will escape. For example, people who live during times of war can escape to America. This is important because they will not have to worry about being killed by a bomb or weapon. Another example is that people who live with a lot of siblings and their family can't provide enough food for them can move to America. In America, there will be enough food for that person and so they won't starve to death. One last example is that the people can escape poverty. Poverty is a horrible thing. People can die of illnesses because of dirty environments. But in America, there are certain rules about living conditions, and the environment won't be as harsh.     Overall, there are many reasons why people moved to America from other countries such as the opportunites they would gain, the freedoms they would gain, and what they would escape.

There are different reasons why immagrants may have came to America. Those reasons are called push and pulls.        Pushes are the reasons why people had to migrate to America. A push may have been people running out of food because of a lack of farmland. Another push may have been people wanting to find jobs in the new land. Finally, people may have had to come to America for freedom during wars.        Pulls are things that make people want to come to America. One pull may have been to practice their religeon. Another pulls may have been for new opportunities in life. One major pull was the Gold Rush, many people had high hopes in getting rich in America.        Push and pulls are the reasons why people came to America. They may have came for opportunities or wealth. They may have been forced to come to America because of war or lack of food.

Workers came to america for the new technology which was enoygh for them. They worked at new factories to farm, build on land, and to invent things. people moved over here to get better jobs and maybe the laws were to harsh for them. for example, the new europeans want ed to leave europe because it was harsh over there. Maybe some people wantd to go to america to get a new job otherwise they would go hungry.            All the rest of the people who don't have jobs neededfood, homes, and a job before they dies with starvation or they get a really bad cold because it was raining and they had no shelter to keep them warm. More than 1 million people got so hungry but they couldn't because they had no job so they had to starve and die. Others came for religious freedom because some countries can be cruel to the citizens. some of the countries were from Holland, Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Some escaped the wars and made thier life unpredictable.            The people that moved would really miss thier friends, but the good thing is that you could still make new friends from a different school. It's good for the people who are from  a different country to get a good and better job.

There was a time period where many immigrants from all over the world were moving to the United States. They moved because of the harsh environment they were living in, wars or conflicts, and poverty or they want to seek a better life. There are two different reasons why they moved. They are known as pushes and pulls. Pull is features that attract people.Pushes are feature that push the people from their home.              There were many reasons why immigrants choose the United States. During the 1800s industry grew, transportation improved, and had new technology. Immigrants came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. They needed food, homes, and jobs. They also came here to find work and and avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom. Some Chinese immigrants came to the United States because that time the gold rush had begun. They called America the Gold Mountain, shortly they heard good news about California and many immigrants wanted to join the gold rush.              Many immigrants also came to the United States because they were pushed here. The Irish, for example came during and after the war because their crops failed and there was a food shortage. Many Europeans wanted to escape harsh conditions , Russian-Jews wanted to escape prejudice and violent attacks. Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses.              Immigrants came to the United States for many reasons.

So ya here it is:   So around the 1800's a lot of people migrated from other countries to America. Many people did this because well we have a lot to offer here such as more jobs, better home's, and of course we have more rights then other people have in other places. Another reason why people moved to America is because a lot more people knew how to build, work, invent, and farm. With that said there was a lot of job opportunities, and with the technology that was being invented there was a lot for them to do. Some immigrants worked in factories, on farms, built land, and helped people invent things.   Most of the people that were immigrants in the 1800's were Germans. Before 1860(the American Civil War) a forth of the people of Ireland(1.7 million Irish people) came to America. Many people were desperate because crops started to fail or there were a lot of food shortages. Around the later 1800's more people from different parts from all over the world started migrating to America. Some of these places included Russia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and many other places. It almost seemed as if everyone wanted to move to America. As i said in the beginning most people came for jobs and better homes but they also came for religious freedom. In the end almost 26 million immigrants moved to the United States in a 50 year period. That was honestly a lot of people but whats important is to remember that all those people moved here because we were the land of freedom.

With all of the technology in the 1800's there was plenty for them to do. Immigrants did alot of things, they worked in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Germans made up large single groups. The Irish were the largest immigrant group. In the 1860's one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. Irish people were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed and most likely the potatoe crop. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800's Europeans came to America. Also other countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe was alot more between 1750 and 1850.

Several simply needed food, homes, and jobs, and they found it here. Workers who could invent, farm, or construct came to America. The technology we produced gave opportunities. They worked in factories, farmed and built on land, and invented. Those people were called immigrants.               Industry grew even more as more immigrants arrived. Transportation improved for the railroad that crossed the U.S.A. was finished. Then, steam power and the redesign of the printing press made many cheap books and newspapers. This produced news and ideas available to more people. Soon, the telegraph was invented and so was the telephone, which created faster communcation. People moved more than ever before. Environments, battle zones, and poverty drove them away from their homes. However, as the saying goes, 'Whenever one door closes, another door opens.'

Well, put your feelings aside because this is not about you. This is about the people who migrated to America and how they actually affected America itself not like you just affecting your neighborhood or your class. There were many reasons for these immigrants to come to America. Some came for religion, while others came to escape from poverty, especially during the Gold Rush. Many came for a new life in America away from the troubles of their home country. Large amounts of people from all around the world come to America, giving it diversity in culture, food, and clothing.                 It began around the 1800's, where in America, newcomers could build, farm, and invent where free land was vast and not very polluted. There were new factories to be built, industries to rise, and people just waiting to become rich and famous. The largest groups of immigrants in the 1800's were the Germans and the Irish, especially the Irish, for their crops were failing, thus resulting in a food shortage, creating hunger and starvation, which would lead to death, but back to the point. Later that same century, people from the other European countries, such as Russia, Italy, the other countries in Europe.Then there were the ones who cam from places that were full of war and small amounts of religious freedom. In the end of about a 50 year period, about 26,000,000 people in America were immigrants. Seeing America today, well, that's still a lot.                 And who could forget the time in the world when your home county seemed horrible and America seemed like the best place in the world. This was the time when industry 'boomed', and the San Franciscan people might say, for their town is the 'Booming City' or something like that. This was the time when the first U.S crossing railroad came out, when people had and easier time transporting resources, when steamships were invented. It was also the time when the telegraph and the telephone was invented, making the steam printing-pressed news travel faster. During this time was what we call push and pulls. Pushes were the things that pushed people out of their country, such as war, conflict, and the things that people don't like,  while pulls were the things that pulled them into a new place, full of attracting things like freedom, opportunities, and freedom.

Some of them were pulled to America and some were pushed to America. Pushed meant the people had a hard time and wanted to move. Pulled meant the they were attracted to it and was sucked in. In this essay, I will be telling you why the immigrants moved to America.                      A reason why the immigrants moved to our country is so they can have a good life in America and not their home country. They were either torture,  poor, had shortages, and more in their country, but in America they had their own rights and they were not tortured by others. For example: Europeans wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. this is one example of a push to America. Another example of a push is: Southern Italians suffered from birth rates and lower prices in Italy. one last example is that the Chinese were not able to pay taxes and could not produce enough rice for everyone in their party.                     Last reason why the outsiders came to America is so they can find gold. Many people were poor in their country. A lot Chinese moved to America because they were so attracted to gold an they were so poor. This is one example of a pull to America. People who found gold at the gold rush were named 'Forty-Niners'. When they found gold they shouted 'EUREKA'. Chinese called California a 'GOLD MOUNTAIN'. People also got change in their currency. Another example is that  when many people found out about the GOLD RUSH, they immediately packed up and went there. One last example is that everyone wanted to go to America for its natural features.                    In conclusion, I think the people who immigrated to America made a good decision. Them immigrating made America have a very huge population and hopefully it is still growing today. The people who immigrated changed their lives in a good way. the bad thing is that they had to change their way of life in America this is why people immigrated to America.

One of them would to escape poverty or the conflicts going through their home country. Another reason would be for a fresh start,since America had several job openings at the time.The last reason would be for the freedom and the lure of gold or wealth.       In the 1800s, Europe's population had doubled,and many people were sent to live in America. Poverty had taken hold, and several Europeans came to avoid starvation. People needed homes and food. Jews had fled to America,since they were mistreated for their beliefs and were persecuted. Many others came to escape the wars going on in their country,that made life unstable. The Irish left because of failing crops and Southern Italians suffered farming losses.        Many more Europeans wanted a fresh start.America was a land of oppurtunity. It had several job openings in factories,farms,and many more.

These people are called immigrants. These immigrants either came because they were 'pushed', which meant that they had to migrate because they were driven out of their homeland with wars, poverty, and other conflict, or they were 'pulled' which meant they were attracted by features of life, like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.?                      Crops were failing, there was a horrible food shortage. Desperate Irish immigrants migrated into America. The Chinese migrated to California in hopes for a better fortune and to participate in the Gold Rush, and European immigrants escaped harsh conditions in Europe. In the same period of time, people from Holland and Jews who cam from Germany, Poland, and Russia also moved to America to flee from wars that made things very inconvenient and to keep from being mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.

Then, in 1910, the population was 92,407,000. Immigrants came from China because of the Gold Rush in California. Also,people came from Europe, a lot of people came from there. Those people came because Europe  was large and it was really crowded, that was the big and obvious reason. By 1910, 26 million people had immigrated to the United States.

Well, these are some reasons how your life would be if you we're a immigrant .            If you are a immigrant person , your life might be very difficult to you . Your life might be very difficult because if you don't have papers and you want to come to America , it is going to be hard for you to pass the border . For example , many immigrant people have been going throw deserts and taking 3 or more days to came to America , but some people have been arrested or being killed by the border patrol because the border patrol don't care about the immigrant people .                  Also, many people have gone throw deserts to come to  America because they could have there children in America or there family .In the other hand , some people have papers and they could come to America which there life is easier than the immigrants . Many other people that are not immigrant they help immigrant people to pass the border by letting barrow there papers to pass . Some people want to pass to America , but they can't because they don't have paper but if they do they could risk there life .                One other reason , is that if you we're a immigrant and you were in America already , your life could wouldn't be that much hard because your in America , but you wanted to work in a good place they wouldn't accept you because you don't have papers and because you weren't born in America , and if don't have a work you wouldn't have money for yours and feed them . And you will be working the streets or in jobs that only pay you like 50 dollars a week .        All in all , if you are not a immigrant your life is easier , but if you are a immigrant your life is going to be harder .       	NNP PRP RB VBD WRB PRP$ NN MD VB IN PRP PRP VBP DT JJ .
