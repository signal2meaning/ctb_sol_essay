They find artifacts from way back in history when George Washington was alive and artifacts from Jamestown Island. They used many tools to keep the artifacts safe and in great condition. In this report you will learn what the archeologists found and used to give you history we learn today!!!       In 1994, a group of people were interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeologists Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.       The first objects were found in 1861. They found uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. That's when they finally found James Fort!       The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. The archeologists also found eleven cellars and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. Today, the group finds nearly one million objects each year!       Archeologists used a lot of tools. Most of them were used to clean off dirt off the artifacts. They used picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels.       I hope you learned a lot about archeologists and someday you will be one too!!!

The frist objects were found in 1861 over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.the National park service led five years study of the area to figure out how the land was used. they used computers mapping software to make an image of the area. that's when they finally found james fort! the first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. the mark's showed where the fort's walls used to be.                           digging up george washing's past                            Then some archeolgists where interested in washington's past you may think you know about washington's past but you don't you know about when he was a soldier he is about his past befor he was a soldier george live in a place called ferry farms over 12,000 years  washington first moved there when he was six no one knew where washington home was located  since the actual building was long gone  they say the stone base was still there they started digging in 2003   	IN DT NN PRP VBZ IN NNS CC WRB PRP VBD NN NNS CC NN POS JJ .

The job of a archeologist is a long process with teams up to 35.Archeologist use some of the most common tools.   They use pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel and a trowel.Each one has it's own use.               The shovel and pick are for digging close to the artifact and are use to start a dig.The whisk is used to clean the   artifacts and get dirt away from the site.A dustpan is with the whisk and is to hold small amounts of dirt.Knife is the   tool for careful digging around the artifact.           A wheelbarrow,skim shovel and trowel is not as important but are still helpful to have.a wheelbarrow is used to   move large amounts of dirt from one place to other places in the area and a skim shovel is to take thin layers of soil in   each scoop.A trowel is the most common tool to the archeologist used to cut layer of soil.             Archeologist had found many things.They found fort James and Washington's house to.It took 100 year after they start looking for fort James to find it.At fort James they also found a ditch in fort James full of junk.          At washington's house they found many things. They found coins,pottory and a pipe.The last thing they found was the main house at Ferry Farm.

They can study mostly anyones life presidents from the past famous people who have did things that nobody had ever done.              Like the life of 2 people and when they where smallthey were best friends and they had promissed each other to stay togeter and never argue on other things.      When that person left the kindergarton that she left and returned until 4th grade and we had became friends again.          During all those years not together we talked about the school she went and when she was in Montesino. And when she was telling me something a nice girl caame and she was our friend when ever one of us were gone she would take that persons place and she would play with that person who was my two best friends. Untilthe school year was ending she had to move to another school because her mom didn't want her to be there anymore, so that was the time when the person and her friend had to be together alone again and we still miss her.          And when she had left the persons friend had to go a watch what someone was dong and then she saw that person playing a game with a boy and she had told her a question and then she ask her if that person liked the  boy and she had tooken a while and said yes she did llike that boy. And when it was Valentines Day our teacher switched seats and that person had to sit with the person who she liked.The boy and the girl got along together.

They look for artifacts that may be helpful for their research. They find items like armor, and weapons. They also found at Fort James the floors and buildings at the site of Fort James. The archeologists also used some of these items to help look for artifacts.            They used a pick and a shovel these tools were to help them dig down to the artifacts, They used a whisk and a dustpan these tools were to help to brush dirt off the artifacts to get a better look, They used a knife to help scrap the dirt off from around the artifacts, They used a wheelbarrow to help them to move items from one place to another and helped to move dirt from one place to another, They used a skim shovel to help them to remove a thin layer of dirt for each scoop, and the last item they used was a trowel this helped them so they could scrap and cut soil to look at the different layers of soil.            Other archeologists will dig up George Washington's past. What I mean by that is they dig up George Washington's childhood. George Washington lived at Ferry Farm as a boy so archeologists dig there. But no one knew where the house was exactly located. They started looking for the site in 2003.            It took over a year but they found it.

A archeologists job is to look and discover artifacts.they use tools to clean or find or carry them.The pick and shovel is so they can go into the earth and look for artifacts.The whisk and dustpan is to clear dirt off of artifacts and to clear dirt from the excavation site.The knife is  to scrape dirt from the artifacts.The wheelbarrow is to carry heavy things from one place to another.The skim shovel is to remove a thin layer of dirt.The trowel is the most used tool the trowel is to pick up different layers of dirt and examine it.               ARTIFACTS            Archeologists like to discover things from the past.Witch is why they look for these things called artifacts.Artifacts are old things from the past.Artifacts give hints if the thing there looking for is near.An archeologists job is to discover things from long ago.             WHAT DO ARCHEOLOGISTS LIKE TO DISCOVER?           Archeologists like to discover famous people or historic things around earth.

They had added new thing to  protect enemies from there ships.Artifacts were found in 1861. they had made images of the area to. And they found fort James.They saw drawings and read stories about it to. Also they were ledges that were made for canons also they were sellers , burial sites, and buildingswith forts . they were  objects like potery, coins, and toys. James fort had struggled year with little food . These information  tells a lot about James Fort.         People had  lived in Fery farm over 12,000 years.George Washington father was Augustine Washington. George had moved away when he wasjust six years old.No one new were he exacty moved for surethey so they started to find artifacts in 2003.In aYear they finall foundit and they started to dig.The first thing they found was a kitchen , slave quarter , and astorge house. Then a few years later they had found a main farmhouse. Then they found  four othe houses on the ferry farm and one of them was Georges Washington farm house. In Washingtons farmhouse that thier was a fire in the house. And they suggested there was a fire. Washington had smoked clay pipes which might of start the fire which gives proof.               To find James Fort Rcheologist had found had uncovered armor weapons. A group had found the exact spot where the fort was. Then the groups had found the spot and built it again. The National Park Service studied it and  figured how to use the land. Then they tried to Find proof of James Fort. With all the studing of James Fort ythey finally found it.They at least find 1 million things in th fort. And then the archeologist  knew that they Powhatan tribe that they had attacked them . With all the information with the past and ties of the peaople who had started the colonies. And they're life style.              They were curios about what george did in his life. So in 2003 they had started diging and looked for clues. To try to learn about Gearge they had used 3D maps. And other teams had focused diging for answers. The group had started diging which were called Trowelling. they had found his farmhouse. And then they had  made it to a work shop.               A lot of aarcheologist use tools. These tools are Pick, shovel, whisk,dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel , and a trowel. The pick and the shovel were used to dig in the earth to find artifacts. Then the whisk and dustpan areto clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knifes are used to scrap of dirt from the artifacts. The wheel barrow is used tocarry the dirt. The skim shovel is used  to scoop soil with each scoop. And the trowel is use to view the layrs of soil. And those are the Tools used by the archeologist.

Archeologists are people who find fosils and bones with teams using tools. Some tools an Archeologist might have are a pick and shovel, a wheelbarrow, trowl, and much more! Sometimes, it takes two weeks digging up a 25-square-foot section!            Some of the tools that Archeologists use are a Pick and Shovel, a Whisk and Dustpan, a Knife, a Wheelbarrow, a Skim Shovel and a trowl. I even went to the store and got to hold some of theese tools! the most common tool is the pick and shovel.            Another thing I learned about Archeology is it take a team. Sometimes it take two sets of eyes to find something. Some people even say is better with a team.            So you want to be an Archeologist? its a great job that make good money. Some people say that being an Archeologist is fun!     	DT NNP NNP DT NNP NNP DT NNP NNP PRP VB WP DT NNP VBZ .

Without archeology we wouldn't know anything about our past. In 'Finding Fort James,' and 'Digging up George Washington's Past,' archeologists teach us about the history of Fort James, and about George Washington as a boy. Not only does it teach us about our history, but it's interesting!          In 'Finding Fort James,' archeologists are searching for Fort James to find out if it really was washed out by a river. In there journey they find out where the fort was and they also find out a lot about how people's daily lives went, and how people survived. Without archeology we would know nothing about this.          In 'Digging up George Washington's Past,' archeologists are trying to find out more about George Washington's life as a boy. They believe that the stone base of George's house is still there. They use a high tech computer to track what is underground.                     Technology also helps archeologists find out about the past. People use analyzers and metal detectors to find things and figure out what things are.Thank goodness for technology.            As you can see the job of an archeologist is very important. without archeology there would be lots of trouble with finding out things like the problems  people had in the past and how do we prevent them.          In conclusion, without archeology we would know nothing about our past...Or anyone's past. 	DT NNP IN NNP IN NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WP NN MD VB IN IN PRP VBP NN IN PRP$ NN .

Learning About Digging Up History            This is what I have learned about George and is that well for starters he both worked really hard.    I would like to mention that he will never give up and not just for selfish reasons, but for people, the city, the (I might be exaggerating but) the world. Washington work very hard each and every day. That's exactly what citizens  need.A hero.            George Washington was a soldier and a great president. When Washington was a little boy about the age of six he moved to Ferry Farm. Though no one exactly new where he lived , archeologist thought the stone base under the house was still there. So they worked, worked, and worked ... and they have finally found the proof.  Mr.Washington smoked clay pipes, he does more like a hobby thing though.                                        Finding the Evidence            Archeologist work in many different orders to find proof. Some archeologist use three demential / 3D to track what is under ground. Though it will be easier using technology some scientist just do the actual digging process. Mentioning that Washington's events had hundred of years ago you ant take a quick guess that most of researh has been found from under ground.                                                            Ending Sentence For Today                         That is what I have learned through out the day and year the end. 	.

Archeologists can start groups likethe Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project this project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought thta the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.                   Archeologists also dig up things from the past, like a stone base. Archeologists believe that there was a stone base under George Washington's house!  George Washington grew up in his childhood home in Ferry Farm They started digging in 2003. It took them over a year to finish, however, when they finished the found a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. The found  the main farmhouse a few years later.                    An archeologist is a type of scientist that studies the past. Archeologist might just be still discovering the Underground Railroad or dinosuar bones. Without Archeologist we would probably know little abot George Washington or little about James Fort. Archeologist play a big part in learning.

Then I could go and make it a awsome police dog and it will hunt down crimanals and sniff the cloths of the the crimanal and smell bombs.Next I give one goodie.The dog is named srapy I got him from his mom and scrapies mom is named choo cha and the father is named smoke and scrapy and his mom are beige and the father is black.They are a big family and they all love to play frisby and take a shower when there dirty ya.But there kind of mean when there eating cause I each give them a bowl they wont eat that gives me on my nerves.         Then I would put a potion that they come faster and that they can run like flash.I was hopping that it will work and so I grabed my dog srapy and it worked so he was running alot faster.So my potion worked and he was like speed and I just saw smoke out of its legs.But my dog had a race that my friends dog was a other pitbull and he said,if you win I ow you 10 dollors and if I win you have to give me 10 dollors and so we raced and I won and I said,man I won pay up and I said no give me 10 bucks.

This is the life of an archeologist.         As an archeologist one main event was to dig up the artifacts in Fort James.  It was tough because they had to dig something up that was 200 years ago.  It was dug up in ruins by a flooding river.  Fort James was built in 1607, that's 406 years ago!  Since archeology was started way back then they have found the first artifacts in 1861!  They found armor and weapons in the ruins.  The National Park Service led a five-year study of it to figure out how they used the land.  That's when they finally found where Fort James was built!  Finally they found about how the people of Fort James did their daily routine.  The dicovery of Fort James was very exciting to archeology life.         The second and last discovery was digging Goerge Washington's past.  As you know Washington was the fist president of the United States.  I will not tell you about Goerge Washinton, but about digging up his past.  They had a numerous amount of teams with 35 people on each team.  The first team scans the area using 3D computers.  When the information got back to them they got to work.  They digged for their lives!  Each team got a part (layer) of the dig.  One team got a skim shovel and digged the first layer.  Then it went on to troweling.  Troweling used small shovels, paint brushes, and toothpicks!  It can take up to two weeks of digging a 25-square foot area!  The last team studied the artifacts they found.  A place called Ferry Farm is based on Washington's past.  It has classes, games, and crafts.         This paragraph is based on the tools that the archeologists used.  The pick and shovel are for hard mining.  The whisk and dustpan is to clean the dust from artifacts or make it easier to see the floor.  The knife is used for detailed digging and scraping dirt from the artifacts.   The wheelbarrow is used to move heavy items from one place to another.  The skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt.  Last, but not least, the trowel is used to scrape and view different layers of soil.         As an areologist it is very hard and takes patience but in the end it is all worth it.

So, look at the paragraphs below.                       An archeologist is a hard worker, because they have to look for very old thing and new things. Like in the story Digging Up George Washington's Past and Finding Fort James.  The archeologist had to look very carefully in the dirt, the fort, the pit, George Washington's house,  and more. They need to work carefully, so they don't break anything that is fragile or just old. They need to think, because in the story Digging Up George Washigton's Past they had to think of what George Washington's did.                     An archeologist needs to be aware of what is where and if something is glinting in the sand or the dirt.  So, they need to pay attention to what is in front of them because what if it is an important piece of information or it may tie up the mystery. If you want to be an archeologist you have to pay a lot of attention to what you are doing because what if you something wrong.                                     An archeologist needs to work as a team to find what they are looking for or else they will get no where. If you work alone it would take forever to find or discover things. So don't think you can do it all by yourself, and when you work as a team you find things that need to be discovered faster.                            To be an archeologist you need to use your tools like the Wheelbarrow. You need to use it for moving things to  other areas or to move things like dirt to different places.And the Knife is used for careful digging and to get dirt off from the artifacts. Whatever other tools you get use them they will help with whatever you are working with.                            So, if you do all these instructions and you want to be an archeologist follow all these instructions and you can be a great acheologist. These are my paragraphs about being an archeologist.

But now that we have technolgy and and pro fessanals we can find stuf that we never knew was there. And that is why I think that it's so cool that they found Fourt James and George Washington's house and how he lived and what his daily life was.

Becauseif you take your dog inside the store the dog might run away, kids are going to make fun of you, and there are going to tease you and your going to get really mad at them.                           Next, do you like dogs in the store? do you like to find dog hair on the floor? do you like to find poop on the floor? because I don't. Don't bring your dog inside the store.  if you do  you might be kick out of the store. if there is a store that lets your dog in  make sure that it has all fo its shots.                        So, thats all I have for you so remember don't bring your dog inside a store inless they let you take your dog inside a store. 	PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP$ NN IN NNS VBG NN DT NNP NNP .

They use pick and shovels, whisk and dustpans, knife, wheelbarrows, skim shovel, and trowels to find these amazing aritfacts. A group of people were interested in studying the past.                  Archeologists have been helpful to people. The first object that was found by archeologists were uncovered army and weapons. The first object was found in 1861. It takes about a year to find other artifacts. Archeologists are around the world. Did you know that archeologists from the United States go to other countries to help them.                 I have mentioned this in the other part, but these are the tools the archeologists use to find artifacts.

To do this they must be very careful not to miss anything because that could ruin the whole exhibition. They use many tools to make sure they don't miss anything. Some of the tools they use are pick axes and shovels these tools are used to break up the dirt and get down deep into the ground closer to the artifacts. Also they use whisks and dustpans these tools are used to sweep dirt off artifacts and to clear dirt away from the sight. Other tools are knifes and wheelbarrows the knife is used to get dirt from around the artifacts and the wheelbarrow is used to get dirt away form the sight. The last 2 tools they use are a skim shovel and a trowel, skim shovels are used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop and the trowel is used to scrape and cut to view different layer of soil.

My name is Emily and I am going to be telling you all about the job of and archeologist.  Let's get started shall we?  Well an archeologist has alot of resposobilities.  Like being very carful while they are using sharp tools. Or make ing sure that they are very careful with the artifacts they find while on a search. This is a list of some of the jobs or resposobilities of an archeologist!!!!           #1 In my opinion an archeologist's job is not always so bad.  Actually I am a little jealous that archeologist gets to wake up every morning and get to find unique artifacts like pottery, tools, coins and so much more!!!!  And did you know that in the 1600s people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit?           #2  Archeologists also have to use 3D computers that can track what is underground!  They used those computers to dig up the Ferry Farm.  They all got split into teams of 35 and took turns using the computers.           #3  And the final thing I am going to talk about is that archeologist have to work together as a team with the historians, because all the artifacts they found go to the historians and they learn even more about history! Like the type of life Colonial Americans lived.

Since I am an Archeologist. I work alot of hours and, I get payed a lot money. I won't tell how much I get paed though. That means I don't get to see my family a lot.            I started this job in 2008. The site is in Alabama. I have been In a lot of different countries. My goal is to work for another 9 years hopefully.            I have made alot of good friends at this job. I remember when I was the lowest rank of this job. But now I am the 4th best out of 17 best jobs.

37	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	NR			F	401114	5	11064252	Y	56274	                Main idea: Archeologists are important people and their jobs are too       I have learned that archeologists are very important people when it comes to learning about the past.       Archeologists are important to us because when they find an artifact that we have never seen before, they can find out more about it, what the people who owned it did with it, and what their culture was so we can learn more about their time.       Archeologist's jobs seem very exiting. It is so fun when you come across a dinosaur bone or an artifact from a long time ago or even a prehistoric village!       Some of the tools Archeologists use on a dig are, a pick and shovel, (Most digs start with these tools and they are used to dig up dirt so people can get closer to the artifacts) a whisk and a dustpan, (These are used to brust dirt and dust off artifacts) a knife, (Used to scrape dirt from around artifacts) a skim shovel, (A shovel with a flat edge used to remove a thin layer of dirt) and a trowel. (On of the most common toll in archeology used to scrape and cut to see different layers of dirt.)

When we got there we found out it was a dinosaur bone we was freaked out.        When we got home we told every body about it.  We even put it on the internet so every body can see it.  After all that we went back out side to get more bones.       the last bone we dug up was big.  When we got we got to looking at it it was an entire animal we defiantly took it down there. When we got there we should it to them and they took it and did not give it back.  But they wrote about use digging it up so that was a good reason to not give it back.

Archeologists have been studying things for a long time people are still studying things about GEORGE WASHINTON'S CHILDHOOD! Here are some of the tools they use for archeologists       Pick and shovel (used for mining and digging) Whisk and dustpan (used to clean off the example to see it better) Knife (used for digging carefully and also to scrape dirt of the samples) Wheelbarrow (used for carrying samples, dirt and other things) Skim shovel (used to carefully remove soil from things) Trowel (used to scrape and cut things)    Now you know all the tools they use and why they use them.                   People that study archaeology have to know a lot about the past      but they don't know everything. Some people learn even as they are digging. Like,'Hey     that bone over there do you know what that is from?' then usually they take it back to there lab and study it.

In 1994, the search for Fort James began.The Archeologists believed that the fort was built near a river but later on they discover that the fort wasn't built near the river because of enemy ships.The first objects ever found were weapons and armor.They also found the floors of buildings.100 years later a group tried to find the exact spot where the fort build began.           The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.They knew that this would help them decide where to for proof of the fort.That's when they found fort James!The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks show where the forts walls stood.       Today the group finds over 1 million objects a each year.The objects includes pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into an big pit.While  digging in the area, the  archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away.These objects help them understand how the people in fort James lived.

Some of the tools they use are pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife wheel barrow,skim shovel,and a trowel.When some archeologists were digging up stuff from the past they came about fort Jamestown.       Fort James       In 1994 a group of Archeologists  were interested in studying James Town.for over 200 years people thought that the Fort had been washed away by a river.Some of the discoveries that had been found made them think some of them might still be around.The Fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.    About Archeologists           Now you can see how much Archeologists do for us  just to give us a history from the past. When I say from the past I don't just mean the past from Martin Luther King Jr to Rosa Parks. I feel that Archeologists are one of the most helpful teachers. Even our social studies or history teachers learn from them. Maby one day one of us might just be a Archeologists.   Some dig up things that's been there from a little while back.       A lot of Archeologists like to dig up things that are interesting like Jamestown and Washington more so famous stuff that no man or woman has discovered. Now I know how much they do for me.Maby just maby you might know a archeologists in your life like one of your friends or family members.Archeologists have done such a great job to us as people for interesting facts.I think that I now want to learn more about Archeologists .

We are now going to learn about finding Fort James.        In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Redicovery Archaeological Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. for over 200 years,people thought it had been washed away by the river. Some dicoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.      The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from england to start a new life. Most belived that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot problably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.           the first objects were found in 1861 those items were armor and weapons.They also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later,a group effort to find the exact spot the fort was built began.           The national park service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.        That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the forts walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read,and drawings they made,the archeologists knew it would be shaped like a triangle.They made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way to the river.Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold cannons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings within the border of the fort.

Its cool to study stuff and get to know and to learn about animals.To me its fun to know new stufff.They will study stuff from the past and find other stuff.       they will learn stuff from the historical times.They could find the presendents clothes or something.They have to find imformation to study the stuff first.       They have to find research before they find stuff from the historical times.That will be hard but you could prabolly get good money on this job.       They start with reports and read it to the people as they go.They have a club to get research.They even made a day called ''History Day''.       They even make steps.To make their preformance.they show some kids what they found or dug up.These archeologist are very cool so far.       Then they go back to the lab to study and read the sources.   It's cool to go in labs and study.They even start to do task  for preformances.       They learn stuff that we don't know yet.Thats how science comes from them.   Thats very cool.       This artical is really cool and you learn to.This artical is mostly about science and history.   Even the archiolegist bring tools to dig or climb stuff.Like they bring sovels,a brush,knife,and so on and so on.Archiolegist bring alot of tools  just in case.               It will be to risky to not bring tools  with you  it could be to dangerous.they also bring wheelbarrows to cary stuff with them.           They even do research questions.Thats preety cool once you learn.   They look for several resources. Thenthey stroke threw them and see wich ones they like.           They ask questions one at  a time.Then the archiolegist see what they scored.   And then they look threw their answers.Thats my story about the archiolegist.

An archeologist can also lead to many discoveries to help us understand the past. Just like they found out that the first settlers used to fight the Powhatan tride that often attacked them.       Now, you may be wondering why they are being payed just to dig around in dirt? Well thier discoveries can lead to many helpful things. Like when ever the first settlers didn't want something or it was broken they would throw it in a unused well or a pit.       So now that you know all about an archeologist job mabye you want to become one! Mabye you want to start digging for pots, old toys or even rare coins! If I was you I would start digging!

In fact it could take two weeks just to clear away a 25 square foot section of dirt at a dig. They use various tools to dig at the site. These tools include the pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and trowel.   When archeologists find something while digging they have made a discovery. These objects are called artifacts. Artifacts can be many different things like clay pots old guns and different cloths and materials. If someone finds an artifact they clean it then take it back to a lab to study it.   Most archeologists search ruins in places all over the world. They make a 3D image of the site. After they make the image they start an excavation. an excavation is basically searching the site for artifacts. An archeologists work is never done until they find what they are looking for.

An archeoligists has to take his because if he rushes everything would mess up but if he takes his time then everything would turn out okay.Archeoligists also have to take a verry long time on what there trying to find out or what there trying to do.

After two hours we went to go eat then we went back on it said that James that he built a fort in 1607 then the first thing found in 1861 then a Archeologist came the thing that was found was a uncovered piece of armor of a knight my friends and me said wow. when my friend read that we were thrilled when we read that it was cool then Santiago said put George Washington so when I put his name then we started reading it said Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president ,People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years, Therefore ,it's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was just six years old at the time. My  friend Santiago said I told you he was cool I said OK then Adrian said did they use to take him out i said ill see they used a pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,and so on. Then we went to school and finish our assignment and Mr. Gaffney was surprised.

So most of the time when archeologist are looking up facts about people they usuallly find were they lived and why the died to find more facts abot them.when they have their informatin they have to make sure that it is correct so they need to revise and check their information.  Most tools the archeologist use when they are working is skim shovel, trowel, knife and a whisk and a dustpan. tall of these toold are veary helpful in all different kindes of situaions.A trowel is proubly the most commen tool the archeologist use it is used to scarpe to view the didderent kinds of soil. Some people say that being a archeologist is easy but most of it is hard core facts the you dig up look up or research but i think it is far from easy  but using tools and researching people and their familys is so interesting anyone could be invaluved.           Being a archeologist is probualy the most hardested  job you can do it invaulkves a lot of research in it and facts but if you are a person who like lots of that stuff you could be one yourself.

The job is archeologists.            An archeologists is a person who studies history things. Ancheologists  also travel and explor and get historical things.   we woldent know a bout all these new discoverie.

They have to look for stuff that people in past years used and other stuff. They also have to look for underground bunkers and what there is inside of them.       First what they need to do is to get a shovel and dig and see what they find. Then they use a screen to see if there is anything there. And if they find something they keep digging to see if they could find anything else.            Then they keep digging to look for more stuff. They use a wheelbarrow to take the dirt somewhere else and use a whisk to brush off the dirt off the item that might be there. Then when they find something they keep on looking in the spot that they found the thing in.       Finally when they find everything that they need, they go back home. They have found everything they needed to find.

To be an archeologist you must be willing to work hard digging and creating maps. It can take YEARS to find what you are looking for, for example it took a five year study to find James Fort.                  An archeologist uses many diferent tools at a dig. One tool is the skim shovel, a skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to remove a thin layer of soil. Or a knife is a common tool used to dig and scrape dirt around artifacts. Lastly, the most common tool used is probably the trowel, a trowel is used to scrape and cut the soil.                  Archeologists can teach us many things about the past. For example archeologists learned that James was in the shape of a triangle. Archeologists also learned much about George Washington's childhood. Without archeologists we wouldn't know anything about the history of the Blue Planet.

For example it gives you a website you can use and it's called www.nps.gov.In source #1 gives you websites such as www.nps.gov,historicjamestown.org,or apva.org.In the wesite www.nps.gov it teaches you about /Jame/and history culture.In the year 1994 their were people interested in James town because it had secrets about the James Fort in Jamestown.                                                                              Finding Where Fort James is Located                                                         People 200 years ago people thought that Fort James was washed away by a river. Fort James was built in 1607 when the England settlers arrived to start a new life. The settlers chose a spot located near the fort. The location they chose probably gave the English settlers more protection from the enemy ships. The English found the first object in 1861.                                                                                                The First Object                         The archeologist also discovered the floors of the buildings. 100 years later a group effort helped find the exact spot where the fort was built. The National Park led a five year study for the land that was used for the fort. The park new that this would help them decide were to search for proof. The people who were studying used computer maps.                                                                                 How They Found Jamestown                 The first thing the researchers found was a set of marks on the ground. Then they saw the marks were the walls used to be. The researchers made maps and found out that Fort James stretched all the way to the river. The researchers realized that the stone ledges built over the river. The stone ledges were built to hold canons.                                                                                        The Archeologist                         The archeologist found 11 cellars. They also found a dozen of burial sites. And the burial sites were within th border of the fort. The archeologist fin 1 million objects each yaer. The objects they find include pottery,tools, and coins. The people in the 1600 used to throw thier trash down a well or a big pit.

Having some troubles finding the exact spot. They found artifacts such as armor and weapons.When they finally found the fort more artifacts appeared like fort walls,floors, and probably much more and they knew they made an important discovery.

Some people discovered the Fort James, and others about George Washingtons past. There were lots of things that these people founded.                When some people saw the Fort James, they discovered its past and started Jamestown Rediscovery. An event in the past was when settlers needed to start a new life there. They lived there, and while they were staying, they had things that they had thrown, and those became objects of the past. They discovered animals and trash they had eaten and thrown away. The archeoligists relised that the settlers didn't have much food.                 The last source of history is George Washingtons past. People lived on Ferry Farm for decades. While digging things up here, they had to be careful because there were lots of fragile things there. They had to use skim shovels, which slowly but catiasly remove the dirt to discover the artifacts. These people also had a long process of trowling. All in all, this is good for kids to learn about George Washingtons past and all the artifacts that the archeoligists scooped up.                   In conclusion, archeoligists are important in many ways. They can dig up anything, and find ancient artifacts from along time ago!

Archeologists dig up bones,minerals,rocks,dirt,maby some bodys,and more.Archeoloists need learn more about importent people that are dead like George Washington. Sometimes archeologists come apone amazing things like lost tribs and more.         Archeologists have research lots of impotent dead. Archeologists find stuff for museum,tours,and more.Archeologists get great money for what they do. They help kids all a cross the world.How ever archeologists find George Washington`s home and were he lived.Archeologists found Jamestown they leared that 200 years people thought Jamestown was washed away by a river.Some of the discoveries are still in the area.        The fort was found in 1861.They found armor,weapon,floors of building.They found marks were the walls were set.The archeologists know the fort would be the shape of a triangle.Archeologists made maps and found out the fort stretched all the to the river.The stones ledges built over the river.The ledges were designed to hold canons.

In 1994,a group of people became interested in studing the past started the Jamestown thats when the Rediscovery Archaeological Project.So they went to start and finish there new asinment.But what they didnt know was that there was dangers out in the wild of Jamestown, some thought it was dangers some thought it was adventures and some werent here to say a word about Jamestown.For over 200 years , people tought that the fort of Jamestown got washed away by the river.But they were rong Jamestown is still apoun us but we just did not know it.                    The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to find Jamestown to start a new life.Some settelers tought that Jamestown was built near the river.Jamestown was built close to the river but not close enought.I will love to talk to you more but i have to go see you later bye!!!

These articles taught me how and what archeologists dug.          The fist article is about how archeologists found Fort James. In 1994, a group of people that were interested in studying the past of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The fort was built in 1607 and most people believed it was built near a river. The first artifacts were found in 1861. They found weapons and armor from digging near James Fort usea to be. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. They finally found James Fort. Today, the group finds over 1 million objects each year.

Archeologist have many jobs to do like dig up stuff they use wheelbarrows to carry things they dig up. Archeologist have to also use the whisk an use the dustpan to take stuff off the thing they work with. They also have to use the knife to gentle dig up and scrape dirt from the artifacts. They have to use skim shovel to remove thin layer of dirt away from each scoop. They also use a trowel to scrape and cut to view the different layers of  soil.                    Most digging start with 2 tool those tool are use to into the  ground. Some shovels flat,small,and some are very big. There's a team that digs and the team is called '' Dig '' digging can take 25-square-foot section. Sometimes there can be up to 35 people on a team. The other team spends days in the labs to study the objects that are found that need to be checked.

First, they find a spot where they think something is. The spot that they picked is where they set up camp. Next, they keep digging and looking until they find something that might be helpful for their notes and search. Sometimes this can take up to more than five years. After that, they examine what they find and then they keep digging some more to find even more things.             Archeologists use many tools and each tool has a different use. One tool that they use is a shovel. This is used to dig up dirt so that the archeologists can uncover priceless artifacts. Another tool that they use is called a trowel. This is the most common tool in archeology. It is used for scraping and cutting different layers of soil to analyze. The last tool I am going to tell you about is the wheelbarrow. They use this for carrying things that are heavy from one place to another. An example of something they carry is dirt.                 Archeologists find amazing things from the past. In 'Digging up Washington's Past' It shows how amazing archeologists are and how they found Washington's past. In another discovery they found Fort James. They found a lot of information about it too. They found how it was used, where it was built, and many other interesting facts.            Therefore, archeologists have fascinating jobs by studying the past. I realized this While writing.

All of these stories have something in common they all are about famous people in the past, and how the archeologists found the items that have been used.   In the story,Finding Fort James it talk and tells the reader that this is a informative text. In this story it also thas something to do with digging with archeologists. In the story Digging up George Washington's Past it also talks about digging. Those are some of th reasons i think they are both alike.                              I think that people usually send archeologists to any unusual place or some were the certain famous person lived. Because mostly when objects or valuable items are dug up by archeologists are usually found to put in museums. Or to put some were special to dedicate that special person who once belonged to the object. Another reason I  believe that archeologists are sent places. The person that sent them or that helped might get money or anything valuable from that item.       In the story Digging  up the Past, it says that one of the special things they found in the house that George Washington once lived in was dry bones and pans they used to make food in may be valuable. Because that may be something that you can not find in these days that is why most things are very valuable these days from the past.

Archeologist do all sorts of stuff like uncover discoveries that no one could ever find out, learn more about the pass, and help other people like scientists understand more about the people in the pass.??              One thing that the archeologists do is uncover discoveries that no one could ever find! Like for example George Washington died and left his personal journal and a archiologist found it. You could reveal soo much!              Another thing that archeologist can do is learn more about the pass, like my example, we could learn soo much about George Washington and what goes on in his life like maybe his family and we could know why he wanted to do what he did.              The last thing that archeologists can do is help people understand more about the pass, they can help scientist find the answers to their questions about the pass like what happened to Einstein.

If we wont to be one we can but a archeologist is to study stuff from the past like if we go to Michale Jackson house and they said that there were stuff o the bottom of the ground and there were jewelery and rings and other stuff we well say lets go digging over there to his house and find the jewelery then there well be a lot of them and there was one that has rubes on it and it we cost a lot of money for that and if you or someone else sells it they well take it for $100,000,000 then yeah they well pay that much money because it has rubes on it and everybody likes rubes or it comes with rubes and stones then it well be a lot of more money. and i wont to be one because its cool and it well be fun and we can find things from the past. and its breaty fun to be a archeologist so this is my book report.

Archeologist, the name for scentist who study objects from the past, uncover armor and wepons. The archeologist also found eleven cellars, dozen of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.            Today, the people nearly find 1 million  objects each year. While digging in the area, the archeologist found the trash that the settlers threw away, inclueding the bones of animals they ate. Archeologist also find Pottery, Tools,Coins, and even metal toys for children. Archeologist uses a Pick, Shovle, Whisk, Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovle, and trowle for a tool.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

After a long period of time the found it. It's because of the artifact. They also figured out how James was connect to the river and that there were ledges mean't to hold cannons. From that day 1 MILLON artifact have bein found every year.          We all know about how George Washington he was the first presdent of U.S.A and a sargent genral who lad his team to fictery but what about his childhood well now were getting into it. Archeologist have to be stady what they dig up because the artifacts might just brake into pieaces in your hands. They have to dust around the artifact or on the artifact so it wont be stulk in the ground and brake. Sometime it takes months to find a artifact because they have to take there time to discofer there artifact the wont to find. It will get boring at sometime but you have to take your time or it might break or your puting your self in danger.       Tools Needed for Digging up a Artifact           Tools that  archeologist use are tools that wont brake the artifact that are stady and that aer carefull. Like a shovel or pick axe they are for digging things up. Whisk, dustpan, and a knife are meant for digging little pieaces around the artifacts making it easy to pull the artifact out of the ground.       How Patient is a Archeologist?           Archeologist are people who take there time when the find a artifact and are patient it takes days, weeks, months, and years for 1 artifact to be found. The reisen why is because the make sure that they aren't in danger of any bombs that might be around them.            Thats how artifact from the past help us know about someone or something past or childhood.

Arceologists are like miners but find riches to. They find fossils, riches, and many more things they find in the dirt or stone. They use picks so they can mne through the stone.       They use shovels because they need to work there way in dirt. Archeologists use a whisk and a dustpan because the need to put dust out of the fossils. They use a skim shovel because they can remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. A knife is used for scraping dirt off the artifacts for acheologists.They also use a wheelbarrow becausethey need to carry dirt and rocks to a different place.Finaly they use a trowel to cut the view for dfferent Layers of soil.       They started mineing  for the search of the stonebase in 2003. One fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. More people believed it was built near the river. Archeologists discoverd armor and weapons there. They found floors and buildings around There. In conclusion, if I was a archoelogist it would be great finding riches from the past.

Also, objects were found there. In 1861 the first objects were found. There was armor and weponds from the past. The first thing people found was a set of marks on the ground.                  Scientists knew that Fort James had to be shaped like a triangle. All of them made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Also, there were stone built ledges.

Archeologist are people who can help they are able to Tell then and  now   many people don't understand why these people are remember or what they did, just like Martin Luther King Jr. he was remembered for bringing peace to the world that's something an Archeologist would be able to tell you,base on their job they dig up specific objects but if they was able to dig up the past you will see why the job they have is very important.  I think Archeologist have a very decent part in life not only because they get dirty they get good information.  For example in 1994 thousands of people believed in the fact that the Fort in Jamestown had been washed away, the Fort was build in 1607,the National Park Service  led to a five year study,that's  when they found James Fort!.  Another example most of what we know about George Washington is from his time from when he was a soldier and president,No one really know were George Washington lived since the building was long gone, they started digging  in 2003,It took over a year,But then they finally found it!    The first  building they found was the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses,They found they Farmhouse a few years later.    So now you know whats so important and how it became that way and also how it happen and why it happen.

If you have, becoming and archeologist would be a suitable job for you. Archeologists are people who earn money by finding buried treasures and bones! Not only be would you be rich, but you would also be famous and well known by many people.            If you want to become an archeologist, you have to know all the equipment and tools archeologists use. First, you have to know what a pick and shovel is. A pick and shovel are tools used to dig dirt and break stone. Second, a whisk and dustpan are tools used to brush away dust from the excavation site. Third, a knife is used for carefully scraping off the dust from the ancient artifacts. Fourth, a skim shovel has a flat edge for removing layers of soil. Finally, a trowel has a pointy edge and a small handle used for cutting to view the different layers of soil. If you know all these tools you are ready for the next step.            You have to know all the teams to become an archeologist. The first team maps the areas using 3D computers that can track and record what is underground. This information is valuable because the people can know what it looks like before they start digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging. Finally, the last team studies the objects that were found for days.            If you think this job suits you, study to become and archeologist. As you can see, archeologist work very hard to find ancient artifacts. Even though becoming and archeologist needs a lot of effort, it is worth it.

You will be traveling the world for your expeditions. Now that the archeologist is packed and ready let the journey begin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When you are an archeologist going on an expedition there is always something you are looking for. There is also a location for this certain type of thing. When looking for objects or artifacts you will need tools such as a trowel,wheelbarrow,knife,skim shovel,pick and shovel and whisk and dustpan. When searching for objects sometimes you might go through a tunnel,a mine shaft or might go uphill. When you find something that means you found something that might be put in a museum like the Smithsonian. That means its time to go back home for the closing of a journey.

There are many different teams who do different jobs for this process. The first team finds the place they will be digging at. The next group focuses on the digging itself. The last group studies the results.                 The first team finds the place where the diggers will be digging. That is probably the most important job of them all because if the first group chose a place in the middle of nowhere, where there is nothing to be found, the hunt will not work. They also need something to look for. If they don't know what to look for and don't have information about it, the hunt won't work either. So, they find the place where they will hunt and map it out in detail on a 3D computer. Then, they record the information so that the diggers know what the place looked like before the digging began. That is the first groups job.                  The second team is the digger team. They have a very important job too, because they are the ones do the actual digging. They use very special tools that are great for delicately digging through the earth. They must be very careful in digging, because if they dig too hard, they could destroy the artifacts or even miss them. The most common tool used by the archeologists is the Trowel. Archeologists use it to look at the different layers of soil. Some more tools archeologists use are the pick and the shovel. They are both used to dig through the earth and look closely at the dirt. Once the diggers find what they think is an artifact, they give it to the third team.                  The third team receives the artifact that the diggers find and look very closely at it. They have special tools for that as well. They examine the artifact, determine who it belonged to, and got most of the credit. The diggers got a lot of the credit too, though. This is what the third team does.                       So this is what archeologists do. They have three different teams that work together to find artifacts that belonged to people long ago. All the teams must work extremely hard to get the job done. If I were to be an archeologist, I would want to be in the third team because you get to examine the artifacts the second team finds.

Then in 1861, the archeologists found the first objects.  They discovered buildings floors, armor, and weapons.  They found the marks on the ground that was a huge triangle that was the fort.  They were expecting a tringular shape.  They found stone ledges that held cannons over a river.  They also found ten of bulidings, eleven cellars, and dozens of burial sites.  The archeologists found pits and unused wells that the colonists threw trash into.  The garbage the archeologists found included bones of animals.  Today, they find about 1,000,000 objects like pottery, coins, and metal toys.  This information was also useful for the archeologists because they could find out how people fought the Powahatan tribe that attacked often attacked them.

They discover objects, artifacts, dinosaurs, sharks and more. They discover things by digging it up. Some archaeologists send out some type of radio length that senses what's underground and knows whats underground. Other archaeologists job is to dig, dig, dig.                       They find things by looking to see if they can spot some sort of clue that there was something there. If they find a mark, they dig in that area to see if there are any objects that tell them that something was there. They also look in the environment or surroundings suggesting that something was there. Then, they use their tools and dig.                       Archeologists use wheelbarrow, picks and shovels, dustpans, whisks, knives, skim shovels and trowels. They use the wheelbarrows for hauling away dirt or artifacts they find. Picks and shovels are used to dig. Whisks and dustpans are used to carefully brush off the artifacts or clear dirt away from the digging site. Knives are used to scrape dirt away from the object. Skim shovels can remove a layer of dirt with each scoop. The trowel is used to scrape and cut the different layers of soil.

They dig up objects that can range from dinosaur bones to a gold miner's pipe. Some other examples of what they dig up are items found from old forts. One such fort is Fort James. It is a fort from 1607 where they find close to a million artifacts per year.       The process of finding these artifacts is long and hard. It involves lots of digging and working. First, the archeologists cut away at the Earth with a tool called a skim shovel, which works slowly, removing very small layers of dirt one at a time. They also begin sometimes with picks and bigger shovels. Once the objects are found, it is an equally hard process to study them.       Once artifacts are found in the dirt, a team of people examines them. If the artifacts are dirty, they are brushed off with a tool called a whisk. Then the objects are identified. They are sent off to museums and looked at by many people. They will be admired for the history that they hold and people of all kinds will enjoy them.

The Tools For Archeologists              There are many tools for archeologists. Picks and shovels were for digging in to Earth. Whisks and dustpans were for brushing the dirt off and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. Knifs were used for the careful digging and to scrape the dirt off from the artifacts. Wheelbarrows were for carrying items from one place to another. Skim Shovel is the shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layor of soil with each scoop. Trowel is the most common tool in archeology and it is used for scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.

It could be fun or it could be boring because you could get frusterated by not finding the evidence you want to find or you could find it and being a archeologists could be fun to you but people have many different opinions. It is very hard work being an archeologists because you have to find a lot of information on a certain person or a certain thing. Archeologists use many different tools.             Archeologists have many different tools they use on their job. some tools they use are a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.  A pick and a shovel are used to dig up dirt. A whisk and a dustpan are used to clean the dirt from the evidence. A knife is used to scrape up dirt from the evidence.

Many archeologists worked on George Washingtons house to find important artifacts like a wig or a shoe or a sock and stuff like that.       Archeologist work very hard in tryind to dig up important parts of our history. Archeologists can find things that would be very hard to find without skills like they have.       When something is drooped or left in a burnt down house, it can get burried hundreds of feet underground after many, many years.Then thats where the they come in and find it.       Sometimes peoples belongings can tell a lot about someone.

Also you need to know what's going on because it might be a trap. That's why you need to be smart and focus at all times. Also you might have to learn different languages. But the fun part is you can travel a lot. The last thing is you have to be prepared. This is why an archeologist is hard work and fun work to me.

Archeoligists use a bunch of different tools.Some of the tools are big and some are small.Let me tell you what some of the tools are that they use.One of the tools is a pick and shovel,it helps them to dig.Another tool that they use is a skim shovel it also helps them to dig.One of the most common tools is the trowel tool it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.      Digging up George Washingtons house has really helped us know more about Washington as a boy.George was six years old when he moved to this house.No one really new where his house was.People had lived on the land for a while.The land was known as Ferry Farm.George's dad made them move there.        I hope you enjoyed my paper.Archeoligists are really nice to do there gob so we can learn history.The tools they use are interesting.It is neat to find out about Gorge Washingtons house.There are a bunch of different tools that Archeoligists use.

For  about 200 years  the people thaught that  that it all washed away but some people think that might still be there.       In 1607 settlers  came from England to start a new life there Most belive that James  Fort was build  near  a far river .        By the objects near by  they suggested that it might be farther away.            They found James Fort's family first cause there were stretch marks and then  dig.       In 1861 the scientist studied  objects from the pastbut they uncoverd armor and weapons. They also discoverd  floors and buildings.       over 100 years later a group of efferts spot were the fort built began.

Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood . That's changing , however . Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy .                How did archeologists find all of these things that were in Washington's house all those years ago ? The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one . Each year , many teams will work on the site . There can be up to 35 people on a team ! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what's in the ground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looks like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging and the place the team does the digging is called a dig . Those  archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels .           The shovels are small ,flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom .This lets the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in.The diggers also use a process called troweling .Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes ,and wooden picks to remove dirt .It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section ! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found . The whole process is slow and tiresome , but it is worth it .           No one knew exactly where the Washington house was located since the actual building was long gone .However, archeologists believed that the base under the house was still there .They started digging in 2003.It took over a year , but they finally found it . The first  buildings they found were the kitchen, slve quarters, and storage houses .           The discovery of Washington's house is important for many reasons . First , it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington before he was famous . We also began to know why he made the decisions he did . Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of  life Colonial Americans lived . All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans .

The artifact they found from George Washington was the James Fort. Tools they use are complicated and hard to because you need to know which goes to this artifact and that one.                       George Washington was six years old when they moved to Fairy Farmland. Then a couple of years later his caught on fire and burned down. Finally the archeologist found his kitchen.                       They James Fort is a basement they had under his house. First they had found a clay pipe that had belonged to George Washington they knew they were close.Lastly they found the fort. they were very happy.                       They used the pick and shovel to dig and yank the dirt. The whisk and dust pan to get the dirt off the artifacts. Knife was used to dig layers from the dirt. The wheel and barrow was to move the heavy artifacts from one place to another. Skim was to remove the thin layers of dirt. Trowel it was used to scrape and cut different layers of soil.                       It would be good to be an archeologist because you could see how they lived and what they used. It will give you a key to they past. I would be one to take pictures,but if I see a finger I'm quitting. A person I would like to find a artifact from is Elvis Presley, I would find his leather jacket and shoes.

Archeologist work almost all day and very hard.They work on a lot of stuff you find frustrating. But they do it and they always are trying there best.Archaeologist and scientist always make a good team.                               when they study i can take a long time to find out what there looking for.Some of the diggers found brilliant stuff. Like when they where working on George Washington house they found a clay pipe and they knew it was his because he smoke those. Or the time when they found like wooden spoons in his house. they went in his house to study who ha was before he became famous and the president.The mapping use a software computer to make an image of the area.                                                   Today,the groups finds nearly 1 million objects a each year. the first objects were found in 1861. They also discovered floors of buildings. Over 100 years later,a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built.Then finally a man named James Fort. The first thing they found was a set of markers in the ground.                                                     While digging in the area, the archaeologist found trash the settlers thew away, including the bones of animal they ate.In 1994 a group of interesting people studying the past.for over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came to England to start a new life.

You have to dig deep in earth's soil. And you will have to look for grand objects from the past. Which is a very difficult job indeed. Now, for this paragraph and the other paragraphs I will type,I will explain to you about the life of an archeologist.               First let me tell you the tools an archeologist uses while working. The pick &amp; shovel are used for finding artifacts. And is also for digging up tons of artifacts from the earth's soil. The whisk &amp; dustpan, are brushing the dirt away from the artifacts that have been dug up. I will continue the rest of the tools in the next paragraph.              Now, archeologists use the knife. Not for cutting veggies at dinnertime, but they use by carefully digging in the dirt. Also use it to scrape off the dirt from around the artifacts. They use the wheelbarrow for moving the extra dirt away, and use it for moving items including tools, pottery, coins, and metal toys to one location to another. I will continue the rest in the continuing paragraph.              The archeologists use the skim shovel. They use it for removing the thin layers of soil with one scoop at a single time. And finally, the trowel. Probably the most common tool in archeology. And it is used for scraping and cutting to find different layers if soil. That was all of the tools that the archeologists use.             Now it is time to explain what the archeologists do besides using tools. Of course, archeologists dig, and find things from the past. Things like dinosaur bones, or dinosaur footprints. Well, some of the archeologists find things other than prehistoric reptile bones. They found man made objects.             Some objects like I said before, pottery, old toys, tools, coins and metal. Sometimes they even found the animal bones they ate. They also found the trash left behind. Well, besides what they found, the archeologists found some pretty neat stuff. I will tell you about what they did in the next paragraph.             Now, I will tell you what the archeologists did. They did things like traveling to far away places. Now back to what they found. Something interesting about arceology, is that the first object was found in 1861. Is that cool or what? It could also take over a year to find those artifacts! Well, that is all I can say about archeology! Just like I said, being an archeologist isn't easy!

But its not you will all sorts of interesting things. We also use cool 3D computers that track underground objects. The information than is recorded for a teem to know were to dig. In a team their can be up to 35 people.       Tools   As you know 35 people can be on a team. Each team has the some tools to use.  Pick and shovel; most digs start with these tools to dig up the first layer soil with grass. Whisk and dustpan; are used to brush dirt off artifacts. Skim shovel; is a shovel with a flat edge to remove a thin layer of soil. Trowel; is used to scrape and cut different layers of soil.       Finding Proof   Some times we find houses of people that are buried. We need proof. We keep records such as the home had a fire in it. To make shore that this is the home we need to find burnt items. We some times try to find parts of items that the person owed.       So inclusion the job of an archeologist can be fun.

Well, have you ever wondered how the report was made? Simple! By archeologists. Archeologists have a very important job. They find facts about well-knowned people in history. When you think about George Washington, you think of the first president. Most people don't think about George Washington's childhood.      But archeologists find more, and more information about him. They try to find proof about their artifacts. They will try to find very important things that are from history. Archeologists even tried to find George Washington's house! Archeologists make predictions about what they find. For example, when they found George Washington's house, they predicted that there was a fire, because they found burnt pottery.      They also found clay pipes. And, we know that George Washington smoked clay pipes. So, the archeologists thought this was the right house. They also found important artifacts that people now know. Archeologists make history because they find stuff very important, that can be used. But, being a archeologist isn't so easy. Archeologists use tools, like the pick and shovel. Archeologists use these tools to start digging. They also use: whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, a trowel, and a skim shovel.      Archeologists are very important. They know a bunch of history! Archeologists use a lot of research. People now know more about people in history, thanks to archeologists. 	NNS VBP RB JJ TO NNP NNP PRP RB VB DT NN IN NNP NNP .

Wel one day these ten archeologists were having there usual Thursday meeting thensuddendly a person yelled out well how about we go look for Fort James. Well all of the sudden another person yelledout well how about we go dig for Fort James right now. So then they all went back to their houses and gathered all of their supplies and headed out to go dig for Fort James. So first they would have to get a three demensoinal picture to see if there would be anything in their way to dig. And then they started dig for Fort James, then the first evidence of the fort were found. They did not know what they had found at first but they had found it they had founded Fort James.They had all of them burst into cheering and laughter it was almostlike they were celebrating the fourth of July or celebrating New Years Eve. Well I bet  that they would not have woken up in the morning thinking that they would have went and gone out to go find Fort James. Well I hope they shure had fun finding a almost three-hundred year old building underground. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB PDT IN DT NNS IN NN VBD IN DT NN .

They find neat things in places like,Jamestown, Eygpt, and many other places. They are scientist who study things from the past. Archeologist dig and find gold coins, old pottery, armor, and weapons.        I have studied about Archeologist in the past. It might be fun to be a Archeologist. Archeologist have found the floors of the Jamestown buildings over 100 years later, that is neat. The first time I heard about Archeologist was on the news. Archeologist discover many cool things. Today they find 1 million things a year. Archeologist think it is neat to find things that tie us to the past.       In past times they have foundGeorge Washington's home that he lived in when he was a boy. Archeologist use special tools such as the trowel and wheelbarrel.     In conclusion I  have learned alot about Archeologist. How they work andwhat tools they use. This is an important job.

Skim Shovels, thin shovels with a sharp flat edge these shovels can remove layers of soil one by one. Trowel, a common tool in archeology, used to scrape and cut layers of soil.( of different deps) Whick &amp; Dustpan, these two tools are what most digs start off with. Used to dig into the Earth, close to the artifacts. Knife, Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt off artifacts.               The next 'team' of archeologists are in a labratory trying is to map out the area with 3D computers  which can show whats underground. Even though both slow moving prosess can take two weeks to complete the artifact is worth it.           The types of things possible to find are endless!  Below are a few things that are pssible to find,           weapons floors of buildings armor walls cellars buarial sites pottery tools coins metal toys Bones of animals A clay pipe old bricks from houses or chimney        Thanks for reading!!!!!

You have to have a lot of skills to be a skilled worker like archeologists. You can't just go out in a historical site and start digging. You need to do research and look at maps to know where to dig. You need to have three skills if you want to be a good archeologist; Perseverance, teamwork, and knowledge. if you have those skills you can become a good archeologist.             Perseverance is a major skill in archeology. The National Park Service led a five year study about Jamestown's Fort James. It took perseverance for archeologists to research Fort James. Imagine yourself studying one topic for five years! It really took a lot of time! And perseverance! So an archeologist's job is important and takes a lot of perseverance.           Teamwork is also a big skill for an archeologist. Without teamwork you can't get anything done. And with an archeologist you need to have teamwork to find artifacts and ancient remains. Without teamwork you can't find artifacts fast and you can't find them easy. You will not even find an artifact if you don't have teamwork. Thats why teamwork is a good skill you need to have if you want to be an archeologist. In the five year study it also took a lot of teamwork. People had to cooperate and work together to find Fort James.           The last skill you need is called knowledge. If you don't have knowledge you can't get artifacts. In 2003 when archeologists believed that a stone base under George Washingtons childhood house it took knowledge to know that it could be under there. They ended up finding many rooms. But it took over a year! You really do need to have knowledge in being an archeologist.           These examples show and prove that you need perseverance, teamwork, and knowledge to be an archeologist. If you decide to be an archeologist you should consider having these skills. It will help you through life and being an archeologist. An archeologists job is mainly to discover artifacts and treasures from the past. An archeologists job is really unique and special.

It comes with responsibility and you need to be very organized. if not you may lose your research and and have lost all these things lost and all you'll have is some bones. Also to be an Archeologist you have to be OK with getting down and dirty so you can do your job of finding the body of old famous people or dinosaurs. also to be a archeologist you have to be found of math because if this person or dinosaur live crescents ago you have to do the math to say how old they were or to see when the died.             To be an Archeologist the person in charge of you will be the won to pick a group of archeologist to to do one person or dinosaurs . Also to be an archeologist you will have to work with tools like the pick or shovel, whisk and dustpan knife,wheelbarrow,skim,,trowel.To even be able to do this job you have to be able to find the bones they could be any where so keep your eye out for bones. to do this job you have to have computer skills like knowing how to type because you might have lest written thing and more typing.             It would be really fun to be an archeologist but it's other things to to do when your an archeologist. Like having fun and when you do this job you will get to go to very famous places.Like if your trying to find queen Elsbeth then you would get to go to England. the bad part about this is that your hands would always be dirty and finger nails would have dirt under the nail.             One more part about being an archeologist is that on your team it can be up to 35 five people on one team. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that track what is under ground.The info is recorded so that people start diging. so by saying that a hole team works to gather to get the job done.This may seem like alot of work but when your doing some thing you love it's not work it's fun.             And that is all i have to say about the all the work you have to have and smarts. also and to be suseful you need to work together. be a team in what you do and know that you are making a differnce. and just do your best. and that is all you have to do and keep and open mind .and that is what you have to doa to be an archeologist.

The first thing you have to do is find the spot where you think the debris field is. Next you map it out on  a 3D mapping machine that tells you whats underground. Afterwards you start using shovels and the wheelbarrows to haul out dirt. Next you use a skim shovel to carefully remove thin layers of dirt.       Afterword you would use a Whisk and Dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts. After that you would then use a small shovel called a trowel it is probably the most common tool in archeology. The trowel does lots of things to help and archeologist one of them is to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Another one is that you can maneuver around the artifact and get in the crevices. Finally the last one is that you can use the trowel to smooth out the area where you dug the artifacts up.       My conclusion is that an archeologist's job is very hard and long. Proof that their job is very hard and long is that you have to use so many different tools. And the smaller the tools get the longer it takes to cover as much ground. As  with a big tool you can cover twice as much ground in twice as much time. Finally you can tell that it is a long and hard job is that there are almost 25 people on each dig at one time.

Their way of doing things is diferent than just diging and finding it takes time.They have a tool that can see thing under the ground with that they must no how far down to go so they don't reck or brake something part of history.They have other things that help them find parts of history like whisk and dust pan,knife,skim shovle so on and so forth.

His father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there when George was only 6 years old. Absolutely no one knew where his home was located but they knew that he lived on Ferry Farms and they still think they know where his house is. When they went to see Ferry Farms they needed proof that this was Washington's house and where he lived. The archaeologist start their dig with what are called skim shovels. The shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half- inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall of and the artifacts stay in. The archaeologist use a pick ,shovel ,whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.

First you must be very smart by finding out where ancient might be and you must be able to research and things on the computer.       Also you must be smart by digging in the right places so you don't destroy any fragile artifacts. Archeologists have to be so careful that it can take months just to dig up a couple of artifacts. Archeologists have many to special tools for finding lost artifacts. Like many different types of machines, hammers, and drills.       There are many different teams of archeologists there are the research where you use the computer and find things,digging group who dig up the artifacts, and the displayers who clean the things and show them in museums or special places.       Archeologists search from dinosaur fossils to kids toys in the past. An Archeologists main job is to collect stuff to help us understand the far back past. A very old toy were rattles because back then they were pretty easy to make. You could use an animal bone for the whole rattle then place a stone inside the opening of the bone. Normally very young children enjoyed rattles.       Digging up dinosaur bones is probably the hardest and trickiest thing to dig up. The reason is because the bones are thousands of years old and are packed way into the earth. There are over a hundred types of dinosaurs to dig up. That does not mean it is easy to find them though. The computer archeologists team has to find and predict where dinosaurs would have been. Then they send the digging team to the spot and tell its cordinates.       Now the digging team has to get a very special machine that digs deep into the earth. Now the team takes all the dirt they dug up and puts it through a thing that takes all the sand off and leaves the rocks and artifacts there. They search it to try to find fossils or items. When they find a dinosaur fossil they search to find the whole body. If they do they send it to the museum people and they clean the fossil up and put it together.       Soon it is put in a museum. Being an archeologist is a very long prosess. But it is a very good job to have when you are older. It is a really good paying and interesting job and you can have a really fun future being one.

Did you know that archeologists have to be extremely careful when dealing with artifacts? Archeologists have to find the right spot to investigate, put effort into digging the artiifacts up, and study what they find.         Before archeologists start digging they have to figure out where to dig. There is a whole team of archeologists commited to finding the right spot. They use high tech 3D computers that can track whats under ground. the information that the team finds is recorded so that they will know what it looked like at first before they dug.          Next the archeologists have to go into action. There is another team that focases on the digging. The place that the team does the digging is called 'The Dig'. first the diggers use small flat shovles called skim shovels to tin layers of soil that is soon put iin a box with a screen at the bottom. this makes the dirt fall out while any artifacts stay in. next archeologists use small shovels wooden picks andpaint brushes to remove any dirt from artifacts. it can take upto two weeks to dig a twenie-five foot section!            Finaly, another team has to spend days in a lab study the artifacts that were found. This is a long hard process but in the end it is all worth it.             	NN NN NNP .

They learn themselves too. They have found things that if they had not found them then we not have known that they existed. Archeologist do awesome things like finding four hundred year old forts, find old president homes as a kid, and use really cool tools.        For over 200 years people had thought that Fort James had been washed away. It was in 1861 when the first objects of the fort were found. Over 100 years later a group found the exact spot of where the fort was. They realized that James Fort was triangular and that they had a big well type thing that they threw their waste into.        In 2003 archeologists decided to try to dig up George Washington's home as a child. After 1 year they found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Also a few years later they found the main farmhouse. To have proof that this was actually George Washington's house they found his clay pipe and burnt pottery in which they knew that he had a fire in his home.        How do they find all of this stuff ? They have to have some sort of equipment. They do,  in fact they use different types of shovels to help with different types of soils, they have a wheelbarrow to carry artifacts and soil away, to get dirt away from artifacts they use a knife and a whisk and dust pan to brush dirt away from the excavation.        As you can see their job is not the easiest thing to do. When they dont find something they probable get down but they always keep their heads up and keep on keepin on. If you know someone who is an archeologist tell them thank you for their great work. They havwe done things like finding four hundred year old forts, find old president homes as a kid, and use really cool tools.

I will explain more about archeologists and the tools they use if you keep reading.       If you ever want to be an archeologist you have to study a lot about the place you choose.  The archeologists in source #1 were trying to find James Fort.  First they had to study about it like I said in the sentence before. Then they had to look for artifacts. They probably had to use some of the tools I was talking about. Since they did a lot of studying and read books about it,  all of there hard work payed off.  They finally found James Fort.       In source #2 the archeologists were trying to find more on George Washington's childhood.  They believed that the stone base under the house was still there.  They had to dig if they wanted to prove it.  So they started to dig, and dig, and dig. Finally they found it even if it took over a year.  They found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.  There were other houses so they had to find proof that it was his house.  Finally they found proof that it was his house.       I will talk about the tools now.  The tools they used were a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.  They were all used to find and dig up artifacts.       If you want to be an archeologist you would have to do a lot of work, like studying, reading, digging, and finding artifacts                 	PRP VBP VBN NNS IN NNS IN DT NN , IN DT PRP VBP TO VB JJ IN DT NNS , CC PRP VBP TO VB DT NNS IN NNP NNP MD VB RBR IN NNS CC DT NNS PRP VBP IN PRP VBP NNP NNP PRP RB VBP TO VB DT NN PRP VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN PRP NNP DT NNS IN NN # CD VBD VBG TO VB NNP NNP NNP PRP VBD TO NN IN PRP IN PRP VBD IN DT NN NNP NNP PRP VBD TO VB IN NNP NNP RB VBD TO VB DT IN DT NNS PRP VBD VBG NNP NNP PRP VBD DT NN IN NN CC VB NNS IN PRP , DT IN EX JJ NN VBN NNP NNP RB VBD NNP NNP NNP NN # CD DT NNS VBD VBG TO VB JJR IN NNP NNP POS NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN NN IN DT NN VBD RB NNP NNP VBD TO VB IN PRP VBD TO VB NNP NNP PRP VBD TO VB , CC JJ , CC NNP NNP PRP VBD PRP RB IN PRP VBD RP DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN , VBP NNS , CC NN NNP NNP VBD JJ NNS IN PRP VBD TO VB IN DT PRP VBD PRP$ NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT PRP VBD PRP$ NNP NNP MD VB IN DT NNS NNP NNP NNS PRP VBD VBD DT NN CC NN , NN CC NN , NN , NN , NN NN , CC DT NNP NNP VBD DT VBN TO VB CC JJ RP NNP NNP PRP VBP TO VB DT NN PRP MD VB TO VB DT NN IN NN , IN NN , NN , VBG , CC NN NNS

But actually its the best job ever. You get to learn cool things and have fun. We also dig from the past and search. We get to use cool 3D computers to search stuff and many more. Let me tell you some ways how its fun and how we do the work.       One reason why being an archeologist is cool and interesting because we get to find things that famous people in the old days used like old plates well they used wood as plates and bowls, we would find that and we would also find many more things like pottery and clay pipes as you know George Washington smoked that.  We where actually digging and we found burned pottery and many more stuff.       Some tools we use are pick and shovel, we start digging with those two tools. The skim shovel is very useful we use that to take off very thin and thick layers of soil.  Then we use a knife to dig and scrape dirt of the artifacts.  It says the best thing to use in archeology is the Trowel, it is to scrape and cut the soil to see how it looks. We use a wheelbarrow because all the artifacts are heavy and we cant carry alot of heavy stuff,It hurts. At the end we use a whisk and a dustpan to brush the artifacts because we could see whats under the dust.       We find proof, we don't just lie we actually look. We find burned pottery and sometimes houses underground. Its very cool, we sometimes even find a canon. Its very cool, but to find that stuff we have cool equipment like 3D computers and scanning robots to find metal stuff.       So I really think being an archeologist is fun and interesting.

It was designed to discover secrets of james fort in jamestown,virgina.           The archceologist were digging up things like: George washington's body.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from england to start a new life.                 it was easier to dock ships there so it made sense that the settlers would stop there.objects found nearby people suggested the fort was further away.lets talk more about archceologist.          archceologist is a job for people that like history. archceologist is people that dig up acinet bones from people in history.they turn in the bones to other people that they work for they also send the else where that is my report on archceology.

First team of an archeologists maps the area using 3d computers that can track what is underground.The imformation is recorded so    that people will know what to look like before people started    digging.Another team focues on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels.these shovels are so small,flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of the soil, one at a time.          That soil is then placed in the box with a 1/2' screen at the bottam.This let's the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.The diggers also use a process called troweling.Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in lad studying the objects that are found.The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.

For example archeologist study of  how many years is the bone under ground. They also study a person's life.                  Archeologist is a hard work, you always have to travel around the world and they use alot of tools to dig and more else. They use pick and shovel to dig, whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt, knife is for careful digging and to scrape dirt around the artifacts, wheelbarrow is to move items from one place to another, skim shovel with a flat edge and used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil. Finally trowel is the most common tool of archeologist. They use it to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.

If it is really hot out side and you have no shade then you have to stay out there and burn untiel you find what you are looking for it mite be boring if you do not find what you are looking for.  What if somebody else finds what you are looking for.  If you get lost what can you do there is nothing you can do about it. It mite be kind of fun if you are finding things and you are getting mony for it and you could find cold and other stuff that is good for you plus you could find some good stuff and when you do you could be rich what they do is that they get to look for rocks that have facks and information about that person and if they find something then they can go back to where they work and do what they do.         When they find something then they will have to dig it up then they need to scan it then when they have scand it they have to brake the rock in oder to see what is inside the rock when they do brake it then they will brush it then when they did that they have to put it in a room that is really hot that will crak some peases off of it that will make it  easyer to see what it is.  When that is done they will put it in a musam or they will sel it for mony that is what i think they would do.

Archeologists believe that the stone base under the house was still there. They started to dig in 2003. I think that archeologists would and would not be interesting. I say no because it takes to long. It would be boring and longtime and may not find anything and make money. You will have to stay there for two weeks. I say yes becaause you lots of money and fun to find information about the past. Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects for from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all withen the border of the fort. While digging in the area, the archeologists ound the trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they hate.                       Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made, arsheologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. Today, the groups find nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metel toys for children. Most of what we know about George Washington comes frm his time as a soldier and president. Now one knew exactly where the washington home was located since the actual building was long gone. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is under ground. So that was my report that I wrote. Thank you very much.

You should really try your best on the test and take your time.You also need to listen to the stories that they read to you. If you don't you will not be able to finish the quistions.that's why you need to make sure you read carefully.       You need consintrate on your test and make sure you didn't make any mistakes. you should also make sure that you are not paying attention to any other people computer.you need to pay attention to your computer because if you don't you will be the one to get a bad grade.then everyone would have been laughing at you because you didn't get the correct grades you were suppose to get.then you would be upset that those people were laughing at you.       the reason we want people to time on their test is because most people will not have the chances to go to school like us.most people don't even have a school to go to. and why well it's because they either end up in jail or burried dead.half of the people in our world didn't even finish school.they either are on the corner of a liquire store or out somewhere doing some bad drugs.i mean why do people do stuff that they know is wrong.       you should also finish school. the reason you should finish school is to get a daploma.you should want do something with your life.you should also do something good for yourself.but don't just think about yourself think about the people in the world.

An archioligist studies objects which they find in the dirt called artifacts and studies them. Even though you have to dig alot it is worth it when you find the artifact you were looking for.            If you would like to be an archioligist you have to be really patient because you might be digging for weeks. Artifacts may also tell you something about that time period. Certain artifacts you may find may help you knowa more about what happened to a house or any other building because if you find burnt pottery tells you a fire may have occured there.

This all may sound simple, but it's not! Archeologists must be very patient and careful with the artifacts and the digging, because if you are not careful with an artifact than you may drop or break it! Also, like I said before, you must be very patient because digging sometimes can take a very long time! Now, you must be thinking, what's so great about artifacts anyways? Well, artifacts are not just a piece of history, they can also tell us more about the history in that time period. Actually, I had already said that earlier, but that is okay.               Now we shall be talking about how artifacts help understand and tell us more about the history. For example in Source #2 it talks about George Washington's history and how some artifacts helped to understand a little bit more about his life, I mean they found clay pipes, and George Washington smoked clay pipes!That is also how archeologists knew that they had found the right house because it was evidence that it was the correct house. Wow! How cool is that! Archeologists can find the place that they are looking for just by having the right facts and finding artifacts! I'm pretty sure that is something that archeologists are trained to do.          Now you must be wondering, ' How do archeologists find and dig up these artifacts, and what do they normally use?', well, hold your horses, because now I about to tell you! Actual archeologists do not just find these artifacts by themselves. No way that would happen! Then finding the artifact or artifacts would take forever! No, that actually doesn't happen, because archeologists work together as a team to discover the artifacts. As a matter of fact, some teams can have up to thirty-five people on the team! No joke! But what do archeologists USE to find these items? You must be wondering. Well right now I shall list a couple of tools that archeologists and their team use to dig up these items. Pick and shovel are used to start most digs to dig near the artifacts. Whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts, and to clear dirt away from the excavation site, too. The knife is used for careful digging and also to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used not only to move items from one place to another, also to sometimes to carry dirt away from the excavation site to someplace elsewhere. The skim shovel is used to remove thin layers of soil, carefully, with a flat edge made for that specific purpose. Now I will be telling you about the last tool that is commonly used by archeologists, and it is called the trowel. The trowel is actually probably the most commonly used tool in archeology. It is normally used to cut and scrape to view the different layers of soil, there. Well, there is one more thing used for digging up artifacts in archeology, some teams use 3-D computers that can track what is inside what is in the ground right before the digging, so that you will not have to dig in a place where there isn't anything that you were looking for.Well, now I believe that I have covered all the tools!         Wow! Now I hope that you have at least learned something new about archeology, and archeologists, if you have, good for you! And if you haven't, well, too bad then! Anyways, I still hoped that you have enjoyed my report on archeology, and archeologists! Bye!

Archeologists also need to be observant and aware of their surroundings. Something could be laying beneath the dirt 25 feet away from you and you may not notice, so always be aware. You may not think so, but archeologists are very important people. You would be surprised of how much knowledge in history has come from archeologists finding and putting together the puzzles of the past. Archeologists also help people understand famous people from long ago, such as George Washington. Archeologists went out looking for items and hints of his past so people could understand what his life was like before he was even famous.             One of the tools an archeologist uses to find items and hints of the past is a 3D computer that can detect things underneath the surface of the earth. This tool is used in many cases, for it is very important. This device is important to archeologists because it can see more than the human eye can. As I said earlier, something could be laying 24 feet away from you covered in dirt and you may not notice. That's why archeologists use the 3D computer. Although not everything archeologists use is a high-tech device. Archeologists still have to use their own senses to find an item. And archeologists still have to use shovels to dig things up. So archeologists also requires strength.             Some self-operated tools that archeologists still have to use are trowels, skin shovels, wheelbarrows, whisks and dustpans, picks, and shovels. You may have notices that I said shovel twice, but the two shovels I said are two different types of shovels. The skin shovel is used to start the digging. The sharp, flat blade of the shovels helps to remove tough layers of soil that can't be removed by a regular shovel. The wheel barrow is used to put dirt in so other archeologists can take the dirt somewhere else and dump it out, then they bring it back to the whole the other archeologists are digging, then the cycle of that repeats.             Many of the people that may be reading this may feel different about archeologists and may understand them better. I hope that the readers of this report are now truly fascinated by the life of an archeologist.

This job is time waitsing, hardcore, and exausting but you are doing good at the same time. You are helping yourself and the country, mabe even the world.           This job requires skill in so many ways. You have to know how to use the tools carefuly and safely. you would have to know how to not chip the fossils or valuable arcafacts.            The tools are...   Pick and Shovel: To dig and start a hole to the artifacts.   Wisk and Dustpan: To brush off dirt from the artifacts.   Knife: Used to carefully scrape dirt off the artifacts.   Wheelbarrow: Used to hall away dirt from the site.   Skim Shovel: A shovel that is used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.   Trowel: The most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut the diffrent layers of soil.            The archeologist job is the most skillful job in my opinion. I wouldn't want to be an archeologist because it takes patince and I don't have any. This job is for someone more skillful than me.

People though that it had been washed away for 200 years. Jamestown still may be around. The fort was bulit in 1607 setterlers came from England to start a brand new life. James fort was probally destroud by a river.It was easier for ships to come in &amp; get out.Which was also a bad thing because it made it easeir for enemy ships to come. The first objects that were found was in 1861.They uncoverd armer and wepons. another thing they discoverd was floors of bildings.100 years latter they found were the fort began. They led a five year study they figerd out how the land was used. today they find over 1millon things each year.That includes pottery, tools, and coins.   I think its fun to learn about what people   did a100 years ago!           What tools they used to find things!!!   Pick Shovle Wisk Dust pan knife weelbarrow Skim Shovle Trowel               I think these were helpful so they could dig things up better.

They look for things underground and they dig it up and study it. Archeologist study places like Jmes Fort and were George Washington lived. They have to find the place where the building was and have to dig it up.          The first objects they found in James Fort was in 1861. They also studied the fort's floor of the buildings. They also uncover weapons and armors. Archeologist today find 1 million objects a year in the spot that James Fort was found and where it was built.The type of objects they find are pottery, tools, coins, and some toys that the children played with. The archeologists found the trash that people in the 1600's threw away including the bones of the food they ate.            Once archologists find the spot where the building or house was, they rebuild it so people can see how they lived and how it looked like over 100 years ago. They build it exactly how it was in the past. With the help of archologist the workers rebuilt it. Archeologist find the spot that the building was, and on the ground there are marks that show where the walls are.            Archeologists find these things by digging underground in the same spot where they buildings were built and then were destroyed. They use tools like the skim shovels to help them dig. They also used the pick, which is used to dig. The most common tool is the trowel, it scrapes and cuts to view the different layers of soil.            Archeologist have difficult jobs and can take about 5 years to finish finding and studing the objects they find. They work in groups so they can work faster and each group has about 35 people. the first group maps the area usning 3D computers. The process is slow. If we didnt have archeologist we wouldn't know how the past was.

Being an archeologist you have to be really be patient and persistent. I don't think that it would be a fit job for me. Spending  your whole day outside digging is what it takes to be an archeologist. Even if you spend your whole day on you hands and knees that dose not mean you are going to find anything.               Most people just think that archeologist are people that just dig. But that's not right there is more than that to one who is an archeologist. They split the archeologist into teams ( there can be up to 35 people in a team ) The first team uses 3-D computers that can tell them what is underground. Then they keep track of what the computers are saying what's underground. So therefore they can tell the diggers what they are going to find roughly. The second team is doing the digging. The place where that dig is call a dig.                Archeologist have to use many tools too. Here are the tools they use to dig at the digs                     -Pick and a Shovel      Which they are use to start a dig                  -Whisk and a Dustpan     Which are used to clean off that artifacts                  -Kinfe     Which is use to dig dirt off the artifacts                  -Wheelbarrow     Which are use to carry things from one place to another                  -Skim Shovel     Which is use to dig thin layers of soil                  -Trowel     Which is used for cut through the ground to see the different layers of soil Thoughs are the tools that archeologist use in the digs.                Being an archeologist is not the easiest job. Also there is more to an archeologists job then you think. But you have to be really patient and persistent. That is what it takes to be a archeologist.

They find old things that have been left after people died and archeologists uses tools to find the things that peoplr left over the years. Somethings might be new if it looks shiny. Archeologists may go any where they wanted to go because as a archeologists they go all over the world to do their job.                                                                         One day I will want to be an archeologists. So I can  go all over the so i can go wherever I want to go. I would also like to know more about the past too.

The job is not simple because you have so many tools  to use and you have to know witch tool to use at the right time. Some of the tools you would have to use are : a pick and shovel, a whisk and dust pan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.                firstly, archeologist need to be very smart because they have to be on the computer a lot researching and finding out where stuff is also the need to be able to operate the new technology.                   secondly, you have to want to be an archeologistt. You can tell who wants it. some people who really wanted it are the people that made the ,James town rediscovery archeological project . the project was made to find out the truth about Jamestown. for many years the people thought the place had been washed out by a river ,however a few signs show it may still be standing today. the place was made in 1607 when settlers came to start anew life.                     thirdly,  i believe archeologists need to record things about what they find. i believe this because if they find some thing really big and they don't record it and get evidence then no one will believe them , the kids wont learn if in school and our whole world will get nowheree unless someone else finds it to.           finally , i think the archeologist job is not simple because they have to be smart and determined.  this is why an archeologists job is not simple.

Archaeologists jobs are to dig up stuff from the past. The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James fort in Jamestown, Virginia. for over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. some people thought that some discovers might still be around.            The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came England to start a new life. Most believed that James fort was built near the river. did you know that it was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. some people found objects nearby and suggested that the fort was located further away.the new spot mostly gave the settlers more protection from the enemy ships around them.                 Did you know that the first objects were found in 1861. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. The national park service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. they new it would help them decide where to find the proof of the fort. the first thing they found was a marking on the ground. Did you know that the people that were studying use computer mapping software to make an image of the area.                     Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. While digging in the area, the archaeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate. they said  that this trash the settlers threw away helped them under stand the way the people in Jamestown lived and what they ate.

Then after doing all of the hard work then they go find several sources.They found some artifacts about Jamestown and George Washington.The archeologists have special tools to find real artifacts about George Washington or James.There are six tools are Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan,and knife.The other three is Wheelbarrow,Skim Shovel,and Trowel.Which is the tools used by archeologists.               Archeologists find good sources that they can used to find more information about George Washington.The also learned about the kinds of things they do.They used computers to find the information about other people's history.The archeologists used mapping software to make an image of the area.Archeologists also finds dozens of burial sites and study images to find location.                For Jamestown the archeologists found eleven cellars and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.For George Washinton archeologist believed thath the stones base under the house was still there.The archeologists found interested fact about both people.                      Another job for an archeologists is to find important fact about Jamestown and George Washinton. How did there life go as growing up.An what did it take to become a president and a town.The find good sources to find good facts about both topics that the did a research on                  They seach on where did the person died and where the person had live. An when did they was elected to be a president.Was it a hard time to be an president.Another job is to find the last location were that person was and dig up their bones.To see how they died.                The last job it  that they show kids how to explore the site experience colonail life and to become a junior archeologists.

The achaeologist job is too discover what is in the wasington`s home for many reason. First,it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous. The first thing that they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the fort`s walls used to be . Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made, the archaeologist knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.                                              They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges were designed to hold canons. The archaeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buidings all within the border of the fort. Some discoveries in area the hinted that it might still be around. They also discovered the floors of buildings.                                 Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.  Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. The National Park Service led a five -year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.The people doing the study used coputer mapping software to make an image of the area.                                                                                                                                 The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in the James fort lived. We now know how the setters fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.  We also know what the setters did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.   They had new that mybe had to do it because they  had something to protect and they had to go through all of that. And that most people didn`t have to go through it but they took there time to do it anyaway but they did.                                                                                                                                They had to find out where it was to located it and then know that it was far away. Even if they were not able to get to it they had to find a way to get to it anyway. Also those achaeologists started their dig with what are called skim shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to rremove dirt. The information is recored so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.We know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house.                                                                                                                                                              Thewe also begin to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived.  No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone so they had to find the home or they would`ve been really disportanted.   they found the main farmhouse a few years later  so now I know what this is all about                                              	DT NN IN NNS JJ IN NN DT JJ VBN DT NNP NN NNP NNP NNP NN NN VBZ RB RB WP VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NNP NNP , PRP VBZ DT NNS IN DT NNP NNPS DT JJR NN IN WP NNP NNP VBD IN PRP VBD NNP NNP JJ NN WDT PRP VBD VBD DT NN IN NNS IN DT NNP VBZ VBN WRB DT JJ NNS VBN TO VB .

Being an archeologist is a very big and busy job.You are in a group of 35 people and your group is responsible for that certain area.They use 3D computers to track what is underground.Using the 3D computers allow them to know what it looked liked before the person started digging.Other people dig and use different tools like skim shovels .            Archeologists use many different tools to help them find the artifacts they need.They use tools like a pick and shovel.They use that to dig with.Also they use a whisk,dust pan,and a knife to scrape and clear dirt of an object.Wheelbarrows come in handy when you need to carry one object to another site.Skim shovels and trowels are used to remove different lays of the soil.They do not just use these tools on any old object.They have a specific tool for every single object like they use a whisk and a dustpan for fragile objects.

It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.

Arceologists study objects that have been burried away for a year to five centuries long and recover them and keep them sell them or even put them in an museum.  Archeoliogists also use many tools to recover these objects like a Trowel they use this to scrape and cut to view the layers of soil this tool is the most common tool in Arceology.  Arceologists also use other tools like Wheelbarrow they use this to move items from place to place or carry dirt away from the excavation site.  Archeologists have a very important job because when they find an object they have to be exact on digging or the object could get broken or even damaged because of a slight miscalculation of them or their computers!            Archeologists also have a role to fill in math and technology when they have to calculate in their head or even on a site then they have to be exact and they also use tecnology too and they have to have very good computer and tech skills because they use these alot in Arceology and when they use these they also have to make sure that the computer is also working properly!            Archeologists often are very exiciting because they could find anything that interests people of all ages because they could find a dinosaur bone or something that could also intrest kids.  When they dig they use very good postures they have to have  clena hands and most of all gloves so they dont get any of their prints on the object because if they get a print on the object then when they send it to a Sciencetist then they can figure out whos artifact it is or where did it come from and how long has it been there for? As you can see Archeologists have an important job and thats what an Archeologists do! 	WP VBP NNS VB .

I think it would be a good thing dream about and look up to being an archaeologist. An archaeologist has a big responsiblity trying not to break potery or other fragle items. They also get to play in the dirt not how you play in the dirt but how they play in the dirt they have tools like picks,shovels,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel, and a trowel.         A pick is a tool that get hard sand or stone out of the way. A shovel wich you all know you use it to dig up dirt. A knife is a sharp tool but they use it for cutting things in the way. A wheelbarrow is used for carrying items back to the lab or the storage. A skim shovel is used for getting  a thin layer of soil. A trowel is like pie cutter, but that is not what it is used for. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.        I think being an archaeologist would be fun.

Archeologists. Archeologist have a very important job to do. They dig up things that are still unknown about and they find out more about our marvelous history. Though the job is very tiring and slow, it is all worth it.       First, you'll need some tools! Archeologists have to have many tools to dig things up. Some of the tools they use are the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, the knife, the wheelbarrow, and the skim shovel. These help a lot in finding old artifacts. Most of the time, you will need a pick and shovel. They are basically used to dig. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush off dirt from the artifacts but without destroying the artifacts. The knife is for scraping off dirt around the artifact and the wheel barrow is for moving items from one place to another. Lastly, the skim shovel is different from a regular shovel, It has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.       Next, archeologists need to have accurate measurements to see where the artifacts are. Archeologists use 3D computers that can track what is underground. There are many teams that help out. One team can be up to 35 people! Each team has it's own job, for example, one team can do the actual digging and the other can study the items that were dug up. They can spend days on one artifact which may seem very long; it actually is but it's all worth it in the end.       Then, after the artifacts are dug up, a team studies the artifact that was brought in. And this can help people understand better about our history. When you put the pieces together, you can see how our history connects in one piece. That shows that archeologists have a big job.       In conclusion, archeologist have a very important job to do and that is to find out more about our past and history. They do the hard and tiring work to discover more about history. So that shows that they should be respected. Archeologists have a interesting job and I think it would be fun to have a job like that.

An archeologist will help people understand famous people or something that happened in history.             An archeologist's job is important to people who want to know more about history or someone important to history. If you want to know about a person you will go look at an archeologist's work or meet the archeologist.              In 1994, people were intrested in studying the past of a city called Jamestown. The project was designed to find the secrets of the James fort in Jamestown. A rumor was spready to say that jamestown was washed away by a river.

Archeologists use  a pick and shovel to dig into the earth close to artifacts. They also use a wisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skilm,shovel, and trowel.  They go in teams and 35 people can go on a team. The first team maps an area by using 3 demention computers to trackt what is underground. The other team goes on a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with a skilm shovel.   When archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt is called Troweling.           Archeologists started digging to find Washington's house in 2003. Records show that the Washington's   house had a fire in it. The diggers found pieces of burt pottery that showed a fire was there. They also foun part of a clay pipe so we know that Washington smoked clay pipes.            Finding Fort James   In 1994, a group of people intrested in studing the past started the jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was desined for discovering the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia. For more  than 200 years, people thought a river washed the fort away.        The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most of the people believed that James Fort was built near the river so it was easier to dock ships there so it made sence.  Objects nearby suggested the fort was located far away so the new spot maybe gave the settelers more protection from enemies.       The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists are the name for scientists that study objects from the past that uncovered armor and wepons. They also dicovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort wwas built began.           The National Park service led a five - year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing this study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.       That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read and the drawlings they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized ther were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges where desined to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.           Today, the group  finds nearly 1 million objects a year. The objects include pottery,tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or in a pit. While digging in the area, diggers find the trash and animal bones settelers threw away.   The information learned from these objects helps them understand how the people in James Fort lived. Now we know how settelers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. We also know what the settelers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.

170	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	NR			F	418798	5	11064744	Y	56274	 Archaeologists                  What are Archaeologists? Archaeologists are scientists who study objects from the past. The first objects from the past were found in 1861. Some archaeologists uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered some floors from buildings. Some even look for famous places, things, and people from the past, for example, Fort James and George Washington's past.                     Some tools they used were picks and shovels. Picks and shovels were used to start digging until you got close to the artifacts. I think the picks were used to brake rocks that were in the way of the dirt. I think the shovels were used to carry dirt to the wheelbarrow.                     Wheelbarrows were used to move things away to a new place. Things wheelbarrows might have carried things like dirt, rocks, and maybe artifacts. Wheelbarrows maybe important to archaeologists because if they didn't have wheelbarrows how would they carry things from place to place.                     Whisks and dustpans were used to brush dirt off of the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Maybe whisks and dustpans were also used to sweep up thing like broken artifacts or bones. I think whisks and dustpans were important to archaeologists or else if they didn't have them they wouldn't be able to sweep away all the dirt.                     Knives were used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Also I think knives were used to cut roots that were in the way. Or knives could be used to dig out left behind dirt in the artifacts.                     Skim shovels is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Also I think they could be used to carry dirt to the wheelbarrows. If archaeologists didn't have skim shovels they wouldn't be able to remove the thin layers.                     Trowels are probably the most common tool in archeology. Also used to scrape and also to cut to view the different layers of soil. If archaeologists didn't have trowels they wouldn't be able to scrape and cut the soil.              	NNS WP VBP NNS .

They find   old things dug up in the dirt. These people are called Archaeologists. The things they find in the dirt are called artifacts. Archaeologists go and learn about our past. Lets go and   descover what it is like to be an Archaeologist.           To  be an Archaeologist you need to have a lot of pacience, if you don't this is not   for you. It takes a long time to dig stuff up. It is very delicate work. It can take up to two weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section! Choose your team carefully. If you are in team 1 you sit at a computer all day! If you don't want that, choose team 2. If you choose team   2 you get to dig all day.           If you are in team 2 you need to know the tools. The tools are pick and shovel,   whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Those are the tools. Now you need to now what there for. The pick and shovel are for when you start. The whisk and dustpan are for brushing dirt off artifacts. The knife is for digging around artifacts. The wheelbarrow is for moving dirt and other items. The skim shovel is for removing small amounts of dirt. The trowel is used the same as the skim shovel. Thats    the tools.           I think archaeology is a cool thing to learn about. I would like to learn about   people's past. I enjoy learning about archeaology and hope to do it again.

Now i would like to talk about Archeologists and how they work.So all of use know what Archeologists is they are people who study well know people or city/towns.       This time I will be talking about about utensils. so I will names some like the paint brush which is used to uncover any dirt or dust.Another is gloves so there would be no finger prints.       Now I will try to sum this up by saying that Archeologists are very important. plus if we did not have them it would be a lot we would not know.

They use whisk and a dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts to clear away the dirt. They use a knife for careful digging to scrape the dirt all around the artifacts. They use a wheelbarrow to move stuff form place to a another and to also carry dirt away. They use a skim shovel with a flat edge move a thin of soil with small scoops. Archeologists also use trowel to scrap and cut to view layers of soil. Archeologists get to descover new thing about famous people a long time ago that no one never new about. Things they descover about famous people is like about their childhood, how they became famous, where they grew up at, when was their birth date, when did they die, how many kids they had, all of their houses, or what school did they go to. Archeologists get to learn many new thing and descover many new things. Archeologists have a great job because you could learn things about a place or someone you never now about.

Second,finding things is important because they help discover famous people's lives.Like George Washionton's pottery pipe he used to smoke in it.His house burned down too.Archioligests found peices of burnt pottery on the ground.They found a pottery pipe that George Washionton used to smoke.Also like king tut they found his things int he underground tunnel.They found his stuff when he used to be king.They found many things in his grave.They still have not found Ameilia Earheart.They are still triying to find her.   Third,if the archioligests find something they return it back to the lab.The scientests study the artifacts.They study it wether it is bones,fur,pottery,jewlery,and art.To prevent something happening the scientests put on gloves.That helps the scientest's skin from burning up or catching a disese.   In conclusion the archioligests do lots of stuff.They can go to digging little things to big things.They can dig things,find things,and send things to the lab.They should be careful because they could injure themselves.This is the job of the archioligests.

Well, now you will. Archeologists are scientists who study objects, known as artifacts, from the past. I used 3 resources with facts about archeologists to find the right information. The articles are titled, 'Finding Fort James', 'Digging up George Washingtons Past', and ' Tools Used by Archeologists'.                     In 1994, archeologists found Fort James. The fort was believed, for 200 years, that it was washed away by a river or moving water. The fort was built in 1607 and the first objects giving facts about the past were found in 1861. The artifacts found wwere armor, weapons, and floors of buildings. About 100 years later a team of archeologists worked very hard to find where the fort was located. Even though they might not have found the exact place, they found near it. Today, groups of archeologists find 1 million artifacts from Fort James a year.              George Washington was a heroic leader and it's so fascinating to learn about his life, where he got is ideas, and where he lived. The land George and his family lived on is called Ferry Farm and families have lived on that land for over 12000 years. Ferry Farm is a perfect place to build a home, and that's probably why George's father moved his family there. George moved to Ferry Farm when he was only six, that means he spent almost his whole life on that land. Nobody knows exactly where the house was, nor which main farm was his, but we can use artifaccts to make an educated guess. The first buildings and floors they found were slave quarters, the kitchen, and storage houses. Occurding to records,it had said that the Washingtons' house had caught on fire. With that information, when the archeologists found burnt potterey, they had a more educated guess on where the Washingtons had built there house. They also already knew that George had smoked clay pipes, so when they found half of a clay pipe, they had a better guess on which was his house and farm. This is how we know and continue to learn so much about George Washington and his family.                Artifacts are used by archeologists so they can find information from our history. As they keep digging, we keep learning all of the amazing facts about our history. Archeologists have such an important job in our world. The job of an archeologist is to dig up the past and get the information we need to know about our history and historical figures in our history.

In the articles, 'Finding Fort James', and 'Digging up George Washington's Past', by Cheryl Bradley and Gloria Corres, it explains what the finders of artifacts, or archeologists do. Archeologists have complicated, time consuming jobs, but it is all worth it to find impressive artifacts that tell us about our past.          To begin, the work that archeologists do is usually complicated. One team creates a map with 3D computer that tracks what is underground. The other team digs with a small, flat, and sharp shovel. They then put the soil in a box. The archeologists can also use a process called troweling, where they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to get rid of dirt.           Another idea is that it is worth all this hard work. With all this work, archeologists can help people learn more about our past. In 'Digging up George Washington's Past', it explains that with all their hard work, United State's citizens have a better understanding of what he was like before he was famous, we get to know more about why he made the decisions he did, and we also get to know how Colonial Americans lived.           Lastly, their jobs are very time consuming. It took two weeks for archeologists to dig up a 25 square foot place! It also took 5 years to find James Fort!          Overall, an archeologists job is complicated, time consuming, but worth it. Even though with all this hard work archeologists work hard.                    	WP NNS VBP DT JJ NNS IN NNS .

We know that George Washington was a soldier for the United States of America.   He was a great leader to the United States.Washington moved to Ferry Farm.Washington smoked clay pipes.The Washington's had a fire in the house.The Washington's made pottery,like the clay pipes that George smoked.

They used a pick and showel to dig into the earth to look for close artifacts. They used the Whisk and Dustpan to brush the dirt off the artifacts also they used it to clear dirt away from the excavitaion site. They used a knife to dig carefully around the artifacts. they used a wheelbarrow to move things from one place to another and carry dirt away from the excavation site. They used the skim shovel to move a thin layer of soil. And lastly they used a Trowel. They used the trowel to scrape and cut to veiw the differnt layers of soil. I assume Archeologist used a lot of tools when they work. That is my explanation of an Archeologist.

Archeologists discover artifacts and they find buildings and old houses digging.       Archeologists discover artifacts from the past. They find armor for example at Fort James. They found burnt pottery in George Washington's childhood house. Tools were found under ground when archeologists were looking for Fort James. Coins were also found while they were looking for Fort James too. These are examples of what they discover from the past. Archeologists also find facts by digging.       Archeologists are also known for finding past buildings and houses by digging. They found George Washington's house from digging. They use clues to help. For example when they were looking for his house they found pieces of burnt pottery. When he was little their family had a fire in their house so they knew it was George Washington's. Archeologists also discovered Fort James by digging. They found floors of buildings to help.       This is what archeologists jobs are. They find artifacts from the past and find houses and old buildings. Archeologists also have a talent of putting what they find together and discover something else. When they found Fort James they noticed there where stone ledges build over the river for cannons. This is an archeologists job.

Archeologists would then sell the once-buried objects to musuems to make a profit. They would commonly look around someplace they think may be historical.There have been people to dig around George Washington's house from which he grew up in. Some have also excavated in Jamestown, Virginia in search of James Fort.                   There are also archeologists who do not just work on any project though. Some archeologists just stick to one particular work field. some work on digging up dinosaur fossils and others may only work on things from a particular war.                   An archeologist's job is very exciting, you get to excavate and learn more about our history. You might even be the first to find something new. Who knows? maybe you will be put in a history book for an amazing discovery.

The genius project was designed to discover the past of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, many people thought Jamestown had been washed over by a huge river, but some discoveries say it might still be around.                  The huge fort was built in 1607, along time ago. When settlers came from England to start an new life. Most folks believe that James Fort was built very close to a river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it would make sense that the would choose that spot to dock. Objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away tho.                  The first few artifacts were found in 1861 when Archeologists uncovered armor and weapons. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built again. The national state park service held a five year study of the area to figure  out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the forts existence. The people holding the search  used computer mapping systems to make an imaga of the area.

Wouldn't you want to find out something that are interesting? I know I would because you could probably find out where your favorite president lives or maybe you could find out where a colony that your studying built.           If there were no archeologists, we would've ever find out where cool stuff are! People could discover many things when archeologists goes searching for something! I want people to know that it is important to have archeologists.            I hope you think archeologists are important!

Here are some of the tools archeologists use shovels, picks, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelborrow, skim shovel and trowel. they use this tools foer different things. Archeologists went to George Washingtons old house from when he was younger. Archeologists are really cool because they get to experince new old places.             Archeologists also went to Fort James which is where the first settlers came and built a fort type thing. The arechologists find a lot of different things. Like they got to see where some of the walls were and the animals bones they ate. So here is some stuff about archeologists.

I picked about archeologists finding John Sutter's Fort. I seachered books about John Sutter, but I had no luck finding books about him. I looked every libary, yet again I had no luck finding the book about John Sutter. I gave up on finding a book about him.              It was three days until my deadline, and still no luck. My dad came up with a idea about reseaching John Sutter. Instead of reading books, my dad took my family to see a musem about the early Gold Rush. It was a long car since we lived in Greenfield and Sutter's Fort was in Sacrmento Valley. We got there early enough to see how the Gold Rush started.                 I reseachered the tools, their machines, and even they showed a pieced of a gold nugget. I wrote ten pages of John Sutter's fort. Then, it was two days until my deadline, so I turned my ten page essay into a five paragraph essay. Finally, I it was time to read my essay in front of the class. I was nervous, but my nerves didn't got the best of me.

I learned the discovery of washington home is important for many reasons first it gives citezens of the united states a better understanding of who george washington was before he became famous.also makes us understand why he chose what he did for a living.The way they found all the thing's a georges house is they used skim shovels and troweling.It takes at least 35 people on a job site to lok for his stuff.            They used alot of websites to look up history about george washington.I learned how to use resources and stuff to dig and find information on george washington by looking at websites also.I learned about how archeologists look up info and stuff to find old history about there past.They have different sources of websites too.I learned that they take awhile to find alot of info.They weight when a long time to find so its old.They do not look for until a long time so its old.         I learned the first objects were found in 1861.Over a 100 years later  a group effort found where the fort was built began.The national park service led a five year study of th area to figure out how the land was used.The people who were studying used mapping software to make an image  of the area.

An archeologist's job is to find artifacts and study them.                  As an archeologist you have to be very patient. In Digging up George Washington's Past by Gloria Corres it says it can take up to 2 weeks to dig up a 25 square foot patch of land. You also have to be very careful since you don't want to   damage the artifacts.                  You can find everything from a few dresses to cooking utensils to a bed. The bigger things you find the more you have to get out that wheelbarrow and push them to the other archeologists who are studying them. You can learn a lot from artifacts from long ago. You can learn how they functioned, how day to day life was, and what they did that is different from today.                  If you want to be an archeologist when you grow up, you might want to start paying attention in history class and learning to be more patient and careful!

It takes a lot of time to find what you are looking for. Archeologist look for acient artifacts that can uncover the past. Some tools they use are: A knife, wheelbarrow, shovel, and a pickaxe. Do you ever go to the a museum and see dinosaur bones? Archeologist dig under ground for many years to find the exact dinosaur bones you saw at the history museum! Being a Archeologist may be hard work and takes maybe ever 100 years to just find 1 peice of evidence, but it is all worth it in the end! I would not personaly like to be a Archeoloigist because I dont like to get all covered in dirt all the time! But if I have a good reason I will. You may be asking why i am talking about getting dirty. It is because Archeologist dig under ground miles with drills and shovels to find stuff that has been barryed under ground thousands of years ago and get realy muddy and dirty. That is my report on a job of Archeologist.

Many archeologists use tools like for example:a pick and shovel are used to dig in the earth to find artifacts,another tool they use is a whisk and a dustpan they use this to clear off dust or dirt on an artifact,they also use a knife for careful digging,the fourth thing they use is a wheelbarrow and they use it to move items from one place to another with out touching it,the fifth thing they use is a skim shovel it is a flat shovel used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop, the last object they use is a Trowel the Trowel is used to scrape and cut to view a different layer of soil. they use these tools to find clues of something that has lived a long time ago.

George Washington's past was known a long time ago and they still remember it today.George Washington was our president and was in the army.George Washington moved here with his family at age six.He started digging in 2003.George Washington smoked clay pipes so that his proof is right.The first buildings he knew was the kitchen,slave quarters,and the storage houses.        When people were digging in the past they found a lot of ancient stuff.They used pick shovels, a knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovels and a trowel to dig.They need a lot of men for this difficult task.They need teams to for digging.

They face dangers like caves falling in, the air may not be so great, and the weather may hold them back. They might have to wear oxygen masks.

The many tools archeologists have are tools that we've heard of before and tools we haven't heard of. The tools they use are called,   picks shovels whisks dustpans knives wheelbarrows skim shovels and trowels   See all of the the different kinds of tools they use!               Each tool has a different use. The pick and shovel work together to dig into the earth to find artifacts. The whisk and dustpan work together to brush dirt off artifacts. The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to the other. A skim shovel is a shovel that has a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. And last but never least a trowel. A trowel is the most common tool that's used by an archeologist. It is used to scrape and to view all the different layers of soil.                I'm guessing you saw how I used the word 'artifacts'. Artifacts is what archeologists try to find!               As you can see archeologists have very tough jobs.

The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.There were ledges that were designed to hold cannons.Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.                     Another example of what archeologist do is when archeologists found things about George Washington like   when archeologist found that people had lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years.No one knew  exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone. At least four other houses have been built on the Ferry Farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washington's farmhouse.They also found part of a clay pipe we know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house.

They are really interesting to know about and their job is super cool.They get to observe and explore new things every day.       Archeologist are people how wear lab coats and work in a lab.There kinda like scientist but they  study other stuff like animals or plants. you have to graduate from a very intelligent  college if you want to be a Archeologist.       You can be a Archeologist by paying intention in school and listen to your teacher and parents.  you also have to have good grades and never ever ever ever ever get suspended ever in your life.also you have to get into a college that is very smart.Plus in high school you have to be doing servos hours.

Archeologists job                      Archeologists job is a tough job they have to dig up artifacts and fossils to try and figure out   what the place was like in the past .For exaple they has to dig up where George Wasington lived to try to figure out what his house use to look like and some of the stuff that was in his house,and because they did that now Americans have a better understanding of how our first president lived.              But also Archeologists job can be a REALLY fun job because you could be the first people ever to see that certain artifact or fossil and it could change the world.Also Archologists job is  really tiring and time consuming but at the end of the day it all pays off when they get to see all the artifacts ansd fossils of the past from finding Fort James to learning George Wasington's past the job of an Archeologists can be fun interesting tiring ansd tough all at the same time but in the end it all pays off.                I think being an Archeologist would be a really fun job,it would be really interesting to learn about George Washington's past and Fort James and how people lived back then, and the stuff they used. I WOULD LOVE TO BE AN ARCHEOLOGIST.

Well if not I am going to tell you. Archeologists are people who learn about the past and dig in the places where people from the past were or lived. They also dig in the famous places from the past so the can get money, and put the things that they find in a muesum.               I told you they also learn about the past. Well, that is true and one reason is because they can learn about where things were and maybe where they still are. They also learn about some people so if they dig in a place and they don't know who lived there and maybe  that person was very famous maybe like George Washington, Abe Linkcoln, or Paul Revere. Then they would either know who lived there or could learn and see.                  They have dug up a lot of things like pipes, pottery, little things, and even houses, buildings and towns! They found James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. That was built in 1607! They actually found the first items in 1861. One hundred year later they found James Fort!                    They also have found George Washington's farmhouse that he lived in when he was six years old. People have been living on that land for over 12,000 years. The house actually burned down! They started looking in 2003. It took more than a year until they found it.  They used some 3D computers that can track under ground. Since then they have a program for kids and they teach them about things about George Washington.              There are a lot of tools archeologists use. Some are picks, shovels, wisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. There are probally a lot more tools!                 That is all I can tell you about archeologists! I hope you learned a lot of things about archeologists and what they do. 	NNS VBP PRP VB WP NNS VBP .

Archeologists                                       By: Zhiarrize ly Rosimo                                                Have you ever wondered how we know about the people in the past and  how they lived and worked ? How we knew dinosaurs that lived here before us ? Well, we know these things because of archeologists. They are the ones who dig up these artifacts and study them. Archeologists have lots of jobs.                    First, one job an archeologist might have is that they have to find an interest that people have from the past that  can not be proved like how people were interested in studying the past of the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. When they find an interest they look for the spot where it might be. They also check if any other archeologists from the past had found artifacts that are part of the interest such as the Jamestown where archeologists found objects in the area in 1861. Then they get ready to dig the site or area . That is the first step.                     Next, before they can dig  they must find the spot where it might be. They also might find  out how the land was used  and how they used resources to find the right spot. As an example; like when the National Park led a 5 year study of the area to figure out how the land was used for the Jamestown Project. To find the right spot and area they use technology to make an image such as computer mapping software and 3D computers that can track what is underground.The information is stored away and recorded so the archeologists know what the area looked  like before they started digging.This the second step.                       Finally, they do the actual digging of the site. Another team does the real digging of the artifacts because of the computers and the technology they use the archeologists know right where to dig and what artifacts to expect. The area they do the actual digging is called the dig. They use skim shovels to start the digging of the dig.The shovels are very small ,flat, and sharp  so that they can remove the thin layers of soil , one at a time. The soil that has been dug is placed in a box with a 1/2 inch screen  in the bottom. It lets the soil fall out but the artifats stay in. They also use the process called troweling . Troweling is when the archeologists use tiny shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the soil. This process takes a lot of hard work and time. It can take up 2 weeks just to dig a  25- square -foot section! Another team of archeologists study the artifacts at a lab and that can take a long time. The tools used by archeologists are; pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and teh trowel.                          So say thank you to your fellow archeologists because without them you would not know anything about dinosaurs or our presidents, anything because they work very hard an take their time for us to know about history. Those are the jobs of the archeologists. 	. . NNS IN : NNP RB NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WRB PRP VBP IN DT NNS IN DT JJ CC WRB PRP VBD CC VBD . WRB PRP VBP NNS IN VBN RB IN PRP .

Well go figure it did not get washed away 'did the..people belived it was washed away' give it away...well now for a history lesson.         When settlers from England came to the U.S in 1607 people believed FortJames was built near a river well guess what it was not haha wow who knew. FortJames was built further away it was probably to keep safe from enemy ships.         In 1994 a group of archaeologists started to give intrest in the secrets of FortJames but before that in 1861 the first archeologists found the first items in FortJames.         After five year study and search thats when THEY FINNALY FOUND FORTJAMES!!! The first thing the archeologists found was marks on the ground and the abandoned well where they put their trash they found evedence of attacks by the Powhatan tribe they found that they had little food they found coins,tools,pottery,alot of burial sites,and metal toys for the kiddies but we still don't much about it more secrets are being found daily.

In 1994, a group of people interested in Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. It was designed to discover the secrets. The big secrets about the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. It was like 200 years people thought that the Fort had been washed away by the river. There are some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still  be around. The second paragraph talks about the archeologists digging up the past. The process of digging at the Ferry Farm it is a really careful one. Every year the teams work on the site. There are 35 on the team. The first team are using 3 computers that tracks what is underground. The people will know what it looks like because it is recorded.The second team is actually digging it is called the dig.     Finally the last paragraph talks about finding your spot. There was a lot of people you lived on the Ferry Farms, there was like 12,000 years. the location is awesome. That is what makes it a good place to live. It's not surprising to George Washington's father Augustine Washington, moved his family there. Plus George was only six.

Georges past home has help historians know more facts about him.                           People have lived on a patch of land called the Ferry Farm, and makes a perfect place to build a home. He was just six at the time. No one knew knew exactly where his house was located since the real building was gone. At least four other homes were built on Ferry Farm so the diggers needed to search for proof that it was George's house.                                            Archeologists used the process of digging at the Ferry Farm and used a 3D computer to track what was underground. How do we know there is a lot more to him?

Many people thought it had been washed away by a river because it was near a river so it can dock ships easier but in the discoverics it can still be around.However, they found items nearby so they suggested that the fort was farhter away so the settlers could have protection from enemy ships.They found the first objects in the 1861 such as uncovered armor and weapons.The National Park Service did study on how the land was used and at last that they finally found Fort James!They set marks where the fort's walls are and they knew it would be like a triangle.they also made maps to show how long the fort isand then they found out some stone ledges used to hold canos and not only they found stone ledges they also found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings that border the fort.The group has found about one million items each year such as pottery,tools,coins and metal toys for the children! They even found trash from the settlers like the anaimal bones they ate. This information tells us about the settlers like when the Powathatan tribe that attacked them and when they had to surived on little food.Discovering these objects help us learn about the past about the settlers of Fort James.

Archeologists work and dig all day long.Some Archeologists work in thier labs all day studying ancient artifacts that they have uncovered. Archeologists do many different things!       So lets talk about water bottles after the Archeologists are done with thier water bottles they recycle them and make stuff out of them COOL RIGHT! When theyre recycled they mean they are reused and can be filtered and resued.        Did you know that archeologsits study dinosaurs? Thats why when you  go to the musenseumu see the bones of the dinosaur now you can rember that Archeologists dug that dinosaur up!

An archeologists job is to uncover things from the past that could tell the history of something or how something lived. You would have to be very careful if you are an archeologist because you don't want to break anything.            There are lots of tools that an archeologist could use. Here are the tools that an archeologist would possibly use:   Pick and Shovel. These tools are used to dig dirt and are the tools that archeologists usually start their work with. Whisk and Dustpan. These tools are used to brush off small amounts of dirt without breaking the object. Knife. This tool is used to dig around the objects and to scrape dirt from the artifact. Wheelbarrow. A wheelbarrow is used to carry heavy objects and dirt around. Skim Shovel. This shovel is used to take thin layers of dirt. Trowel. This tool is used for scrape and cut soil to see the different types.            Archeologists can dig up small and big things. For example when the archeologists were digging up things from Fort James, they found lots of small things like the things that people threw away many years ago. Big things were found when the archeologists were trying to find out where George Washington lived. They found the stone base. That was probably huge!!!            An archeologists job is hard and sometimes takes years to finish digging up one thing. You have to be very careful when you are digging up things. But once you are finished digging up something, even if it takes a long time, it is worth it.

Because you are looking at the past of towns and you are also looking at famous people like George Washington. So your going to have to get in a good college, need to have a degree in Archeologist, and learn how to study peoples lives.       You have to get into a good college because if you don't you can't be a good Archeologist. Also you wont get your degree in archeology. Many people think Archeology is simple but they are always wrong because it is not simple at all.       If you don't have a degree you can not be an Archeologist. if you cant become an archeologist you dreams are done. That is why you need to become an archeologist and get a good degree because they can deny you any time without any reason but one will be you degree. That is why you need a degree in Archeology.       you will need to learn how to study peoples lives. You will study peoples lives like George Washington and Samuel Adams that is why you need to learn how to study people live it is like writing an essay about them. You take when the were born and when the died and put it together.       You have to get in a good college, need to have a degree, and learn how to study people.

The pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, close to the ground. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off artifacts from the excavation site. the knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts. the wheelbarrow is for moving dirt or items from one place to another. the skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. and finally the trowel probably the most common tool in archeology, used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil           archeology has helped us to learn lots of facts about the past, will you grow up become an archaeologist?

What is an archeologist? An archeologist, is a name for a scientists that study objects from the past. The tools they used were a pick and shovel,whisk and dustpan,a knife,skim shovel,and a trowel. If you want to ' Get Involved' then you can go to Ferry Farm, it has lot of chances to explore sites (digging sites), know how colonial life was like, and even become a junior archeologist! Why is it so important that  they found Washington's house? Well it because now we know more about are  beloved(first) president,before he became president.                                         When they first found  James Fort,they found a set of  marks on the ground,thats were they marked the walls. They also found 11 cellars,tons of burial sites,and 10 buildings in the borderd of the fort. Today groups find nearly 1 million things each year. that includes pottery,tools, coins,and even a metal toy for kids. Fact,in the 1600's they used an unused well or a big pit to throw there trash down into,settlers threw away bones from animals they ate. With that info got from those things we now know how the people in James Fort lived.                                                                The things they used were pick and shovel , whisk and dustpan,knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. Pick and shovel, used to dig into the the earth ,close to artifacts. Whisk and dustpan, used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knife, used to careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.Wheelbarrow, used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from excavation site.Skim shovel , a shovel  with a flate edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Trowel,used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                                   James Fort was built in 1607 when people came from England to start a new life. For over 200 years people thouht that  the fort was washed away by the river. But thanks to archeologist they actuly found James Fort . Now we can get to know more about how the people lived at James Fort. The natinoal park service led a 5 year study to figure out how the land was used. They knew that that would help them look for proof of the fort. People doing the study computer maping software to make an image of the area.                                                                                        To discover objects from people who lived 100s of years ago is exciting. It ties us to the people who first started the American colonies and gives us a pice of our past.

Some things that I learned about digging up George Washington's past is that archeoiogists are learing about his life as a child.

Its like an adventure everyday for them. Its not always an easy job but its not always a hard job. Most archeologists don`t mind getting dirty and some like rocks or just finding things. Archeology is a very dirty job. You have to be smart.    There are many different jobs as an archeologist. For some jobs as an archeologist you have to be strong.

For example they use a pick and shovel which is used  to dig into the ground close to the objects were looking for. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush/clear off dirt from the artifacts . The knife is used the carefully dig around the objects and not into them. The wheelbarrow is used to move dirt/ item from one place to another.The skim shovel has a flat edge and removes thin layers of the soil at a time. Lastly there is the trowel which is most reccomended by most archeologists because it is used to scrape and cut around the important artifacts!! Those are the tols archeologists use.That is my report on archeologists !!!! 	PRP$ NN VBZ IN NNS .

Now today pottery objects include: tools,coins,and metal toys for children to play with.People who were not responsible threw there trash in a very old old well.The archologists found out that the people threw there,trash,bones of animals that they ate and threw away in a very old old well.

People have been living here since and archeologist like me are here to discover it. Being an archeologist is hard work. You work for hours a day. You have to have gentle hands to do the job that we do. Hope you enjoy me telling you about the past and the discoveries that archeologists have made.                       The first thing I should probably tell you is what kind of tools we use to find these artifacts.Some of the tools we use a lot in beginning of the dig are the pick and the shovel. We use these to dig into the earth and get closer to the artifacts. Then we use the wheel barrow to remove the dirt that we just dug up with the shovel and pick. We also use the wheel barrow to remove the artifacts that we dug up. After that we use the skim shovel and the trowel. We use the skim shovel to remove thin layers of dirt gently and we use the trowel to scrape and view the different kinds of soils. Then some of the last tools we use are the whisk and dustpan, and the knife. We use the whisk and dustpan to remove dirt from the artifacts and we use the knife to carefully dig and to scrape the dirt from the artifacts. Those are some of the tools we use when we are out on the job and now you can see how many tools we have to use before we actually get the artifactt.               Now I am going to tell you some of the famous people that we have tried to learn more about. One of them wasn't actually a person it was a huge group of people. They lived in the Fort James in James Town. In 1994 people interested in the past started a rediscovery of Fort James. It was built in 1607 and for over 200 years people have thought that it was washed away by a river. After a few years they finally fond there first artifact in 1861 and national park services led a five-year of the area to find out how it was used. Later they found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the forts boundries. Then they found out that they built stone bridges going across the river and they held cannons. Back then they had wells that they would throw there trash into and and after a few years of looking for one they found it with bones from the animals they ate and the trash they threw away.Today they find nearly 1 million artifacts including pottery, tools, coins, and even a few metal toys for kids. These artifacts helped us learn a lot about the first succesful settlement.                    Another really famous person that we tried to find out more about was George Washington. Most of what we already new about him was from his time of being a soldier and his time of being  president. George Washington moved to Ferry Farm at the age of 6 and archeoligists like my self beleived that the stone base of his house was still there, so they started looking for it in 2003. It took several years to find, but eventuallly they found some of it. They found the slave quarters, the kitchen, and storage houses. Later they found the main farm house. The finding of these artifacts have us discover many things of what people did in the past and soon people will be looking for our bones.                      In conclusion, I hope you have learned many things and that you just got a chance to imagine what it is like for archeologists.   Now when all of these archeologists that you see today are dead you will take there place and keep on learning about our past.

People have lived on George washington known land as Ferry farm for over 12,000   years.The location had made a perfect place to build a home, George washington's   name is Augustine washington and they moved his family there.George was six years   old at that time.       he infentee a lot of stuff and thats why I pick him .

For many years lots of people thaught that the fort had been washed away be a nearby river. Archeoligists thaught that it was close to the river for cargo ships to dock easily but war ships could also come up the river. Later archeoligists found imformation that the fort was further inland. Later, the fort was found. There was a a bridge for cannons to mount in case of an attack.

Archeologist find many artifact on they're trips. The artifacts can tell alot about the past. The burned pot piece found on the location of George Washington's childhood home shows there was a fire.A clay pipe shows the area in was found in was in facted the location of George Washington's childhood home. The trash found in the ruins of James Fort shows what the people ate and used.Now you can see how artifacts can tell people about the past.         Archeologist use many different tools. The wheelbarrow is used to move dirt and tools around . Picks and shovels are  used to get to the area the artifacts. Whishs and dustpans are used to clean dirt of artifacts and brush dirt away.The knife is used for careful diging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Skim shovels are use to carefully remove a thin layer of soil. The trowel is used to scrape and cut to veiw the different layers of soil. Those are the many tool that archeologist use.         In conclusion, archeologish do have amazing jobs. They learn many things from artifacts and use many tools.I hope you injoyed this report.For more facts go to wikipedia. 	NNP PRP RB JJ IN DT NN .

You have to do things like, searching for new places, discovering and recovering artifacts, and you also have to look for proof about who lived there.       While searching for new places, you have to first scan the area. Because discovering and analyzing an area is not all found in a day's work, you would also need to map out the place. You also would have to do some research on the place, which can take many years depending on how well known the area is. If you find any buildings, broken or not, you still have to analyze them 	VBG DT NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN PRP NNP NNP VBP TO VB NNS IN , VBG IN JJ NNS , VBG CC VBG NNS , CC PRP RB VBP TO VB IN JJ IN WP VBN NNP NNP VBG IN JJ NNS , PRP VBP TO JJ NN DT NNP NNP VBG CC VBG DT NN VBZ RB DT VBN IN DT NN POS NN , PRP MD RB VBP TO VB RP DT NNP NNP RB MD VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN , WDT MD VB JJ NNS VBG IN WRB RB VBN DT NN NNP NNP PRP VBP DT NNS , VBN CC RB , PRP RB VBP TO VB PRP

They have to use special tools like the pick and shovel in which they use to dig up the hard ground at the site. That is one of the different tools that the archeologists use wile finding artifacts.     There are different types of tools for digging up artifacts and here they are and how they are used.    The Whisk and Dustpan: used for cleaning dust and dirt off the artifact.   The Knife: used for careful digging and to help clean off the object.   The Trowel: used to scrape and cut the soil to see the different layers.   The Skim Shovel: has flat edge and is used to carefully dig a thin layer of  soil (dirt) with every scoop.   The Wheelbarrow: used to move big dirt piles and heavy artifacts.     Archeologists find different and really exiting things wile digging up artifacts. Once in 1994 they found Fort James!! Then in 2004 the archeologists found George Washington's farmhouse from when he was a kid!!! They found out that the kitchen, slave quarters,  storage houses, and farmhouse were seperate buildings.     There are different places to go on the enternet to find what archeologists have learned and found here are four I think might give the most information about finding George Washington's farmhouse:   http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-acheology/digs-washington-200809.html?c=yge=1 or http://www.kenmore.org or http://diganthro.wordpress.com/ferry-farm or http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/ProcessArch/ProcessArch/field_excavationtech.html with these you can learn all about how they found the stone base of Washington's house. Then if you want to learn about how they found Fort James here are three websites I found that might give you some infomation:   http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/chronology-of-jamestown-archeology.html or http://historicjamestowne.org or http://apva.org/rediscovory with these you can learn about how they found james fort.

They also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

To begin with,archeologists find by going in their old houses and searching in them for valuble stuf.Also by looking at document and signetchers of them befor they were alive.Pictures are valuble they test them and keep them as memories of what they use to look like.They save them and reasearch them until they are done.

I might find golden coins.Or might find bullets from World War II or III. Or might even find carvings from Indians. But one thing that really I want to find is dinosaur fossils or how long dinosaurs lived.   The tools I would use is a pick and shovel, a whisk a dustpan, and a knife, because a pick is used to cut into cement. A shovel is used dig into sand and soil. A whisk is to brush off artifacts. A dustpan is used to pick dust and trash and put it into a trashcan. A knife is used to carefully dig and to scrape dirt from the artifacts.   Other tools I would use is a wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. I would use a skim shovel because it removes a little bit of soil at a time. And I would use a trowel because it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. That is why I would use these tools.

It takes days or even years to uncover America's past. But they don't work alown. These arceologists work in teams up to 35 people in one group.                     The first team uses computers that are 3D that can track what is under the ground. that information is recorded so that they will know what the place looked like before they start digging.                      Another team foucuses on digging. The place the team does the digging is  called a dig. The arceoligests satrt digging with a shovel called skim shovels. Those shovels are used to get small layers of soil off the ground becaus they are flat, small and sharp.The soil is then placed in a box. In that box there is a half-inch screen. this screen is there so the dirt\soil can go out and the artifacts stay in the box. They also use these tools : pick and shovel , whisk and dustpan , knife , wheelbarrow , skim shovel ,and a Trowel. Those tools are all used with arceoligests. They say a 25-square-foot section can two weeks to dig !                      The last team spends days in the lad to study the objects they have found.

They were used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. Next is the wheelbarrow it was used to move items from one place to another like dirt. Last  one is the knife it is used to cut things.

You will learn a lot of important objects  about back then in the past from just one tiny book! Well I'm  going to tell you everything I learned about in the past! Enjoy :)                     In 1607 settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people believed that the James Fort was built close to the river it was. The Archaeologists were digging to try to find the James Fort   they were digging  up the ground. In 1861 they found their first objects they were uncovered armor, and weapons. They also discoverd the floors to the fort.

Archeologists are very helpful to history. they do alto of research it could take all day for them to do the research.research helps do things that your brain can't like thinking about the past.     Archeologists dig up the past like bones dinosaur bones they find  out if it was a girl or boy and to see what kind they were.       Archeologists are very smart if they were not smart they would not be there finding bones of any   ancient animals it could be a that swims or something that eats meat. They could be  trying to find out what happened in some ones  past.

Well you can figure it out by reading this passage. An archeologist has to do a lot of things to find an artifact.         The first thing an archeologist has to do is dig or mine to find something. When the archeologist has found something he or she has to clean it with a whisk and dustpan. If the artifact has to hard dirt the archeologist has to clean it with a knife.          If the archeologist finds a lot of stuff they will have to use a wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow is used to move things from one place to another. Then there is the part to actually study the figuer. They then will identify the figure. This is what you have to do as a archeologist. 	NNP NNP PRP RB VBN IN WRB JJ NN TO VB NNS .

Like finding the Fort James the archaeologists asked people but they said was,' It must of wash away'. So they searched for it. But this is what they learned before that in 1607 when the settler went to England. they thought it be by a river cause it was easy to dock ships. So it moved far away since it wouldn't be spotted by enemy ships. Also they are sposed to find objects that are old  like weapons, food, books, and armor cause archeology found a little bit of stuff like that in 1861. And archeologist like finding new things and explore cause they really want the artifact and examine them.                   Archeologist also dig to find things like the people who dug up the dirt just to find George Washington's house by Ferry Farm. They dug it up because the farm house had burned.  Then the archeologists finely found it in 2003. Then they found burnt pottery from the fire and a clay pipe. So they knew Washington used a clay pipe. So that is what archeologists do to get an artifact.

Every one in the class was excited but our teacher said,'' That we have to choose a different job for people who are interested in the study of history. Then our teacher put a list up on the wall with history jobs, she said that after recces you could look at it. Soon of nuff recces was over I was the first one to go over there to the list. Their were a whole bunch of jobs then at the very bottom their was Archeologists I grabbed the pencil and I wrote my name next to it. Then my teacher said that you have to go home and do research  about what job you picked. Suddenly the bell rang school was over. I ran all the way home and ran to the computer then I looked up archeologists,I found a lot about archeologist so I got out by notebook and started writing. Then my mom called me down for dinner, so Iran down stairs to the table my mom said what was I doing on the computer, I said that I had to do a project. After I ate dinner I went back up stairs to start writing then I found a paragraph so I wrote it down : In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships. In Conclusion, I learned a lot about archeologists I also think my class will like it so will my teacher.

The activity is used to explore the hidden secrets of James Fort of Jamestown, Virginia. A rumor spread that a river washed away for the past 200 years. Still, a few clues have been found, which made people think that it is still standing.       Brief History of James Fort       The fort was designed in 1607 at the time when English people settled in the colonies to start their lives again. Many people thought that fort was built near a river to have simple docking. Archeologists later found artifacts that led them into a wrong course. The spot for the fort was clever because it kept more protection of enemy ships.                The Reasearch       The first few items were found in 1861. The revealed objects were a few swords and suits of armor. Archeologists also found floors of buildings. Many, many years later, clues led to where the fort was located.   The National Park Service were paying much attention to the fort. The people were imaging the area to be sure the area was correct.       The Founding of James Fort       It turned out to be right! The James Fort was actually found! The archeologists left tracings and markings so the location can be found many times again and again. Maps were developed, and evidence was shown that the fort was built by the river. The archeologists uncovered 11 cellars, many burial sights, and ten buildings constructed by the fort!       Conclusion        In conclusion, James Fort is a mysterious place that had covered secrets found by the archeologists. In my opinion, James fort is an interesting place to learn and study about.

They said we where going to Las Vegas for the summer. I got excited when they told me that be cause Iv'e never been there and Iv'e always wanted to go there. when we got there my parents rented a hotel in one of the most famous places in all of Las Veges. It was very huge and there were lots of games and kids. I made a friend named Kevin he had nvery nice parents and they let me stay for dinner well my parents went out. The next morning my parents, me and Kevin went a casino it was very fun there was alot of  games for kids and food. On the last day of summer me and my friend Kevin went to the pool in the back of our hotel. Then when our parents tolus we were leaving I was excited to go back home. I sure hope to go to LasVegas nest summer and visit my friend Kevin again.

The first artifact they found at the site was some armor and some weapends but this was in 1886, now they were trying to find were the foundation once was the fort.

Archeologists did not know were james fort was build at first place,but then witch  means after find artifact about james fort they got closer to finding were james build his fort.After that a long Period to time the found it.its because when of the actifact.they figuerd out how james was connected to the river that there was ledges meanted also.thats when they finally found james fort!!! the first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.the marks showed where the forts walls used to be.between all the stories they heard and read,and drawings they made.the  archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.               Most of the time we know about Goerge Washington comes from his toime as a soldier and president,and we all know that he was the first pesident of the U.S.A.they dont have very much  information about were his childhood  home haved helped helped historians more or much about when Washington as when he was a boy.no one knew esactly where the Washington home was in located since the acual building was long gone.however,archeologists believed that the stone base under the home was stiil thier.they also started digging in 2003.it toke over a year,but they finally found it.the first building they first saw they found were the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.they found the mian house farmhouse i mean a few years later.             The discovery of Washingtons home is inportant for many reasons.First,it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washinton was before he became famouse.thay also begin to know why he made the decisions he did.another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived.all of these things are key parts of the past as Americans.             Ferry Farm offers many opprtunities for kids to get involved.the George Washinton society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities.digging around in yhe dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans.the folks at ferry farm are bringing to life the countrys first president in ways we have never seen.

George Washington was a very good soldier and was the best president we ever had.His father had his family move to place to place that George wanted to go.Some archeologists found some of the kitchen and the farmhouse that's where he was smoking at.When they stared working to look to tire to find the house they stared in 2003.             That's when they found the kitchen and the farmhouse.

In the sources 'Finding Fort James' and 'Digging up George Washington's Past' the author explains how an archeologist's job is.       First a group of archeologists use computer to make a image of the dig site. The archeologist then go out and mark the site with flags. they then call up a different group of archeologist to start the dig.       They start the dig with Picks And Shovels. Then as they get deeper they use Skim Shovels and Trowels. They also use wheelbarrows to haul the dirt away. When they reach the artifacts they use Whisks and Dustpans to get the artifacts clean then they use knifes to get dirt out of small places.       Lastly the artifacts go to the last group of archeologist to be looked at. This group makes such it is an artifact. If it is not an artifact they throw it away. If it is it is sent to a museum.       To conclude being an archeologist is a hard job but can make you rich or famous.

In order to get through solid rock, they use a pick, which has a sharp edge to break up the ground.  In softer places, archeoligists can just use regular shovels.  When they do find artifacts, they have to dust off all the dirt.  Archeoligists have a special tool for this, it is called a whisk.

Their job is to uncover the mysteries of the past. For example, the mummies. King Tut In Camen did not find himself. Do you ever ask yourself what was the Civil War like? Well they uncover those thing because they want to know the awnser.       They help so many peaople find about the past. Like the Mian Calender. Archeologists are also known as historyians. They also write a lot of books about history. They have these things called teams and the teams are the digging team, the reasearcher team and the scientists. Well history is an amazing thing!

For instance you will learn about the tools used by archeologists and what they do.  Also learn how they dig things up and why.       This paragraph tells you why archeologists do.  Archeologists dig things from the ground to learn about the past.  For example they foud gearge washingtons house.  Then dug it up.  With this evidence they comfirmed that gearge washington burned his house down and where his house is.       This paragraph tells you abou the tools that archeologists use.  The use picks and shovels to dig in to the earth to find the artifacts.  Then use a  whisk and dustpan to brush the dirt off.  Also use wheel barrows to wheel dirt some place else.  They also use knifes to scrape dirt of artifacts.  some times they use a skim shovel to remove thin layers of soil.  The most common teool is a trowel.  it can be used to scrape dirt shovel dirt and cut to view whats inside the dirt.       They dig up theses thing so people who want to know about them acan know about them.  Plus it tells people  about the past.  With this knowledge we can learn more things to benifet us.

These include of; pick and shovel, whisk and Dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim and shovel, and trowel.             Additionally, they could spent hours just trying to dig up something small.             Also, archiologists are very important people because of the artifacts that they find, can teach us new things that we haven't discovered about new technology and much more!             There is also another very importat part to being an archiologist. Well... when they find the artifact it could be millions of years old, or even billions! Because most of the items they dig up are so old they have to be very careful of how they treat them because they are so fragile!            In closing, now you can see how hard an archiologist's job is. Would you like to be one some day?

Archeologists are experts on finding, cleaning, and analyzing ancient artifacts, and other things left behind by ancient people and learn what their lives used to be like. These experts use many tools to help them find these amazing treasures.       To begin, the first stage of extracting an operation is using computer software to map the contents of the ground. These models are helpful towards the teams that will later come and dig up the site. This is important, so people can know where all the artifacts are, and what structures the project might interfere with.       To continue, after the teams who map the area are finished with their part of the job, the team that will do the actual digging come. This team begins by first using small, sharp, and thin shovels called skims to carefully remove the many layers of the dirt. After completing that, the diggers start a process called troweling. This process is carried out with shovels wooden picks to remove more layers of the soil. The entire process of digging can take up to two entire weeks, just for a small 25 square foot section of the soil. This stage is hard, and tedious, but it is one of the most important stages of the large job.       The final stage of the tiresome (but fun) process that archeologists carry out is analyzing the artifacts that were found by the digging team. Technicians spent lots of time to use their expensive equipment to complete the hard work the two other teams did, and actuly learn from the many artifacts found. After many months of hard work, analyzing is complete. The long job has been ended, and all the teams, and all of the other scientists become thankful for the important information the hark work of the many archeologists has found.       To conclude, becoming an archeologist is a painful, but fun, process which helps everyone discover important things in the covered past. Archeologists are important people because of what they discover. Maybe one day, you would love to become a famous time-traveler!

To be an archeologist you must be patient because you are digging and you don't find something in five minuets and you aren't patient, that wont end well.

When they are working, they need to be delicate when handling object on their site. Even though it seems uninteresting, it still is fun. Few archeologists have struck it rich during their job. That is why so many people are archeologists.               An archeologist needs to be delicate. They also have delicate tools. First they use the pick and shovel. That is used to dig into the earth. Once you get close to the artifact, you would use a Skim Shovel. It has a flat edge that can easily dig out a thin layer of dirt. If there is any excess dirt, an archeologist can use a wheelbarrow to take the dirt away. When you have hit the object, you can use the Trowel. It can remove small parts of dirt. When you have dug out the object, use the Knife and the Whisk to brush and clean the artifact.               When they are on the site, the archeologist uses the Skim Shovel to dig. Then, they put the soil in a box with a screen that lets the dirt fall out. Then they study the object. Everything takes a lot of patience and work but once you find something, it is worth it.               Being an archeologist is fun because there is always the chance that you will get rich and helps historians learn more. It also teaches you a lot. Being an archeologist is truly a great job.

Over 100 years later a group wanted to find James Fort. National Park service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.     The group knew that this group would help them find that fort.That's when they finally found James Fort! They found it because they kept on trying. Its very exciting to find items from thousands of years ago. The settlers did the difficult years when they had no food.Finding items from the past is what ties us to the people who first started the American Colonies.                                        Finding the information    Most of what we know George Washington comes from his times as a soldier, and as president. Nobody knew where Washington's home was. His father moved George to Ferry Farm when he was just six years old.People believe that George's home is where the stone building is or was.    Archeologist dug up ferry farms to get some artifacts.   They used tools to help them find artifacts.   Digging in the dirt will give you dusty jeans but also a lot of valuable items or artifacts that you may find.   They use a wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another.   Knifes are used for digging also you have to be really careful though.   The trowel are the most common  tool in archeology. They are used to scrape and cut  to view layers of soil.

This job is hard work because they have to dig and dig and dig until they find something they came looking for.  When an Archeologist digs they don't just dig any where, they have to dig in a place where a building or village once was.         There are still many projects going on like in 2003 there were Archeologists that had started to dig up, what they believed was there, was George Washington home. They believed that the stone base of the house was still there.  it took over a year but they found it!       In 1994 there were a group of Archeologists started a project at James town.  This project was meant to find hidden secrets of James fort in Jamestown, Virginia.  for a long time About 200 years people thought that James's fort got washed away by the river.  It was 1607 when the fort was built and when settlers came to the new world for a new life.  So any ways the Archeologist found many things in this site.  They found uncovered weapons and armor from over 100 years ago.  After all the findings they found the one that mattered most. They found ................ JAMES FORT!!!!        Today this group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.  People from that time used to throw away their trash in a unused well or a big pit and the team of Archeologists found bones of animals they ate and other food.  As you can see there are many interesting things to being a Archeologists and a lot of hard work can bring you to times you might no even know about.

Archeologists use picks and shovels to help them dig into the earth to find artifacts.Another tool archeologist use are whisks and dust pans.Whisks and dust pans are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear dirt from from the excavation site.Knifes are used by archeologists to dig carefully and scrape dirt from around the artifacts.Wheelbarrows are also used by archeologists so they can move items from one place to another and, carry dirt away from the excavation site.Archeologists also use a skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of soil within each scoop.The last tool archeologists use are trowels,which is used to scrape and cut or to view the different layers of soil.       Something else archeologists do is find ancient objects also known as artifacts.Some of these artifacts may have been pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children. these few objects were found in Fort James. Some other things they might have found were old kitchens,slave quarters,storage houses,and farm houses.these things were found where Washington lived.The last thing I will tell you is the way archeologists have to be careful while doing there job.         Archeologists have to be very careful while doing there job because they could loose very important information or get hurt.Archeologists use dangerous tools to find more about that person.If they are not careful they could get stabbed or cut or even loose a body part.Archeologists also have to be careful because they could easily loose some very information because thy might be rushing and scoop out a artifact.Some tools pick up big piles of dirt that cold have a coin or valuable pot in it.       Archeologists use interesting tools,find ancient objects or artifacts and have to be very careful while doing their job.In conclusion archeologists are important but very busy people.if I did this project again I would pick archeologist in the past.If I did that I would be more specific and easy to do.Now you have learned about archeologists.

One team uses 3D computers that can show you what is underground. So archeologists would know where they could dig. The second team has to dig holes. It takes them two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section.         Archeologists start to dig the holes with skim shovels. Skim shovels are small, flat and sharp and they can remove thin layers of soil. The soil is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out.        The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. Another team spends days in the labs studying the objects that are found. The whole procces is slow and vtiresome, but it's worth it.

It will explore what Archeologists do, what they dig up, and how they dig them up. This report can explain why Archeology is good and why we need it. The research is extremely helpful, so we need to thank our archeologists for working hard.         Archeologists are people who dig up things from the past, or artifacts as they are scientifically called. Archeologists work on teams of up to 35 people. They can dig up artifacts and begin to know more about history.        There are several ways of digging up artifacts. But first you might want to have a specific idea of what you are looking for. Maybe you could do some research within the area? One way of digging up artifacts is using a pick and a shovel to get closer to the ground where artifacts might lay. Another way is using a trowel or a skim shovel to remove, scrape, or cut layers of soil. You can just keep doing that until you find artifacts. Once you have found them, you can use a whisk and a dust pan to brush away the dirt on the artifacts. There are many more ways of digging up artifacts, but these are the most common.         Archeology is a very helpful thing. We can learn many things about history from what Archeologists find. It helps to know more about history because we can understand how life was a long time ago and try to make the present world better than it was then.         It takes a long time to go through the entire process. First, you need to know where you are going to look or what you are going to look for. Then you need to begin digging, or finding artifacts. Next, (If you have found any artifacts) you need to try to figure out what it is and then clean it off good. Now you are an Archeologist! This process can be very tiresome and can get you pretty dirty, but it's all worth it.        Now you know what it is like studying Archeology and being an Archeologist. It can be difficult, but it is all worth it in the long run! Understand that Archeology can help us humans learn more about history!

They will be finding Fort James, digging up George Washington's past,finding the spot of Ferry Farm, and the tools used.                            In the year of 1994, a group of people were going to study the past that had started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project or J.R.A.P. This project has been designed to discover secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For more than 2 centuries, people thought that Fort Jamestown was washed away by a river. A couple of discoveries in that area made a hint that it may still be around. The first discoveries were found in the year of 1861. The archeologists that were studying the Jamestown Fort found uncovered armor and weapons. Some also found the floors of buildings. Over a century later, a group found the exact spot where the fort was built.           A lot of what we know about George Washington comes from the time when he was a soldier and our first president. Biographies barely have any information about George Washington's life as a child. That has changed. There has been recent discoveries about where Washington's childhood home is and how it has helped historians learn more about our first president's history as a child.           Lots of people have lived on the land where Ferry Farm once was for over 12,000 years! That is a long time. The location of Ferry Farm makes the land a perfect place to build a home for families. However, it is no surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. At that time George was just 6 years old! Because the actual building was long gone, no one knew exactly where the Washington's home was located.         The tools that were used by the Archeologists to find their discoveries such as George Washington's home were used carefully,so that the objects that were found wouldn't break, because they were very old. These tools are, pick and shovel. (Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts.) Whisk and dustpan.(Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away from the excavation site.) The knife. (Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.) The wheelbarrow. (Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.) The skim shovel. (A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.) Last but not least, the trowel. (Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.)           Throughout this research a lot has been learned. In this research archeologists have found Fort James. they have dug up George Washington's past. They have found the spot of Ferry Farm. They also have used very important tools for these discoveries. That is the end of this research on Archeologists Historical Discoveries.

Archeologists  discover  armor and weapons  and they also discover floors of a home   when they found  the fort they  make marks  to show that  they have been here before.  They made 3D  computers  so they can  track whats underground.  Digging in the  can give just more then dusty jeans  the folks at ferry farm are bringing to life the countries first president  in ways we have  never seen. Some times they draw  to  so people  know what thing saw they had drawer a fort to show people. today  the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. the objects include pottery tools coins and even metal toys for children.                  That's when  they finally found James Fort!  The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground . The marks showed where  the forts walls used to  be. In the 1600s people used to  throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While digging in the area  the archaeologists found the trash the settlers  threw away including  the bones of animals they ate.  Archaeologists   the name  for  who study objects from the past  uncovered many weapons. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels paint brushes and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to weeks to dig  a 25- square  foot section.                       At least four other houses have been built on  the ferry farm land so the diggers needed  to find  proof  that's  this was  George Washington farmhouse. Records show that the  Washington had a fire in their house. The diggers  found pieces of burnt pottery . They  also  found lay  pipe . We know Washington smoked clay pipes  so this discovery gives more proof it is  the right house.  No one knew  exactly  where the  Washington's home   was located  since  the actual building was long gone. How ever  archeologists believed that the stone  base under the house was still there.

Archeologist only search for the past why not the future?       All they do is look for the past why do they only search for the past?       I we like the president's and the past but it's lame we need to know the future a little.         And kid's are curious of the future and past mostly the future!!       The thing's we learn in school is different but we learn the past in school.       Archeologist need to learn the future like will there be flying cars?       You get to use some cool tool's but it's still lame it take's way to long for all that digging and what happens if it's not there then what they just call it off and the same amount of money that's a wast of time usurious that would get on someone's nerve like same amount of time    i make more just by sleeping.       The pick is a good tool the shovel is faster but takes to long just to make a foot sized hole   way to long.                                                                                                                              Some times what if you need more money to support your kid's the boss let's you but then doesn't pay like he say's.                  The skim shovel look's cool and could take a while all the tools take a while mostly the shovel's the pick is a good digging tool.

They had to find more land for crops and homes and other things they needed.       More and more people came from England to James town.finding fort James is still very hard to find. But they found artifacts a little farther away . They thought that they would of built fort James near the river so they dock there boats.

The project was discover the secrets of James fort in Jamestown,Virgina.For    over 200 years,people thought the fort had been washed away by a river.Some    discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.well they think it will    be still around in the 1994 some even say,it been washed away by a river.          He fort was built in 1607 when settler came from England in started a new    life. most believed that James fort was built near the river.it easier to dock ships    there, so it made sense that the settler would choose that spot. ???However,objects     found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably  gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.which they mean stay away.           Today, the group finds nearly 1 million object each year. The objects includes     pottery,tools coins,and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to      trow their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. while diggingg in the area,      the archeologist found the trash the settler threw away, including the bones of animals      they ate.The information leaned from these object helps us under stand how the people      of jamestown lived.

Archeologists are people who dig in the ground to find artifacts.There are many reasons for how a life of an archeologist can be complicated.           Firstly, being an archeologist takes a lot of skill. They have to dig without damaging anything. You also need to have the right tools to dig into the ground. For example, if you needed a trowel but used a knife, that wouldn't be right to use. Pursuing this further, an archeologist has to have knowledge. They have to be smart and know where to go and to dig. For example, if you wanted to find out about Abraham Lincoln and you were nowhere near where he lived, you won't find anything from him! Finally, an archeologist has to have patience. They must be careful and slow at their process. For example, if you dig, whisk, and wheelbarrow fast, you may not have the most clean artifact.   There are some reasons how an archeologist's life can be complicated.

Archeologists are people who dig up artifacts from our worlds past, and people in it. Also being an archeologist is not an easy job, they can spend months or even years to find just one artifact.        Archeologists are a very important part of our learning. Without archeologists people today woul'nt know what we do about our past and even our future. For example we woul'nt know as much as we do about George Washington without the archeologists who dug at Ferry Farm.       Archeologists help us do more than understand the past they help us understand the future. Scientists and archeologists can use both the information and the artifacts to create big evolutions for the future. Also archeologists don't just work on land they also work on the ocean to find legit treasures from legit pirate ships.

They can find anchent objects and slowly use a whisk and dustpan to brush off dust and a knife to  carefully scrape off dirt. They also use wheelbarrow to carry items from one place to another and to move dirt from the site where they dig. They use a skim shovle and a trowel to dig.

One is a pick and shovel, it is used to start the dig and get close to the artifacts.        The next tool is a whisk and dustpan, they are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear the dig.         A knife is used for careful digging.         A wheelbarrow is used to move items and dirt away from the dig.          The skim shovel is a flat edge used to carefully remove thin layers of dirt.          The last tool is a trowel,  it is probably the most common used tool.  It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.  The archeologists have started many camps for kids to come and explore what it is like to be an archeologist.

It also allows people to get a better understanding of how people lived a long time ago. The process takes a long time such as a year or so. When a archeologists finds something it is exciting.             Some archeologists even find towns. When this happen, they get really excited.

I will tell you about an archeologistsandwhat they do.       An archeologists is someone who studies history. They study things from a fort in Jamestown which was called Fort James, they also studed how George Washington was a boy and what was in his house.       The archeologists can do many things like study the sky and people. They can also find many things and do research on that thingand we can learn about whatever that thing was. If they were digging something up they would use some tools like pick and shovel,wheelbarrow,and a knife and a skim shovel.       So if you ever read something about a archeologists you can think about all the things they have done. So I hope you can learn more about what an archeologists does. 	NNP PRP RB VB IN NNS .

It could be hard or it couldn't be hard but if your not up for some hard work than this is not the job for you. You could wonder what is an archeologist any way. Well an archeologist is someone who studies archeology. We students have been studying how archeologist work. So far as we know archeologist have to do really hard work.                                          How Archeologist Work                           Archeologist have many different tasks to work on. For example one of them could be digging and searching dead things such as dinosaur bones or dead animals. Another task could be researching atoms. Some of their tasks could be easier and some could be really hard.archeologist work really hard on their tasks.                                                      What you have to use to be an Archeologist                                To be an archeologist you have to use many different utensils or specimens to work. It is hard to be an archeologist because you might not know what the names of the objects are. The specimens might be heavy they might be light.

There is a story about a group of people interested in studying the past, In 1994 a group of people who liked studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. It was designed so that they good figure out myths and secrets of  James Fort. From 200 years back people thought that a fort was washed away by a river. Some people thought it could still be there. A couple objects were found in 1896 they found uncovered armor and weapons they also discovered floors to some building.                                                                                                                                                              Over a 100 years, A group effort to find the exactly same spot where the fort was built. The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area. They knew that it would help them to do it. The people doing this study used computer mapping software to take a photo to look at to study the area. That's when they finally found James Fort!     The first thing they did after they found they put a set of marks on the ground. After they drew realistic drawing they realized it would reshaped as triangle. They did research maps and they found it would stretch to a river. The sides were designed to hold cannons. The group also found eleven cellars,dozens of sites,and ten buildings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Some tools that used was a pick and shovel this is the tool that they start with to dig. They used a whisk and dustpan to dust off the artifacts. A knife is used to scrape dirt from around the artifact. A wheelbarrow is used to carry stuff like dirt from one place to another. A skim shovel is a shovel that is used to shovel a flat edge used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last is a trowel they use this tool the most it scrapes off and cut off different layers of soil.

They can answer most of the history of the past. It is an exiting to discover people and things which were hundred years ago. It gives us a piece of our past and tells us how are we like this and who started the American colonies.            What we know about George Washington comes from his time as a solder and president. The archeologists know all this by digging up the past by tools. They use important tools like pick and shovel for start to dig or to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts, whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, knife used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts, wheelbarrow to take dirt away from site, skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to dig away thin layer, trowel used to view the different layers of soil.           There can be up to 35 people in a team. The first team maps the area using 3D computers to track underground. This helps people know how did it look like before before people starting digging. Another team focuses on actual digging. Those archeologists start digging with skim shovels. The soil is then then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.           I think the archeologists jobs are interesting. I think most people will chose that job, but i would choose another job because I have interests in that.

A lot of people think that archeologists are of no use. Sure, the job is tiring and slow. But it's worth it. Today I will explain why archeologists are important and what they do during the job. I will also explain how archeologists find information about ancient people and my opinion on archeologists.              Archeologists may seem useless because all they do every day is just dig and look for buried things in the ground all day long. It may seem like that but their job is actually very useful to the world. Looking at source #2, it says 'Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood.' People don't have much information about his childhood but thanks to archeologists, that's changing. Archeologists dig in places where George lived as a child to find out what kind of life he led when he was young. Aren't you curious to find out about this great American's childhood? Thanks to present archeologists we are finding more about George Washington's life everyday. It is not just George Washington however, it is also to find out more events from the past of a lot of famous people. From source #1, archeologists have found more information about Fort James. Archeologists are still studying ancient people and let's hope we can find more about more famous people. That is the use of an archeologist. To find out more about famous people. Now you know the use of an archeologist.             To find out information of an ancient person, archeologists use lots of tools. Archeologists work in teams that can hold up to 35 people. Lots of teams work together on a site. This is what archeologists do when trying to dig. The first team maps the area with 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what the area looked like before people started digging. Another team that is called a dig, does the digging in the area. They first use skim shovels that are so small, flat, and sharp, that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. The soil is then placed in a box that has a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The digs use another process called troweling. Troweling is a process that archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt out of artifacts. Surprisingly, it takes 2 weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section! The final team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. This whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it if it's to shape history. Now you know how hard it is to find historical artifacts. The whole thing is so slow that you need to have a lot of patience if you want to be an archeologist. This is how people dig up the past.              'How do archeologists find out about events in history when all they're doing is looking at objects?'. That might be a question frequently asked and here's the answer. Looking at sources #1 and 2, They found lots of things left behind in the ruins of James Fort and George Washington's childhood home. The pieces of burnt pottery they found at Ferry Farm showed that there was a fire there and the metal toys they found at Fort James proved that there were children there. Looking and studying these things actually tell you how people lived in those days. That is how people find out how ancient humans lived in those times.             I think that an archeologists job is fun, even though you need to have a lot of patience. Digging and studying ancient artifacts that have been touched by famous people would also make me feel special. I think that an archeologist's job is very fun and I would love to do it.             Now you know all about the job of an archeologist. I hope this essay has been of use to you. Thank you for reading this! 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP MD VB CC VB , JJ VBZ DT NN IN DT NN . .

They may search in a interesting place where they think a former president may have lived or maybe where they think a historic fort may have been. They may also have as many as thirty-five people on a team. Even with that many people it can take up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five square foot area.                        Archeologists use three-d computers to track what is underground to help them find more artifacts. They may also use a wheelbarrow to carry a large artifact, or maybe they found a bunch of small artifacts they could use the wheelbarrow for that also. Archeologists found Fort James after searching for a long time. they also found former president George Washington's house that he lived in when he was a child.                          Archeology is a interesting job where they locate, dig, and find out what objects and artifacts are. They may spend hours, days, or maybe even weeks trying to search an area until they find what they are looking for. Some archeologist may have even found some really amazing artifacts from old forts or other cool places they have searched. But, in some places they have searched they may not have found any artifacts. They may have also went to a place looking for something but found something different.

Once a group of people that were interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. But the project had been designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown Virginia. For over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.        But the fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from England to start a new life the kids thought that was really interesting. Most believed that the James fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. But however objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships the kids that are looking for some things that they don't know about it looks like they get allot of information that tells them allot about what happened back then.   And the first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists are the names for scientists who study objects from the past uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort had been built.               Now the National Park Service led a five-year study of the whole area to figure out how that land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.               That's when they finally found James Fort!!! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the Fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read about and drawings they made the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars dozens of burial sites and ten buildings all within the border of the fort ground.           And the group of kids are going to find one million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins,and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While digging in the area the archaeolists found the trash the settlers threw away including the bones of animals they ate. The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. WE also know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food 	EX VBZ DT NN VBN NNP NNP VBD DT DT NNS VBP IN NNS WDT PRP VBP RB NNP NNP DT NN IN NNS WDT VBD JJ IN NN DT JJ VBN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP CC DT NN VBD VBN VBN TO RB DT NNS IN DT NNP NNP IN NNP NNP NNP IN CD NNS NNS VBD IN DT NN VBD VBN VBN RB IN DT NNP NNP NNS IN DT NN VBD IN PRP MD RB VB NNP CC DT NN VBD VBN IN CD WRB DT NNS VBD IN NNP TO VB DT JJ NN DT NNS VBD IN VBD RB NNP NNP VBD IN DT NNP NN VBD VBN JJ DT NNP NNP VBD JJR TO VB NNS RB RB PRP VBD NN IN DT NNS MD VB IN NNP CC RB VBZ VBN JJ VBN DT NN VBD VBN JJ NNP NNP JJ NN RB VBD DT NNS JJR NN IN NN NNS DT NNS WDT VBP VBG IN DT NNS WDT PRP VBP RB VB IN PRP VBZ IN PRP VBP RB IN NN IN NNS PRP VBD IN WP VBN RB NNP CC DT JJ NNS VBD VBN IN CD NNS VBP DT NNS IN NNS WP NN VBZ IN DT JJ VBN NN CC NNP NNP RB VBD DT NNS IN NNP NNP CD NNS RBR DT NN NN TO VB DT JJ NN WRB DT NN VBD VBN NNP NNP DT NNP NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN TO VB RP WRB IN NN VBD NNP NNP VBD IN DT MD VB PRP VB WRB TO VB IN JJ IN DT NNP NNP NNS VBG DT NN VBD NN NN NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NNP NNP POS WRB PRP RB VBD NNP NNP . . .

What it gives us is it tells us why he made the decisions he did.And another thing it does help us learn the type of life of the    colonies american lived and there past.And it archaeologicals find what famous stuff they find and who was its or what was what they   found.

Such as bones, teeth and old toys that they use to play with. some archeologist go out and discover people from now.  Some archeologist researched on Jamestown and found lots of interesting that might be in Musial now. The archeologist used souses like the internet, maps and software. Some of the objects that they have found are pottery ,tools,coins and little kids toys. Some archeologists used pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel. trowel that some stuff that archeologist use.       When George Washington past archeologist found stuff like. His toys that he bought and when he was older they discovered that. George Washington smoked clay in his older days. George Washington built a farm in the site that other teams can go there to work there for him.   At his farm lots of kids would come to sign up for classes play video games and crafs. They also go online and    play puzzlez about the work that people do at the fary farm. The reason archeoligist did this was because. Gourge washington did many thing for us.

Well if you do you might want to know this it takes lots of time to figure out where to start digging and when to start digging.So if you aren't patient you problably won't like this job but if you are patient you would most likely love this job.       If you are interested in history you would also love this job because archaeoligists mostly find very important history artifacts like some archaeoligists in egypt are trying to find very important people like kings of egypt so if you are interested in history you would love this job.       Many people love being archaeoligists because of the large profits because the artifacts are wourth a lot.  	MD PRP VB TO VB DT NN .

If you would like to learn more about archeoligsts then keep on listening to my report on archeoligists.               Archeoligists work all day long, no one really know's what they do so I am going to tell you. Archeoligists find all kinds of things in the ground if it not important then they barry it in the ground until someone else finds it. Archeoligists are named people who study from the past, and other things they find are armor and weapons. Did you know that one group of archeoligists stayed digging in one spot and since it got so deep that now it a fort called James Fort.               Archeoligists use many tools and not all of them I knew about till I did this report. They include a pick and shovel used to dig into the earth close to artifacts, wisk an dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts, knife used to dig or scrape dirt off the artifacts, wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another, skim shovel used to remove soil with each scoop, and the trowel used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.               Archeoligists are very hard workers so if you can do all those things and are not scared of those tools then you could study to be an amazind archeoligist.

If ever want to be a archoligist you will have to study alot of things. You probably need to start when your young so you can go ahead and learn things.

Archeologists have a lot of patience becuse it can take weeks to dig up one object. to find a object u get string and place it like a grid and number the spots like A1, A2,A3 and keep going on until u fill all the spots.If u run into somthing do not just dig it up or it might break the object take a brush andbrush the dirt away until u see it then take the pickand then u pick at it then u can dig it up.                   Then use the wheel baro to carry the object back.I encourege u to do somthing like that on someone.

Another thang is that you may not fine something that you saw the day before and was geting ready to pick it up and it starts to rain or it is time to go home and go to bed.

Archeologists reveal the past! Without archeologists we would not know a lot about the past. Here are information more about archeologists.A job that can be hard and fun, something that you can learn from. Being an archeologists can make you smarter.                    Archeologists are people who study the past and Earth. They find clues called artifacts. They work hard to find artifacts and study it. Well. you might say 'finding stuffs is fun why is a archeologists job hard?' Well, it is hard because you have to study it. Like George Washington's fire, They found stuff he used to make a fire like a burnt wood and studied it. How do you get information from that! Isn't that crazy! Also they have tools that helps them, actually they use a lot of tools. Like picks, shovels, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, ad a trowel. Now you might say 'how do they find those stuff doesn't it take, forever!?!?' Archeologists uses a 3D computer to scan underground and tell other archeologists to dig in a certain spot.                    Now here are tricky things about archeologists. They have to be careful, patient, and not being in a hurry. If you can not stand being patient well, being an archeologists might be a job for you. Being careful is really important. you might brake an artifact then  its gone. Patient is important too. Information might not be revealed for hours even days! The artifacts may be really cool but you have to wait. non patient gets you in a hurry, Which is another problem. If you are in a hurry then you may break something. That is why being an archeologists is hard. They do not have fun all of the time.                   This writing is a job of how an archeologists is. It is fun and hard at the same time or different times. These information may help you if you want to be an archeologists. An archeologists is people we need in this world so we could know more about the past. Thank you for reading this piece of writing of an archeologists 	WRB MD PRP VB IN TO VB DT NNS .

If we did not have archeologist we would not know a whole lot of things like slavory or Fort James or veary important things that happend in history like the Reviutioary War. Each group of archeologist has up to 35 people on a team. The first team mapes the area using a 3D imige on a computer and then they can see what is under ground so that they know where to dig and some what of a imige if what they will try to find. Then the teams spred out and start to dig and hope the will find what they are looking for. After a long long time of digging and searching for this object and they find the object they are looking for they will send it to another group of people who will study the object this prosses could take years to finish but these people will continue to this over and over again.           Tools Used By Archeologists           One of the main tools used by a archeologist is a pickaxe and a shovel these tools are used to start digging into the ground. The pickaxe is used to brack through stone and the shovel is used to did through the dirt. A whist and dust pan is another inportant tool. This tool is used when you find a inportant artifact in the ground. The whist is used to brush off the dirt and the pan is used to move the dirt that is put into the pan. A knife is one other tool archeologist use when the find a artifact in the ground. If the whist and pan dont work the knife is used to scrape of the remaning dirt. The wheel barrle is another common tool in a work site. It is used to move the dirt or stone that is dug out on the ground while triying to find the important artifacts. A skim shovel is just like a regular shovel but thinner. The skim shovel is used to take off thinner layers of dirt. The trowel is the most common tool in the work siste most of the time. the trowel is used to cut through layers of dirt and view thoses many layers of dirt in the earth. The finall tool used used dose not have a name but you place dirt into a box with a half inch screen at the bottom of it and all of the dirt falls and leaves the artifacts that was in the dirt behinde and for the archeologist to study and learn about.

Archaeologial is to rediscover something that had happened. In 1994 people descovered some of the things that they had in the past from jamestown. They were trying to descover things from jamestown for two hundred years ago. The archeologists founfd obhects that were very valuble like different places and things. Archeologists also found part of george washintons house and childhood.                           Archeologists also find things like where places go and maps to places. They dig up lots of famous peoples history like there house, there land, and there tools and toys and there barns and there letters. Archeologists take a long time to find the peoples things and history. One took two hundered year to find the spot they were loooking for.                                                                          Sometimes the archeologists think they found something that they were looking for and it was just a piece of something that does not really matter. There  most famous thing that they found in my oppinoin was where jamestown fort was. It took a long time two find it but they did find it. It was along, super tireing find but they did find part of the jamestowns fort.                                 They think that they found George washionton house they had some proof like clay pipie and slave headquarters and the kitchen. They said that they built there house on ferry farm. Wich was a great spot too settle there house. Georges dad Augustine washionton was the one they say moved there family up to ferry farm when george was six years old.                            Archeologists are like the people who find a treasue map and have to go see whats at the end. They kindove  go on a wild goose chase. They think they find it and never get off track. They are kindove like the people off those shows that seach for something and never give up.

Archeologists uses materials such as Pick and Shovel, Wisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and a Trowel. Most of these things are used to dig up artifacts but a couple aren't. The Pick and Shovel, Knife, Skim Shovel, and Trowel are all used to dig up artifacts. The wheelbarrow and the wisk and dustpan are used for cleaning the artifacts up and carrying the stuff around.             Some artifacts are very valuble to find. Usualy the artifacts are at a famous persons house or a famous place. At the Ferry Farm archeologists were looking for evidence that this was Goerge Washingtons home. They were digging and they found a piece of burnt property. They knew that there was a fire at his house. Then they found a piece of a clay pipe and they knew that he smoked clay pipes. So being a archeologists you can learn more about the past.             Some special places had artifacts. A group of archeoligists went to Fort James. They wanted to find out the discoveries of it. When they got there they found special artifacts. They found weapons and armor. After that they found different floors in the fort. When they were at Fort James they found little marks on the ground. From now on at Fort James they find nearly a million artifacts each year.              Archeologist doesn't allways look at houses. They look at special places too like parks. They also look at places where special events took place. did you know they look at grave yards. they look every where to find them.               Archeologists are a lot like pirates. They almost do all the same things.They both look for treasure. They both get on and off of ships. They both make maps. They both have big groups. And they both have to wait a long time befor they find treasure.

The archeologists used many objects to find out if the James Fort really got washed away by a river. One of the objects that they used  was a pick. The pick would help to see if there's still some things under grown from the James Fort. A archeologists is a person that looks over object from the past. They study what it was like back then and what people did for a living. Some people used computer mapping software. Shortly after that they found the James Fort.       Did you know that George Washington was a soldier and a preasident. When Washington was six years old his family moved to the land call Ferry farm. Their were a lot of familys their. The archeologists weren'y really sure where the Washington familys home was at. We know that at least four other houses were built on the Ferrry Farm land. Archeologists think that they have the right house because they found a part of a clay pipe and we know that George Washinton smoked clay pipes. A few years later the archeologists found the main farmhouse.         	NNP VBD VB IN EX VBD DT NNP NNP NNP NNP .

I would like to be an archeologist because I would like to see things from hundreds of years ago. You must use a bunch of different materials like:      Pick and a shovel, you could use that to dig. Whisk and a dustpan, you could use that to get the dirt off objects you find. Knife, you could use that to cut roots that are in your way.   Wheelbarrow, to move items from one place to the other.   Skim shovel, you could you that to to move soil it's kinda like a regular shovel only it gets thin layers of dirt. Trowel it can view different layers of soil.                      Archeologist find alot of interesting things that are from a long long time ago.  When they dug in Ferry farm they found some interesting thing like, burnt pottery that used to be George Washigton's, and a clay pipe that used to be George Washington's to.  The reason that it was burnt is because George Washington's house burnt down. The archeologists had no clue it was his house until they found the clay pipe.                     Archeologists have to dig 25 square foot section to dig a 25 foot section takes about 2 weeks! The discovery of Washington home is important for many reasons because it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous and they are starting to understand why he made the decisions he did.  The archeologists started digging in 2003. It took over a year but they finally found it       The kitchen. The slave quarters. Storage houses.                  Now you know what an archeologist is all about pretty much.

I found out that over 200 years, people had thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. There are some discoveries in the area hinted that might still be around.        Also the fort was biult in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people believed tthat James Fort was built near the river. Also it was esier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearby sugested the fort further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more proection from enemy ships.

An archaeologist is a person who studies objects from the past. They use many different tools such as pickaxe, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.              Archaeologists dig up artifacts from the past to try and figure out how they lived, what they ate, and where their houses were. Once they had found the artifacts they would take the to the lab and study what they were, what they were used for and what they are made out of.              When I had listed the tools  above I will now tell you about them. The pickaxe they would use to dig through hard surfaces. The shovel would be used for digging through softer surfaces such as dirt and mud. Whisks would be used for dusting off the artifacts and a dustpan would be used for sweeping things into it. A wheelbarrow would be used for moving piles of dirt and other things to different places. A knife would be for scraping dirt away from the artifacts. A skim shovel would be for removing thin layers of the earth. And last but not least a trowel would be to scrape and cut to see different layers of earth. The archaeologists would  use different equipment to draw maps of the areas and guess about what might have been there many many years ago. 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP VBZ DT NN .

They use different tools to find objects from the past.  These objects are called artifacts.  Archeologists have found many artifacts.          Some artifacts archeologists find are sometimes places or buildings.  In 1944, a group of people intrested in the past stated the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project.  Their project was to find James Fort in Jamestown, which people thought washed away by a river.  James Fort was built in 1607 by colonists.  They built near a river so it was easier to dock ships.  But, with the artifacts found, it is hinted that Fort James was located further away.  Some of the first artifacts they found were armor and weapons.  They had also found floors of the buildings.  Over a century later, a group effort to find the correct location of Fort James began.  The National Park Service` led a five-year study of the area to find out how the land was used. This would help them find proof of the fort.  The people doing the study used a computer mapping software to make an image of the area.  That's when they found James Fort.  After finding James Fort they also found cellars burial sites and buildings within the border of the fort.          Another place archeologists dug for is George Wasington childhood home. Washington's home was built on Ferry Farm, but no one knows exactly where it was located.  However, archeologists believed there was a stone base under the house.  They started digging in  2003.  It took over a year, but they found Washington's childhood farmhouse.  They also found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.            Tools used by archeologists are pickaxes, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, skim shovels, and trowels.  The pickaxe and shovel are used in the beginning of the dig to dig near artifacts. Whisks and dustpans are used to brush away dirt from the artifacts and the excavation sites.  The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt off of the artifacts.  Wheelbarrows are used to carry dirt and items from one place to another.  Skim shovels have a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt with each scoop.  Trowel is the most commonly used tool in archeology. it is used to scrape and and cut to view layers of soil.          These are what past archeologists did, found, and used.

First is they use a 3d computer to track what is underground. Then map it for the diggers.            The diggers dig and find the artifacts from in the dirt.             They do the same as digging.             That is about a archeologists job.

They should figer out a way to use robots for help.                 It was amazing when they found James-town's fort.  Also when they found George Washington's house.

They have to use a pick, shovel,whisk, dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovle, and a trowel. Each tool is used in a different way.       Most archelolgists find dinosar bones. Some are big dinosar bones and some are small. Most archeologists give the dinosar bones to some museums so people can look at them.

Step 2 they have to get all their tools for the trip. Step 3 they find out how to get there as in there i mean where ever their going. Step 4 they go to the place where going. Step 5 they look for clue one . clue one was a bottle.When they find bones one they need to study the bones one to get to clue two. Step 6 they find clue 2. clue two was a foot print a big foot print when they find the foot print the match it with clue one to see if it makes since. Step 7 they have to find clue 3 that's the biggest part of the whole trip. clue 3 is the puzzling piece when you see that clue 3 is the cracking of the whole case that's when you'll know that clue 3 is a big piece of the mystery. clue three was brown hair. they knew they cracked the case but they need to find the proof who are they talking about. there talking about BIG FOOT. They followed the foot prints. They came up to a big cave. They were scared to go in so they set up traps for big foot. They made crazy sounds so big foot can come out of its cave. They heard a big ROAR. So they all hided behind the tree the big browned monster came out. Big foot looked around and saw nothing until one of the archeologists took a picture of big foot. Next thing you big foot gave the biggest roar. Big foot saw one of the archeologists and stared running to him. next thing you know big foot was caught in the net. One of the archeologists call people and told them to com look at the monster big foot. people was astonish of what they saw but they let big foot go because he is a wild animal he should not be kept  as a pet. All four of the archeologists was rewarded.   THE END.

You have to get down and dirty if you want to be an archeologist.                Archeologist have to find out about the history of an item that they dig up. They have to datirmin the age and what it is. Somethimes it takes year to even finish a dig. A dig is what they call the place where they dig everything up.                 An archeologist has a hard job it takes a very long time to dig the the stuff up and figure everything out about it. So an archeologist has to do a bunch of things it's fun but really hard.

First, I am going to till you about Georgo Washington and his house growing up as a kid.Today many archeologists are finding George Washington's house. In 2003 they started diging.Later after that they found it but, they only found the stone part because, it was burned down.Soon they found edevince that it was George Washington's house.                 Second, I am going to till you about finding Fort James.Many people thought the fort was washed away but, the archeologists found the fort. After a while, they found many things, such as , the trash the pioneers though out. While they were walking while they try to see where the fort ended, they saw it was at the end of the river.They finally found edevince pioneers lived there.                   As you can see, there is a lot of stuff you should know about history. 	NNP PRP DT NN IN DT JJ .

In 1994 a group of people interestedin studying the past started the James Town Rediscovery Archaeological in gical Project.  The projectwas desighed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in JamesTown.  The first objects found was in 1861.           Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot wherethe fort   was built began.                    People have lived on the land knownas Ferry farm for over12,00 years.   Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home.  Therefore, its not surprising   that George Washinton, moved his family there.  Georgewas just six   years old at that time.

There is a group of people in Jamestown that are studying. The national park service let a five year study group  to figure out how the land was used. The first object was found in 1861. Objects  that were found were by an old ship. The objects were getting further away as the time went by.       While the people were studying that when they finally found James Fort! They found it by following marks on the ground. They knew that the fort was shaped like a triangle. While they were looking for they fort they found out that the fort was across the river there are ledges across the river so they can get across.       The group finally found over a million objects a year. The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even toys for the children. While they were digging they found the trash that the settles threw away in a big pit and holes. They liked to find all the stuff they remembered in the past. It give them a piece of the past and their discoveries.

A group of archeologists started Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project and started looking for fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. The first objects were found in 1861, they uncovered armor and weapons.The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how it was used. That's when they finally found James Fort! First they found a set of marks of where the walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read, drawings they made, the archeologist knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.                                       Some other archeologists started to look for George Washington's home. They knew it used to be in Ferry Farm, but the actual building was long gone. However, archeologists believed that the stone base was still there. They started digging in 2003. It took longer than a year but they actually found it.

It was probably very hard for the archaeologist to find information.          Reading about how archeologist found fort James was very interesting.It was very surprising to find that some people in 1994, actually wanted to study the past. I learned that it was over 200 years when people thought that fort James had been washed away.some discoveries that had been hinted that might be still around.           I learned that fort James was built in 1607.They built it when settlers came from England to start a knew life.Some people say that they built it near a river so it was easier to dock their ships there, witch made more sense of why they did.However objects found it that it was actually farther away from a river.That spot might gave them more protection from their enemies .                     The first object found from James fort was in 1861.Archeologist found armor and weapons.They also discovered the floors of buildings.In over one hundred years , a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built.They found several objects they still are surching.                   It was hard for archeologist to try to find things about fort James.There was many mysteries that haven't been discovered.they are still more information.Archeologist worked hard on finding it. I hope we discover more about fort James in the futer.

First of all, you have to find a great spot that has a lot of great history. Bring a group of people to go with you. Then start digging! You need a lot of tools that you need for digging. It might take a while, so you have to be patient. It took 1 year to find George Washington's house &amp; plantation!                       The tools you need are a pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and the most common tool is a trowel. Lots of archeologist say their job is  lots of fun. so anyone can be an archeologist!        Once you are done digging and dusting you can probably have it. Archeologist have exiting jobs just finding artifacts and digging. you can get stuff and tools that are worth a lot from the past. they can have gold and jewelery that is nice. Then the fun part is wearing the heavy armor and clothes they worn. 	NNP NNP NN IN NNS IN DT NNP NNP IN DT , PRP VBP TO VB DT JJ NN WDT VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNP NNP DT NN IN NNS TO VB IN NNP NNP NN VBG .

You get alot of money.                   You get to find objects and fossils. It's a very good job for people who like science. If you find something you might be famus and be rich. It takes alot of time and study. you need good grades and a college education.One type of an archelogiest is one that studies and finds fossils.aif you are lucky a museam will buy your fossil and you will get alot of money.

You would be able to find new things. You could learn about new artifacts from the past. Also you would be able to use different tools.That is why I would want to be an archeologist . In this essay there will be three reasons why it would be an exciting job.                 The first reason that it would be exciting is because you would be able to find new artifacts. Some examples of artifacts that you would be able to find is pottery, tools, coins, and metal. In only one year archeologists find up to one million artifacts! That is the first reason why being an archeologist would be fun.                 The second reason that i would want to an archeologist is because you could learn about the new artifacts that you have found. For example the artifacts you find you could read books about it. You could also search online about that artifact.That is the second reason being an archeologist would be fun.                  The last reason it would be exciting to be an archeologists is because all the different tools you have. Some examples are trowel, skim shovel, and pick. A trowel helps scrape the dirt off the interesting fossil they found. A skim shovel helps remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. Lastly a pick helps dig really deeply into the dirt. Those are all the different tools they would be able to use.                    I have clearly explained that being an archeologist would be an exiting job. The three reasons are being able to find new things. Learning more about an interesting artifact. Also using different kinds of tools for different jobs. That is why i would want to be an archeologist.

The archeologists is amazing so thats why I am writing about this for people you likes to be one when they grow up so lets get going about this kind of explorers                  Okay so usalluy a archelolgists starts thier plan to find what do they want to find maybe the missing titantic or frankfort.       If you want to find something you need is going to be a pick,shovel,a dustpan,and alot of water if it is going to be a long joereny.   Okay for me I would explore the titantic because dont you want to know what the mystery of the titantic   .Like what they used before and maybe you are a arethecit to build a big boat for the army.       See how important a areologists so they could discover how they need to put it more advance to be safe.                If you love to be a archeologists please just be patience to find mysteroiuus ways of things you might want to find but make sure you are ready for this big adventure ahead for you.       I think you still need more info so I will so more stuff.Digging up George Wasghition so they thougt where will it will be great for you.

Later a group of people called archeologists found clues that it was more inland. In 1861, the first objects were found. The first things found where a set of marks on the ground. They shoud where the walls were. In all the storys they read the fort was shaped like a triangle. Later they found a stone ledges made to hold canons. They also found 11 cellars,dozens of burial sites,and 10 buildens inside the fort.                        We all know Ggorge Washington him being a soldier and president. What we don't know is much about his childhood. That has all changed. His house was built at a place called Ferry Farms. He moved there when he was 6 years old.

Did you know, they found what is said to be George Washington's house! For years people only remember or thing of George Washington as a soldier or first president. Archeologists found much more, they found things from his childhood and what it was like. At first the archeologists didn't know where his house was located, but then they found it. After a year of digging, they found clues that it was his house.         The archeologist also found many remands of colonial times. They found information about Jamestown and how it was built and ran. T English moved there. From that they found clues from them and their children. Activity, games, meals and even bits and pieces of the usual scaled.

Well, if you want to... let's go.            Finding Fort James           Well, it all started with the James Town Rediscovery Archaeological Project. They uncoverd armor and weapons. Found in James Fort... Pottery, Tools, Coins &amp; Metal Toys (Found 1 million different things per year.). They also learned that a long time ago the had to survive with liitle food.            Digging up George Washington's Past            No one knew where George Washington's house is but they wanted to know... In 2003 they started to dig and they found what they where looking for. They found the kitchen, slave head quarters and the storage houses. Soon they found the main farm house. They needed proof that this really was George Washington's house. So they kept looking. Then they found their proof. They found burnt pottery. That tells that this was the house of the one and only George Washington's house because the house burned down. 35 people found this one and only discovery.            The Tools that the Archaeological Group uses            These are some of the tools that they used to discover these places. Picks and shovels, wisks and dustpans, knives, wheel barrows, skim shovels, and trowls.             These are just some of the amazing things people discovered.

Well I can tell you that an archeologist looks for things from many decades ago. For example a team of archeologists found where Jamestown actually was. Another team found out where George Washington lived. Would you like to learn more?               Archeologists need to do their work carefully and slowly. If they are not careful they might end up destroying a important artifact. If they work to fast they might miss something important. That would not be good.               Some of the tools that archeologists use are picks, shovels, whisks, dust pans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovel, and trowel. A pick and shovel are used for digging. The whisk and dust pan are used to brush dirt off artifacts. The knife is used to scrape dirt off the artifacts. The skim shovel is used to remove thin layers of dirt and the trowel is used to scrape and also cut to see different layers of dirt.               Archeologists find millions of things every year.

Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood . That's changing , however . Recent discovers at Washington as a boy People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years . Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home . Therefore . it's not surprising that George Washington's father , Augustine Washington , moved his family there . George was six years old at the time .                                          No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone . However , archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there . They started digging in 2003 . It took over a year , but they finally found it . The first buildings they found the main farmhouse a few years later . At least four other houses have been built on the Ferry Farm land , so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washington's Farmhouse .                                             Records show that the Washingtons had a fire in their house .The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery. 	JJS IN WP PRP VBP IN NNP NNP VBZ IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN CC NN .

Today ,the group finds    nearly 1 million objects each year.   But getting back to the point, an archeologists   job is very interesting and they have to   work very hard.An archeologists job   is usually finding the spot, digging up   the past,finding out what it means,   and getting involved. And I guess that sounds   a little fun but just think of it without   archeologists we wouldn't know as   much of the past as we do now.   Archeologists find so many thing from   fossils to Dinosaurs. They sometimes   look for fossils in the dessert but mostly   anywhere they think they will find what   they are looking for. If you don't like   getting dirty you do not want to be an archeologist.   Digging around in the dirt can give you more than   just dirty jeans. The archeologists at Ferry Farm   are bringing to life the country's first president   in ways we have never seen. Some tools   used by archeologists are a pick, shovel,   whisk, dust pan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel,   and a trowel,(probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the   different layers of soil.

When they are done identifying the object, they use it to figure out how life was in the past. After they are done, they also use the objects to solve mysteries we couldn't figure out.           Archeologists use many tools. The tools they use are a pick and a shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. Archeologists may use more tools to observe old artifacts but these are just the ones I found. They use these tools to move, pick up, dig, and brush artifacts to make them clean.           Archeologists have changed our world by getting ideas from old artifacts that people have built many years ago. The archeologists also let us learn about what people did in the past and how they did it. That is why we have history books. Maybe some tools from the past are what we make today.

So in 2003 they  thought there was something under the remains of his house. They started digging under his house in 2003.           It took about two or three years until they actually found something under the house. They found a kitchen,slave quarters and storage houses. They had teams for when they found something they had a team that would take the thing they found and scan it for about a day and find information about the thing.           The other teams were digging under the house and getting the stuff for the people to scan to find information about the thing. They found peices of broken pottery. And they also found a part of a clay pipe.  To scan those items they would use 3D computers to see what it is. It would take a long time because it would take to weeks to dig a 25 square foot section.

What an archaeologist does is they find a excavation site about someone or something that interests them and go to that site. Once they are there, they use special laptops with sonar equipment to track what's underground. Once they know where it is, they start to dig with either their shovel or pickax. Once their nice and close to the artifact(s), they use their skim shovel, knife, whisk, and trowel to carefully get to an object.             When they find an artifact, that's when their excitement builds up. They go and tell the rest of the team,'I found something!' when the rest of the team rushes over, they bring it back to their HQ to study it. When they identify what it is, they either keep it there and write reports about it, or submit it to a museum. That's what an archaeologist does. I think it's interesting. Don't you?

An archeologist often maps out their dig site with computer before digging. The place they are digging is called a Dig Site.            They use many different tools to uncover the artifacts without breaking them. Including Whisks, which brush dirt away, Skim Shovels, which remove thin layers of soil, Knives, which carefully dig and scrape around artifacts, Trowels, which scrape and cut yet they also reveal different layers of earth, Picks And Shovels, which dig deep into the earth and are usually the first instruments used, and Wheelbarrows, which help move items around quicker and more efficiently.          Archeologists help us learn more about our culture and past. They go where some don't and dig up things others wouldn't. Without them, we wouldn't even know who important historical figures like King Tut or Cleopatra even were! I'm thankful that archeologists are here. And I love learning about their discoveries.

They also discovered floors and buildings .over 100 years later they found the exact spot were the fort was built began.The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used .they knew this would help them decide wre to look for proof of the fort.the people who were searching for proof used almost everything they needed.then they finally found JAMES FORT!, the first thing they found was foot prints.                        the marks showed were the forts wall used to be . out of all the stories people heard and read about and drawings they made the Archeoligists knew that the fort was going to be shaped in a triangle.The Archeoligists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.                        today the group of people are finding a million objectseach year.The objects include everything pioneers use such as pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.the settlers had little food.im so glad they fond all the objects.

Like in Digging up GeorgeWashington's Past,they thought that there might have been a fire because they found things from the past. The things that they found looked like they were burned. Stuff that they find, help them learn about what happened in the past.           Archeologists know about the past when they find evidence that helps them knowwhat happened back then. Archeologists found weapons when they were looking for James Fort. The National Park Service finally found James Fort! The archeologists heard stories and drew pictures,so they knew that the fort would be trangle shaped.           Nobody actually knew where George Washington's house was,but archeologists belived that the stone base under the house was still there! They also belive that George Washington's house caught on fire because they found burnt peices of pottery anda clay pipe. They all knew that George Washington smoked clay pipes,so that gave them even more proof! The archeologists used speceial tools to help them find things from the past. Like a pick an shovel,whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and trowel.

You can get sick from pollution to. Some places they tend to go to is very rich states and countries. Like Navada or Egland. Most of the times you are most likely not to find gold most of the times. The first place people ever found gold was in California. Each year many people and teams will work on one sight just for a while. They also use maps and special computers like 3D computers to help them find the gold. Some teams use special tools as well like a pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,wheelbarrow,knife,trowel, and a skim shovel. Sometimes it can take digging teams to take over a month finding gold in caves or underground. You don't know how dangerous digging underground and in caves can be. But if your interested and if that's what you want to do. Good, go and have fun with your job but be careful.

There tools and jobs of the tools are, pick and shovel. Its job is to dig deep into the earth to find artifacts. A whisk and Dustpan, this is used to brush dirt off of the artifacts. Knife, is used to carefully scrape away the dirt from the artifacts. Wheelbarrow, used to haul dirt away from the dig. Skim Shovel, used to take a thin layer of dirt of of the artifact. Trowel, used to scrape dirt away to look at the earth in a different way, one of the most common tool.             Archeologists use to have to dig all the facts out by hand, what a pain!

People thought that it was washed away by by a river, the fort was built in 1607 when settlers came here to start a new life.            Most people believed that it was built near a river it was easier to dock ships there so they chose that spot ,however objects found nearby and decided to move further away the new spot gave them more protection from enemy ships. The first object was found in 1861 archeologist also uncovered armor and weapons.          Over 100 hundred years later a group of people found the exact same spot where it was built, the national park service led a five year service of the area to figure how it was used, they knew that this will help them look for James fort thats when the finally find James fort.

Some of the archeologist tool's are  pick,shovel,,whisk,dustpan and some kind of work knife.other tool's they use are wheelbarrow skim shovel and trowel.so I think that an archeologist is a  very important job.The reason why I think their job is important is because if we didn't have them rain and other junk would get into your gutter's and I don't think you want that to happen.

An archeologist has to lots of patience because they must wait a long time before they start finding things. Also archeologists must work really hard looking for artifacts.       They must use different types of tools on their dig sites. The first two are a pick and shovel. These are used to dig close to where they know artifacts are laying. The next two are a whisk and dustpan these are used to brush dirt away from the artifacts. The next two are the knife and wheelbarrow. The knife is used for careful digging and also to scrape dirt from around artifact sand the wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt away from the dig.The last two are the skim shovel which is a shovel with a flat edge that is used to remove a thin layer of dirt with each scoop and a trowel which you would use to scrape and cut to view different layers of dirt.         Archeologists must be good at using and understanding computers because they have to use computers to make graphs on the area they are excavating. They must also have to be able to focus on one thing for a long period of time. If they are looking for artifacts on certain people they would have to know what happened through the course of their life so they know what to look for. If they were looking for bones or a dinosaur then they would have to know what the skeletal structure of different dinosaurs.       There are different jobs on a dig site there is a team that digs and there is another team that's in charge of mapping out the dig sites and dealing with computers.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.The first objects were found in 1861.The National park service led a five-year study of area to figure out how the land was used.

Well, Archeologist are people who study things from the past. If they found something they would try and find what it was used for and what exactly it is.Archeologist's use special equipment like Pickaxes,  Shovels, Small brooms, Dustpans, Small knife to be careful digging, Wheelbarrows,  Skim shovel, and a Trowel all for finding artifacts and stuff we can discover. But, they have to be careful so they don't hurt the artifacts. And they use graphic tools to help them find the artifacts. Some of the artifacts they find are over a million years old so they half to be careful when they are diging it up or dusting it off.The End. 	DT NN IN DT NNP NNP PRP VB WP NN IN NN DT NNP VBZ .

I want to become an Archeologist because I love history. The tools they use are really weird.         Digging takes a long time and is hard work. It only takes about two weeks.         The tools they use are pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel. The tools go in a certain order because that is how they dig.         Discovering history is awesome because you learn about the past. Older things are cooler than new things.          You should try to be an Archeologist. There are two teams one is in a lab the other is digging.         Someday maybe you will find a cool find. You might find Abe Lincoln's house.

Their job is to study objects from the past. I'll tell you the tools they need for an archeologist. I'll also tell you about the job of an archeologist.                    It's hard to be an archeologist. You need to be very careful and calm. It may take a long time to study about one artifact so you'll also need to be very patience. It will take teamwork to get the thing you will going to study about. These are the tools you will be needed to be an archeologist:   pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel. I'll tell you what these tools are needed specifically for each of them.       Picks and Shovels are useful for start most digs. Whisks and Dustpans are useful for the artifacts to clear or brush off any dirt on it. Knifes are useful for carefully digging and for scraping off dirt around the artifacts. Wheelbarrows are used to move something from one place to another or to put away dirt from the excavation site. Skim shovels are used to scoop up a thin layer of soil. Trowels are used to scrape and cut the different layers of soil to view.                     	NNP PRP VB WP DT NNS VBZ .

Echeologist also look into m&circ;croscope to look at small thing for erxample an organism its too small to see so eecheoligest look into a microscope. Echeoligest look into a telescope because they want to discover about the stars and the planets. When the echeoligest's look into a telescope they can see the planets like Mars,Earth. Venus, Saturn and other planets they could also see the galicies and stars. stars you dont realy need a telescope because you could see in the sky but those two other ones you have to use a telescope which is planets and galexcies.           Echolegist also puts fossil on the floor . if you ask how does a scientist put the dead animal bone is that they take the animal and burn it and put it under ground kind of like din suars they burn it and put the dinosuars bones underground.          Echeoligest also takes picture of animals like elephants, mamoth,and dinosuar. Echeologist also finds information about people from the past like George Washington.         Also their inventions like how they built it and when did they  built.

They can find these artifacts to learn more about these important events, or people. Them finding these objects can also help us understand more about the lives of historical people. And, if they think something in history was incorrect, archeologists could assure that its correct, by finding the locations and artifacts from the event they think is incorrect, and find the truth.           In 1861, there were the first objects found in Jamestown by archeologists. Around 100 years later, a different group began to search for the exact location of the James Fort. They believed it was located near a river, so it would be easier to dock ships there. However, in 1994, archeologists began searching again in Jamestown for the James Fort, which people believed for many years that it was washed away by the river they thought it was near. By judging the objects that they found close to the river, the archeologists thought that it was located somewhere farther away from the river, so they were safer from any enemies. They finally found Jamestown by looking at a group of marks on the ground, and decided that it was triangular, and was located near the edge of the river. Now the archeologists find many artifacts near where the fort really is.           Many archeologists wanted to learn more about the home of George Washington, because they didn't know much about his childhood. They knew that the Washington's lived on the Ferry Farm, and moved there when he was six years old. Although they didn't know the exact location of the house, they began to dig in 2003 at the Ferry Farm. It took more than a year when they finally found the Washington's home. They found the kitchen, storage houses and slave quarters first, then years later, found the main farmhouse. Archeologists said there were other houses built on the Ferry Farm, so they needed the proof that it was really George Washington's childhood farmhouse. They said that there was a fire at his house, because they dug up some burnt pottery, along with part of a pipe. Which was more proof that it was the Washington home, because George smoked.           People wonder how the archeologists found all those objects from the Ferry Farm. Well, what they do is form a few groups of up to 35 people to dig. They use 3D computers and machines to track underground, and find artifacts, this is so the diggers know where to look and what it will look like. Some archeologists focuses on the real digging, with a type of shovel called a skim shovel. They are small and very flat, therefore they can dig the layers one at a time. Others will place the soil into a box with a small screen at the bottom, which lets the dirt fall out, and the artifacts, if any, stay in. They also use many other tools, for troweling, such as small shovels, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove any dirt covering the objects. There are other archeologists that take the artifacts to a lab to study them. It can take a while to dig up a section. Up to two weeks for just 25-square-foot area!

The job of an archaeologist is to inform the world by finding artifacts for hundreds of years ago. Some of the things archaeologists do are really fun. Some of the tools they use are the pickaxe, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. sometimes archaeologists have to go to different countries to find artifacts! Do you still think that the job of an archaeologist is boring?       I don't think it is, because it sounds fun to be able to go around the world just for work! Want to know more? Here is what each of the tools do. The pick and shovel are obviously used for digging down to the artifacts. the whisk and dustpan are use to brush and clear dirt. the knife is used for carefully digging and scraping dirt from the excavation site. the wheelbarrow is used for moving items from one site to another. the skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. And last but not least the trowel, which is used for scraping and cutting to view the different layers of soil.         	DT NN IN DT NN VBZ IN NNS IN NN .

A few ways you have to be careful are, one, you have to be careful with old artifacts and new artifacts. Two, you have to be slow and steady, meaning you have to be patienet with your work and steady meaning you have to have experince with your tipe of work.       A few ways you have to be thoughful with your work are you have to be very smart at your job. Meaning that you have to know what you are doing. You have to know what the right tool is to use, you have to know where to dig at. Also, you have to be focused on your job.

Archeologists most likely work in groups, rather than working by themselves. They work like this because the artifacts are very delicate historical items, and all of these items are crucial to discovering the history of mankind. Archeologists hold a lot of responsibility to keep the artifacts safe, clean, and whole.       While working, an archeologist needs many tools. Here are some of the tools that an archeologist might use in their work: a pick and shovel (to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts), a whisk and dustpan (to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear the dirt away from the excavation site), a knife (to dig carefully and scrape dirt off the artifacts), and a wheelbarrow (to carry away dirt from the excavation site or to move something from one place to another). These tools often help archeologists in their work.       How do these archeologists find all these artifacts? The first thing they do is have one team of archeologists use 3D computers to map the area. Then the information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before they start digging. A different team of archeologists does the actual digging, and they place where the team digs is called a dig. These archeologists start digging with skim shovels, a small, sharp, and flat shovel that can remove small layers of soil at a time. The soil that is dug up is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. The screen lets the dirt fall out of the box, while the artifacts stay in. The digging team also does a process called troweling. What is troweling? Trowling is when the archeologists use wooden picks, paint brushes, and small shovels to get rid of dirt. All of these processes are cautious ones, and only professional archeologists should perform them.       As you can tell, an archeologist's job is tough, requires maximum intelligence, and is lined with caution. Beacause if almost anybody else finds artifacts in their backyard and trys to handle them like an archeoloist would, say good-bye to the artifact (well, say good-bye to the artifact being whole, at least). And that, kids, is why you should never dig for artifacts in your backyard!

Archeologists believed that underneath a stone base, George Washington's house still lived.   They began digging the stone base out in 2003. After a year passed, they finally found it. They first found the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage houses. They then found the main farmhouse.

The southern states rivaled the northern states but some southern states agreed with the north and stayed there.

They find where something is buried then get a pick or shovel to dig close to where the object is then they use a trowel to dig around it.When the archeologists get to the artifact they use a knife to carefully dig around it. Once they have gotten it out  they can take it to alab and find out what it is and where it came from.

Way back in the 1994, some curious Arcioligists (A person who finds out about the past) wanted to find out if James Fort is still standing. However, many pople claim the fort washed away and broken down in the river. But the Archioligists still have a chance to find the fort, because there are still clues to that the fort may be still around.                               The first thing the Archioligists did was to do some researsh on the fort. They then found out the fort was built in 1607, so it must have been old and fragile. In addition, the fort was built near a river so it would be easier to dock incoming ships for their supplies. But, the objects which were in the ship ike weapons and armor, were found farther away then the Archioligists expected, so the fort must have been farther away.

First, archeologist find many of the important historical facts that are taught in classrooms today. Second, their jobs are not easy. They have to go all over the world just to dig up artifacts in the hot sun. I hope they get paid alot!Last, archeologists study alot for the artifacts there looking for, and the places there going to.              In source # 1 a group of archeologist went looking for a whole building! That group had to look all over that area for the smallest of  pieces of that building. When they finally found objects they were to far from the river, so their early predictions that they docked boats by the mission could have been wrong. Then another group found marks from the walls leading all the way to the river. The James Fort was huge! It was hard work but they achieved their goal.              The information in source # 2 is interesting. When no one new where the Washington home was located, a couple of archeologist were on the scene. They started in 2003 and found what they were looking for in over a year. They struck the slave quarters, the kitchen, and storage houses. A couple of years after that they found the farmhouse. They needed proof it was Washington's house so they looked for evidence. They found out his house burned down, so they found some burnt pottery. They also knew he liked smoking pipes, so they found some clay pipes. Their hard work and research really paid off.             Many archeologist like in these sources use tools like these: picks,shovels,whisks dustpan, knives, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowels. After reading this report I hope that you will remember how important and, how hard archeologists work.

Archeology could be very amazing .Maybe you discove something aboute dinesoures and it makes you rich this can ll be great.If i was a archeologist i would want to go out ad dig out the things that we are looking for.This prosses may take a while but its all worth it after you sucsesfully completed a misson to figerr things out from the past .      These are all thebenifets of being a archeologyst getting money,finding out things, and get more and more adventures to find things out. if you are a archeologist you may already knw how it feals like to hunt and finally figer out things.

Being an archeologist is very hard work.All digs have o dig alot.Some people have to map the area using a 3D computer.Almost all archeologists have to trowl.        Archeologists job's take a long time to do.It might take a whole year to find something.It is very hard to find artifacts.In the end It's all worth it.         Archeologists use many different types of tools.A pick and a shovel are two of the tools used mostly.Archeologists also use knifes.Archeologists use tools we don't use in our average lives.         These people can great riches.They can find wishes like gold.Riches can also be fossils.Fossils are worth lots of money.Another type of great type of great prize is lost artifacts.They can also find unknown species.          Archeologist jobs are very hard.Their work is difficult.Their work is not easy at all.These people have a great chance of earning money.

The settlers went to the river to go and discover it.But the settlers found out that it was located farther away.                     The archeologists found the first found objects. The settlers found the objects in 1861 so now they are called archeologists.The archeologists studied objects from the past,like armor and weapons.They discovered floors and buildings.                      The arcarcheologists found found the fort. the first thing they saw was a set of marks on the ground the marks showed where the forts walls were at before.they made maps and found out that the fort was a path to the river. they found buildings within the border of the fort.                       My con conclusion  is that it would be fun to find a fort. It would be cool to find objects and it would be neat to discover something or someone.

When he was about 6 years old when his family found about a place called Fairy Farm.There were about 4 houses but about 12,000 people living there. So of course they bought a house on the pa-ire. A couple years later, their house burnt down and all their treasures went into the ground.       When archeologist went and found the stuff under ground their were 35 people on the Territory and they were all sectioned off into 3 groups. The 1st group was mapping out the area and they had type recorders under ground.       The 2nd group spent all day digging. They used a skim shovel. A skim shovel is very small and flat, but the tip is sharp.This helps all the dirt fall out.        The 3rd group spends all dad in a lab making sour every thing is going ok. They also make sour every thing is running properly under ground.There is a 25 foot area that all groups are all working on.All this work can add up to a total of 2 weeks process.        In that 2 weeks , one of the things that they found was a smoked clay set. So that means that Mr.Washington smoked clay.        Archeologist are a very important to history. with out them we probably would not know a lot of stuff that we know today.

Many archialogist usen tools like pick shovels,whisk and dustpan,a knife,wheelbarrows,skim shovels, and trowels. Some archialogist have to dig and some are in the lab.The ones digging takes about two weeks to be done. Unlike the ones in the lab they have to research the item, that takes a couple of days. Archialogist find many intresting items that people used in the past.Each team could have about 35 people in one team.              George Washington has many intresting things in his life. Archioligist found that he lived in a farm. So they searched there. They digged there and found clay pipes. It took along time to search something and they found the kitchen, slave quartes, and the storage house. George's house was burnt along time ago. The team found many stuff. It took a year to dig and find items.                                                                      The team used 3D computers so that they can check under ground. Another team came and used tools. They focused on skim shovels. Unfortanaly they didnt find anything. But they still were searching. Then the team found clay pots. They send it to the lab reaserchers. They studied it for a couple days. The team found out that that was George Washington's mother.               Archialogists send there items to a musuam. The kids get to look at it and ask questions. The musuem has the items in a glass container. Many people come and explorer the musuem each year. Some of the people pay money to hold it. Kids go to the museum and look at it.              Archialogist work very hard. They spend most of theire life finding items. Many risk theire lives to get old items. All teams  work together. Many found treusere that we didnt know about. This is why I think that archialogists are brave.

Their job is way harder. They have to look at old thing and find out want it is and what it's for.They are important people. If we didn't have them we wouldn't know about the history.                       You would have to study a lot and hard to become an archeologist.Just by looking and studding things they found out that on Gorge Washington farm there was  a fire.Also found parts of a clay pipe and we all knew that Gorge smoked clay pipes. In Fort James they had found uncovered weapons and armor and also found floors of buildings. 100 years later, a group tried to find the rest of the building. Well they go trough a lot to find out what all about what they have.                      Archeologist are very smart. They know more stuff about others than we done. When your an archeologist you find more about their childhood and a little about what they did. Some people may want to do it for the money but that's not the real reason.I think its important because once they learn more about the pass they will tell everyone else.  No one really knew were Gorge Washington lived. However, archeologist that the stone base under the floor is still there.                    The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used in Fort James. That would help them to find proof of anything from the pass. They even found eleven cellars, dozen of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.That's when they found James Fort.                     Archeologist are important to me. If it wasn't for them i wouldn't know anything about history. They found out all about the history today . They work very hard to find proof of history for us to learn.I hope i can be just like them and learn more about the history in the future.

To dig or to find something that you are in luck of looking for you will need to have the right tools. Some of the things you willl need is a pick &amp; a shovel to dig something up.To put all of your artifacts in you will need a wheelbarrow or you can use the wheelbarrow by puting the dirt that you dug up in the wheelbarrow so you can be tidy with the dirt.You will also need a skim shovel to carfully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. You will also need a whisk and dustpan to scoop all of the dirt up in a nice pile.You will also need a good archeoligist group of men to carry hard and heavy things and women to get very deep in the dirt.Last you will need a knife for carfully digging and to scrape the dirt carfully of the artifacts.Those are a couple things you will need to by or have before you complete an archeoligist job.               What Kind Of Things You Will Be Instrested In Looking For?   If you are looking for something think of a great spot with dirt but a mystirious place and start just digging anything you find keep at first have fun and dig and dig and find lot's of stuff and keep and use.Second you want to get serious at your digging first you had your fun now you need to look for things that is just very strage, you would want to look up some things and places and a artifact that has not been found in 100 years go to the place and start digging with your group and when you find something take it straight back to your lab and look at it a disekt it and keep it as your First Artifact  that you have found so far because before all those things you saw and dug that was just having fun and getting the hang of it but when you found that first artifact that was just your first.                       What You Will Do When You Find A Facinating Artifact?   When you find a facinating artifact you just keep on going its the first thing its always the beginning of an areoligist process you dont just stop when you find you find a cool artifact you just wait like I said its just the beginning of an archeoligist process.When you find that arifact you never know if your going to find something bigger and better the next day.Those are things an archeoligist would do if he found a facinating artifact and he had no idea what to do with it at the time and thats the process of an acheoligist process.                                       What Can You Do If You End Up Finding Nothing In The Location Your In?    When you maybe end up finding nothing o=in your location you dont just give up the task you were looking forward into doing you just find a nother location to dig up something mysirious and weired or you can just look up some facts that explain to you what is an artifact that has not been found over than 100 years ago then it will pop up people who have tryed digging or finding this artifact you prombly will end up have a lucky chance of finding it by the process of searching those are things an archeoloigist would do if he is not finding anything in the location he is at.                           What Would You Do If You Want To Reserch Another Person?    When you feel like you are not finding the right artifacts that you are in need of finding all you need to do is reserch another task that no one has been looking for but has and thought was going to be easy but ening up be a whole diaster.And when you feel like when you serched it up think of something you've heard as a diasaster in life like the 'Titanic' you can get up some people and go to where that disaster had happend and end up finding some good artifacts.Those are a couple things an archeologist would do and say.                           How To Pick The Right Group Members To Work With During This Task?   When you are doing a task you would like to find the right group mwmbers to work with like some poeple who know how to work hard and get a task done.Or someone you know who can use a shovel good,Also someone you know who can use all the tools good like a Pick,Shovel,Skim Shovel, Trowel Or A Knife all those things but know what there doing sand know how to do it right and get down to business. or you would like to pick someone who is not sassy or bossy.And last you dont want to pick someone who is weak and not strong.Those are things and archeoligist would say.                       How To Know When Its Time To Stop The Task?   When you think the task you where working on has now been comepleted the first thing you would like to do is count how many artifacts you have the minimum is 20-40 thats all.The next thing you would want to do is skan them and see where this came from? and how it looks like? this and how it got here?.When you are done with that,thats how you know you are done with this task or when its time to stop.                           What Do You Do With The Artifacts You Found?   When you are done with the artifacts that you have found you need to take it to a museam or spit it with your group members.But what you dont do is just throw it away or keep it all to your self those are a couple things an archeoligist would do when he is done with his task.

Archeologists try to find artifacts or pieces of things people used back in the day. First, archeologists are suppose to find artifacts about a person or a place long ago. For example, if an archeologist found an arrow head, that is an artifact.       When they find the artifact there looking for, there next job is to clean off the artifact with a whisk and dustpan and examine it. While there doing that, they might run into trouble! They might not have the right tool for the artifact or, the archeologist cant tell what the artifact is. After they figure out what the artifact is, if they have back round knowledge (skeema) of the artifact they either already know what it is or if they don't know what it is, they do research.       When they figure out what it is and what it does, the archeologist shows who there working for what it is and what it does! Lastly, if its a huge thing of the American history, the artifact goes to a museum where people all over the nation can see it.        There are many tools archeologist need to finish the job. One of the tools is a pick and shovel. The pick and shovel is used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. The second tool is a knife. you think a knife is used for cutting apples or something. Not for archeologists! The archeologist uses the knife to dig and scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The last tool is a wheel barrow which carry's heavy things that a man can not lift.           Being an archeologist is a breath tacking job. If you become an archeologist you get to examine hundreds of year old things. If you are an archeologist, you get to explore almost all the world looking for artifacts. If you where an archeologist and you found something amazing, what would you do?An archeologist has to do many things before he/she can figure out what the artifact did. Would you want to be an archeologist? Why or why not?

First of all we could get information from the encyclopedia right, NO! Because if archeologist did not dig up the past then there would be no way of knowing about any famous dead people. In the next paragraph I will tell you how the archeologist found all this information. So that is part of why archeologist's work is very important.            So the archeologist found all of the information by using clues that they already have about that person. Here's an example, they found his house because they knew that everyone lived on a Ferry Farm so they found a house. The way they could tell that it was George Washington's house is because his house was burned down, when the archeologist went to George Washington's house they found a burnt item, so that is how they could tell that is one of the ways they could tell it was his house. So that is how archeologist found all of their information.             They have to go through another process. They have to clean and identify the object so that they can see if it is what they are looking for. They use wheel barrow to carry the objects, they also use a knife to scrape off dirt from the artifact, and they use a whisk and dustpan so that they can brush off the object. After they are done with that they simply use their computer to scan the artifact so they can tell what it is if they do not know. Finally they have to load it into the truck or car so they can take it back to their camp. That is the slow but useful process of cleaning and finding the artifact/artifacts.

Archeologist all over the world study famous people so they can find what happened and what they did.  Even famous people are alive today from the past and archeologists study them so they know about there history from there childhood.  Now I will tell you about some thing about being or looking for a archeologist so they can give you examples.        Some examples about being a archeologist are right here if you want to be a archeologist you have to be watching them on T.V or go to a museum all about the history of a archeologist.  Archeologist are interesting because they can find,tell, and look for a famous persons history.  Also they can find birth and death of the famous person and it would be hard to look for George Washington because he does not have a lot of information about his childhood.  Today archeologist still look for famous peoples history from the past to see what they did or what there childhood was like.        Archeologist is a hard job because they have to go look for information everyday so they can use there sources to find amazing artifacts.  Archeologist have so many tools they have six tools there's a pick and a shovel,trowel,  knife,wheelbarrow,whisk and dustpan, and a skin shovel.  They use all of those things to get evidence and clues so they can find the history.  That's a archeologists job and what to do and what to use because they have a amazing job although they put there best work into it.Those are my examples of being a archeologists job.

It made sense that the settelers would pick that spot. Objects found nearby suggested that the fort was further away. The new spot that they picked would give more protection. The first object that they found was in 1861.                                                                                                                                         Archeologist was another name for a scientist, but these people study objects from the past. Like uncovered armor and wepons. And they discover the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later they found the exact spot where the fort was built. People lead a 5 year study to figure out how the land was used.                                                                                                 It would help decide where to look for proof of the fort. Thats when they finally found James Fort. The first things that they found was a set of marks on the ground. Those marks repersented where the walls were. Today, the group finds nearly 1 million things a year.

Archeologists dig for artifacts. They can examine the artifact and figure out how certain peoples lives were in the past.          To begin with , archeologist are people who find items from the past called artifacts. They also examine the artifacts. Artifacts also help the archeologist find out how people lived in the past.         Second of all , archeologist dig as teams. One team dig in places they call excavation sites. The place where the team is digging is called a dig. Archeologist use a process called troweling. A different team works in the lab studying the artifacts they found.          Finally , Archeologist have many tools they use. They start off their dig with tools called skim shovels. They are used for removing layers of soil. More tools they use are picks, shovels, knifes, wheelbarrows, whisks and many more. All these tools help archeologist find artifacts. This is what archeologist do and what they are.

Then he must do lots of research on the artifacts he is looking for. Then he must select the appropriate tools for his search.      Next, a certain group of people 3D computers to track what is underground. They then send messages to the other team.      Finally, the other team digs in the spot where the other team sent them to. If they found what they where looking for, they would use the whisk to brush it off and examine it.      The archeologist job is hard, but it helps other people understand the past.

One team of archeologists get to use 3D computers that can track what is underground. Some archeologists that get to be on the team that digs use skim shovels. Skim shovels help them to remove thin layers of soil one at a time.Then they place the soil in a box that that has a half-inch screen at the bottom.           One thing that they use is a trowel. They also use wheelbarrows, knifes, whisks, dustpans, picks, and shovels. Some archeologists use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use paint brushes, shovels, and wooden picks to take dirt off.            Another thing, is that it can take up to two weeks for archeologists to did a 25-square-foot section. There is also another team that spends days and days in the lab studying objects that were found.The process that they do is very tiring but it is worth it. As you can see archeologists haveto work very hard.             My opinion about being an archeologist is that it would be very fun and interesting. Being an archeologist involves doing alot of work.

Now we move on to our beloved presedent Gorge washington.Alot of people know him as a presedent and soliger but do you really know him? Well he lived on a land known as fary farm.  Now we don't know where his house located.People say that Gorge smoked clay pipes.Gorge had a fier in his house.Arcialigests have used 3D computers to map the place.the The arcialegests had to worked hard long hours to find all of this but it is worth it.

To begin with,if the archeologists find something in the ground they dig it up and dust if off with a whisk and a dustpan also you might just about get dusty jeans when your done.            I'm  going  to  tell  you  how  they digged  it  up they started with a pick and a shovel to dig easier then you get a trowel to scrape and cut tghe different layers of soil,if you find something valuable you dust it off with a whisk and a dust pan then you get a wheelbarrow to carry dirt and a skim shovel to remove a thin piece of layer with every scoop.

Over 200 years people thought that the river was washed away. The fort was build in 1607 when settlers from England stated. Most believed that James Fort was built by the river. The first objects were found in 1861. The National Park led a 5 years study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. Then they finally found James Fort. The first thing they found was a set of mark on the ground. The mark showed where the forts walls used to be. Today the group finds nearly one million objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit.           While digging in the area the archaeologists found the trash the settlers threw away including the bones of animals they ate. The informational from these objects helps us understand how the people in the James Fort lived. We now know how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.We also know what the settlers did to survive to difficult years when they had little food. It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. It gives us a piece of our past and tries us to the people who first stated the American colonies.Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. They knew that this help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.       Between all the stories they heard and read and drawing they made the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over river. The ledges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozen of burial sites, and ten buildings all with the border of the forts. We also know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. It gives us a piece of our past and tries us to the people who first started the American Colonies.

They have very creative and important jobs. They work with              finding bones of dinosaurs.They sometimes even try finding the history of a area where somewhere very important              lived. They sometimes sell the artifacts they find to museums and let all of us see their discoveries. I can tell you              what materials they use to find artifacts, what they do when they find artifacts, and what some do with them. Here              is what I know about archeologists.                                                                                    The Right Tools                          Archeologists look under the concrete and into the Earth to find what their looking for. But they need the              right tools to do that. Archeologists usually work with picks and shovels, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow,              skim shovel, and trowel. Picks and shovels are the starting tools. Whisk and dustpans are used for when they clear              away dirt from the artifact and the site they found it. The knife is used for very careful digging. Along with scraping              dirt around the artifact.                                              Next the wheelbarrow is used to move the dirt that was already researched. Skim shovels have flat edges to               carefully remove a thin layer of soil. Lastly the trowel, the most common tool used in archeology, is used to scrape               and cut to view the layers of soil. These are the tools that archeologists use to help them identify what they have              found or what they are looking for. The best tools to use when they have found an artifact is probably whisk and              dustpan, the knife, and the trowel.                                                                                 What They Do Now                                                                                                               What do they do now they found something? They first clean off the object briefly at the site it was found.                 Then the expert does further cleaning at the lab. Once they have finished the cleansing on the object, they do closer                inspection. They look at the scratches. they reserch how old the dirt is. They figure out what could have possesed                 the artifact, either person or animal. Once they have solved all these mysteries, they sum it up. Example: they find                a foot print near a empty area of dirt where there was once a community. It was a big foot print. Could it be a huge                 footed man or a large creature foot print? They reserch until they find out. They then realize it was a large mammal                that caused it, but don't know what animal. They are still researching.                                                                                                                                                  Where They Will Go                             What do they do with their amazing discovery? They either keep for further researching the object, give it to                important people, or sell it to museums. Don't worry, they keep all of the artifact's discoveries and history to them               and a little bit to us in museums. They give it to important people, such as the military, because it could be dangerous               to all of us and the military can do something about it. They keep the artifacts to them selves for further researching               because they need to know more about it. The more research, the more we can know about the past and future.                                                                                          Conclusion                                                         This is my report of what I know on archeologists. I am glad I was able to tell you about them making very                interesting research and how important their jobs are. I hope they are as interested in their job as much as I am.

Well, if you are going to be an archeologist, you shall do just that! An archeologist is a scientist who studies archeology, or the study of ancient things. Being an archeologist can be boring and tiresome, but surely fun!!        The first mission to a successful archeology project, is the identification of the material. Scientists use a special computer to track down and locate the item that they want to discover. Using sophisticated radar can be helpful, they use X-ray machines. Given all these privileges, scientists get a rough idea of what the material looks like underground, so it can help them see if they have found it the right thing.         This leads to the process of digging. After they have found the item, it is time to dig it out. Here is where a LOT of what archeology means, comes into action. The digging starts with archeologists using a tool, called a Skim Shovel. These are special shovels that are small, flat, and sharp. All this makes the shovel dig out a layer of soil. The dirt is dropped into a box with a small, so that the soil can leak out by itself. Then comes a bigger tool, the shovel. This kind of shovel takes larger amounts of soil off the ground. The box will overflow, because of the bigger quantity of soil, and dirt. This drags another tool in; the wheelbarrow. A wheelbarrow is sort of like a wagon, which is essential because the soil amount has increased. When the archeologist finally hits a surface, he or she takes out the other tools for the job; the whisk and the dustpan. These are used to brush the dust off the surface so that they can see what the surface is really like. If it is the object they are looking for, they are successful.        The final and most important part of the project is researching it. After the item has been found, the scientists take it with them to their lab, to research the material. They do may tests on it, and analyze it. Archeology is a great study. So why don't you go out and start digging?     	DT NN NN RB VBP IN DT DT JJ NNS PRP MD VB IN JJ NNS .

You probably get to travel around the world. I would love to go to Africa and solve mysteries there and put bones together. It would be cool if I found a T-Rex and i would have a partner to be with instead of working by myself. It would probably be hard if I work by myself.           I learned archeologist have to be very smart to be a archeologist and of course putting it together.    Their probably working on something right now on this day. I wish my class could be there watching them solve a mystery and putting it together.        The archeologist had to figure out Finding Fort James and finding proof Digging up George Washington's Past. They had to see if George Washington really lived there.

This tells us that archeologist is a very important job. Then what exactly is an archeologist?     Archeologists find artifacts that once belonged to famous people, or is famous itself. We can know the history of long time ago by using the artifacts. However, archeologist is not an easy job. First they need to know where the artifact is. Then they need to find a proof that it is the right artifact. Finally, they start to dig. This steps may sound simple, but when you actually do it, it may take months and years to find an artifact.     When you are certain that an artifact is in an exact place, you need to find a proof, like I said before. For example, they found a clay pipe in a place where archeologists thought George Washington's house might be. They knew that Washington smoked clay pipes, so it gives proof that it is the right place. Then, they start to dig. Many teams will work on the site. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.Another team starts to dig. They start with skim shovels that remove layers of soil. The soil is placed in a box with a half- inch screen at the bottom. The dirt falls out while the artifact stays in. They also use a process called troweling, which is when you remove the dirt with small brushes and wooden picks. There are a lot more tools that are used by archeologists, but still, everything is used to dig and dig. Another team studies the objects that are found in the lab. This whole process takes a lot of time and effort.     The discovery of artifacts is really important because people can learn how people lived long time ago, and if the artifact belongs to a famous person, they can learn more about the person. Artifacts also give us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies. You may think being an archeologist is a boring job, but it is actually a meaningful and important job!

After they dig all of that stuff they put it in a pan that keeps all the artifacts and gets rid of all the dirt or other stuff.The pan has a strainer at the bottom which like i said gets rid of dirt  and keeps artifacts.         In a result from all of this is finding out history and that is a archeologists job finding out all this history. 	NN NNS VBP RP NN NNS VBP RB VB NNP NNPS VBP VBG .

The job of an archeologists is to find artifacts to discover different objects that came from a long time ago.       An archeologist does this job because maybe to get money or just have fun doing the job and just find cool things that are very old and rusty so maybe not to keep an dusty and rusty artifact.       The first artifacts or objects found were in 1861 and found like floors and and armors and weapons under ground. They also found a fort that was in or called James Fort. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.       The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. they knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the James Fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.       That's when they found James Ffort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be.       Today the group finds 1,000,000 objects each year. The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.       The archeologists use picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel, and other items or materials or tools to do there digging for there work.       Some people tried to find George Washington's house but no one new where it was under ground. Archeologists believed that there was a stone base under the house was still there. It would be cool to find George Washington's home!       They started to dig in 2003 to try to find the house. It took over a year but they still found it.They found the main farmhouse a few years later though.       This is why some people choose to be an archeologist to find different artifacts or to get money and things like that. Thank you for reading my paragraph hope you had a fun time learning about different ways archeologists want to be archeologists.

Do you know what they do? Do you know what tools they use? Well then lets get started! This fun essay will show you what they are, what they do, and what tools they use.            Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects from the past, and uncovered armor and weapons. In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past, stared in Jamestown. The project was designed to discover the secret of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought the fort had washed away by the river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.            The fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people believed that the fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it would make sense for settlers to choose that spot. However, objects were found nearby suggested the fort was more further away. The spot probability gave the settlers a safe spot so they would be safe against enemy ships.        The National park service led.        	VBG IN NNP NNP PRP VB WP NNS VBP . NNP PRP VB WP PRP VBP . NNP PRP VB WP NNS PRP VBP . NNP RB VBZ NN VBN .

Archeologists ,the name for scientists who study from the past, uncover armor and weapons.      I think archeologists are very intresting to write about. There is many intresting things they have discovered. Like the settlers from England.There is also national parks that archeologists research.i think you should be an archeologists when you grow up because you can also learn things.

They help you learn what has happened in the past that nobody knows about today. Archeologists have a very interesting life but to find what they are searching for, they need to have a lot of patience. You can look for years for something and never find it. That's why you can't be frustrated very easily.            I believe that being an archeologist would be very interesting mainly if you found something from the past because it would be fun and exciting to find something that you've been looking for, for years and then revealing it to the public. Also, if they find something very valuable they might become rich and famous. If I were an archeologist, the hardest part for me would be waiting and searching and also digging.             Some very successful archeologists found dinosaur bones or something about a famous person that died. Archeologists must be very smart to do their job because it takes quite a bit of intelligence to solve things that no one has solved before. If you want to become an archeologist you probably should be a good student in school, meaning pay attention, and never give up!             It takes many steps to dig some ancient place. you first have to start old school with a pick and shovel. You would also the use the trowel. After that you would most likely use the skim shovel. The knife it used second to last but before you use the last item you have to cut around the artifacts so you don't break them. Last, you use a whisk and a dustpan to get any stray dirt of the valuable artifact.            In conclusion, it takes a lot of hard work, effort, and patience to become a great archeologist that solves the world's questions about the past.

To begin, archeology is a process that divides between two teams. The people in the digging process have to trowel. Troweling is when archeologists use tiny tools such as small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden toothpicks to take out the dirt from the artifacts. That's one teams job. Another team is looking at the artifacts in a lab and discovering what is has to do with the life of the person. Archeologists have to work together to find the best and truthful results.             Apart of the process, the archeologists have to make sure the facts they find have a reasonable explanation. For example: George Washington's house supposedly had a fire and archeologists had found some burnt pottery proving that his house did actually have a fire. Also, around the 1860's archeologists had discovered that Fort James wasn't only next to the river, but was also farther away to protect the town from enemy ships. Archeology is a very interesting and leads to many new interesting discovery's.             Lastly, when the artifacts are proven to be true, the pieces teach humans about other humans lives. For example: George Washington's past has taught children and adults about who he really was and about his family. Also, the fort James taught how smart people were in the olden days and why they didn't live next to the harbor. Not only is being a archeologist interesting and fun, but it also teaches other people a lesson along with yourself.                   To conclude, archeology is a historical 'mystery' that teaches people about this persons life in the earlier days. It also shows how the people were in the olden days which sometimes is a mystery.

They have a job that requires mysteriousness, smartness, and patience. Though archeologists have important jobs they have hard ones too. I'm going to tell you all about how archeologists do their job and why they do this.            Archeologists do there job so that scientists can know and study what people did or what kind of things happened in the past. We want to know this stuff because it's important to know what happened in our past and how people helped us get to where we are in the world today.            Now for how archeologists do their job. Archeologists find a spot where something important happened and they start digging for artifacts. Artifacts are the things that they find and study to figure out our past. After they find the artifacts they clean them with a whisk and dustpan and clean them off. After they are clean they study the artifacts to solve our history.            Today I told you about archeologists. I told you how they do their job and how their job is important. I had a fun time learning about archeologists and I learned a lot. I hope you did too!!

Also, you can be the first one to touch a artifact. Being a archeologist, you need a lot of time to do it, and you will have to be in a lot heat. But, it is worth it because of you find a artifact, you can get a lot of money for doing so.   In 1994, a group of men found a discovery that could change the history of things. Also, it was about George Washington so the group that found it got a lot of money. It was a big accomplishment in the world.   As you can see, being a archeologist can be very cool.

Well if you didn't do I am about to tell you all about them and there very hard job. Archeologists spend most of there time mining for fossils and bones and some even full bodies. When archeologists first found objects they had no idea what they were doing. People first started to be archeologists when they discoverd Fort James. This fort is were most all archeologists went when they were looking for bones and fossils. Fort James was built in 1607 from settelers that wanted to start a new life. Many of these settlers belived that James should be built near a river because it was easier to dock ships their. These settlers later became archeologists and they started finding objects everywhere. Once they became more into it, it was their life. Later on, a national park service when on a five year hunt trying to find this fort so our archeoloigests now can study there.                      Between all of their hard work they finaly found the fort!!!!! After they found the fort they also found eleven cellars, and ten whole buildings. This took archeologists a very long time. They studied and studied with alot of hard work and never gave up to find the Fort. An amazing fun fact is that today, archeologists find more than 1million objects every single year. If think that this is an easy job you are wrong. This is such a difficult job that you have to study for many years before you start to do this job profesionaly. Its also not easy to find the objects. you have to be trained and you also need how to use the tools very properly. Now I will tell you all about archeologists tools. Their different tools that they uses are called pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skimshovel, and trowel. Some of these objects I think you will be familier with but most, I don't think you will be.                        The tools that you are not familier with are quite complicated. First of all, the skim shovel is used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. The whisk and dustpan is used to clear away dirt from the excavation side. These are the tools that I am not familier with, but you might be. I thought that it was very interesting to learn about the different tools that archeologists use to find objects and bones. Now I hope you understand more agout archeologists and their very hard job. In conclusion, archeologists are very interesting to learn facts about and I hope you learned alot from my essay about these very interesting and unique people.

Many of these jobs include working with artifacts from the past. In a way they are like detectives with shovels. But, that is not the only tool Archeologists use. Numerous tools are used in the process of finding, studying, and most of all making sure the artifact is not hurt during the event. They use things like the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and the trowel.       Also, archeologists can become very important people. Some have discovered things from the range of dinosaur bones to famous actor's personal belongings. This has made them important due to the fact that people seem to become closer to people of the past once they know something about their childhood or early life. This may be because people are most of the time drawn to the persons life before they became successful. This makes the job of an archeologist more worth wild.       Finally, I believe that this certain job is amazing because of the ground sight that they work on. One might be astonished to know that archeologists actually get to encounter the historical landscape from a very up close view. This interests me because I would love to pretend like I lived in that past life on a farm with my cows. A beautiful ground sight to work on would be a castle of an old pirate. Going into all the rooms; digging up stolen treasures and finding swords. It would be spectacular!       In conclusion, I believe that the job of an archeologist would be awesome. Although, digging isn't really my specialty, finding breathtaking artifacts and holding a little piece of history in my hands would be my dream job.

You could be in three teams the first team uses 3D computers to maps the area. The second team does the digging in a place that the call the dig,and do the troweling. The third team is in a lab the study the artifacts.            Being an archeologist is worth it you can find many things like pottery,frames, and maybe even weapons. There are so many things that you could find. And once you find them you get to share them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             What it means when you find an artifact is that you can share it. It gives people a better understanding of the famous person that the artifact belonged to. How the lived and why they made the decisions the did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Another part of being an archeologist is you have to find what you will be looking for, where it's at, what  equitment you need, and the teams for it. It would be good if you had a sponser so you have extra money for where you go. Having a reseach about that place would be good too.

Archaeologist first use a computer mapping software to make a image of the the area they are going to use.  Archaeologists then they look at the ground with it  and they can see things under ground.Then they mark the spot.  The spot they mark is the spot they are going to dig in.          Archaeological start digging with a skim shovels they remove thin layer of soil.  The next tool they use is picks and shovels to dig in to the earth.  Then they use a trowel to scrape and cut layers of soil.  They use the wheelbarrow to  carry the dirt .  When they get close to the artifacts they use knifes to scrape dirt around artifacts.  They then use whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts.

They also have discovered many facts about the life of George Washington as a kid.                         After many slow years archeologists have discovered where James Fort was located and what the life of people that lived at James Fort was like. They have found out that Jmes Fort was not washed away by a river but it was still there! Reports from archeologists say that they found where it is located and why it is located there. They also found out about many things about the people that lived there. They found out how they fought the Indians that attacked them, where they put the things that they didn't want or need. That was the discovery of ''long lost James Fort.''                           Archeologists have also discovered things about the childhood of George Washington. They found out where he lived. How did they find out that the house they were looking at was his? Archeologists found out that the house they were looking at was his because they used details about what happened in the past, to find out about things today. For Example, they used the fact that George Washington's house once caught on fire and that George Washington smoked clay pipes to find out that they were looking at the correct house. That is the dicovery of George Washington's past.                           Why would they want to dig the past? Archeologists dig up the past so they can learn new things about the past. Sometimes books don't have enough information for what they want to learn so they decide to dig it up or investigate themselves.They also like to dig up the past so kids can learn more and also adults. Adults can learn what the lif e of George Washington was like before he became a president.Those were the reasons why they would be intrested in digging up the past.                              Some times people want to learn more about the past.I think that people like archeologists are very nice and intelligent people. I think they are kind because they help people learn more. I think they are intelligent because they use clues from the past to get to a end.

But most of all i   especially need a pick axe and shovel for digging   and hitting huge rocks and breaking them the    spots i would look for would be the Grand Canyon    and Fort James for like at Grand Canyon I would   dinosaur bones and other cool things and at Fort-   James and the thing i would look for there is the   pieces to the American Flag, Armor and Weapons   that they used, But the coolest place i would go is to   the white house and look for stuff that the presidents   may of dropped something. Or go to George Washington's   house and see if i could find something he wrote or a piece   of paper that he wrote his speech on or maybe a pitcher.

Like a pick shovel it helps with digging things up from the ground.  Whisk and the dustpan helps brush off the dirt.  The knife is used to scrape dirt off the artifacts.  The wheelbarrow helps move things.  The skim shovel has a flat edge to remove a layer of soil from the ground.  Trowel is the most commond tool it scrapes and cuts layers of soil.                               Archeologist is a fun job you get to explore and get to see different things.

Archeologists can dig up dinosaurs famous people animals anything, but sometimes it can be nothing. Sometimes when an archeologist finds something, or someone famous they can become rich if they find enough stuff.       I can tell you some things bad about being an archeologist because mountains could collapse on you if there is a big sound. You can be discovering things, and a bolder can roll off the mountain, and crush you, and if you live it you will be very hurt and may not even walk again.       Here are some good things that could happen when you are an archeologist, you can find a famous person and the stuff they had and you can get a lot of money. You should find important things needed for other people and they could give you money. You could just get money from finding things that have been under ground for thousands and thousands of years.

When they did Goerge Washingtons farm it could take them two weeks to dig up twenty-five square feet. It took a very long time to dig up his entire farm. It also took a while to find the area to dig they found the main farm house last and the kitchen first.       Also at the James town fort it took a while to find its exact location by looking for artifacts such as on the rivers bank they found stone ledges that once use to hold cannons they also found were the town dumped its garbage. The artifacts that prooved they had found Goerge Washingtons farm were some burnt pottery from the fire they had and part of a clay pipe that his father had smoked. In conclusion I think that arkiologists work very hard and patiently.

The prosess of digging for artifacts is a long one. Teams can have up to 35 people. One team uses 3D  computers to see whats under ground. Then the other team starts digging. They use skim shovels to carefully remove thin layers of soil. All of the soil goes into a box with a half-inch screen which lets all the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.

The project was designed to discover the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia. For over 200 years, People thought that fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.    The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there,so it made sense that the settlers choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.    First objects were found in 1861. Archeologist, the name For scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.They knew that this would help dicide where to look for proof of the fort.

An archeologist has to work long hours to find what they are looking for, on this ocation the archeologist are trying to find a fort on Jamestown.                In 1994 a group of archeologist were trying to investigate how Jamestown was on that time on Virginia. The archeologist find on their investigation that in Jamestown it used to be a Fort, but now it's gone, so the archeologist want to find where the fort was. Now let's see what happens. The archeologist told their leader that they want to find a fort on Jamestown. The leader told the archeologist to get all the people on the building to go find it.                Once the archeologist  where on their way they stop where they saw a mark on the ground, the archeologist got all the tools they will need. One of them took the pick and shovel, other took the whisk and  dustpan, another took the knife, other took the wheelbarrow, another took the skim shovel, and finally the last person took the trowel.When they where ready they start digging and digging until they found a triangle on the ground, so, they notice the fort was on a shape of a triangle.                 So the archeologist made an amazing discover of the fort on Jamestown.

You'll also learn what tools the archeologist used on that times. George Washington was a soldier, that is what we know aboout him, wedon't know much about when he was little, let's see.               On time some archeologists were making a investigation of George Washington.   The archeologists wanted to know where George Washinton lived, so they started to look for information of where did his house was. The archeologists went to look for the house. The archeologists remmember that in the information said that fire was on his house, so the archeologists were looking for some kind of mark of fire on the ground. On day they return to keep looking for the house until someone look something on the ground,and all the archeologists look and look and look. One of the archeologist walk away through the car and look at a picture that they had before of George Washinton's house.               He run with the other guys and tell them that this is the place where Washington lived because it was exactly like the picture. When the archeologist went back to home they told everybody where Washington lived.

But later on the Rediscovery Archaeological Project ( who were suppose to find the secrets on Fort James) found some hints and clues that it was still there.                            Fort James had been built in 1607  when some people came from Britain to be free of England's hard laws. A lot of people thought it was bulit close to a river. It was a logical desicion because you could easily dock ships there. But later on work showed it might be located further away to give the colinist more protection.                          After about a 105 years later there hard work bore some fruit. They had finaly found fort James! They first found where the outline of the fort had been. And today we still find artifacts like trash and coins and even toys.                      It is amazing that we found items over 400 years old. Objects that are still used today. It provides a unusale connection to our founders of our country.

The archeologists make sure they use the right tools so that they do not make a mistake . Finding items under the ground is difficult for some people exept archeologist because they are good at finding items. Some of the tools archeologists use are cool because I never heard of them. Archeologists take a long time trying to find items that are old. Archeologist like finding old items, so that is like they are interested in making a old collection.             Archeologist are very fun because they get to use awesome tools and we do not. I  think archeologist are very hard workers. They always try their best and enjoy what they do.  They get to  look for important  items like ,George Washingtons  house. Also they get to have more  fun than any kid because they get dirty and kids do not get to be dirty unless their parents let them.

For archeologist it is very tough for them when they don't find   bones.Then they have to search in an whole different area with bones.   Archeologist tools are easy to use ! Archeologists usually call a search for bones a dig. Most digs start with a pick or a shovel.           A pick is used to dig into the earth next to the artifacts, a shovel does the same thing as the pick it digs into the earth trying to get dirt from around the artifact.There may be lots of other tools they may use  that I don'n know about.The whisk is used to dust off the artifact carefully. The dustpan clears away any dirt in the way.           Archeologists also use a knife to carefully scrape the dirt off the priceless artifact.They also use a wheelbarrrow to carry dirt away from the excavation site.Archeologist use a skim shovel too! It is used to carefully scoop away a thin layer of soil with each scoop.They also use a trowel to scrape and view different layers  of  soil.In conclusion, I learned differnt things about archeologists.

They use tools like a skim shovel or a trovel to remove and veiw diffrent layers of soil in order to help look for artifacts. Archeology is important because it helps see how people from our past lived and how things have changed from then to now. They find the sights where the artifacts are by looking back in history.          The tools of Arecheologist have special jobs and are needed to find artifacts. Here are the tools and their uses.   The Pick and Shovel are used to dig into the earth and get close to the  artifacts. Whisks and Dustpans are used to help clear away dirt. A Knife is used to carefully scrape dirt away from artifacts. Wheelbarrows are used to move dirt and other objects to diffrent locations. Skimshovels are shovels with flat edges and are used to carefully remove a layer of thin soil. Trowels are the last tool and are the most common tool. They are used to cut and scrape dirt so Archeologist can look at the layers.   I used this information from Source #3           Archeology helps us see into the past and learn what happened back then.In 1994 a group of people intrested in studying the past (Archeologist) started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. It was designed to dicover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. for 200 years people thought it had been washed away by a river but some discoveries in the area hinted it might still be around.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. The first objects were found in 1861.Over a hundred years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.Then the National Park service led a five-year study of the area.Thats when they finnaly found James Fort!The archeologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the borders of the fort.Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.the objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in James Fort lived. We now know how the settlers did to fight the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.this info was from source #1          People like George Washington leave behind history so to find what they where like before they became famous you follow that history. Archeologist thought a stone base for a farm house would be left behind . Four houses had been built on Ferry Farm land, witch is the place where George Washington lived so Archeologist had to find proof it was his so they started a dig.Records show the Washingtons had a fire in their house. The diggers found peices of burnt pottery suggesting a fire had been here. They also found part of a clay pipe. We know Washington smoked clay pipes so that is further evidence it was Washingtons house.

Archeologists are very hard working people.They use a pick and shovel,Whisk and Dustpan,an knife,a wheelbarrow,a Skim Shovel and a Trowel. they use the trowel to scrape and cot to view the different layers of soil.They use the skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.They use the wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another or carry dirt away from the excavation.They use the knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.They use the whisk and the dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.They use the pick and the shovel to dig into the earth,close to the artifacts.Those are their types of tools archeologists use to do their job.            In conclusion,being a archeologists is very important and you have to be loyal to your workers.Don't forget this job is very hard pay attention and do the right thing and don't forget work hard.I think it would be cool to be an archeologists.Its sounds really fun and it isn't boring.Cause when you read about it you will learn a lot of things and you will already be prepared.

It takes hard work, cautiousness, determination, and patience.  Archeology helps us understand things about people and why they made the decisions that they did.  They use all different kinds of gadgets and tools to help them find these artifacts, so that's what I'll write about first.    This paragraph will be about the tools Archeologists use to find lost artifacts.  Some of the larger tools would be the Pick and Shovel, the Wheelbarrow, and the Skim Shovel.  Some of the smaller objects include the Trowel, the Whisk and Dustpan, and the Knife.  The Knife is used to dig carefully and push dirt away from the artifacts.  The Trowel is used to do some cutting and scraping to have some sort of a view of the different layers of soil.  The Whisk and Dustpan is probably used after you find the artifact it brushes off the dirt on an artifact.  The Pick and Dustpan is used to start the dig and get down close to the object, while the skim shovel scrapes thin layers of dirt with it's flat edge and dumps it into the wheelbarrow which then takes it away from the excavation site.    In this paper I explained what Archeologists tools do and how they help them get the job done.  If there were no Archeologists, museums like the Smithsonion wouldn't exist.  Museums help us learn about History, and isn't History one of our subjects in school?  So think about it, the world needs Archeologists because we can find some pretty amazing things when we dig up the history of the people on our Earth.

Archeologist have to find things in the past.In 1994 people went to Jamestown to discover new things in the past. They also wanted to discover secrets of the James Fort. For about 200 years, people thought  that James Fort was washed away by a river. The first objects were found in 1861 and the Fort was built in 1607 so it took a lot of years to find the first objects.The first objects the Archeologists got were armor and weapons.They also discovered floors and building.                                            The National Park Service led a 5 year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. That is when they found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of footprints on the ground.The marks showed were the Fort walls were. The Fort was shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the Fort was stretched all the way to the river!                           Today people find millions of things including pottery, tools , and coins, They even found metal toys for children. In 1600s,people throwed their trash in a unused well or into a big pit. Archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, they found the bones of the animals they ate.Now we know that the settlers did not eat a lot.                               It is very amazing to find objects that were used by people 100 years ago. That is my report about Archeologists and their jobs.

Archeologist dig up fossiles and clean them and use a bunch of tools.The tools that and archeologist use are a pick and shovel,wisk and dustpan,nife,wheelbarrow,skimshovel,and atrowel.Without archeologist the world wouldn't have socail studies.Archeologist give us a peice of our past.Archeologists dig up stuff a hundred years old.Archeologist have found pottery.Also they have found coins.

If you do not know about people and you want to learn more about them then you can ask a archeologist. But this job can be scary to because if you put your hand in glass then it can stick you in the hand and can hurt really bad.This job is very fun because you can also tell people who do not know anything about the life of that person and that would be fun.            A archeologist can find information about that person that they are looking up.They can learn about there project that they are working on. They would not have a clue and then they find a clue and it helps them a lot. In the passage it says that the archeologist could not find the James fort in Jamestown but they did not give up and they found it.         When they where looking at the Washington home they found a lot of stuff and they found smoked clay pipes and clay pots. They could tell that the house had burned down because the clay pots were melted.That is how they could tell if the house had burned down.They knew that the stone base was still there so they started to dig in 2003.The first thing they found were a kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a couple years later.          I hope who is reading this learned a lot of stuff about archeologists.I hope the next time that you read this you will pass it on to other people. I hope you liked my report on archeologist's. See you next time. Hope you read my next report on George Washington.

They use many different types of tools to dig things up like a shovel, pick, duspan and whisk, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and a trowel.  They wright in their journals and have different paraghs and they use other sources.  They find were the people grew up and see if any thing is left.

An archeologist is a person whose job is to study objects that have been buried from the past and dig them up.  What they do is an important job beause they are basically digging up our past and our future history.  Also I think it would be cool to be an archeologist and dig up all of those cool artifacts.  I also think would be hard work and not be so pleasent when you do not find anything.       In this paragarph, you will find out about archeologists digging in George Washinton's childhood home and about archeologists in Jamestown colony.  In George Washinton's childhood home on a farm caled Ferry Farm.  On this site an archeologist team can have up to 35 people!  While digging here you have to be very careful or you can damage something of his past, to avoid this you could use a soft whisk and a dustpan to get dirt from around an artifact. At the Jamestown colony dig workers use 3D computers to graph out what the conlony might have looked like.  Once they find Jamestown, they will then grab a skim shovel to remove thin layers of dirt.  In this dig, they found pottery, coins, tools and even metal toys for children.       As you can see, the life of an? archeologist is very hard. But when you find something it is like you have struck gold. So after a hard day of work, you may be tired but there is always another day ahead to look foward to. You can also think of the next day as a chance to find something more exciting and better than the thing you found yesterday. I hope you learned a lot in thin essay and enjoyed reading it.              	IN DT NN PRP MD VB IN DT NNS , NNS CC DT JJ NN IN DT .

The first objects were found in 1861, found armor and weapons, floors, and buildings. In about 100 years, people began to find the exact spot were the fort began.                    Findning the spot is bout  a grup of people digging up the past of ferry farm, were George Wshingtons home was before he became president. They found clay pipes, wich Washingtons used, along with burnt pottery, wich must have ment the house has burned down.

You can't just start digging, or else you don't know where to dig.  First, you have to map the area with computers, then you can start digging with the skim shovels.  The skim shovels start removing layers of dirt, but be careful, you don't want to skim too far or else you might break the artifacts.  You could also start with a pick and shovel, once you are close to the artifacts.  You are very likely to use a trowel to remove the last few layers of soil. At this point, you will have to be super careful, or else you could easily break the artifacts.  If the soil surrounding the artifact is hard, you would use a knife to carefully scrape off the dirt.  If the dirt is soft or loose, you would use a whisk and dustpan.  As you can see, being an archeologist requires skill, but is still partially based on luck.  Why luck?  Well, you could be digging for 15 minutes and of found 43 treasure chests, while you could've been digging for 9 years and only found a piece of metal.  In conclusion, being an archeologist is not always easy.

They use different tools, such as a: pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. They find out about the past of famous or well known people and more about their life that nobody knew about.       They find the objects or personal secrets by working as a big team. First, the team finds the place, which can track things underground, on a map using 3D computers. Then, another team starts digging in the dig. They use a type of shovel called the skim shovel that are small, flat, and sharp. They put the object found into a half-inch screen to let the dirt to fall and the object to stay. After that, they trowel to scrape and cut up the layers of the soil. Finally, the last team spend a lot of their time to study and find out more about the object and what it is. It takes a lot of time to do all this, but step by step you can get a good result.       Digging up objects and discovering things may be hard work, but you can make history out of it. People learn more and more about that person and their childhood. Being an archeologist is a big job from discovering to studying and learning about the object to making history.     	. . . .

To be an archeologist you have to know what archeologist means. An archeologist is a person who finds things from the past, like people and how they made the life of today happen. Or when things took place. They find these things out with lots of different tools.                   Some tools are forfor diging, some for carrying, some for dusting. All of these tools have some kind of meaning. Here are some tools that archeologists used.       Pick and Shovel Whisk and Dustpan Knife Wheelbarrow Skim Shovel Trowel                       The hard part of this job is knowing were to start. To know were to start archeologists might want to use to internet to help them know were to go. Once they find something they grab their tools and go. They start diging and once they find something they put it in the wheelbarrow, roll it to their truck and/or van and load it up.                   All of this stuff is now sent to a special room were another tool finds out how old it is and by the marking on the object that could tell us how it was used. Once they know all that they might be able to put the rest of the story together from all of the other tools that were found.                                       I highly recommened becoming an archeologist. Not because how much money they make, eventhough they probable make a lot of that, but to help yourself and others no more about the world around us and how it came to be, and maybe even how it will become. Please know that not everything in these paragraphs are true, these were things that I figuered would be true from my own thoughts and from what I have leared.

What an Architect Does                      An architect does many important and interesting things. Architects find artifacts that can retrace or recollect what had happened to a person, place or thing. Architects discover important things such as diaries of a famous person or letters from the time of World War 2 probably they could even find secrets. They sometimes find things you can't imagine that could find for instance an invention or quotes lying around in the debris. Architects can discover many things.            Have you ever thought of a famous person that has passed away and wondered what their childhood was like and what tragic things happened during it's life span. Well that's what an architect can find out. Suppose Thomas Jefferson was your person maybe you would like to recollect his outlines of the Declaration of Independence. You could also find out if there was a fire where the person lived by testing the ground samples. For instance maybe you might find one of Benjamin Franklin's invention or books. There are many things you could find buried somewhere which you might not expect.        	. .

They dig up stuff and they examine it. They find information about the stuff they dig up by examining it. They use tools to dig the stuff up. Here are some examples.   The pick and shovel. Most of the time archeologists use these tools first. They dig into the Earth to find stuff.   The whisk and dustpan. They use this to dust dirt off the artifacts and clear dirt from excavation site. So if there is a lot of dirt on something they can just brush it away.   The knife. They use this to scrape dirt away from around the artifacts.   The wheelbarrow. They use this to carry something or dirt from one place to another. So if there is a lot of dirt in one place, then they can move it to a different place. Or if there is something heavy that they need to move.   The skim shovel. A skim shovel has a flat edge so it can remove dirt carefully. So maybe there is a fragile thing in the ground. They can remove the dirt carefully.   The trowel. This is a common tool used by archeologists. They use this to cut layers of soil. Maybe they just want to view stuff but the soil is too hard.   Archeologists dug up some of George Washington's past. They have one team that focuses on digging. They have another team that focuses on mapping out the area. They use computers that track what's underground. They tell the digging people where to dig and stuff. That is all I have for this report so I guess I'm done. The End.

Their job was to study objects from the past. The archeologists used many different tools for example, they used the Pick and the Shovel that was used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts, the Whisk and Dustpan that was used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, the Knife that was used for carefull digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts, they used the Wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site, the Skim Shovel that was used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop, and last, but not least, the Trowel that was used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.              In their job their had to be a surtain amount of people. They could only have up 35 people on a team. The first team would map an area by using 3D computers that can find what is underground. They used 3D computers to record was was underground to see before people started digging. The second team would focuss on their digging. They started with the Skim Shovels. They were so small and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil.They also used a Trowel.This job was so hard it took about two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section.

George Washington's home was on a Ferry Farm because of the perfect land to build a house on.Archeologists think that stone base  that was under the house is still there.So they started to dig in 2003.It took a year but they did find it.The first thing they found was the kitchen next they found was the slave quarters and storage houses.Other houses had been built on the Ferry Farm so the had to make sure it was the right house.Records show the Washington's had a fire in their house.They found burnt pieces of pottery which shows a fire was there.They also found a burnt clay pipe because Washington used to smoke them so they knew they were at the right house.                   The discovery of George Washington house is very important.The first reason is that it helps citizens know who George Washington was before he became famous.The second thing it helps is historians learn about the life Colonial Americans lived.                          Ferry Farms are open to family's.Family's can go to the summer workshops with classroom and outdoor activities.Kids can explore the site,experience how the Colonial life was and kids can become kid archeologists.They can do classes,and games and crafts.Ferry Farms are coming to life like the country's never seen before.

For example, there are lots of surprises and you don't always know what is coming next, you get to see a lot of cool things that most people don't get to see, and also kids can get involved. Plus, you don't get to say that you have seen George Washington's house very often.                 First of all, being and archeologist seems like lots of fun because there are a lot of surprises and you don't always know what is coming next. I know that I like surprises....most of the time, so maybe the job of an archeologist wouldn't be so bad. For example, it took the archeologists a lot of time to finally found James Fort. They first were seeing a lot of clues to find proof. Because you will need proof to prove to people that you found James Fort or people won't believe you, and as you may know that it takes a lot of work to find proof, most of the time. But can you imagine the great feeling that the archeologists felt when they knew for sure that they found James Fort. I know that I love the feeling of relief after a lot of hard work!                 Another great reason about being and archeologist is that you get to see a lot of cool things (artifacts) that a lot of people don't get to see, and you get to be the first. Not only do you get to see cool artifacts but you also get to use and see some cool tools. For example, when the archeologists discovered Fort James and George Washington's house, the archeologists got to discover objects that were used by people hundreds of years ago. Isn't that cool! Being and archeologist doesn't just give people excitement, but it also gives people a look at the past.                 One more reason that and archeologist seems like lots of fun is because, kids get to get involved. I may not like reading out of a textbook, but I do like doing hands on activities. It doesn't seem bad to get to go out and discover things that many people may of thought you wouldn't be able to do. Any good job takes some hard work. I thind that it would be really cool to learn about George Washington as a kid, or getting to see lots of cool artifacts! There should be a museum where kids can learn the same stuff that the archeologists discovered and doing hands on activities. Even though we wouldn't get as much fun as the archeologists did actually getting to discover, it would be lots of fun for the kids, and the archeologists would feel good about it!                 In conclusion, these were just a couple of examples of why being an archeologist is so much fun. Who knows, maybe you would want to try being an archeologist someday! Think about all the awesome things you would get to do. For instance, see cool artifacts, be the first to discover something, feel the feeling of anxiety, but then again have the feeling of relief. Like I said before, even though being an archeologist seems like lots of hard work, it is still lots of fun!

It all started in 1994 when a group were interested in studying Jamestown. They were trying to discover the secrets of James Fort. Everybody thought that the fort had been washed away by a river but the group found small remains such as armor, weapons, and floors of buildings! This was so exciting that the National Card Service led a five-year study of the James Fort area. Finally they found James Fort!        It started out as just a few marks, then they realized those marks were were the walls used to be. Then they found stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold cannons. They also found eleven cellars, many burial sites, and ten buildings.       After that motivation the group finds over 1,000,000,000 objects each year! each object gives away more information about the James Fort and how the people inside it lived.The team still works on uncovering artifacts and learning about the James Fort.

They find guns, grenades, ammo, and even corps of the men who fought in the wars. Archeologists have studied things and fossils all around the world. The hardest part is digging the bones or artifact up. The fossils and artifacts they find are really cool amazing because its not every day you get to see a T-Rex or a survivors bones!!! Archeologists use many sorts of tools like a pickaxe, shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. They all have there own abilities like the pickaxe that mines stone and cobble stone. The shovel gets rid of dirt. The wheelbarrow carries heavy loads. The Trowel is used to scrape and cut different layers of soil. Pickaxes are a great tool for mining. There are many groups of archeologists. All the tools have different uses and meanings. Archeologists look for artifacts and fossils. They work in hot deserts sometimes.

Finally,Digging up George Washington's Past.Over 12,000 years people lived in Ferry Farm.It was a perfect place to be and live.Washington father ,Augustin moved his family there.No one knew were exactly where Washington home was located since the building was long gone.                            In conclusion,that's my report on history of digging.That how finding James was and digging George Washington's past.

Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life colonies americans lived. Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home.        The archeologist is  a hard thing to do like a work. All of these things  are key parts of our past as americans.We also begin to know why he made the decission he did.        Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at ferry farm are bringing to life the countrys first president in ways we have never seen.People have lived on the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000 years. If I was in the old days I would be working so hard and help my family with her stuff.

This story let me know George Washington better.George Washington lived over 12,000 years ago I did not know that. His father moved his family there   that place was called Ferry Farm.The first room they found was the kitchen.They also found the slave quarter, and the storage houses.They searched and searched but then they found a clay    pipe they knew already that Washington smoked clay pipes.   But at lease they found proof.Some archeologists work at there    other places working on 3D computers so that they can see under ground. Others where doing the digging they called it the dig.Some of  them diged with a shovel called a skim shovel it is very sharp     it can remove a thin layers of soil.When others did troweling that is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks.Some    times it takes them two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot.But at the end it is all worth it.

It is, but it's a lot more then that. Even before the work happens it takes years to plan out the location. Then it's tiresome hours of ?finding objects in the ground on a 3D computer. Finally months of digging in the dirt for those objects. In this report you will learn the forgotten work of the archeologists.          The one of the hardest things an archeologist has to do is search out the coordin&aring;tes of the ruins. In a article I read it took a couple years to begin the search. I once met with a professor, he told me that 'in many of my archeological digs that it took 2-3 years to come up with the location.' He said that 'it takes many calculations. We have to go off of recent reports. Sometimes we go off of findings. One time we had a huge lead when we met up with a business man who said that their is a certain place with artifacts lying around everywhere.' There also is another flaw in this work. Say your calculations are off. You could dig up an entire place for nothing. You lose a bag load of money for nothing. You now have to reconfigure your calculations and spend another 2-3 years on calculations. This is one of the many tiresome events that occur as an archeologist.          Another tiresome act that occurs is the hours of watching a screen for any sign of object in the ground. This can be as boring as staring at a wall because      There is no game, website or anything to do but watch the screen. If you are hungry or go to the bathroom you need to call someone over to take your shift. Then the other person encounters the boredom that you were experiencing. If you sit to long, your butt falls asleep. I personally hate that.    Those were 4 things that may or may not occur if you are at this post. Not only those scary life threatening events but if the fates hate you that day they will either shut down your machine or make you dig up a tin can. If you dug 15 feet into the ground for that you would be furious. This is 5-6 things that can ruin your day in at least 10 minutes.          Finally the toughest part of them all. The dig. This part is the hardest because you have to dig in the hard earth. Yes, there may be machines, but, there always won't be. Imagine breaking your back everyday. Digging and digging and digging till you find the artifact. 95% of archeologists say that they needed 30 day back therapy after the dig. Yes, back therapy. 30% also said they either needed physical therapy for a couple months or needed back surgery. Imagine that! That's why only the crazy, dedicated, and genius have a career as a archeologist. Now you may call it. The dig.          As you can see you are wrong. A job as an archeologist is a crazy career not just fun and games. If you are interested in the job and have at least two of the traits I have listed above here are the simple steps.       Get a bag load of money Take 2-3 years to plan your archeological dig. Get a huge group of crazed workers. Take hours and hours of time on a 3D computer looking for artifacts. Start to dig and dig to find the objects. Schedule a physical therapy appointment.         Now you know the basics, and always remember them, they will come in handy! See you at the dig!

They have to work in the blazing hot sun to the freezing cold winter day.They also cant be distracted or they might miss something right in front of them.Also they have to take there time with every possible second they have so they don't stay up all night trying to find something when its rreally dark out. I personally wouldn't like to be a archeologist because i really would rather have an indoor job that doesn't require a bunch of time and being as slow and careful as you can.

Picks and shovels are to tools for diggin in the ground and these are the first tools you use when starting to dig.Whisk and dustpans are used for picking off dirt of things like fossils. The dust pans are used for  picked up dirt off the ground. The knife is use to dig scrape dirt in the ground and on things. Wheelbarrows are used for getting a whole amount dirt and putting it in. The wheelbarrow will carry that dirt away. The skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge. It will scoop a thin layer of soil.The trowel is used to scrape and cut layers of soil.       When you get use to these tools you feel like a master archeologist. Does a archeologist have a lot of jobs to do? Of course they do it takes about days to find one thing. A lot of archelogists had to go to james town and look for george whashingtons stuff. All day every day for a archeologist.       Jamestown  was a very important place in history. But when the archeologist come it all changes. The archeologist found alot of things like armor and weapons. they found marks where wall use to be to. The most intresting they found was little pieces of food!

Like James Town was found. An archeologist's job is to find history artifacts of the past. All the dinosaur skeletons you see in a museum, where found by archeologist.          The tools an archeologist uses are a Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim shovel and a Trowel. A Pick and Shovel are used for mining and digging up artifacts. The Whisk and Dustpan are used to dust the artifacts etc.          An archeologist job is historical and good if you want to discover the past. Archeologist discover things every day everywhere.

Other teams were digging found other houses.

Archeologists are sometimes on robbery cases or maybe sometimes on discovering things from the past and getting all new information. Some archeologists even get payed to do their work. Archeologists can be put in dangerous situations just to find out more about what is going to happen in the future and what did happen in the past that we do not know about.          The things that people find out in their backyard like that they have a squirrel family living in their favorite tree is very different then what an archeologist does. Where as you found out about a family member living in Florida,archeologists found out about a whole group of presidents Berried in Florida(not really). Archeologists are very important to the world other wise we would never know who the first president was or what really happened in the big wars and big events.          Many of the archeologists these days are discovering crime cases or on a daily bases,what other life forms might be out there. You might think that aliens are never going to exist and you might have your head set on that but as an archeologist would say,I predict that there are to life forms of another species out there in this world. You might say,or you might think but that is not what an archeologist would do. An archeologist would think of something that they are not really sure about and has not really been proven,and then they would go out and try to discover what the real true answer is instead of guessing.          Archeologists are very smart people who help our world be a smarter place and we will always know now what these people discovered. If they can dig and risk their lives just so we can have a part of a social studies lesson then I think that we can do it to.  You can just go to a park or while you are on vacation dig around look around see what the world has in place for you and what you can help with. Be an archeologist and search,...who knows what you will find.

Have you ever been an archeologist?  What is an archeologist?  What do they do?  All of those questions might be going through your head right now, but I will answer all those questions.  Anyways, to be an archeologist is a lot of work.  Also they have to take a lot of classes to know what to do .  The good thing is that they can get a lot of money for selling all their precious artifacts to dealers.  Therefore, the job of an archeologist can be very complicated.               First of all, to be an archeologist is a lot of work.  You have to work all day long, which can be very tiring.  Also to be an archeologist can be very slow because you have to dig up artifacts that are very precious.  Sometimes you have to use paintbrushes, small shovels (skim shovels), and wooden picks, this is called troweling.  Even if you have a big group digging to find artifacts, it can take over two weeks to find and dig up something.  Furthermore, archeologists have a lot of work.               Secondly, to be an archeologist you have to take lots of classes.  For example, you have to learn about history to know where and what happened in the past.  They do this to know where to dig and what to dig/look for.  You also have to take archeology to learn how to dig and to dig properly.  There is also a lot more classes you have to take to be an archeologist, but that would take a while.  Lastly, you have to take a lot of classes to be an archeologist.               After all, you can get lots of money if you sell the artifacts to a dealer.  This is the good thing about being an archeologist-you get a lot of money out of it.  If you sell the artifacts to a dealer, they can give you lots of money for the artifact(s).  If the artifact(s) are very old you can get a lot of money for it.  If the artifact(s) are not really really old you will get less money, but still a lot of money.  All in all, this is the good part about being an archeologist- you get a lot money.               To sum it up, to be an archeologist is very complicated.  Archeologists get a lot of money.  You have to take a lot of classes to be one.  The on thing that is good is the money that you get.  Well, I hope you learned something new about the job of an archeologist. 	NNP NNP IN DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT NN . NNP PRP RB VBN DT NN . WP VBZ DT NN . WP VBP PRP VBP .

If so you might want to dig into this report.  Firstly, it takes a lot of time for archeologists to do their work.  Secondly, they have to use computers, tools, and science to find ancient artifacts.  Lastly, even though it takes a long time, it is definitely worth it.       Firstly, since it takes a long time for scientists to do their work, it might be a while until they they do find what they're looking for.  Since George Washington`s house burnt down, it was harder for the scientists to find proof that they were at the correct sight.       Secondly, since they have to use several tools to find artifacts they may have to work slower to understand what they have to look for.   Firstly, they have to use a computer with a 3D monitor to find out what they are looking for and where it is.  Secondly, they have to use shovels, trowels, pickaxes, knifes, dustpans, etc. to actually find the artifacts.       Lastly, even though it is very time consuming, it is worth it. it helps people understand more about the first president of the United States.  It also taches people what is done to discover artifacts from famous peolpe hundreds of years ago.       In conclusion, i believe that archaeology is very important in this world.  It takes technology, tools and hands to reveal imortant artifacts. 	NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WP VBZ VBD IN NNS IN NNS IN .

It also gave us cool web sites to go to and to get more info of this subject.

In this essay you'll learn about Jamestown Isand, working at young George Washington's house and you will also learn a little more about the tools they use and how they use them. I hop you learn more about archeologists by reading this essay.               First I'll tell you a little about Jamestown Island. In 1994 a group of people started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. They wanted to rediscover Fort James in Virginia. For more than 200 years people believed that Fort James had been carried away by a rushing river, but now there starting to doubt that theory. The was believed to be built either by a river or father away to be protected from enemies. The first artifacts were found in 1861. Archeologists found armor, weapons, floors and even ceilings of the fort. Now people are trying to find the exact place the fort was at. There was a five year study that gave them many important clues. Then they found it imagine how happy you would be! Today people can find a million objects or artifacts each year. They find pottery, glass and many other artifacts.Wow archeologists have to work really hard to find the sites even before they dig.       Next we will talk about George Washington's old house. George lived at a place called ferry farm. Finding the spot was very difficult because the farm was very big. but they made an estimate and started digging they soon found the stone base of the house.  Since other houses had been built there they needed proof it was young George's house. Records say the house burned down and they found burnt pottery. They also found clay pipes which they know Washington loved to smoke them. The archeologists have to be very careful while digging and handling artifacts. One wrong move and an important part of our history could be destroyed in seconds. Up to 35 people could be working on one site. They also use Highly advanced computers. They even let kids help out!       Finally I'll tell you about tools they are the pick and shovel used to dig the earth close to objects, whisk and dustpan used to dust the dirt off artifacts, knife used for careful digging near the artifact, Wheelbarrow is used to move artifacts or dirt away from the dig site, skim shovel used to remove a thin layer of soil and finally the trowel used to scrape, cut or view the soil differently. Wow that a lot of tools to dig right and ensure the safety of every artifact.       To sum it up Archeologists are amazing people who help us understand our history by literally digging it up. They have uncover Fort James and young George Washington's house. They use special tools and have to be extra careful. I hope now you have learned a lot more about archeologists. Maybe you want to be one too.

Here is what I learned.                      Archeologists use a lot of tools such as a pick and a shovel, whisk and a dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and a trowel. They use all these tools to dig stuff up. Archeologists are names for scientists. They study thngs from the past. Archeologists had a project to find James Fort. The first thing they found ws a sset of marks on the ground. They showed where the Forts walls used to be. All the stories they read they knew it would be shaped like a triangle. Archeologists also found out stuff about George Washington. No one exactly knew where Georges house was located. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year, but they finally found it. It was found on Ferry Farm. Records show that the Washingtons had a fire in there house. They found Georges clay pipes so they knew it was the Washingtons house.                  I learned a lot today with reading these history passages. I excpecially learned about George Washington. I hope you did too.

The archeologists found many things such as tools,pottery,coins and metal toys when that kids used to play with.They found these things when they were searching for James Fort.The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the site.Today, the group fins nearly one million objects a year. In the 1600s people used to throw away their trash down an unused well or into a big pit,While digging in the area , the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including bones from animals that they ate.The information learned from these objects helps the archeologists understand how the people lived in the James Fort.That is the end of that summary.

The tools used by archeologists are a Pick and Shovel.Most digs start with the pick and shovel and are used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts.The whisk and dust pan are used to brush dirt off artifact and clear away dirt from the excavation site.The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.Another tool that is used is a wheelbarrow and that is used to move things from one place to another.One other tool is a skim shovel that is used to carefully remove a thin layer off the artifact.The last tool is the trowel and is used to scrape things. The ferry farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved.The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities.Kids can explore the site even.This challenges kids to solve puzzles about the work being done at ferry farm.That is the end of that summary.

For example if you pick and shovel you are using it for digging clues that people of long ago have hid. You can also use the nife to scrape off the dust that have been all over the place and covered many clues. After all being an archeologists is not that hard.       An archeologists found many things in Washington's house all the years ago. The archeologists use the skim shovel to remove layers of soil, at one time. The discovery of Washington's home was important because, it gives citizens clues to let them know who was he before he became famouse. The archeologists also found clues that Washington had made his decisions he had made.       The archeologists started studying about Jamestown Rediscovery Archeologists Project. Many people for over 200 years thought that that fort had been washed away by a river. Archeologists found some hints that the fort will still be around. First archeologists found some weapons and armor. Then they discovered the floors of buildings, after a while archeologists found the place where the fort was build. Last they found that the peices of the fort and found many clues.

Well if you do it's hard because you have to find the right location. First you have to search for miles. Then when you find it you have to get ready to dig and find things. Finally you start digging and keep digging until you find something.              It's  also easy sometimes if you were digging a long time you could find something. If you like dinosaurs you could proabaly find the bones of one. You could get a promotion if you find a lot of things.Like they found both Jamestown and George Washington house. Plus you could use a easier tool.                  So if you want to be one remember it's hard and easy. So now you know about archeologists.                 	NNS VBP PRP VB TO VB DT NNS .

The fort was built around the start of the 16th century to protect a river entering the mainland of the new land that had been claimed. But in a more recent seach to find out more about this time of history the National Park Service sent out teams of up to 35 people in a team to find more about this fort.                   The teams found many amazing things like pottery, tools, and coins. They also found trash, like the bones of animals that the colonists had eaten. That investigation also gave us more information about the attack of the Powhatan tribe. It also told us of how they built things back in those times like, all the cellers, burial sites, and the foundatoins of 10 buildings inside the boundries of the fort.

I think a good way to find out if the fort was still in the area was to just dig.Maybe the if a giant storm did something to the fort it probably didn't do much damage like knocked it over the.The thing is that nobody will ever know for sure because it happened a long time ago,but here is the following things they could of used to keep everyone knowing about what happened.         keep a log book and pass it down threw your family talk to people about it allot! ask your teacher to teach the class about it           The one thing that is for sure is that some of the things in the fort MUST have decomposed because    mostly every thing on earth.the fort is probably under ground or maybe not.Then in 1861 the team of archeologists finally found it!it was a amazing discovery i think it was the best one ever found because forts are just so big and with the army it had to make it a even bigger fort.                                            DIGGING UP GEORGE WASHINGTON'S PAST               History tells us about George Washington wail he was a soilder and a president,but now we know about him when he was a child.When he was a child george's father moved to a land know as ''ferry farm'',at the time george was just six when his father moved there.The building that washington family lived in was long gone be time people wanted to find it.So because of that they had to find the stone base that was under the house so then they can find the house.Then in 2003 they found it because of the stone under the house they found the slave quarters,kithen and storage houses/shed.           the team also needed prof that the house that they found was the washingtons house. the team of archeologists knew that george washington had a fire in his home so thy looked for burnt thing like burnt chairs from the kichen or a burnt wagon.Then they found a burnt peace of potery so they then knew it was george washingtons house.           the team had to dig very carfuly so they didn't break any thing.they had to use 3D maps on computers to find so they can track whats under ground and the data would record the data and give it to the diging crew so they can VERY carfuly.Then they find the house,but they need proof so they find thing from the washingtons.                                                            TOOLS USED BY ARCHEOLOGITSTS                      PICK AND SHOVEL:   The pick and shovel method is a great way to start a dig.   You can use the pick axe to hit and break rocks and the   you can use the shovel to dig out dirt,and on earth there   allot of dirt and rock to get out of the way.                 WHISK AND DUSTPAN:   The whisk and dust pan is used for getting out just little bits   of dirt.this is use to get dust of things.Or rocks that's why you   need the dust pan part because some of the rocks might be   important so with both you can get rocks and dust off.               KNIFE:   You can use the knife to get dirt off of the artfact or scrape   the ground when you think your very close.                      WHEELBARROW:   The wheelbarrow is use for geting out of the area and big rocks   out of the way and if you have a big artafact then this is the perfict tool   to use.

The knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof  of the fort.That's when                                             the found James fort!The first thing they found was a set of mark on ground.Today, the                                                  group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The information learned from these objects                                            helps us understand how the people in the Jamestown fort lived. It's exciting to discover                                            objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of year ago.

You have to dig research the place you are digging at but it can also be cool like if you find something really neat and cool you get proud of your self for finding it.As an archeologist finding artifacts can be so sweet.     All the tools you use as an archeologist can be very useful like the whisk.The whisk is very useful for archeologist because it can wipe off dirt on any object a archeologist finds.The pick and shovel can be very useful because the shovel can dig up a artifact a archeologist finds.The pick can be useful because if you run into a rock or something you use a pick to brake it.The job of a archeologist is hard and fun.

One archeologist was searching for the secrets of James fort in Jamestown, Virginia. In the paragraph it says that for over 200 years people thought that the fort  got washed away by the flowing river.Some discoveries gives clues that the fort might still egoists. By the way the fort was built in 1607.             Since the fort was built near the river and people docked their so it made sense to stay their at the fort.The fort was located further so the new spot gave more protection from enemy ships. also the the first subjects were found in 1861.             The next Archeologist i'm going to talk about is who searched for George Washington's past he found out in his search that people lived in Ferry farm for 12,000 years!and that his father moved their family when he was only six. Even though the house he lived in is gone people belive that the stone base is still their.the team started digging in 2003. In the paragraph it says that the first building found was the kitchen then the slave quarters after that was the storage houses.

With us at this moment.            Second of all the kids that are doing the reserch should be serching for as many possible things that they could find.Because there suposed to do the best they could do. Because they need a good grade.                  Third of all they should be going to the libary to do reserch like on George Washington . the first presadebt of the united states of america .And thats the story abut the fifth grade class.

People in the past maked baskes,pots,and stacus.They get barred or dropped and people in the future find it and they know what happed in the past.         A lot other countrys have artifacts that know one knew were it is at. Every coutry has very valuble artifact like golden rings or diamond necklessess.Archeologists used pickaxe, shovels,skim shovels,knife,and a Trowel. A pickaxe is a like a shovel but it mines hard rocks.A skim shovel was used to remove little layers  of dirt. Thowes were some of the things archologists do.

George Washington had a not so good childhood, but however things are about to change.           George Washington and his family moved to a land known as the Ferry Farm. Thousands of people lived there. He was just six years old when they built a house there. No one knew exactly where the Washington house was, since the building was long gone. Archeologists believed that the base under the house was still there, it took a year to find it but they did. Records show that there was a fire at the Washington's house.           The discovery of George Washington's home is important for many reasons. It gives citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington is today. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans,.

They also have many special tools they use for their digs. Archeologist find many cool artifacts. Artifacts are anything that was made or used in the past. They do their digs at various places that were important in the past. It might be at James Fort, George Washington's house, or maybe they are looking for dinosaur fossils.                      Archeologist are separated into three teams with up to 35 people. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. This information is used to get a look of what the area looks like before team two starts digging. Team two is the team that does the digging and gets the artifacts out of the ground. The archeologist start the dig with a skim shovel. This shovel is flat, small, and sharp. This makes it so it can remove different, thin layers of soil one at a time. Then they place it in a box with a half inch screen at the bottom, so dirt can fall out with the artifact still in. They also use other tolls besides for the skim shovel, like the trowel, pick and shovel, wheelbarrow, and more.              Archeologist jobs take a long time to do. If an archeologist rushed his or her work at the dig than they could brake very valuable objects that help us figure out the story of the past, history. The National Park Service led a five-year study to figure out how the land on which Fort James was on, was used. Five years is a long time, but it is worth it to archeologist who do the work. To plot the land, carefully dig for artifact, and to identify what they are takes a long time.              Now you know why they archeologist dig, to find artifacts. You also know how they dig, in three teams with up to 35 people. Another thing you know is what they dig with, many different tools. If I had the job of an archeologist, I would either want to be the team at the dig or the archeologist who plot the dig on their computers. I would want to be a person at the dig because I like using pick, and I want to try to use a skim shovel. I would also want to be one of the people plotting the dig out because it sounds fun using the 3D computers. No matter how much fun it is, being an archeologist is a tough job.

There job is also important because that have to dig.They have to dig until they find something.They are the ones who find all the intersting things that happen in th past.They also nedd to find the right stuff to dig and find stuff.They sometimes stay days to find something.They also have to find the rifght spot to dig at. They have to use a lote of tools like a pich,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,and so many other thind.            The archeologist are the people who find all those enteresting things that are at the museumes.If it wasn't for them  we would not have museumes because thanks to there work we have stuff in the museums.The stuff in the museums are really interesting.They use alot of souces to help them find things.They help use a lot and thank for their jobs and hard working we now know lots of stuff from the past.Thats why archeologist jobs are important.

With the items they find we can learn more about are past and important events and people in history. Archeologists use many tool to help them with their work. If we didn't have archeologists much of what we know today we would not.              Two big archeological findings were the discovery of James Fort and of George Washington's childhood home. In 1994 James Fort was discovered in Jamestown, Virginia. First they found marks in the ground then they realized it must have been bigger then they thought. Now they find nearly 1 million objects a year from James Fort. They found George Washington's childhood home in 2003. First they found some smaller buildings. Then the main structure. They found pipes and burnt pottery that supported their thoughts that the house had suffered a fire. Now they have activities there to educate people on the house's history. Thanks to these discoveries we know more about history.            Now you have learned about two important digs you need to learn about the tools they use. They use a pick and shovel to dig close to artifacts, so they won't be damaged. They use a whisk to clear of artifacts and a knife to remove dirt from them. They use a wheelbarrow and a thin shovel for careful work. They use alot of tools and each one has a certain job.           Over all being an archeologist is hard work, but there are people who go out there and help us understand history. Now we have learned alot from them.

It matters what kind you are though.For example a dinosaur archaeologist has to do alot of researching on the bones to find out what kind of dinosaur it is. archaeologists guested the past like 400 years or more years ago then, they find out.            There are other archaeologists like the ones who finds the fossils. The other archaeologists Just research the things scientists bring back and been checked. They have to enter it into the system so, its in and memorized. After it is in the system it goes to an storage where the Archaeologists put it.             I think I would enjoy being an Archaeologist when I'm older. It sounds like a fun job to me. Although it would be challenging digging up the fossils and old rocks. My uncle works for an Archaeologist I would love to work with my uncle. Archaeologists are still trying to figure out the past like when Abe Lincon was president. They are still finding dinosaur bones. The bones will never run out.            A true Archaeologist would get the date, time, and year when they found the fossil, body, and ect. Archaeologists are still digging up the dinosaur's path of life. The Archaeologists are trying to figure out why the dinosaurs died.                Overall it is an exiting, fun, and amazing job. You would love it if you like Social Studies/History. I would do it for a living because it is fun discovering dinosaur bons/fossils.

Archaeologist found the first artifacts from Fort James in 1861. They found armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of Fort James. A 100 years later people started trying to find the exact spot where the fort was built.They first thing that the archaeologist found was marks on the ground that showed where the walls used to be. The archaeologist heard stories and made drawings that lead them to relize that the fort was triangle shaped. They discovered that the fort stretched all the way to the river. At the river they foundledges that were designed to hold cannons.They also found 11cellars, many burial sites and 10 building all inside the fort. Today archaeologist fing almost 1,000,000 objects each year. In the area archaeologist found the trash that the settlers threw away. Some of the things found were animal bones of the animals that they ate. The archaeologist found many objects that were used everyday hundreds of years ago.      Next we are going to talk about the George Washington house. Archaeologist started digging in 2003. It took them over a year but they had found the kitchen, slave quaters, and storage houses. They did not find the main farm house untill a few years later.      Lets talk about just archaeology now. First there are 3 teams. 1 team can consist of 35 people. The first group makes a map on 3D computers. The maps help the people who actually dig know where they are going and how deep they are going to dig. The  second team is the team who digs up the artifacts. The third team is the people who later study the artifacts in a lab. Some of the tools that archaeologist use are pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Each one of the tools does something different.       Now you know a little bit about archeaology and what archeologist do.

To study about archeologists.This all started when a little girl named April got this plan to start history day. I really thought this was a great idea   so I took the plan and said yeah i'll do it.                 One day I was wondering if I can go to school on saturday school   So I did and I got there, and I had to get my form and so I did. but an-   yways, I was thinking if we can do some school event but I didn't no what type of event...but my sis April took my idea and said 'Hey guys   why dont we have a day called history it's so cool that you can study   indiana jones' BUT I SAID THIS! 'Hey why dont study about superheros!!!' John said 'No we wanna study about archeologests.' So i got angry like an angry bird, but i accepted it anyway. But we went on on field trip heres the beginning of the story...             The middle of the story was us going to alaska  we learn so much things there that I screamed like a hawk so that remains as of the stor-   y thats all...

The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river.Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.                                                                                                                                              The fort was built in 1607 when settlers come from England to start a new life.Most believed that James Fort was built the near the river.It was easier to dock ships there,so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort the fort was located further away. the new spot probably gave the settlers more protections from enemy ships.

So I have some questions. The thing I have always wanted to know was how do you know where things are hiding at. One more question do you use any kind of device like a (GPS) system or something like that.                Archeologists use special tools to either dig for new things, to dig up soil,and to carry thins from one place to another place.                Archeologists are people who study things from the past for example: uncovered armor and weapons. They find from the past like old pottery.Such like other people study other things.

They have to find a place to dig and use the right tools to do so.            When archeologists first started looking for Fort James, they designed a project. This project was called 'The Archeological project' 200 years ago, Fort James was washed away by the river that washed up against it. Archeologists still have hope that object ,ight still be around the area.                 The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists found armor and weapons. To find these items they had to use whisks and dust pans. Plus, to get away all the dirt they had to use wagons.They now had help from the national park which helped alot! Archeologists think that more items are still around the area of Fort James.             They did it! They finally found Fort James. They worked hard and it really payed off! To find Fort James they saw a set of marks. Inside, there were paintings that someone had drew and maps that showed Fort James spread!             I think it is fascinating to discover objects that were once abandoned by humans. Archeologists work very hard to do their job!

By: Chloe Forssell                 Have you ever wondered what an archeologist does? Ever thought that maybe you would like to be an       archeologist one day? In this report you will learn about the job of an archeologist. You will discover the good sides       of being one, and also the bad. You will learn things you have never known about digging bones, artifacts, and more!       Does this interest you? Read on to learn more!             What is an archeologist? An archeologist is somebody who digs and discovers artifacts, which are items that give       us glimpses of the past. In the artical, Finding Fort James, it describes archeologists as,'...people who discover       uncovered armor and weapons...', which is true. Those who take this job have a lot of responsibility, holding keys to       hundreds of years ago. To learn about all the good and bad of being an archeologist, read on.             When taking the job of an archeologist, you also take responsibility. To this responsibility, there is good and bad.       If you decide that this is the job for you, you will enjoy digging in the dirt on hot days. Some though, wouldn't preferr       these conditions. Another thing to consider is whether you would like to do this every day. Other jobs may offer       oppurtunities that you do new things everyday, but some may enjoy routine. Being an archeologist means you have       to follow the system, and if you dont, then you might mess it up for the entire team. In the text it reads,'...the first     team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground... ...another team focuses on the actual       digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig... ...diggers also use a process called troweling.       Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to 2       weeks. I c                 	VBG IN NNP .

Many archeologists find fossils and every so often they might find a city that was buried underground hundreds even thousands of years ago.                One interesting Rediscovery was the one of James town in 1994 a group of people started the Jamestown rediscovery group project that group was designed to discover the secrets of FortJames for over 200 years people had thought that FortJames had been washed away by a river. the fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people believed that FortJames was built near a river so it was easier to dock ships there. However the group discovered items nearby and found out that the fort was built further away the new spot probably gave them more protection from enemy ships. The first items were found in 1861 when archeologists found weapons and armor they also discoverd floors of buildings. Over a 100 years later a group effort tried to find the exact spot where the fort was located. The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to find out how it was used. When they made a mapping of the software for the area Eureka! that's when they found it they found ledgest that were supposed to hold cannons they found dozens of burials and today they nearly fin 1 million objects.              Another expedition was the Digging up of George Washington. Most of what we know about him is his presidency and fighting in the American Revolution many biographies dont have much information about him as a child. But everything will change because recent discoveries show that his home as a child might help archeologists learn about him as a child. Many people lived on the land called ferry farm so of course George Washington's dad moved his family there. Know one knew where they exactly lived because the house had been long gone however archeologists believed that the stone floor of the house was still there the group started digging in 2003 it took over a year but eventually found it.ther firstrooms they found were the kitchen the slave quarters and storage houses, the found the main farmhouse a few years later. Four other houses had been built on ferry farm they found out that they had a fire in their house so they checked and they found burnt pottery part of a clay pipe and Washington smoked clay pipes so that is more proof it was the right house.          Some of the tools the archeologists used were the pick and the shovel most digs were started with these tools. A whisk and a dust pan they were used to brush away dirt. knife used for careful digging around objects. a wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another and lots of dirt. a skim shovel used to carefully remove dirt. trowel used to cut different layers of soil.

Or what job you may want to do? Well today I am going to tell you all about what an archeologist does for a living, and how they do it.            Archeoloy is the study of fossils and old arifacts. An archeologist is a person who studies fossils and old artifacts. In other words, archeology is just the study of old objects that were dug up and dusted off.            First, they find something that they may be interesed in finding more about, like dinosaurs. They sudy them and read all sorts of books about them and learn the different names and bones. They have to make sure they know almost everything about that topic. To be able o dig up these creatures they have to do a lot of researching. The research what they ate, what they looked like, their bones, where they lived, and so on.They had to know all of this because when it came time to dig they had to know which animal, and where to find it.              The next step is getting together the right tools, and finding out where to dig. Once again they have research about where to find hey animal(s) and what tools to use. You dont want to show up to the digging spot with only a shovel and a wheelbarrow. They need to bring a pick and a shovel,to start your dig. A whisk and a dustpan, for brushing off he artifacts, and a knife for scraping dirt from around the artifacts. They also need a skim shovel,  trowel, and a wheelbarrow. To find the right spot is the hardest. You have to research where they lived and may have died.            Lastly, the archeologist goes to the sight, finds where to dig with a computor, and starts digging. When they find something they usually dig carefully around it, then dust it off. When they have made a discovery they may sell it, or give it to a museum.               In conclusion archeology is a very hard job, and being an archeologists is very hard, and important too. This report may make this job sound easy, but it is actually the opposite. It is a challenge and some archeologists don't find many things. If ou like challenges and hard work this might just be the job for you! If you hinks it's just cool and want to see some fossils, go to a museum and look at all he shells and fossils they have. Some museums actually have a sound proof, glass room where you can see reakl archeologists dustin and cleaning some fossils! Here's what I want you to do, try some activities, have our parents bury some oys in a sand box and have you find them. It migh actually be more fun than its sounds to you!

Most of the time archeologists study from 5-10 years or more on a site, such as the one they studied about George Washington. They started digging in 2003, and over a year later, they found up to three rooms. They were the kitchen, the slave quarters, and storage houses. They had heard that there was a fire that happened in the Washington house, and they needed proof that this plantation was actually Geaorge Washinton's house. After lots of digging, the archeologists found burnt pottery, and parts of a clay pipe. Since George Washington smoked clay pipes, it was now obvious that this plantation had belonged to the Washingtons.      Usually on digging sites, there are a big number of teams/groups. There can be up to 35 people on a team!  Archeologists use up to six sets of tools. They are the Pick and Shovel, which most digs start with these tools, used to dig in the earth close to the artifacts. Second there's the Whisk and Dustpan, used to brush the dirt off the artifacts and items gently. Third there's the knife, used for careful digging and used to get the dirt out from hard to reach places. Fourth there's the Wheelbarrow, used to move objects and artifacts away from the site or to carry dirt out of the site. Fifth, there's thw Skim Shovel, which is a shovel with a flat surface used to ccarefully remove thin layers of dirt and/or soil with each scoop. Finally there's the Trowel, which is probably the most common tool used by archeologists, used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. And that is what archeologists do.

Archeologists are very important people and if you want to help 'dig up the past' and work hard digging into the ground I would suggest being an archeologist for your future job.       Archeologists in in Jamestown in 1994 were trying to discover the secrets of their James Fort in Virginia. Everyone thought it had been washed away by a river but maybe some new discoveries may be made.The fort was built in 1607. The first objects were found in 1861 uncovered armors, weapons, and floors of a building.  The National Park Service led a five-year study of the land. Thats when they finally found James Fort! They first found marks of where the walls used to be, and they found stories and drawings that made the archrologists know that it was shaped like a triangle. Today they find nearly 1 million objects each year that includes pottery tools, or coins. It is very exciting to discover new things that were used hundreds of years ago.      Have you ever heard of Ferry Farm? A lot of people jave lived there but archeologists just found out that George Washington used to live there! When the archeologists dug up there they found a lot of things that George Washington used. They split up into groups, one digging, one getting the objects out of the dirt, and another trying to find out what the artifacts are. The dicovery of Washington's home is very important because you can understand who George washington was, the desisions he made, and the life that he lived. Maybe you can help dig up George Washington's artifacts when you grow up.       Archeologists need tools to 'dig up the past'. The most important tools are the pick and shovel because they dig up the dirt so that you can find the artifacts. They also use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifact and clear away dirt. Archeologists use knives to scape dirt away from around the artifact, and a wheelbarrow to carry dirt away so that they can dig more. Some extra tools are a skim shovel and a trowel to remove dirt. The archeologists need a lot of tools to do their work so if you like tools an archeologist would be a good job for you.      All in all an archeologist is a very helpful and interesting job.  If you like finding cool things, using tools and getting dirty, an archeologist is a good job for you. I hope that after you read this you will think of being an archeologist as your future job!

They are important for many reasons because George Washington took part during the American Revolutionary War and Fort James was in Jamestown,Virginia where it was one of the first settlements in North America for England.                      George Washingtons father, Augustine Washington, moved his family to Ferry Farm at the age of 6. Archeologists believed that the stone base under George Washingtons house is still there. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section!The discovery of Washingtons home is important. First, it gives the citizens of the U.S. a better perspective of Washington and his family before and after he became famous. Another, because it tells of a life of a Colonial American and how they lived.Clearly, the dicovery of his past is quite important.                     Fort James was built around 1607. When settlers had arrived there they thought that it was near water. So it was easier to dock ships there. The new spot gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships. Fort James was located at Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years people had thought that it was washed away.In 1994, a group of people became intrested in this fort and started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The very first object that they had found was in 1861. When they had first discovered James Fort they had found a set of marks on the ground.Its swampy low lands made them leave and find a better settlement to make crops. Clearly, its was a good and bad place to settle in.                All in all, it is exciting to dicover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. And it gives us a piece of knowledge and information about are past and ties us to the people who firsted started the American Colonies.Into what is know today The United States of America.

An archaeologist is a person who studies the artifactsof long ago. They use facts from the artifacts to solve long ago mysteries.\              They helped solve the mysteries of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia and solved the mysteries of George Washington's childhood. These people use specific tools to solve the mysteries. Some examples of tools are the pick, shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.              To solve a mystery, the archaeologists must follow these steps in order to make   a big discovery. Before the archaeologists start digging, they use 3D computer models to see what is underground carefully. Then, the archaeologists can start digging. First, the   archaeologists must use the tools very carefully to find any antiques that are very small. They use big sifters to carefully observe the small antiques. Once they find treasues that proves what happened long ago, they will have solved the mystery on what they wanted to solve.                 They just don't dig just like that. They must dig very, very carefully. It can even take two weeks to dig and sift through a 25-square-foot-section. By what these artifacts means is how long ago was important was long ago.               So as you can see, an archaeologist has a very important job. They use common sense and other things to prove about the world.                                                                                 	NNS WP VBZ DT NN .

Now I am going to tell information about digging up George Washingtonians past.George Washington's dad,Augustine Washington,moved his hole family to a different place.No buddy really knew ware exactly  George's family lived.the archeologists started digging facts about George Washington in 2003.It took them over a year to dig up the facts about George Washington.               Now I an going to tell you what archeologists has to do in there job.they have to dig up all the information that they can and turn it into there boss.but that's not all they have to dig up.they have find like all the houses that people lived in the old days and get all the information out of there.but that's not all either they have to search on the internet sometimes to search the information but they don't use the internet they're not lazy the get up and go out and explore.

The project was desingned to bulit a fort that was the secret of James fort in Jamestown in Virginia. Peopel thought that the fort was built.The fort was not built peopel thought that is was built.       In 1607 the fort was built the settlers came from England to start a new life.Most believed that James fort was built near the river.

You know what they discovered?They discovered George Washington's past and where he used to live in.They even knew what happend to the house.They even say that there was a fire in his house.Thet found pieces of burnt pottery.They also found part of a clay pipe.They knew that George Washington smoke clay it pipes,so gives more chances that,that was the right house.             The archologists use alot of things.For example they use pick and a shovel.They use it to dig.They also use a whisk and adustpad.They use it to brush dirt of the artifacts and clear away from the excavatory site.They use the knife.They use it for careful digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts.They also use the wheelbarrow.Used move items.Archeologists use towels and askim shovel.A trowel used to scrape and cut to view the diffrent layers of soil.The skim shovel used to carefully removed a thin layer of soil with each scoop.

Digging was in the past now it came back so achreologists try to dig for the information like this the crown whos is it lets find out the information plus lets say a rich person was in the ground barried like selena now thats information you haft to find out by.

Riches arcologists made gold,jewelry,pottery,they made that stuff because they needed to survive on the stuff they made that helped them also they made that stuff because some people would buy it also because some people would wear it also they made jewelry like, necklaces,earings,bracelantes,and more pottery was made for many thing also .   soilders and president they practice and studied for becomming a soilders they worked hard on fighting against people in the war. for becomming president they had to try their best and take things serious in life .

I think it would take a year to figure out were the the famous people stoff are underground. It takes two weeks to dige twenty-four feet to find a house underground.Archeologist find more imformation the guy their finding and they right a book telling everybody about to know.             3     People all over the natune people discover everything everyday. George Washington lived in ferry farm were people discover his pipe. Archeologist discover that a stone bass under george house was still their.The first building they found was the kitchen,slave quarter,and a storage house a few years later they found a farmhouse .                4     At least four other houses have been built on the ferry farm land,so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washington farm house. The diggers found pieace of burnt pottery. This suggests a fire occurred there. they also found parts of a clay pipe.So this discovery gives more proff it is th right house that he lived in.                5  Some archeologist are peared in teams so they could find more imformation abaut george. They found stoff when george was only six years old. A fewer house was built when george lived there.Now we know George smoke clay pipe.                6     People have lived on the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000 years. Hes location is a great place to built houses on top of them. Some of the people thst lived in george town was found underground                 7 Their was alot of stoff fond underground of george. They found his clay pipe. The first objet that was found in 2003 of george was put in musum.

Archeologist study many things such as bones,and treasure, and really anything. Archeologist had many jobs to do such as not breaking the artifacts while trying to get it out of the dirt, or finding the artifacts that takes a long time. And the most important part of being and archeologist is making sure it is an artifact and someone didn't just put it under ground. Archeologists have a big job they need to stay on topic and and focus on what they are doing if they don't they could get very hurt or loose there teaser that would not be good at all.         when an archaeologist finds something they don't just pick it up because it could break really easy and it cold have bugs and other thing on it. you have to pick it up with great care or else the terser will just be a wast of time finding, Being an archeologist does not mean you get to keep the treasure actually you take it to a test lab and many people will study it and its really cool and can be fun at times. The job of an archeologist can be fun but also really tiring and maybe even stressful.         When an archeologist finds something they study it with bare eyes and then they bring it to a lab and study it and most of the time the artifacts they find are stuff from many, many, many years ago and now in days we have cameras that can see under ground without digging first that helps them look at the artifact before digging, they also have boxes that they scoop dirt up and put it in the box and there is a thing at the bottom where the dirt falls out and the artifacts stay in the box then they collect it and bring it to the lab. when they get to the lab and do tests on it.       Before archeologist can study artifacts they have to make sure its clean so they can put it in a museum. archeologist have a very important job because without them we would not have known so much about people in the past and without knowing what people have done for us to become a country would not have been good we need to learn about are history and more. People thing that archeologist have a easy job but they don't they have a very hard job when i read 'finding fort James' i realized they don't have an easy job and they work really hard. When i think of an an archeologist I think of a person who study diansor bones but they actually study more than that like pots and pans from when gerorge washington was alive they can learn stuff from that. Archeologist have an inportant job in life and it would be hard withoute them.

I think a job of an archeologist is very exciting in my opinion I think the job of an archeologist can be hard and busy.  Archeologist are people who look for artifact of ancient people during the past.  Sometimes archeologist want to know what weapons looked like in the past,  the first weapons found by archeologist were found in 1861,  the archeologist discovered or uncovered a armor and weapons.  The job of the archeologist can discover many things from ancient time or history.                In 1994 people were interested of studying the past of Jamestown,  people wanted to find and study the James Fort in Jamestown.  So researchers look and studied about them for years until they can find the James Fort in Jamestown.  But suddenly after five years of studying the area of where the James Fort was the archeologist finally found the James Fort.  Right after when they found the James Fort they saw some sets of marks on the ground, the marks showed on the fort were drawings and shapes like triangles.  It would have been an amazing experience  for archeologist to the James Fort in Jamestown, years ago.  For archeologist they had to search the area for at least five or more years until they can look for artifacts or find the James Fort. It must have been many years to find the James Fort in Jamestown.           Did you know that today archeologist finds at least one million artifacts each year wow thats alot it takes people from all over the world to find that many many artifacts each year.  The object include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.  During the late 1600s people would throw aways things down a anused well or a big pit,  while todays archeologist dig they find the trash from settlers that they threw away, an dincluding bones of animals they ate.  The information or artifacts that the archeologist find is very important, they find srtifsct so srcheologist can understand how people lived during this time in Jamestown.

The way archeologist do this is they work together as in team work and they us the right tools such as a pick and shovel it helps the archeologist dig into the earth close to the artifacts another one is a whisk and dust pan it is used to brush off all the dirt when the artifact is found.           Archeologist are very important in life there probably/wouldn't be any history or biographies on famous people now! People would be remarked and joyful to know about different thing that happen long ago in our world such as Rosa Parks people would be interested in knowing about there life time if they already don't know! to me it is extraordinary to learn about the one who brought great pride to the world mainly famous people to know that you've been a child and went through the same thing famous people went to is amazing. some times archeologist may involve in famous people privacy that went on a long time ago thought so you better watch out.       I would think being an archeologist is wonderful you get to learn new things that you never knew before about the past that happen to those are our now gone that happen to you in the past if I was an archeologist I would love to find all different kids of Artifacts that had been there ago such as old dolls and windmills and particles of maybe Furniture that was torn from. an archeologist job is never done there are many famous people out here to figure out what happened to that person, and that person life it should always be wonderful an amazing to figure out what happen to that famous person ant happen to you as a child growing up its outstanding. If you were an famous person who was long gone and was up in heaven wouldn't you want someone to find something you had while grown up.       Another way the archeologist work is they call on a group of archeologist from maybe around the world and they try to find they exact spot where the famous person like Rosa parks home was built in the beginning did you know they use about (5 -maybe 10), form recent discoveries it helps they archologist know more about that famous persons life and more about there childhood                             	DT NN IN DT NNP VBZ RB VBG DT NN VBZ TO RB VB RP WP VBN IN DT JJ IN NNS WP VBP RB VBN VBG JJ WP VBD JJ WP DT NN VBP VBZ PRP VBP IN RB JJ NNS CC JJ IN DT NN NN CC PRP VBP RB TO DT NN CC WRB PRP VBD TO VB CC JJ RP NNS WDT VBP RB RB NN EX NN NN TO DT NNP NNP NN NN VBP DT VBZ PRP VBP RP IN IN NN NN CC PRP PRP DT NN NNS JJ IN DT NN CC NN PRP VBZ DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN TO DT NNS DT CD VBZ DT NN CC JJ NN PRP VBZ VBN TO VB RP DT DT NN WRB DT NN VBZ NNP NNP VBP RB JJ IN NN EX MD RB VB DT NN CC NNS IN JJ NNS RB .

People who go to museums and see all the old things like dinosaur bones or really old pots are dig up somewhere by archeologists. Some archeologists focuss on getting one thing at a time. Anyways, Im gonna tell you about the job of an archeologist.                    Archeologists are people who dig up anchent realics and put them in museums so they can earn money for themselfs. Some archeologists don't get payed as much as others do because they do find as valuable things as others do. they might get payed $2,000 a year as others get payed about $5,000 a year.               Alot of the archeologists in NC are the ones who get $2,000 a year but, at least they get payed. some people don't get payed as much as they should. I think alot of the people who get payed $2,000 don't work as hard as they should. But thats my opinion. So back to the topic. Some archeologists are really serious about their job. Most of them are. And some of them aren't.              So thats what I wrote about archeologists. I hope you liked it.

Each team uses different plans to get what they had to do don.               Their are 3 teams that work one team scans the ground for artifacts and another teams digs it up and the other team that digs it up is called a dig. When the dig finishes they give it to the last team to research the item they found. Each team works a different part they use different equipment to do it like the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and trowel.                          These were equipment that they used to dig things out or to Carey the artifacts to different grops so they can do each of there part. Each team takes a different part in this but they are all in the same grop.  This was a writing about archeologists and how they work together.

It would be interesting because, you would find the remains of people.  You would also get to find old things we dont use today.  Maybe you can find things that may fetch a high price.  You could also find a one of a kind object.  You could go around the world to places you've never been to before.  You never know what you'll find and how you find it.  You get to use all these weird tools that work in an awsome way.  Some may seem familar but bring a big impact to the dig.  For people that are careful and like discovering new things this is something they might be interested in.  Any one that likes the dirt, digging you name it they might like this.  If you like getting your hands dirty this might be your thing.  This is a  great exspearence for children.  Personally I think this is a chance to learn something new.  You can try it and might even like it.  And try it again to get a feeling of if you want to do this.  You can find new things and name it what ever you want.  It does take time and paishents anything you find will be worth th wait.  This is all I have to say( for right now) so these are the reasons why I would want to become a archeologist.

Of the guys shananigs and where is he now probley dead Mr.king was trying to make change the guy was trying to make a kill. Was he going to get payied I have no clue mabe he was going to get payied but I don't know what was going on with this guy was he looney in the head, ok but like I was saying if the archeologist did'nt  find any information then. I would never know about aything on Mr. king thats why we need archeheologist please don't kill the archeologist then we won' know any thing about famousb people anymore.

I think a archaeological could not be a good job for old mans because it is to hard to be on the ground for old mans.For example old mans could get hurt and taken to the hospital. I think it could be good for young people like in the 20 because they can bind down and old people can't bind down like young people can bind down In working like archaeological you will need tools just like pick and shovel ,whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and trowel.

For example finding fort james, in 1994,a group of people interested in studying the past started the james Rediscovery Archeological Project.For 200 years, people thought that the fort had washed away in a river.       Another interesting thing they discovered was Digging up George Washington's Past. The thing that makes it interesting is no one knew exacly where the Whashington home was located since the actual building was long gone.the first thing they found was athe kitchen, the slave quarters, and storage houses.And then they found the farmhouse a few years later.At least four other houses have been built there on the ferry farm land,so diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washington's farmhouse. they say that records show the Washington farmhouse had a fire in there house.       I hope you like learning about stuff from the past that archeologists discover and learn.

Now let's get to the good part of this report,  An Archeologist is a person who finds fossils of animals who lived long ago,  like a Dinosoar,  or a Woley Mamath!  Or just a regular animal that we know today.  Archeologist's sometimes go to the desert, or moutains, and other places they go to find fossils!             The tools that Archeologists use is, a pick and shovel, that most digs start with these two tools.  Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.  A whisk and dustpan, used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.  A knife, used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.  A wheelbarrow, used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.  A skim shovel, a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layor of soil with each scoop.  And a trowel, this is probably the most common tool in archeology.  Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.  These tools help Archeologists in many many different ways!             And this is the job of an Archeologist, and what they do, and what tools they use for the finding of fossils and scraps of any thing or animal that is left behind.  And remember if you want to become this amazing person make sure that you do an excelent job and school, keep up the good work, and never give up your dreams to be an Archeologist!

For a long time people thought that the fort in Jamestown was washed away from the waves. They aso thought that it was really close to the shore.               The first object found in Jamestown was in 1861. The National Park Sevice led a five year group to scout the areafor all different kinds of things that went from weapons to potary to bricks. Then they finally found Jamestown with the help of maping computers.Today groups of up to thirty-five people find almost a million pieces of infomation each year.            Archeologists use these things to help them with their work.       Pick and Shovel    Used to start the digging at their digging site.       Whisk and Dustpan   Used to brush all the dirt on the artifacts off the artifacts.       Wheelbarrow   Used to move different items from one place to the other place easier.       Skim Shovel   This shovel is used for gently taking little layers of soil off at a time.       Trowel   This is used to scrape andcut into the soil so the archeologists can get a good view of whats under the soil.             It is easier for the archeologiss to find more hidden things than it was when they first started because they have a lot more things that are high tect right now. It still takes a long time to find all of the artifacts but it's faster than it was when they first started.

They spend most of there time digging in paticalr spots to find out more about famous people and places. You must use a lot of different mattirels to do this job. Because you never know what you are going to come acrossed. You could come acrossed a really old tea cup that George Washington drank out of and you need to get all of that extra dirt off so you would use your whisk and dustpan. Or if there was lots of dirt sticking to the tea cup and it wont come off with the whisk you could use a knife to scrape the dirt off the cup. You will always use every tool at some point. If you came across rocky dirt you can grab out your pick and get threw the rocky dirt in a couple minutes flat.                                        Archeologists help everyone they need to. When they dug at Ferry Farm Land they had to do more digging then you can inmaging to finnd where George Washington's house was. The only way they knew it was his house was because George Washington smoked clay pipes. When they found that the Archeologists  found some burnt pottery.  And that means they figured out omthing new. George Washington's house did have a fire occered.  Archeologists are very hard workers. If you were one i bet you would say being a Archeologists is harder then it looks but it's worth it.                   Or when the time they went to Jamestown to uncover the secerts of Jamestown.  And people had thought the fort had been washed away by the river for 200 years. Around in the 1960's some archeologists found the exacct spot were jamestown was first started. The fort was shaped like a triangle. They made maps and the Archeologists found out that the fort streched all the way to the river.  They also figured out that the river had stones on the ledges of the river designed to hold cannons.                  Archeologists do a lot of cool things for us back then and now. They have somtimes desovered the most instesting things that you could never inmagine to find. A job as a Archeologists may sound a little boring but when you do it im sure you might injoy doing it. When you do you are desovering things for you to know but also for everyone else to. Archeologists are amazing people. Even thow they have to carry around a lot of tools were ever there going to dig they still get to do cool things.

And you can also dig up that person  and research about what that person did to help the united states.Like Haritte Tubman help lead slaves to freedom .And Martin Luther King Jr. told the world he had a dream to help blacks and whites get along whith each other.And Rosa Parks to because rosa parks sat on the bus and the driver said she must move to the back seat or else get thron e in jail and rosa said no and the bus driver called the police.And rosa still wont give up her seat to the white man and when the police came the police officer ask rosa to give up her seat to the white man and rosa sid NO.So the police officer handkuffede her and took her ton jail.And when she got out she never rode the bus again.

These items are used to discover artifacts such as pots, weapons, and sometimes even dinosoar bones.        There are up to 35 archeologists in a team and there is an interesting way to discover artifacts. What they do first is they use a 3D computer that tells you what is underground. Then they dig where the computer said where it was. Sooner or later, the archeologists find the artifact!

However archaeologist believed that the stone base was still under the house. they started digging in 2003 it took a year, but they finally found it. the first thing they found was the kitchen, slves quarters, and storage.They also found the main farm house.they also found brurned pottery so they suggested that the house had a fire.          the archaeologist use 3D computers that can track what is underground.Skim shovel are sharp small flat and is use to dig out layers carefully.

The tools the archeologists use are the basic tools most people have to clean. Their job might be a little hard but they still like it.       Archeologists concentrate on trying to find evidence thhat can help them discover something new about someone. They look in places they think there is something to discover. When they have enough evidence they start observing really close.       To find something new archeologists have to through a few steps. Number one they have to plann what they are trying to find. Number two they have to find evidence. And number three they have to discover something. That is the job of an archeologists.

An archeologogist is a person that sstudys ,looks and finds things from the past. Also is a type of scientist.Some have different jobs like some of them have to find the things and others clean them. the people in the lab that study the things they find.            How did it start? In 1994, there was a group of people that were interested in studying things from the past. They started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeologist Project. That project was made to dicover the secrets of James Fort.             Who are the archeologist ? they are the people that  find things and then we learn more things.they work hard to find things that later we see and study.          	WP VBZ DT NNP .

There is always that excitement of finding a lost artifact. You would always be out in the sun digging with people and having a good time.        Archeology is a very important job. The job keeps museums in business. It also gives us more information on very important history.        There are also bad things about the job of an archeologist. They are almost always not spending time with family. Personally it would be to much of a hassle to move my family around.        Therefore archeology is a well mannered job. Though the job has a down side it is still a very fun and interesting job.

Recently, I read some articles about archeology and how it is used to understand history. The process of digging up objects is long and quite confusing. The steps include digging up objects, cleaning them off, and identifying them. These all need extreme care.              While digging up things, archeologist use pickaxes and shovels to dig up top layers of dirt and stone. The dirt archeologists dig up are transported elsewhere using a wheelbarrow. Another digging tool is the trowel, which is used to scrape and cut different layers of dirt. It is very common. These tools, except for the wheel barrow, are used to dig up artifacts. Artifacts are the objects from a long time ago, that tell us about our past.              After, the archeologists dig up artifacts, the clean them off. The tools they use are the knife and the whisk. The knife is used to scrape off the dirt on an artifact. The whisk is used to brush the dirt off. When using the knife, archeologists must use extreme care so they won't hurt the artifact.              Lastly, archeologists must identify the object to know about their past. There are laboratories for identifying objects. For example, if there is pottery made with a type of clay inaccessible in our part of the world, we could know trading routes for Native Americans. Bones of animals could tell us what type of meat our people ate. In George Washington's house, there were many things. Most of those things could be used to tell about Washington's past.                  In conclusion, an archeologist's work is very confusing. They need to dig up, clean, and identify these artifacts. Although their work is tough, it's worth it to go through it. We learn about our past and what happens in it. 	VBG IN NNP NNP PRP RB JJR WP NN VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ PRP TO VB RP NN .

In, 1994 a group of people called the ''Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeologist Project'' wanted to know about the secrets of James Fort. They designed to discover the secrets of  James Fort. Over 200 years, legend says that peole thought the fort was washed away by a river. Some say that peole still think the fort is underground. In conclusion, the archaeologists wanted to find out the secrets of Fort James.             The fort was built in 1607. Settlers came from England to start a new life. People would built ships, start businesses, and built new homes. They would even grow crops like corn, tabacco, and other crops. It was easier to dock ships there, and settlers choose the spot there. Settlers also started alot of businesses. The spot even gave people the protection from enemy ships. In conclusion, the settlers came from England to James Fort to start a new life.                 The objects were founded located further away from the fort. The achaeologists found the first objects in 1861. They study the objects that uncovered that armor and weapons in James Fort. They discovered it was under the floors of the buildings. The armor and the weapons were used to protect the fort from enemies, who tried to attack the fort. Maybe, the settlers put the armor and the weapons under the floor of the building so no one will still them. Plus, the enemies won't know where they hid the armor and the weapons. In conclusion, they found armor and weapons under the buildings of James Fort.                  Over 100 years, the group found the exact spot where the fort was built. The National Park Service had a five-year study. They were figuring it out how the land was used by the settlers. They need the proof so that it will help them to decide where they would find James Fort. They have been studying using computer mapping software to make the image for the area. Also there using maps and probably to scan the armor and weapons to find  James Fort. In conclusion, they need the proof to find James Fort.                   That's when they found James Fort! The first thing they have to do is find a set of marks on the ground. The second thing, to do is the marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. All the stories peole heard that drawings they made, the archaeologists knew that James fort formed like a triangle. They believed that the settlers used the stone ledges to built over the river. Plus, the designs on the ledges were canons. The most amazing part is, that the archaeologist found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all with the border of the fort.                   In conclusion, today the group found nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children. Plus, in the 1600s, people used to throw their trash in a unused well or into a big pit. All their scarps were there, including the bones of animals they ate.The objects help us learn more information in history and about how the settlers in James Fort lived.

The whisk and dustpan is for brushing the dirt off of the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.To scrape dirt away from the artifacts is the knives. Also there is the wheelbarrow that you would use to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Then theres the skim shovel, you use that to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. And last but not least there is the trowel. It is probaly the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the differant layers of the soil. But they also have to be carefull because you can get hurt from the tools. If you know how to use them right, then you wont get hurt that bad or as much. It is not that easy to work all of that in a day. The archologists would get tired really fast from all of the hard work that they do so much.

Like digging up old stuff, to one person they may think its weird but to another its pretty cool. Its digging up old stuff from a long time ago, like when the first presednt was alive. They dig the stuff up because some of the stuff they find are the stuff that tells them what people wore, or used. Usally they would have to have alot of tools to dig stuff up like that!

You have to plan the digs very carefully and make sure everything is in perfect order.  There are three main groups in archeology with up to thirty-five people in each.        The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.  That information is recorded so that the diggers know what is underground before people started digging.  This was very helpful to the discovery of Fort James.  The archeologists needed a good map of the area, so they used the computer mapping software.  The 3D computers are a very helpful tool when looking for the spot where archeologists want to start digging.        The second team focuses on the actual digging.  The site where diggers dig is called a dig. Those archeologists start digging with a tool called a skim shovel.  A skim shovel has a flat edge and with each scoop removes a thin layer of soil.  When archeologists dug up some artifacts from George Washington's childhood, the first tools they used were skim shovels.  The second tools they used were shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks.        The third and last team works in the lab.  They study the objects that were found.  They have to work very carefully so none of the artifacts would get broken.        I hope you have learned about archeologists and what they do!

Like find how to properly wipe the artifacts and find the past of people and things from the 1700's. I think it would be interesting to be an archeologist because you can find many artifacts about the famos people or even presidents.        The job of an archeologist can find the facts and houses of well-known people. If you would like to be an archeologist I think it would be cool to find Elivis Presley's guitar, house, and clothes.

An archeologist is a person who studies things from thousands of years ago. They dig for fossils and artifacts.  In order for an archeologist to be a good one, he or she must take their time, study hard, and don't give up. Taking this job isn't the easiest task, but if you stick to it, you can get the job done.                                                                                                                                                                                   Taking your time is a big part of being an archeologist. If you don't take   your time, you won't have the correct information for a informational piece. Without the right information, you could easily lose your job. Sometimes people feel like they have the need to rush, but that's not true. If you don't rush life would be a lot easier and safer.                             Studying hard is also a big part of this job. If you didn't study hard you     would again have all of your facts mixed up. If your facts aren't right you are the one to blame if people copy your wrong facts down. When studying, make sure you slow down and read carefully. If you don't, a big price could be payed.     When doing the archeologist job, don'tgive up. Giving up is like just giving up your house because you can't pay rent. That's why you don't rush. Rushing can get you frustrated very quickly.When doing your job take your time and don't get frustrated. In other words, NEVER GIVE UP!                                                                                                                       In conclusion, all of these ways can help you in becoming the perfect archeologist.

If they don't they will lose money. if archeologists don't make money they will go broke. Archeologists have a very hard job.First they have to find the artifacts then they have to dig and find them.

So ten buildings all whithin the border of the fort.  Nearly 1 million of people threw thier trash down a well or a big pit the childrens toys were metal or wood .Some people found cellars. Some settlers threw trash away in there to and even the animals they ate and the bones were in there to.which people ate after they threw it in the big pit or well.So some people used a wheel barrow and shovels to find the stuff.                The people who found everything knew how the people in James Fort lived.The settlers had a little bit of food and they had a difficult years.The stuff they found were hundreds of years ago.the stuff helped them find who did the first people who started the American colonies.The people used a lot of stuff and a duster.

Archeologists even uncover peoples houses, such as George Washshington's house or a house that he lived in when he was a child. Archeologists also uncover dinosaur bones and many other things. They also have teams, there are teams where people dig trenches or holes for other teams to use to discover in the trenches or holes. But to dig or uncover artifacts they use tools.                          Some of the tools they use are; a pick' a shovel, whisk, a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. The use a pick and a shovel to start out with for digging into the ground. They also use a whisk and a dustpan to brush away dirt off of an artifacts or to clear away some dirt from the site. They also use knives to scrape away dirt on they artifacts. Wheel barrows are used to carry dirt away from the site. A skim shovel is used to take off layers of soil with every scoop. A trowel is used to scrape or cut layers to see the different layers.                           Archeologists also use a 3D computer to track find artifacts or to see what is underground. The information is also recorded so the people know what it looked like before and after. Then another team focuses on the digging. This team use skim shovels to dig. These archeologists also use a process called troweling which is when you use trowel, a small shovel, paint brushes.they also use wooden picks to dig up dirt.                            Another team of archeologists work or spend days in a lab studdying the artifacts that were found. The whole process is really slow. But hey its worth it because then we wouldn't know what we found. Even if it was a bone that came from a dinosuar that lived long ago. We also wouldn't know if we found the roof of a house or something else.

They uncovered armor, weapons, and floors of buildings.  They found a set of marks on the ground.  They had found Fort James. They had to use a lot of tools to find it.                                   George Washington was only 6 years old when his family to Ferry Farm.  Nobody knew where George Washington's house actually was.  The digging started in 2003.  They dug for over 1 year and found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.  In a couple years they found the main farmhouse.  The discovery of his home tells us a better description of who he was.                       If you want to be a archeologist, you need to know what to look for.  If you go picking up things you don't know are artifacts, you might be kicked out of the dig.  You also need to know what tools to bring, like a wheelbarrow,or a trowel.  And finally, you need to know where to dig.  If there is a person digging, don't take there spot, find somewhere else to go. That is how you be an archeologists.

They started looking in the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological project . The project was supposed to look for secrets of James fort in Jamestown in virginia.About 200 years ago people have thought that James fort have been washed away. the people still think that there is still secrets there hinding . the fort was built and poeple came to from England to start a new life . It was easier to dock ships so it made more sense to the poeple who would choose the spot.                     However, objects was found nearby these fort that was located further away. These new spots probably gave more protection to the settlers. The first object was found it was amor and weapons and found floors of building. Over 100 years later ,a group effort found the exact spot where the town was built. The national park service led to a five year studing the town.They found proof of the town then putted them on a software .           These people have wanted to know about george washington childhood . So they went to ferry farm where washington lived at over 12,000 years.

They have found pottery and armor. The Ferry Farm was hard to find because four other houses have been built on the land. The archeologist first found a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then they found the main farmhouse a couple years later. Then they found something unbelieveable.             They had found evidence that shows that the house was burnt down. They found burnt pieces of pottery. Then, they found a clay pipe. The clay pipe is more evidence, that that was the right house. Everybody knows about how good of a commander in chief George Washington was. Now people know how and what his childhood was like because of the dig.

But what if the place where he did his last concert burnt down.Then I would use a pick and a shovel to dig.Then I would use a dustpan and whisk in the lab to clean some stuff off.I would probaly use a wheelbarrow to take some heavy stuff away and dirt.And use a knife to cut something open.

There were houses that were built by the water, so if there were intruders they could get their boats and find safety for a little while. People from England wanted to start a new life because they thought they had really good water.      We thought everyone died over the harsh winters because there were little food, but the truth is only a little died but a lot did not. Those who did not die had a hard time but hey eventually made it. Once the winter was over the men had fished for the colony.      People believe that James Fort was like a triangle with canons at every corner, That is not true. It was opened so people could go get water or haunt and stuff like that. They made all kinds of thing bout when they went to the woods they brought a map with them just an      The tools we had to use and still do are... pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim Shovel, and the trowel. It is hard being an archeologists because they might look for years and years before they find anything about history. 	VBG NNP NNP NNP IN DT NN NNS VBD IN NNP NNP VBD VBN , CC DT NN VBZ PRP VBD RB .

Some of the artifacts that they found were weapons and armor. They also found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children. One way archaeologists could have used unusuall aritifacts, is by using them to make inventions.       In the article 'Digging up George Washington's Past' poeple found George Washington's house. I think people should put some of the things from George Washington's house in the museum so other people can see what things they used back then, and they can see how different they looked back then.       The things I think are most interesting are very old artifacts. I think that they are interesting because they can look very different then how things look now. For example: Nowadays, phones have flashights, cameras, games, music, and lots of different cool details. But then, lets say in the 1900's, the phones didn't even have flashights, or games, or any things that the phones we use today have. The old phones might only have a place for you to talk and a place for you to hear what the other person is saying. In my opinion, old artifacts can be very, very, very, very interesting.       One way people can use Picks by pounding on rocks to see what's inside. One way people can use a Shovel is to pick up the dirt and dig down deep to find different artifacts.       One way you can use a Whisk, is to dig the down in the dirt to. Well, you can also use it to sweep it into the Dustpan, then go empty it in the screen.       You can use a Knife to scrape of the dirt of a rock when you find one.       You can use a Wheelbarrow to put dirt into it, them empty it into the screen.       One way you can use a Skim Shovel is to remove thin layers of soil. One way you can use A Trowel, is to break big chunks of soil.       You can use many different things, in many different ways. And it can be very interesting.

Then accoriding to the story they have to do the digging in the story it saig it is called the dig. The archeologist who do the dig  use small, sharp, and flat shovels called skim shovels. The dirt is then put in a box with a 1/2 inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall and lets the valuables stay in. Like in the story the diggers uses a process called trowling.  This is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can tace the up to twp weeks to dig a 25-square inch section. Another team spends a day in the lab studying the artifacts. In conclusion the job of archeologist must be hard.

Also it's about what they use. Also it's about why they do what they do.also about if i were a archaeologist.        Archaeologist works in the morning evening and night because they like to get their job done and find things. They like interesting things like statues,pottery,gold,silver,furniture and lots of other things. They go to places like fields,abandon,cities,towns and old,old,old houses,hotels,apartments and buildings.       Some tools that archaeologist use is pick and shovel. They start with those two tools and they use it to dig in the earth, close to the artifacts.They also use the whisk and dustpan. Those are used to brush dirt of the artifacts excavation site.the knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or carry dirt away from the excavation site.        So if you want to be a archaeologist you should because it seems really awesome.

How do archeologist find all of these thing that were in Washington's house all those years ago? the process of digging at the ferry farm is a careful one.  the first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.the information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.Another team foucases on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.that soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom.the discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United Stated a b better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous. another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonia Americans lived.digging around in the dirt.They also found part of a clay pipe.We know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovery gives more it is the right house.another teams spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. the whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.               All the things i learned in the report i made is that the teams discover allot of things. And i learned alto of details about George Washington life and all the things he did. And w??at???? archeologists find when they were digging to find his home they found the kitchen,slave,quarters,and storage houses.And it helped me allot with they things that i wrote down on my report.and what the teams made to dig things they made a 3D computers to track thing underground and the informatin is recorded so that people will know how  the things looked like before they started digging the things underground.And it tells me where George Washington home was located at since the actual building was a long gone.                   The things that i did its because i wanted to learn alot of things about George Washington life, and the things that some teams made up and told us about the 3D computers that track things underground. and wat they found when they were digging, under the ground for George Washington's house.and wat they did to try there best of trying to find more things about his house and wat he did when he was bearly a children and when his family moved to ''ferry farm'' to lived there when he was a children.and he use to smoke clay pipes when he was an adult.and when they were digging underground they found alot of things that were in his house.

The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologist,the name of scientist who study things from the past,armor and weapons.They discover the floors of some buildings.over 100 years later a group of archeologists effort to try to find the exact spot of fort James.National park services led a five year study of the fort to know how it was used.This would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.the people of the study used computers to make and image of what it would look like and the area.                      The archeologist finally found the fort and they first saw marks on the ground that showed where the forts walls use to be.All the stories they have read and the drawings they've made they knew the fort would be a triangle.They made maps and they found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.They have realized that there was stone ledges over the river.they where to hold the canoes.Archeologist found eleven cellars and buildings with in the walls of the fort.                            This was exciting for the archeologist to find these things and learn about are past.Because of the archeologist we know what we do to day.The archeologist found this fort and they found out more about are history.This gives them a piece of are past and they could learn more about are ancestors.The archeologist now know more about are history today.                             The archeologist also found some of George Washington past.They are trying to learn more about his childhood because we don't know much about his childhood.This is all changing historians now know more about him as a child because.Archeologist have been digging up his past and its called digging up George Washington's past.I'm going to tell how this dig all started.                          People lived on ferry farms for over 12,000 years.The location makes it a perfect place for a home and a family.Its not surprising that George Washington's father moved his family there.George Washington was only six years of age when his family moved there.                             They didn't know where the actual location of the Washington's home was located because the building was already long gone.Archeologist believed that the stone base under the house was still there.Archeologist started digging in 2003 this took over a year to dig up but they finally got it.They first found the kitchen,slave quarters,and the storage houses.They also found the main farmhouse a few years later.                              At leased four other houses were built on the ferry farm so they had to find proof that that was George Washington's home.They say George Washington house had a fire in their house.Diggers found burnt pieces of pottery.They suggested a fire was in this house.They also found a piece of a clay pipe inside of the house.They knew Washington smoked clay pipes so this gives them proof that this was Washington house.                    The process of digging at the ferry farm is a careful one.Every year teams will come and work on this site.There can be at lest 35 people on a team.The team first maps the site with there 3D computers that tracks what is under ground.They do so they know what it will look like before they start digging.There is a team that focuses on the actual digging this is called the dig.They start digging with a shovel called a skim shovel.These shovels are small,flat,and sharp and they can remove thin layers of soil.The soil is placed in a box with a half inch screen this lets the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in.Archeologist use a tool called a trowel.Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.It takes up to two weeks just to dig 25-square-foot section.Some teams spend days in the lab studying  the objects they found.It is a slow and tiresome job but its worth it.

These people also get cool tools so they can easily, carefully find artifacts.    Another thing ios that theyalaways find something to dig up for heavensakes.People make grands for finding artifact that is awesome.    People can also be famous for learning new things that people dont know.I mething from thomas jefferson that he maybe invented or even touched.

An archeologist is someone who uses artifacts to study the past. Archeologists have a hard job to do.                     Archeologists have to be organized, careful, and use their time wisely to get their job done. It can take long times to complete a dig. First, a team will map the area using special devices so that they can see what is underground. This helps the people know what the area they are digging in looked like before they started digging. Then another team starts the actual digging. They start the dig with a special shovels which are very small, flat, and sharp. With these shovels they remove only small layers of dirt. Once they have that soil, they will put it in a box where the dirt will fall out while the artifacts stay in. Another thing they may do is troweling which is done with paint brushes, small shovels, and wooden picks. It can take two weeks to remove a twenty-five-square-foot area with troweling. Finally, a different team will study the things they found. It is a very slow process.                      Archeologists use many different tools. They will use a pick and shovel to dig down into the Earth. A whisk and dustpan are used to tidy up the artifacts or clear dirt from the dig-site. Also they will use a knife for careful digging and scrapping dirt of the artifacts found. A wheelbarrow is used to transport dirt or the artifacts to another place. Taking a thin layer of dirt is the skim shovel's job. A very common tool, the trowel, is used to scrape and cut so you can see the different layers of soil. Those are common tools used be archeologists.                      Archeologists have found artifacts in many different places. George Washington's house is one. They have found things there that have helped them learn new things about George Washington's life. It also helps us know about him before he became famous. Another place is James Fort. We now know about the settler's every day life and challenges.                      Archeologists are actually very important. They help us know what we know about history. They are more than just diggers.

There were platforms that were thought to hold cannons. There were several million items found such as toys, coins, tools, and pottery. The people in the fort were often attacked the Powhatan tribe. There were several rooms such as cellars. There were many graves. In all there were about ten buildings in the fort.   George Washington's home was thought to be gone forever but some archeologists discovered the spot where the house used to be.They found burnt pottery and also discovered that the house had burnt down.They knew this was the spot. they found more buildings later on. They found slave quarters, storage houses and other buildings. They found the main farm house later on.   Some archeological tools are used for most digs. These include a knife for careful digging, a skim shovel for removing thin layers of soil, a whisk and dustpan for cleaning artifacts, and a trowel for scraping and cutting soil.

This topic was chosen because fifth grade is having history day. This text will say stuff about what archaeologists use to dig and what they found during some research.            Archaeologists dig up stuff from the past with tools like the pick and shovel. They also use stuff like the whisk and dustpan,  knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and the trowel. When they find something, they can infer what happened in the past. Sometimes, they even find stuff like old toys, pipes, and other very important stuff. Sometimes it can give us clues on what people learned in school. They also find stuff that give us clues to what the colonial people did at home. They are the keys to finding out stuff on very old famous people!            People think that James Fort was washed away by the river, only a corner was. Some people got a organization started called Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. It was started to discover the mysteries to James Fort. History says that it was built at the river so it would be easier to dock ships, but research says that only a corner was there. They dug and dug through the dirt, but nothing. It took over one-hundred years to find it, but they had found were James Fort was built. That shows how long they put effort into that. Especially how much patience they had.            Everyone wanted to know more about George Washington's past so they started digging at Ferry Farm in 2003. A few years later they had found the main farm house. They used a trowel to scape up the dirt and sifted it through a screen. They found a clay pipe. That let them know that he probably smoked clay pipes.The found pieces of burnt pottery. That confirmed that it was his house.               In conclusion, archaeologistts are very important to the world or we would have no clue what history was. They find stuff every day that leads to our an-sisters. Especially what they did for fun. Even for work.

They have to do lots of research on things. I bet that they are really smart. They have to get down on hands and nees to work really hard. They have to focus really well too. When there done finding things they have to research it very well. Thats why I think being an archeologist would be hard.           The job of an archeologist would be interesting too. They get to find cool things from the past. They also get to go and look at peoples old houses and stuff from when they lived long ago. They also get to dig and use all types of interesting tools. When people lived long ago they had interesting thing that archeologist get to find now. If we didnt have archeologist we probably wouldnt have muesems. Thats why I think being an archeologist would be interesting.           Archeologist use alot of interesting tools. The pick and shovel is one. They dig with these. Another one is the wisk and dustpan. They use these to brush dirt off of things. Another one is the knife. It is used to scrape dirt off of things. Another one is the wheelbarrow. It is used to move items from one place to another. Another one is the skim shovel it is used to smooth out things. The last one is the trowel. It is used to scrape layers off of things.           Now you know why I think being an archeologist would be interesting. Now you know why I think that being an archeologist would be hard. I am just stateing my openion so its not a well known fact that archeologist are fun and interesting. They do have alot of interesting tools too.

It is the digging and looking for objects that have been buried over time.You will learn about two digs in particular. The James Fort dig and the George Washington childhood dig.                    This paragraph is about the James Fort dig. The first objects that were found were dug up in 1861. They uncovered weapons, and armor. After a 5 year study they found James Fort. the first thing they found were markings on the ground where the walls used to stand. Then they found ledges built over the river to hold cannons. they also found eleven cellars, and dozens of burial sites.                      This next part of the report is about  a George Washington Childhood dig. They found burnt clay pottery that suggested that there was a fire. They also found a part of clay pottery. They new that Washington smoked clay pipes, so that suggests  that Washington lived there. It took them two weeks to dig a 25 square-foot section of land.                       The archaeologists use a variation of tools to uncover artifacts. They use picks and shovels. These tools are used to start the dig by breaking into the dirt. They use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off of the artifacts. A knife is used for careful digging. They use a wheel barrow to move dirt and artifacts from one place to the next. They use a skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt away from the dig. They also use a trowel to scrap and cut to see different layers of soil.                           Archaeology has a lot to do with the uncovering of our history. It is important to keep organizing archaeological digs. We need to keep leaning about our history. Also we need to keep teaching about what was discovered on archaeological digs.

THE PROCESS OF DIGGING AT THE FERRY FARM IS A CAREFUL ONE. EACH YEAR, MANY TEAMS WILL WORK ON THE SITE. THERE CAN BE UP TO 35 PEOPLE ON A TEAM! THE FIST TEAM MAPS THE AREA USING THE 3D COMPUTERS THAT CAN TRACK WHAT IS UNDERGROUND. THE INFORMATION IS THERE SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. OTHER PEOPLE START TO DIG SO THEY CAN FIND STUFF TO.                                                THEY START TO DIG WITH A SKIM SHOVEL. YOU PROBPLY DON'T KNOW WAHT THAT IS. THAT IS A SHOVEL THAT HAS A BIG PART THAT YOU PUT IN THE GROUND. THE BIG PART LOOKS LIKE A RECTANGEL. THIS SHOVEL CAN PICK UP A LOT OF DIRT AT ONE TIME. THEY USE THIS SO THEY CAN GO FASTER AND GET IT DONE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY CAN'T DO THE GOB GOOD BECAUSE OF THE SHOVEL, BUT THE SHOVEL DOES A LOT OF WORK. THESE SHOVELS CAN GET A LOT DIRT AT ONE TIME. THE SOIL IS PUT INTO A BIG BOX THAT WILL KEEP THE SOIL IN A PLACE TO STAY AND NOT ON THE GROUND.                                              HERE IS ANOTHER TOOL THEY USE TO FIND STUFF IN THE DIRT. THEY USE A WHISK. THE WHISK WIPES AWAY THE DIRT ON THE GROUND. THEY USE THIS TOOL SO IF THERE IS SOMETHING UNDER THE DIRT THEN THEY WIPE AWAY THE DIRT. THIS IS A REALLY COOL TOOL BECAUSE IF YOU ARE PLAYING OUT SIDE AND YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT HAS DIRT ON IT AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT IT IS THEN YOU JUST GET THE WHISK AND WIPE OF THE DIRT AND THEN YOU HAVE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.                                                   THAT WAS MY REAPORT ON DIGGING OUT THE PAST.

I think it will be fun but boring to be an archeologist. There are several reasons why, about the job and the tools.                   First, archeologist is someone who discover something. Example of digging the ground to find a dinosaur's bones and fossils. And it's kind of associated with history, too. I think archeologist need to be patient and need a lot of effort and must be smart.                Second, there are many tools that archeologist use. There are Shovel, Whisk, Dustpan,   Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. Basically, Shovel is used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Knife is used for caregul digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one plave to another of to carry dirt away from the excavation site. And Trowel is the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                        Third, I think this job will be fun but kind of boring job for me. But really, I don't want to be an archeologist. Well, I don't like to dig the ground all day. And when if I find nothing? I will be very sad and I will give up this job. Also, I don't want to study of all the history and the tools that I use. So, it will be really boring when if I find nothing special and when I don't know anything about it. And I think this job is for Men, because it's too tiring. But, when I found a huge fossils and other things, I can be famous and I can be on TV, do interview and go to different country to found something. Then I will be really happy and it will be really fun to do that job.              In conclusion, I think being an Archeologist is fun when I'm famous. But I think it will be boring to me. However, this is the end of my essay, the job of an Archeologist.

Archeologists job is to find artifacts about old things from the past and put them in special places like museums.  They need to work together to find old things.           At first, archeologists start with tools like the pick, skim shovel, wheelbarrow, and the shovel to get dirt or anything else and move them out of the way for the archeologists to work.  Then they go to smaller tools like the trowel and the knifefor getting the smaller pieces of dirt of and then going to the whisk and dustpan.  They use the whisk and the dustpan to get the dust offand get the old things out.

Researchers found out that he lived on a place called, Ferry Farm, they knew that he lived in a house. And that house had a fire! So the archeologists were looking for burnt items. They started to find items and then they found a burnt clay pipe. They knew that G.W. smoked a clay pipe so they knew that they were looking in the right area. And eventually they found enough items to prove where G.W. lived.                 Fort James... Researchers started looking for where Fort James was. They knew that it was near a supply of water source. They searched for days and nights but still never found Fort James. But one day, they started using advanced Technology Software (A.T.S), and they plotted out the land... and they found Fort James! They found the outline of the fort and found out that the for was shaped as a triangle. People are very excited that the archeologists found where Fort James was hundreds of years ago...

Today mostly every thing we know we have learned it from archeologists. Each day many archeolohists go out in the hot sun trying to find out more about people thet lived 10s, 100s and 1000s years ago.

Archeology can be used to find out about historic peoples' lives. It can also be used to find out where someone or something is. Archeology can be a tough process. There are three main parts to it, determining who you want to learn about, finding the artifacts, and studying them.          Step 1, determing who you want to find out about, is probably the easiest part. You can learn about George Washington, Martin Luther King, or maybe Rosa Parks. You can look on a computer to research who you want to learn about, which might tell you a little bit about what you might find. If you dont have a computer, use a book. Then you can get on to the next step.          Step 2, digging, is the most tiresome part of the job. Most archeologists use a skim shovel to start. A skim shovel is a flat shovel that digs small layers of dirt at a time. Then they put the dirt in a wheel barrow to be examined. They then trowel through it with a trowel, or a pitch fork and make sure they didn't mis anything. Now to study!          Step 3, studying, will be the part all archeologists want: finding out about the artifacts. From your research, you might have discovered that your person likes to farm. If you found a hoe or a bucket, that might prove it. If you find a lot of tools, you might find out that they were a carpenter. If you are lucky your discovories will be important. Even if not, it still will be good to know that you tried! Maybe you will be the one to discover more about George Washington's childhood!          Archeology is one of the best things to study history. It is good exersize, and could reward you. Studying under a microscope, or digging could be great fun! Most things in museums is found by archeology. digging and studying can find many things!

Archeologist do many things find artifacts about before times. You will use many tool including a skim shovel, a trowel, and a knife. You will go to many places to find artifacts about what you are searching for. Here are some more facts about archeologist.                  There are many tools that a archeologist uses. They use a pick and shovel to start it with and then will use a wheelbarrow to carry the items away. They then will use a a skim shovel to take off thin layers of dirt. They will use the trowel the most so they can cut the soil to view it. They use the knife so they car push pieces of dirt off the artifacts.They will use a whisk and dustpan to carefully brush dirt off the artifact so it can be clean. Archeologist use many tools on there job.                   Being a archeologist is a hard job. You will use all you know to try to find the artifacts. Traveling the world to find priceless pieces is what they do. Maybe one day we can become archeologist. It sounds fun to me! 	IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN WRB PRP VBP RP PRP VBP IN IN DT NN .

They dig things up so that they can learn about what things were like a long time ago.  Archeologists take many tools with them when they go digging. They take things like, pickaxes, many different kinds of shovels, wheelbarrows, knives, and many other things. The archeologists use these tools for digging, moving dirt, and they use the whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and to clear dirt away. It is important when archeologists discover things. It helps people understand what things were like many years ago, and it helps scientists study how people lived  a long time ago. Archeologists find things by going through a process of digging. Each year, many teams will work on the site. There will be up to 35 people on a team. The first team maps out the area using 3D maps on a computer. Then, the other teams go where the information on the computer tells them to go, and they start digging. Archeologists find many things that help us understand things about the past. It is exiting to discover objects that were used by people that lived hundreds of years ago.

The job of an archeologist is to find special artifacts to figure out other things that nobody knows. It is a hard job and it may be deadly in cases. You can look for anything find it and bring many tools with you. You must be very careful with the objects that you will find.       There are many artifacts you can find the most popular are dinosaur bones. as i sayed Once you find it will leed you on for a long time. You also must be careful if you find an artifact it might be really old or easy to break. You also can travel to very far places to find great artifacts. The most popular artifacts are    Bones Minerals Treasure Carvings on walls diamonds           Bones. There are many archeologists who colect bones for artifacts. Dinosaur bones ,Human Bones, and Animal Bones. Big or small, Wide or thin the are all hard to find. This is where it becomes a hard job. With metal detectors you cant find bones so you will have to dig in a certain place and be very lucky.       Minerals. They are much easier to find in ways. But you cant just pull them out of the ground they are on the walls of caves and they are really hard to pull out so thats why they use picks, to knock them out of there place. another hard thing is they could be huge. how are you going to get a pick and keep hitting a crystal bit by bit. You cant. Why this job is easy is because they can be tiny and out of place.       Treasure is much easier to find you can use a metal detector. Its also very valueable. you can find gold, money, diamond and much more. You can get many things in a short amount of time if your in the right place if not you can just find anything thats metal.       Diamonds are extremely rare they are found way far down in the ground and most of the time you wont even find it. Its really really hard to brake and almost most of the time you wont be able to break it. Although if you do break it and get it you will be popular.        As you see an archeologist has a harder job than it seems. this is the job of an archeologist. 	WP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .

Second,What do Archaeologist do?They will find some of the most extraordinary,awesome,old,and fragile things in the past and from the future archeologist will always do all of the things that archeologist are doing in the present.The archeologist will never give up until they find the thing that there looking for.Archeologist do some of the most amazing things they will find bones and put them together to see what it will create like for you could see if its a Dinosaur bone or otherwise they will be human or any creature bone. Archeologist have found stuff that no one has ever found. They are one of the most jobs people could obtain money because it is one of the most difficult job in the planet.Archeologist have one a very difficult job in planet Earth.The archeologist are one important tool to solving a mystery.                      Third,The archeologist have important tools to help them with their job.Like a pick and a shovel,a whisk and a dustpan,a knife,a wheelbarrow a skim and a shovel and lastly a trowel.They use the pick and the shovel to do most digging.They use a whisk and a dustpan to brush dirt away from the bones or the artifacts.They us the knife for careful digging just to scrape the dirt for most of the artifacts.Like they use the tools to help them find the artifacts or to help them get the artifact for it can't fall and actually break.First,the archeologist must know where the artifact is located.Second, they must have their correct tools.Third,there computer will help them almost like navigating in the ground.Lastly,they will find the artifact dig it use the knife to trace it with the knife and use the wheelbarrow to carry it.                        Fourth,The archeologist  they will dig to find clues of the past.As for that they must know and use the info they know of George Washington lived to find out.They must know if there is a piece remaining of his past.They must do hard work to keep up their mission.So they don't  be just lazy they do the hard work.They must continued what they left of on.Their are such hard workers they don't get a break.They dig for information of the past so they could solve the mysteries of the present or maybe the future.They have to be strong and good at the job for they could support the tiredness of the job because it is a really hard job it is not easy being in the sun the whole day digging in the ground having eye problems because sand will get in their eyes.They have to get their job very good they don't me around they have a hard time doing all of the difficult things.                                  Lastly, the archeologist are good at finding extraordinary things like in one of the passages they never gave up so they found the fort.They went through a process to find what they looking for they  have to study what is it go and try to find it.They don't just go spend hour and hours just looking for it and end up getting nothing.They have to work hard and they get paid more money then almost all the jobs.They are very good at finding what there looking for and they will actually.The archeologist are one of the most hard working persons on earth because they find earth  mysteries maybe  solve when they find it they will actually trying to do all of there hard work.They never give up.

Archeology is the study of earth, or ground. Archeologists find many interesting artifacts such as; dinosaur bones, teeth, and sometimes claws! However not everything an archeologist does is look for dinosaur fossils, they can also look for presedential items from the past! They can also look for lost cities,towns,or even colonies.   Keep reading!                                                                                                                                                                                    Archeologists need many tools to actually BE an archeoligist here they are:   A pickaxe and shovel A whisk and dustpan A knife A Wheelbarrow A Skim Shovel A Trowel        A pickaxe is used to break through stone,and a shovel is used to dig through dirt. These two materials are used to start out the search.        A whisk and dustpan are used to clear dirt off the artifact without harming the artifact.        A knife is used dig around artfacts and to scrape dirt off the artifact carefully.        Wheelbarrows are used to move items to one place to another carefully.   One skim shovel is used to scoop a very thin layer of dirt.   When you see someone use a trowel, this means they are trying to view the diffrent layers of dirt.            Now you know what archeoligists search for and what tools they need. Hopefully someday one of these reader's will become an archeoligists!

Archeologists look for thing in the past.  For example,the dinosaurs.  The archeologists have been studying dinosaur fossils for a long time.  In the museum there dinosaur fossils that make a dinosaur.  Archeologists find the fossils then they turn them in to scientists to see what bone it belongs to then they build it.                                             Archeologists spend there time finding things from the past.  So they try to find things in history from dinosaurs-now.  Archeologists went to Ferry Farm to see George Washington's house.  Only the base of the house was there.  None of the archeologists new were the Washington house was at.  They started digging in 2003.  The archeologists found the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.The archeologists found the farmhouse a few years later.  The archeologists were digging more to make sure that the house was George Washington's house.                   Archeologists found burnt pottery.  So the archeologists occur that there was a fire in the house.The archeologist knew George Washington smoked clay pipes.  So they gives more proof that it is the right house.  Each year many archeologists get put into teams.  The team have up to 35 people on there team.  The first team maps he area using 3D computers to see what is underground.  The other team focuses on were there digging.  The team uses skim shovels,shovels are small, flat and sharp shovels.Soil is placed in a box with half inch screen at the bottom.  This lets the the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in.The diggers also use troweling.  It takes up to 2 weeks for the diggers to dig a 25-square-foot section.

Well archeologist do many things for science, education, curiousity, and even just for our amusement. There are plenty of resons for being an archeoligist. Their work is not easy at alL. Read more to find out what exactly an acheroligist does, why, and the tools they use!                                                         WHAT THEY DO       An acheologist is the kind of scientist who likes to 'dig' depper.   They discover artifacts of all kinds from tall caves, to deep oceans. Artifacts are objects from the past. Archeologist ue the artifacts to discover many things from our history. Such as, Gorge Washingtons old house, The exact spot were for jams was built, why the Titanic sank, and more! You might see all kinds of artifacts in local musems. Usually archeologist dig in  the ground or in ccaves to find what their searching for                                WHY ARCHEOLOGIST ARE IMPORTANT       Archeologist find artifacts that ckuld even answer some of the biggest questions of the wrold today. The artifacts they find gives us a little piece of what it was like for people, and any living thing a long time ago. Our children, and ourselves will be able to learn about htese artifacts and what it was like back then. Sometimes they find extinct animal bones or carcasses (if frozen in glaciers) from about 1,000,000+ years ago! Such as the Tyranasaurus, Saber Toothed tiger, Wooly Mammoth, Megalodon, and more. Its also good to know how the creatures of our world 'Evolved'. It gives us some ideas of what the animals of today might be capable of.                                             THE DANGERS THEY FACE        While at work, archeologist face many dangers no matter what terain their in. Some have even died from sickness, or injuries. Lets say your an archeologist on a mountain, digging ino its depths. its possible an avalanche could occur, you fall off, or an animal attacks you. Some tools are hazerdous has well. Such as the knife. We all know what would happen if somebodey accidentaly cut themselves. Some archeologist go on several year long journies to remote places. They might encounter an unknown disease that is uncureable.                                                           TOOLS USED        Arheologist use a number of tools for many reasons. here is a list of too,ls and why they use them.   Pick and Shovel: to usualy dig through dirt or rocks   Whisk and dustpan: To gently clear off dust from artifacts   Knife: Used for CAREFUL digging and for scraping off dirt from hard to reach places on an artifact.   Wheelebarrow: Used to move a number of items, or a big object from one place to another, or to move dirt/soil away from an excavation site   Skim shovel: A shovel with a square-like shape used to remove thin layers of soil with each scoop   Trowel: Used to scrabe away diffrent layers of soil.   These are just a small number of the most simple tools used for archeolagy. You might even own few of these tools.                                                      CONCLUSION       Its true that archeologist have a very tough job. They provide us with alot of knowlage of our history, and other facinating things from long ago. Next time you go to a musem amd see an old artifact, youll know who worked hard to find it. Archeologist face many dangers to find the objects, and usually have no success. Go to your local musem to learn more about archeologist and their jobs!

In the source Finding fort James it says in 1994 a group of archeologists became interested in James town history so they started some research and they found out the  fort was built in 1607 when settlers came to live.                                   In the source called Tools Used by Archeologists it shows a very advanced variety of tools including the following: Pick and shovel, whisk and dust pan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel ad a trowel. these tools are used to do many things including: scraping, pulling tightening,loosening,breaking,cleaning,dusting,polishing and many more things.                                    In the paragraph called digging up Washington past, it tells about a group of archeologists who become interested in Washington past so they do some research and then they went to his old house to find even more research about our very first president. no wonder the title is digging up Washington past!

I think it's so cool how they find thing from millions of years ago.  I'm going to tell you how cool an archeologist really is.            Archeologist uses really cool tools to find clues to the mystery their trying to solve.  Those tools are a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.  Each of those tools have a special meaning.  For a pick and a shovel the meaning is when they first start to dig they use the pick and or shovel.  The meaning for the whisk and the dustpan is it's used to brush the dirt off the artifact that they found and to make it clear so they can see what it is.  The wheelbarrow is to move items from one place to another place or to carry dirt away from the site.  The skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.  Last but not least the trowel.  The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.            I hope I explained to you what an archeologist does and I hope that you are interested in archeology.  Isn't what they do cool?

What you dont know about history archeologists probably.       Archeologists know stuff that the presedent dosent know about right now. Archeologists have to love history to be one.

Archeologists uncover historical figures that give us clues about America`s history.       Archeologists have studied many different thing. They`ve studied Fort James and George Washington`s home on Ferry Farm land. Theyhave discovered many other things too.       While discovering Fort James archeologists also found the places where colonists would dump their trash. Colonists would dump their trash in unused wells or garbage pits.       When discovering George Washibngton`s house they found burnt poetry and many other things. They first found the kitchen, slave quaters, and storage houses.       At lesast 4 houses have been built on Ferry Farm land. So, archeologists had to find the right house. They also had to have proof that the house they thought was George Washingtons was his house.       Archeologists use many different tools. These tools are: pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. A pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. Whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. A knife is used for careful digging and to scraope dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrows are used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Trowels are used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.

The archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a tringle.They made maps and found out that the fort strerched all the way to the river.Then they realized there were stone ledges built overthe river.The ledges were designed to hold canons.        The archeologists also found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.

Also they found fort james! There were books, and drawings. The fort was shaped as a triangle. The fist thing they found inside it is markings. They found maps and then they found out that it stretched all the way to the river. There were metal toys for children. It's weird how they throw their trash in a big pit.       From what i heard is that settlers had a difficult time surviving since they had less food. They found Potterys, coins, and also tools. I did not know that they attack them very often. Plus they also eat bones. It came from animals they ate. Fort James was bulid near the river. I wonder if it was torned up or it was still like it's self when they build it.

Or how we can learn from archeologists? Well, it is very interesting to be an archeologist, in my opinion, and it is very hard!         It's interesting and boring because of the things you might find. Some people have found remains of historical artifacts like walls of Fort James or broken pottery from George Washington's house. You could also find clothes and other things that people used back then. Who knows what you could find out there? Only time will tell! It could also be boring when you don't find anything for a while. You could dig up a large area of dirt and not find anything.         Archeologists used many types of tools for many different reasons. One tool that archeologists use most often is the 'whisk and dustpan.' These are used like a dustpan at home! You would use the whisk to clear off the dirt on the artifact. Then, the dirt would go into the dustpan. Picks and shovels are often used to start the search. They use the pick to chip away at the dirt. The shovel is used to move the dirt out of the area (most likely into the wheelbarrow). The knife is used for carefully scraping dirt off of the artifact. The wheelbarrow is just used for a simple transport of dirt to somewhere else; most likely away from the digging site. A skim shovel would be used for removing a thin layer of dirt from the earth. The most often tool on a digging site would be a trowel. This is just a smaller version of a shovel used for digging and to show the different layers of dirt.         If you have ever wondered what we could learn from archeology? Time to put that question to rest! We can learn a lot from archeologists! One example would be that we could find out what colonial life was like. Archeologists found George Washington's house that he lived in when he was a boy. They found burnt, broken pottery, which indicated that there was once a fire at George Washington's house. We have also found some remains of Fort James. Archeologists started digging up armor and weapons that would indicate that Fort James was built in that area. We can also see what it was like to live in Fort James, like several cellars, burial grounds, and toys for children, all in the same area.         As you can see, we could learn a lot from archeology and fro the people who dedicate their time to helpus learn about colonial life.                 	. NNP . .

An Archeologist is a person who looks for artifacts that are hidden in the ground. They use many different tools to look for different things. They will dig at many differnt places like old houses and battle feilds. But this job can be fun and can be boring.               A Archeologist uses many different tools too. They use tools like picks, shovels,  knifes, wheelbarrows, and skin shovels. Each tool is speical in its own way. like the skim shovel is used to remove one small layer of dirt at atime and the knife is used for careful digging around artifacts. so now you know that all tools are im portant in the world of archologist.               So now you now alot about archeologist. You learned that archeologist dig in many places. They also use many tools to find artifacts. The tools can come in many shapes and sizes too.

First you need to become an archeologist then find someone or something to find artifacts on then locate the dig site. Before you are at the dig you need to get tools. You will need a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. When you are at the dig you will have to dig and dig and dig until you find something valuable then take your whisk and dustpan and brush of the dirt from the artifact. Then use your knife to carve out the remaining dirt. Then you start all over again.           All in all, being archeologist would be tiring.

In 1607 the fort was built when settlers came to England  to start a better life.James Fort was near a river, people thought it would be easier to dock a ship there.           The first Archaeologist object were found in 1861, scientists who study objects from the past were called  uncovered armor.Uncovered armor discovered the floors in the building. In the future a group found the same spot where the fort was being built.   The National Park Service let to five-years study the figure how the land was used. That's when they finally found James Fort !! The very first thing they found was the mark on the ground. The mark showed where the walls used to be.   Archaeologist is exciting to discover objects that were used by people who lived  hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the  people who stared the Americans colonies!

They have to plan out what they are trying to find, carefully and slowly follow the directions, and do research. Even when this tiring process is done, all your work will pay off.                   When archeologists want to find out more about something in the past, they get a team for the digging process and finding information. For them to find more about the past they have to do research on it just like the people did when they found Fort James. They have to know where the historical place was, what are they trying to find, and what happened to the historical place to start digging or looking for clues.                   When archeologists are ready and they have done there research, they look for clues to see where the historical place is.When archeologists were finding Fort james, the National Park Serice led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They used that information so they could know where to look for proof of the fort. That's what archeologist have to do to map out where the historical place is.                   When the archeologists find the historical place, they get their tools ready to dig. there are alot of tools they use on the site. Most archeologist start digging with a pick and shovel. They use it to dig in to the earth, close to the artifacts. Other main tools they use are whisk and dustpan ( to brush dirt off of the artifacts), knife ( used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifact), wheelbarrow ( used to move items from one place to another), skim shovel ( a shovel with a flat edge. It carefully remove thin layers of soil), and a trowel ( used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil).                    It takes years to accomplish your goal. Being an archeologist contains being patient. Your job is slow and tiresome so you have to be patient and steady. Even though it is tiresome, when you're done you'll know more about the historical place and you will find really cool things!

All they were thinking was that 3 men are going through the Burmuda triangle safely with no problem to find the Bahamas. Sooner or later they will find out that the Burmuda triangle is the most current place for people and their air crafts or boats go missing.The trio of men do start having problems in the helicopter they soon realize every thing goes off .They were actually knocked out by the loss of air.            When all the boys wake up they find themselves off the helicopter and on a land full of people.Melvin asked one man he saw 'where are we at'? The man responded 'you're in the Bahamas' All 3 of the boys looked at each other in a frighted look.They all thought the same thing they are in the Burmuda triangle and they were stuck.            All of a sudden they found their self's in their bed the day of their journey like nothing ever happened. they thought could this be our minds warning our self's not to go on this trip. The boys went to the press and told them what they dreamt . Later ton that day 3 other boys went on the same trip.The next day they were found missing!

Archeologist find things that were made in the past. But this job is very slow because sometimes you are assigned to find a huge artifact. Archeologists don't only use their hands, they use tools like shovels or a wheelbarrow.              This job can be exiting. Imagine a peice of history right under your feet. But you have to have a  good college and good classes.   In my sources people were assigned to discover George Washington childhood. The best part about this job is finding it and bringing it to a history place. So when you are at the history place you feel proud of yourself. 	NNP PRP VB TO VB WP VBN IN DT JJ .

Also, you will learn how they do it       Archeoligists have diferent tools. They are picks, shovels, whisks,dustpann,knives,etc.  A pick and a shovel are what start a dig. whisk and a dustpan wipe dirt off an artifact. A wheelbarrow can move your artifacts around.       In past digs, archeoligists use processes to find artifacts. Trying to find artifacts at Washington's house, there were many teams. One team used 3D computers to find artifacts undergound. Looking for artifact in Jamestown, scientists dug up many of the things they used a long time ago.       Archeoligists used many differnt processes to find arifacts. Some just dug to find stuff but some also used higher technology to find artifacts. They also used many different materials to find artifacts.

Archeologist are people who study things from the past. They dig up artifacts for you and them to learn about people and history. They have studied and found Fort James, and have found out a lot of things about George Washington's childhood home.               What Kind Of Tools Do Archeologist Use?      Archeologist use a pick and shovel that is used to into the earth close to the artifacts, a whisk and a dustpan is used to clear the dirt away from the artifact, the knife is used to scrape dirt around the artifact, the wheelbarrow is helpful to either move the dirt or the artifacts, the skim shovel is also helpful to remove a thin layer of dirt with each scoop, and the trowel helps them see different layers of soil. These tools really help the archeologist.               Archeologist really help us understand history. We are glad to have such a job like this.

If you want to be one, follow the instructions I have personally typed below.                                         First off, you need to find a place you want to dig. Like somewhere located with dinosaur bones. Also, if you can't do it on your  own, you need to grab some buddies (if they aren't busy).        Now, you need the right tools. You will need:       A pick and shovel A whisk and dustpan A knife A wheelbarrow A skim shovel A trowel       If you don't have all the tools, barrow them from a friend or buy them from a toolshop, just make sure you don't go broke. Next, you must go to your selected place to dig, and get ready to get dirty! To get your dig started, you better get your pick and shovel. You can't really get into the earth any other way.        Remember, you can use a wheel barrow to carry the dirt away from th excavation site. Once you think you have found something in the dirt, use your skim shovel to remove any thin layers of the ground. You want to ruin your artifact.        If your artifact has dirt on it, you can use your knife scrape it off. Remember to put your artifact in a safe place before you start digging again. Now, if you were thinking about being an archeologist, start now!

An archeologist digs up artifacts from the past and then finds out what role that artifact played in the past. It usually takes years to find an artifact or where to dig, it takes so long that there are teams of 35 digging in one site! Archeologists have a variety of tools used to do the job such as the simple pick and shovel all the way down to the huge wheelbarrow.       Archeologist start out by finding clues on where to dig, it takes a while to find where to dig. They usually use 3D computers to see things under ground. Teams of archeologists dig at an excavation site to find the artifacts. Once they find the something they study the object they found digging in the site. It takes a lot of time and effort but it's worth all of the hard work. Finding these artifacts help us see the past in a way never before. An archeologists life contains patience, hard work, and effort.

But people think it's still out there, but you might just need to get you jeans dirty to fin it. Around 1605-1610 when the settlers came here from England for a second chance. they made a fort, and they named it after there leader. Sir James. So the fort was named fort James. Now a big group of archaeological, found eleven cellars, a dozens of burial sits and a big trash pit.                                                                                                    George Washington pasts              In 2003, a group of 35 archaeologist's found GW house. they only found the base of the stone house. they were able to tell what kind of things he did because they found toy, pottery, and other and a couple clay pips. it took the about five years to learn all they wanted to learn about George Washington life as a boy and as an adult.

An archiologist is someone who has to work for a company that goes out to all different kinds of places and digs up all kinds of animal bones and skulls from thousands of years ago.                          One thing about archiologists is that they have to work for a long period of time , day after, day after ,day. the archiologists also have to travle all the time and be on time to work evryday.Some of them have twenty-four seven jobs at that company but some of them have just a twenty four hour job at the archiologist lab.                     The first object found as an archiologist was in  1861.  over 100 years later, a group had found more things than the first group had 100 years before this group had discovered more things about the bones that they had found.                              In conclusion, i think archiologists  are a good resorce for finding animal bones and other valuble things al over the world. so i think we should have more archiologists then we already do in the world. so when your done reding this you should go get a job as an archiologist .

Archeologists have a hard time finding artifacts sometimes. Archeologists take very long to find artifacts because they get tired from mining and working. They need all the tools or devices to find rare artifacts. Archeologist can find artifacts from somewhere where it is deserted, have mining tools,  have lots of hope of finding artifacts, and know about the artifacts they found.                 Archeologists can find artifacts from somewhere where it is deserted because they have devices that show if there are any artifacts underground. They mine for many days or even weeks just finding an artifact. Archeologists look for old yet rare things at that place. They even know if it is or is not deserted.                 Archeologists have a lot of mining tools to bring or find the artifact. They use the pickaxe and shovel to get underground, but the skim shovel and trowel help get rid of the soil faster. After the archeologists find the artifact, they use the knife to cut around the artifact. Archeologists also get the whisk and dustpan to clean the old dirty artifact, then they put it in the wheelbarrow if it is big.                 Archeologists don't give up very fast because they have hope. They don't care how long it takes but if they find the artifact. They might take breaks but after the break, they go and try to find it right away. Archeologists may take long time but they find it. Archeologists are like most kids, when kids lose, some give up, but some don't. Archeologists are like the kids that don't give up.                 Archeologists know what artifacts they found because they research about it. They must know about what they found or they will think it is junk. Archeologists research before they go on an expedition or they will think its for fun like a treasure hunt. Archaeologists may not know about artifacts sometimes but they could think its special for them.                Archeologist are people that studies about the past for artifacts. They have a hard time finding it sometimes. Archeologists have a fun job but it takes a lot of time to find even 1 artifact. Archeologists mine a lot of time just for maybe even 1 small tiny piece. Archeologists can find artifacts from deserted places, have mining tools, have lots of hope, and know what kind of artifacts are found.

People who dig for artifacts are called Archioligists. Archioligists learn many things from finding artifacts, like what people did hundreds of years ago. Some examples of artifacts Archioligists find are bones, pottery and pipes.           Tools Archioligists use, are whisks and dustpans to dust artifacts. Pick and shovel to dig deep. A knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts. Wheelbarrows are used to move artifacts. Skim shovels are shovels with a flat edge to remove a thin layer of soil. Trowels are prabaly most common to dig with.         I hope you have found this informing and interesting.

Some of the tools an archetect would use are a pick and shovel to start the dig and these tools make it easy to brake the top layer of dirt. Next there is a whisk and dustpanwhich is used to push all of the dirt off th item they find. There is also a skim shovel that is desighned with flat edges to get small layers of earth. There are many more tools that I have not named with big jobs.      The architect is alot to remember but they get used to it. When looking for George Washingtons house the archeologists were split into teams and some of the teams consists of up to 35 people. Some of the teams used a 3D computer thattracks what is underground so the crew members might know what it is without digging. Other teams just start digging and sift the dirt for other objects and if they find one they send it to the lab to see what it is and find out any more information.      If you are looking for a job with a lot of digging and cool artifacts then an archeologists would be th job for you!

First of all this job is fun because you get to uncover secrets hidden beneath the earth for a long time. For example Jamestown or the Washington house or old disgusting dinosaur bones. I wish I had this job! Plus you get to travel around the world to find the artifacts.            Secondly this job is fun because you get to teach little kids how to be an archeologist. They are allowed to explore the sight, experience colonial life, and become junior archeologists. I want to be a junior archeologist!            Last but not least this job is fun because all the tools you get to use. for example the pick and shovel or the whisk and dust pan etc. Imagine that! This job may look hard at first butt really it isn't because the tools get the job done. ?

Some people do but if you don't their people who study the past, it could be about someone that was famous or just someone interesting that happened in the past. Just imagine some things you would have to do to be a archaeologist, for example you would have to dig artifacts up with different tools, find out when they got there, and who they came from and where they came from.                                                                                                                   My first reason is that if your'e an archaeologist you have to dig artifacts up with different tools. For example, you use a pick and shovel to dig into the Earth, close to the artifacts. Also you need to use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, another tool you use is a knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt off the surroundings of the artifact, you need a wheelbarrow for moving items from one place to the next, a skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil, and last you need a trowel to cut and scrape the layers of soil off the artifact. Wow, that's a lot of tools to keep track of. So if you become an archaeologist you'll need to be a skillful and careful worker.                         My second reason for being an archaeologist is you have to find out how the artifacts got there. For example, you might have to look on old maps to see if the artifact was there in that year if not they might have to look in books for any facts about the artifacts the archaeologists found. Many people might say  wow that looks hard but for them it's not that hard and it might only take a few weeks to figure the facts out.                       My last reason for being an archaeologist is you have to find out who they came from and where they came from. For example, they find some of this out by using 3D computers that can track where artifacts are. Thats my last reason for now.                      In conclusion, an archaeologist would be a great job because of my several reasons, maybe when you grow up you will be one, you never know but it's always good to try, though:) 	NNP NNP PRP VB WP DT NN VBZ .

George Washington was a president when he was younger. He also moved when he was 6 years old because his father, Augustine Washington, wanted to move .                        In the time when James Fort was alive ( in the 1600's), people used to throw their trash down into an unused well or into a big pit. While digging the area  where Fort James used to be, the archeologists found  trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.                George Washington and James Fort are similar because they both had trash in a well, pit, or lying on the ground. They are also similar because they both have past and they both had archeologists come and examine their life time and how they lived.                    Now you know how George Washington and James Fort are alike and different in many ways. To find out more about James Fort and George Washington, read the book called ''Digging for History Infornational Performance Task'.

Not like others they milked cows and got eggs from the chickens   and the men went hunting for bears also they went fishing for fish forsome meals.   The kids washed clothes, cleaned the house, they did the dishes and they set the table for dinner.   But sometimes the kids picked the fruits from the plants and took them inside to wash. they also had to walk to like the restroom because it was just an outlet back then    Then some mothers got on their horses and went to a little market to get only some types of foods and they didnt have tolet paper   theycleaned their self with some type of a   leave.and the kids wanted alot of thing but couldnt get the things they wanted like- clothes, tolets, and toys. Back then they had lots to do for the kids moms and dads. The only thing was they didnt have ipods,ds,ps3,phones,laptops, and other eletronics like that. All they had was work work work. After dinner they had to wash dishes with water from out side and bring it in a tub then when they had to take showers they filled a bucket with water and dumped it in a tub then they just washed with water no soap,shampoo,or condisiner. Plus they had no profume,lotion,or any smelly good scents like that.

There have been many important discoveries of important artifacts like finding Fort James and finding George Washington's childhood home. They also have many tools to dig up the past. There are many things to do if you are an archeologist.       One job the archeologists do is rediscovering old forts from the Revolutionary War like James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The Rediscovery Archaeological Project was ordered to find and rediscover the old James Fort. The fort was built in 1607 by English settlers. The archeologists found pieces of armor and weapons and the floor of the fort. They used computer mapping to find the exact location of the building.They made many maps of the fort.       Another job that many archeologists do is finding the homes or birthplaces of famous historians from all over the world. Many archeologists were interested in finding out more about George Washington's childhood. So they found the home that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family to when George was six years old. The location of the house is now known as Ferry Farm. Since the house was actually gone, many archeologists believed that the base of the house was still there. So they started digging in 2003, and found the house in 2004, a year later. They found the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage houses first. A few years later, they then found the main farmhouse.They had little proof that this really was the Washington household. They carefully used 3D computers to map the house out before the archeologists actually started digging.They also recorded what they found with the computer in the computer. They dug lightly and carefully and found the evidence they needed.       There are many tools that archeologists used to carefully dig up and move important artifacts. There are picks and shovels, which are used to dig into the Earth that is close to the artifact. A whisk and dustpan are used to dust dirt off of artifacts and pick up the dirt. A knife can be used to carefully dig and scrape dirt off of an artifact. A wheelbarrow is used to move artifacts or dirt to different places. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove thin layers of soil from the item. A trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut soil to see the different layers.       In conclusion, archeologists do have difficult jobs, but they are important to world history. They help uncover important discoveries all over the world. I want to thank them for all of the history they reveal.

The job of an archeologist today is a very important, multistepped, and hard job that involves dig sites, reverse engineering ,observation, and piecing together useful history or information. As you can see, archeologists have long, hard, important jobs.

They study items like gold, dinosaur bones, and even cave men! This started in 1994 when archeologists wanted to find Fort James. When they wanted to they needed more people so they started the Jamestowm Rediscovery Archaeological Project. This project was designed to find out all of the secrets in James Fort in Jamestown, Viginia. For more than 200 years some people thaught that the Fort was washed away in a river. Discoveries in the area where the fort was gave them a hint that it might still be there.                James Fort was built in 1607 when the British settlers came from England to start a new life. The reason James fort was built by a river is because it was much easier for the people to dock their ships. Some of the objects that they found nearby made it look like the fort was further away. They made a new spot so that the settlers could be more safe from the enemies.              The first items found of Fort James were found in 1861. When they found the first items they found weapons, armor, and floors of buildings. Over 100 years later a group decided to find out more secrets where Fort James was built again.               A National Park Service held a five year study of the area to find out how the land of Fort James was used. They knew this is where they had to look to find the proof of the fort. These people used doing this used a computer mapping of the area. Thats when they found James Fort!One of the very first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. After that they kept going and then they keep finding things!               All together, Finding James Fort was pretty hard to find but when you use teamwork nothing is impossible. Learning about archeologist was really fun! I hope that one day they find something else that is History.        	NNP NNP NN NNS IN DT NNP NNP NN NNS IN NN , NN NNS , CC RB VB NNS .

Let me tell you a little more about what archeologists do for a  living every day.                                                                                       Archeologists work hard every day. They also use the following things: a pick and shovel,a whisk and dustpan,a knife,a wheelbarrow,a skim shovel ,and a trowel. They use these things to find things that were used many years ago to the first people of the colonies.                                                                                                       Archeologists have an exiting job they get to do things that most adults don't usually do every day they got to find people and other things from many years ago they got to find Fort James,learn about George Washington's past, and got to do and find many other cool and fascinating things.

Archeologists have made many dicoveries.I am going to talk about two discoveries:Finding Fort James and Digging up George Washington's Past.       Finding Fort James.In 1994 a group of people  were interested in studying Jamestown's past.Jamestown is found in Virginia and many people thought that 200 years ago a fort was washed away by a river.The fort was built in 1607.The first recovered objects were found in 1861.These objects were uncovered armor and weapons.After about 100 years later a crazy discovery was found.It was Fort James.An incredible discovery indeed.       Digging up George Washington's Past.We all know George Washington was our 1st president and was a soldier,but not much is recovered from his childhood.But now recent discoveries are being made and soon we will know much more about Washington's childhood.

Fort James was built in 1607 by settelers from England.They didn't build near the river because it was easy for enemies to attack.They probably found a spot much safer.They found objects that suggested the fort was located further away.       I wrote my report on Fort James because it sounded like an intresting topic.After i read more about Fort James i decided to write my report on it.i think my report was really good and hoped you enjoyed it.

The Fifth-graders had been asked to give information on different jobs for people who are interested in the study of History.  I decided to learn about people, called archeologists.  Archeologist are people who study the objects from the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                             As part of my research I have found two articles and one graphic that I think will be helpful.I still have to look for more research on the archeologists.  Alex and I are working together on this project for History Day.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Alex is going to draw and glue.  I am going to do the research and the cutting.  My mom is going to help us with the printing and getting the things we are going to need for the project.

The people deciced to build there own tools they did so. The people got there tools ready but it didnt work. They  thought and thougth they got it.In stead of going right work they would plan it out first. they thought thats why there tools didnt work cause they build instead of planning it out.Other people thougth there tools wouldnt work. Once they build it they tried it out but it didnt work out. They were scared if they didnt build it the man would get mad and they will die! Not one of them had a home.           Severl years past but no fort was build. The man would come oncse and a while that is to hit them. One day a person came alonged and help that person just left a paper behind thats all. The people opened it was paper to help to make tools. They got to work righ away. The tools worked! A man went to go tell the mean man. Once the man got the news he left. It took hours for him to get there but he did. Once he got there he was surspiersded he loved it. The people the man captured never finished its job so he killed them. He let get of the people those people made some good history. So the man deicsed to call it ''History Day.' The man how left behind the paper to make tools came. Almost died.

The archeologists find millions of things each year.   The mysterious fort was thought to be washed away by a river, but recently they found it!             A National Park Service found James Fort because they spotted the marks on the ground where James fot used to be.  the archiologists knew that the fort woulgd be triangular.  When the archiologists looked around and dug a little bit, they found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites and ten buildings all in the fort range. they almost found a million things in 1 year.  They discovered that the people there dug a well or a big pit to throw away their trash.  They also discovered that the settlers got into war with the Powharan tribe.  The settlers also faced hunger and difficult times with the Powhatan attacking.             It seems, to me, that discovering new things, such as things from a fort a long time ago , just by reading it, makes me excited that I may find something in my yard. (even though I don't want to destroy my yard)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	IN DT NN , JJ IN NNP NNP NNP NNP POS PRP MD VB IN WRB NNS VBN NNP NNP NNP NNS VBP NNS IN NNS DT NNP NNP JJ NN VBD VBN TO VB VBN RB IN DT NN , CC RB PRP VBD PRP .

They try to help us understand history more and more.They uncover history as if it were hapenning out our front door. With the amazing discoveries they have made and more great ones to come they don't have an easy job. They have to get all the research about something, predict if needed, and start digging. But, I know that it is worth it.        The whole team of archeologists are working all the time. Scientists in labs are looking at and identifying the artifacts while others are finding them. Both procceses take a lot of time but with the help they need they can make something amazing.When it comes to history they have to be working as ghard as they can and giving their work one hundred percent. they know what they are working for.       Being an archeologist takes a lot of hard work and determination. They also use a lot of tools in their work such as a whisk, dustpan, pick, shovel, trowel, knife, skim shovel, and a wheel barrow. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off and clear away dirt from the excavation site and arifacts. A pick and shovel of course dig to get to the artifacts while a trowel scrapes and cuts to view different types of soil. A skim shovel has a flat edge that is used to carefully remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. Also, a knife is used to scrape dirt away from around the artifacts. Finally, a wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt away from the excavation site or carefully carry artifacts.       Lots of archeologists around the world are looking for answers to mysteries that have come. They might just want to get a little more information about something but, either way they are helping us discover and uncover these mysteries. Some of these include finding the place where George Washington grew up or unlocking the mystery of finding where the mysterious Fort James was or where it went.

They have important jobs because they have to find important thing that happened.  People want to know what actually happened so they have to find proof. They have to find things about back then.  People sometimes depend on them because they want to know stuff about the cool things that they want to learn about.                            Archeologists are cool because they have to find historical things that happened.  They have to use imortant tools to find things they want to find.  It doesn't matter how old you are. Your class could have an activity like digging up old stuff or finding things you dont know about then you can do a research about it.                            These are the tools you might want to use for digging up things. You might want to have a pick, a shovel, a whisk an a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.  You can start your own bussiness if you want to. You can ask people if they want you to dig up things that they dont know about like a little box in the back of their yard.  It might be hard but it might be interesting.

And it takes a long time just to make a small opening in the ground. When they do this almost a week has past. Then they dig more dirt up because some things have aged and sunk into the ground. This whole process ia called a dig.         It is very hard to get through the rocks and dirt and they have to be very careful. I think archeoligists do a very good job by giving us information about our past. I think archeoligists deserve a break for once because they search and search all day mostly every day.

It requires a lot of skill, pateinece, and hard work.       It is not easy to be an archeologist, to find acient buildings from the 1200s to the dinosaur bones.             Archeologist is about finding artifacts old mostly.The pressure is also on you not to break a artifact like a dinosaur bone to an old brick from George Washington's house.         Archeologists' use all different types of tools like pickaxes, shovels, dust pans, paint brushes and wheelbarrels.       Archeologist would be a very fun and exiteing job to say you fiund an anceint artifact.  It would also be very boreing to sit there with a paint brush and swipe away dirt by the milimeter. Archeologists' find things for museums too i belive.  You would also get paid alot depending what the thing you found was.

To find stuff they have to use:       Pick and shovel Whist and Dustpan Knife wheelbarrow Skim shovel Trowel           All these thing is how they find these thing. When they find these thing they don't know exacly know what it is at first so they sometimes have to clean it, sometimes have to think what they can ust it for.       I think it would be fun to be a archeologist because you have to find stuff and experiment stuff to know to use it. Yes, it would be really hard but some people get the hang of it, some people don't.

Also you can find real bones of a real dinosaure.  Plus some people might say 'that the bones are so fragiel that if  you put to much preser on the bones they might brake'.  Also if you use a tool use it safely.                 My first reason is that if you touch a bones you have a big chance of brakeing them. My second reason is that if you use a tool to clean a dinosaure you use it carefly. My thired reason is that you can also see the dinosaur bones in a lot of musems. These are the tools you use Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, a Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and a Trowel and those are all the tools you can use.                  Also you can never predict what you will find underground.  You can find informational things underground.  Even you can see dinosaures put together.  You can also see paintings of dinosaures.  There are many diffrent kinds of dinosares.

How do the archelogists find all these things? The process of digging on farms are carful ones. Each year many teams will work on them.       There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area  using a 3D computer that can track underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.       Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat and sharp they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets dirt fall out while artifacts stay in.       The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can to two weeks a dig a 25 square foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects found. The whole process is tresome, but it's worth it. 	NNS IN NNP . . .

They use shovels and picks to find bones from long ago and find jewels. Kids use shovels to dig in sand and dirt so it's like they are trying to find artifact.        Archeologists also use 3D maps and cumputures to find where they are going to dig and where the place is where they wont to be.        Archeologists can find amazing things like artifacts,jewels,and underground tunnel and this informashen is important for stuff that can happen like we could use underground tunnels for boom shelters and maybe basses.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers from England came to start a new life. At first they thought that the fort was built near the water, so it was easier to dock ships. Later they found out that Jamestown was further away from water for protection from enemy ships.        In 1861 the first objects were discovered. The people were called, arceologists. They found armer, weapons, and valuable things. 100 years later they found the exact spot where the fort was.        The National Park Service led a five- year study on the area to figure out what the land was used for. The people studying used computer software to look at the images there.        That's when they found Jamestown!!! The things they found first were markings on the ground. The markings showed where the walls used to be. The arceologists discovered that Jamestown was in the shape of a triangle. They discovered that it stretched all the way to the river. They  realized that there were stone ledges to hold canons. The arceologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings in where Jamestown stood.        Today , the group finds about 1 million things a year. Such as pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys that kids used to play with. In the 1600s, people in Jamestown also through their garbage  down wells that they didn't use. The arceologists found some of their garbage, it was mostly bones from animals they ate. The information helps use understand how people lived back then. We now know how the settlers beat the indians that often attacked Jamestown. We also know how they survived those many years many years without that much food.        It must have been a big acomplishment finding Jamestown. Maybe someday you can be arceologist.   Part 2   The Discovery of Ferry Farm and George Washington        We all know that George Washington was a soldier and was the first president of the United States of  America or (U.S.A.). But something we do not know is his child hood.         We do know that he lived at Ferry Farm. The only thing is that there were four houses. They know there was a fire at his house. They also know that he smoked clay pipes which they found part of a clay pipe, so they have more proof that this is the right house. Now they know more about Washington's child hood.          Now you can be active by going to Ferry Farm, because there's many oppertunities for kids such as: workshops both indoor and outdoor activities. The kids can also experiance the life when the colonists lived, they can explore the sites, and become junior arceologists. Kids can also sign up for games, classes, and crafts. There's even a website!!!!! So come on down to Ferry Farm and enjoy the colonial life.

They can find many artifacts such as gold, bones(from dinasores),silver(items), and many more.They can even find things from famous people like George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr, Aberham Lincon, and many more.              The way they use tools is with a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel is used to start most digs.The whisk and dust pan is used to brush off dirt off the artifacts. The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt off the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used for carring items and artifacts.The skim shovel is used to remove layers of  soil with each scoop.The last tool  is a trowel  the trowel is used to scrape layers of soil.               The things they discover is more history from the artifacts they find . They learn more as they keep finding.                Thats the way they find artifacts use tools and what they discover so I need to end this story.

After they've done that they use the item to see how there life was like. Then they study the item to see if the item belongs to that person.          They also put some of their finds in the museum for entertainment. Some people take their hair and wear it. They take the hair to know what color his hair was. Then they also take it to the museum. That will show the secrets of someones life.Not only that they do, they also fine dinosaur bones, new minerals, and all kinds of stuff.          Archeologists use some tools in order to do their job. These are some tools they used: a pick and a shovel,whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel, and last but not least a trowel.They used those tools in order to dig,pick,or take their finds.          That is about it in what an archeologist does.You now know how archeologist find their items and unique secrets.

So I would like to tell you about tools that  archeologists use.                                             Archeologists have been studying history seen dinosaurs have roomed the Earth. Archeologists find bones from dinosaurs to. I thing archeologists have a great job. To do this archeologists have to use a Skim Shovel, a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of  ground with each scoop.         Archeologists also use a Pick and Shovel. Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the Earth close to the artifacts.The pick is used for when they are by a mountain or a hill that they need to get in. And I know you know what a shovel is used for.          They also use Trowel. Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of  soil. Probably used when they are looking for something that is underground.           That is all. I could say more but I am running out of paper. So that is all I have to say. So bye.

They go to a lab and look at the ground before they dig. Archeologists put the bones together.     There are two groups one goes to the lad the other digs. They do alot of stuff by digging alot. Archeologists use skim shovels to move thin dirt. They dig up 25,000 tons of dirt before the find anything.         They dig up alot of the past. Archeologists swich places alot of the time. It takes a year to dig a 25 feet sqaire. Then archeologists find the past of one thing. That is why archeologists use alot of stuff.

Archeologists final all of these things that were in Washinton's house was by doing the process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 pople on one team. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track underground.The informatrion is used so that kids and people all over the world can learn about the past and the mistakes that they made.

This important to all of us  because if there were no archeologists we would not know much about history in the old days this is why they are important to us so we would understand the things that the people had done back then in the old days.

There job is to study objects from the past. And what kinds of things happened in the past. And they can uncover armor and weapons. And with George Washington  they believed that the stone base under the house was still there. And they started digging in 2003. It took over a year,but they finally found it.The first buildings they found were the kitchen,slave quarters, and storage houses.They found the main farmhouse a few years later. On the mission to dig up the farmhouse up to 35 people were on the team.       And now I am going to talk about their tools they were really cool one of them were a pick and a shovel. And here is some information about those two. Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth,close to the artifacts. Now about the whisk and dustpan. Here is some information. It's used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.         And now two more pair of information about the tools. One is the knife it is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. And we have the wheelbarrow. and some information about that is it is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.            And now the last two pieces of information. One is the skim shovel and here is some information about it. A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. And another one is a trowel and here is some information about it. Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                                                             THE END!

When GeorgeWashington was a little boy he lived in a little house with his family.He was a 6 years old and when the time past they moved to a prarie that they bought.In that house that they moved from was a fire .In the time archeologist went to the house to look for things.          Archeologist were digging and searching for things. here are some thing that they used to help them they used a pick and shovel to dig for interesting things.They used a wisk and a dustpan to take dirt off the artifact.The most important things that you need are a wheel barrow that carries dirt away to another place for they could work,map of the place and a 3d computer.          Mr. Washinton later became the president of the United States of America.When he was anouncing something he got shot and wasn't the president any more.they were loking around for who it was.But didn't see him.

912	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	A		N	F	652141	5	11067925	Y	56274	     The job of an archeologist would be interesting but this is how they work. An archeologist works by finding objects of  past people and studying the object. They find the artifacts by digging with a trowel,skim shovel, or pick and shovel. Once they dig far enough and they found artifacts they study them by what they are and what they were used for. They also have to find the location by using a map.       Then when they find the location they use a 3-D computer to see whats underground and when they get what is under they record it so the people that dig know what to find. They also work by having a team that works on locating where the digging will happen. Once they know where to dig they use a skim shovel to do most of the digging, a skim shovel is used to remove thin layers of soil.  After they dig all the way down and found an object they use a trowel to carefully scrape or cut most of the dirt off.  Also while digging they need to get all of the dirt out of the way so they use the wheelbarrow, while using the wheelbarrow they don't just use it for dirt but also to take an object back that is to big to carry.         While digging they would have to find clues about if it is the right location and is this really the persons place of memories. When archeologist dig they don't always use a skim shovel,  they don't always use it because once they get  close to the object they would start to use a pick and shovel but sometimes these tools are used for the beginning of most digs.  If you are thinking why they do all of this well here's why  they do it to find out more about the past and about the person so we can understand their life more.       Being an archeologists is hard because if they are looking for an object that is 100 years ago they need to find they exact spot for that object.  An archeologist also has to careful while digging because if they dig to low and somebody didn't know someone may fall in.  Also with  the tools they need to be careful cause the knife would be one that they need to be careful with cause someone may get hurt while digging with it or scraping dirt off with it.  They also need to be careful with the pick because if some dropped it  they may get knocked right out of the head.  An archeologist also has to be careful with all artifacts they find.       They have to be careful with artifacts cause some may be fragile and if they drop the artifact it may get ruined and then they can't study the artifact. So, that is how an archeologist would work.

If you're an archeologist you can find out more about a persons life, and their career. They could get hundreds of dollars being an archeologist. They could get money for doing this by finding rare items and selling them at public auctions and get money for them. It's their decision if they want to keep it, or give it up for money. The job of an archeologist is a special job because you can see a persons past. An archeologists is a person who loves the future and would like to find out more about a person.  An archeologists could even find out about and Native Americans that like about 1,000 years ago they don't just have to find out only about famous people. That is what is an archeologist is.         Two weeks worth of work            Every thing an archeologist does it takes them a while to do it. They would put like two weeks into working as an archeologist.  As said in the article Digging up George Washington's Past they found burnt clay pots so they think there was a fire in that house. That tells us more about the persons life already. That explains that it took them a while to figure out what happend at that house. When they find an artifact they would have to do research on the artifact. When your an archeologist you use many tools one is the shovel. the shovel is small so it take you along time to take a big piece of land. They also use whisk and dustpans. They use the whisk and dustpans for taking dirk off the artifact so they can see what it is. Now you know that the shovel is small so it would take a while to dig up a big chunk of land. Another tool is a skim shovel. they use skim shovels to take a lair of dirt off so they can see whats under the dirt and see if there is artifacts.       At the end           At the end they have to find out a lot information about what they found. Then they have to put it up for public auction or you can keep the artifact. That is when the might move to another person or stay to the same person and find out more about that person. The person can have proof that he found out something about his\her favorite person and or just a person. They could stop when they find an artifact  but they might be so happy that they might not want to stop.

If you answered yes then the job of an archeologists is for you.  The job of an archeoleogists is tiring but achvieble.  Sometimes you might not find anything. Other days you'll just have to see for yourself.  Your job will have challenges but you will be achvieble.        You could find some facinating things.  From the 1800 to 1600 heck mabe even from the 1500.  Like in 1994 when archeologists found out that in 1607 fort  james was made by settelers to have a new better life.   History can be amazing.         This job can inform people.  You'll be suprised about the way people lived in the old times.  From toys to how much techonogly has grown.  Plus your artifacts may bring in some money as in khaching.  This job can uncover the history.          Archeologists have a rough job. They spend hours even days trying to find one artifact.  It takes time and effort.  Blood, sweat, and tears.This is a job that is tough and rough.          The job also has some advantage.  One thing you could find is Geogre Washington's old patroit uniform.  You could also find Abe Lincon's old hat.  These artifacts would give you a load of money.  These are the advantages of being an arceologists.           You'll have to have certain tools.  One tool yuo will use is the knife which cuts around artifacts without damging  them.  You will also use The skim shovel which removes one layer of soil in one scoop!  Finnaly to move items one place to another you use the wheelbarrel.  Those are important tools.           So if you want a hands on job? Then job of an archeologists is the job for you.  Brief summary: The job of an arceologists is rough but has advantages.  You'll need special tools. This job is for skilled people so if your up to the challenge become an archeologists today.                   	DT NN IN DT NNPS NNP PRP VB DT NNS IN NN .

There are 3 main groups.  Group 1 does the mapping.  Group 2 does the digging.  Group 3 finally does the lab work and research.                     Mapping It Out                   Group 1 as I told you before so you should know that this group maps the site out. The map it out part is done using a 3D computer.  The reason archeologists do this is to show the diggers where to dig.  This to me means saving time for more exploration of the dig.  More exploration means more time to lengthen the part of ground dug in.  If you thought this group was awesome wait till you hear about group 2 the diggers.           The Dig                    The diggers, or group 2 as I like to call them or course by the name do the digging.  Digging requires experience you cant just walk over to a dig site and start digging.  With this experience the dig of a site weather it is of George Washington old farm house.  Or maybe even a dig of Fort James the dig takes 35 weeks give or take a few.  While digging the archeologists dig up a layer of soil or dirt or what ever and put it in a bucket with a 1/2 screen at the bottom.  The screen helps the dirt go out and the artifacts if any stay in.            Lab Work                     Finishing up the proses the 3rd group takes the artifacts and takes them to a lab.  At the lab they figure out what they are a part of and where they came from and sometimes what they were used for.  For example in the dig at Washington's old farm house they found a piece of old pipe.  The pipe suggested that Washington left it behind when he left.                          Reading this story really made me want to be an archeologist when I grow up but still maybe a marine biologist.

They thought that it was located at the river but then they realized that it was far away from the river to protect it from enemy ships.The first objects to ever be found was in 1861 they found armor, weapons, and the building floors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The national park service had a five year study on the area and try to see how the land was used. This would help decide were the fort might be. The group used computer mapping to find an image of the area. The first thing they found were marks were the wall had been. the stories that they had heard led them to believe that the fort had been a triangle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     they had made maps of the area showing that the fort stretched to the river. There they found that a tone wall was lined down the river, they were meant to hold canons. They also found 11 cellars dozens of burial sites and 10 buildings within the wall. Today they find around 1,000,000,000 items a year, they include tools, coins, mettle toys for children, and pottery.            During the 1600s, people threw there trash down a pit or dried up well. while digging they found one of these pits it had the bones of eaten animals in it. The things we found and are still finding help you learn about how the early settlers lived. We know that the powhatan Indians attacked them. We also now know what the settlers did during the time of starvation.

All these jobs are stated here in this essay:                  First, an archeologist digs for artifacts. He/she uses tools like picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels to dig for artifacts under the ground very easily, and quickly!                  Next, an archeologist examines ground for the remains of any forts, or ancient houses. This relates to Fort James and George Washington's house. Archeologists looked for remains of these ancient places, found their locations, and then dug!                  Finally, an archeologist might use computers to plot where things are underground. This way, he/she will know what they will dig for, and what is under them. If a giant water pipe that can easily be cracked is under them, they won't dig under them and create a giant water fountain! Instead, they will use the computers to find where something of a high cost is hidden. This way, they have a higher chance of finding a valuable ancient artifact quickly.                  As you can see, these are all the jobs that an archeologist does at work. These jobs are digging for artifacts, examining the ground for remains, and using computers to generate graphs of things under the ground. all these qualities used together, along with patience makes a archeologist successful.

They discover secrets from all kinds of different places, such as James Town. A National Park Service led a five-year study, they found James Fort. The first thing they found was a few marks on the ground, these marks showed where the fort's walls used to be.Between all the stories they heard, the archeologist knew the fort would be shaped like a triangle.They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. the ledges were designed to hold cannons. they found eleven cellars, dozens of burial places, and they found ten buildings all within border of the fort.                        Today, groups find almost 1 million things a year.People find pottery, coins, tools, and metal toys. They fond the bones of animals they ate.People back then used unused wells to put there trash, or big pits.It's exciting to find and object that was used back then.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who started the American colonies.                        A lot of what we know about George Washington has come from the time he was a solider and a president. Biographies do not have much information on his childhood. Recent discovers at Washington's childhood home have help historians know a lot more information on George Washington.people have lived at a place called ferry farm for over 12,000 years. No one knew exactly where   Washington house was located. People believe that the stone base was still there. The found a few things years later.

It was used find the secrets of the fort. For over 200 years people thought it was washed away. It might still be in the area.              The fort was built in 1607 for settlers from England to start a new life. Believers said it was built by a river. It was put there for boats to dock. The fort was moved for protection from enemy ships.        In 1861 objects were found by archeologists .They have found armor,shields,and weapons.   100 years later they have found the exact location where it was built.        National parks have set up a five-yer study on it . The archeologists used this to see if it was the right location. They used 3-D computers to see what it really looked like.

Next, they find the objects and dig them up to send to scientists. After that, the scientists look at the objects and research on it and then they restore it to it's original form.

He was also in the army.In the 1800.         lets talk amberham lincon. He was or sixteenth president he grew up in a log cabin. He was in the army to. He was really tall.I think he was like 8 feet tall. He also lived in a small town.         There is also a lot of stuff  that might cost alot of money. You can find gold. You can find stuff that is heding plases. They could have stuff that cost more then 200,000 dallors. Many peoplelike loking for stuff like an anvencher.

They find evedence on what they did back then like shot guns, built cabons, and fired cannons. They also are the people who reashered dinosaurs. They reasherd dinosoars because they know that it is a past creature. they would also reasearch what they ate their habitats their bones. All those things are things they have found. Archeoligy has gone a long way since it has started today archeoligist are finding past evedence like fossils, bones, carved wood, and more. Archeoligist  are cooming back with a skim shovel. The skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Archeoligist would use this shovel to dig up flat hard layers of  rock or hidden artifacts. A nother tool archeoligist use is a knife. This is used for carving out artifacts. this is how they find the good in the fossils. That is all I have to tell you about fossils.

Over 1,000 amazing items.                        Just think about all that amazing stuff you could find if you were an archeologist, it would be crazy.

Archaeologist have to try not to break an artifact or we can't learn much from it. Being an archeologist is hard work because you need to know where to look for an artifact. Most archeologist use high tech equipment like 3D maps that can track what is underground.       Back when we didn't have all the high tech we do today archaeologist had to dig in many different places until they found something to dig up. Since there wasn't backhoes back then all they had to dig with was shovels. They usually go to somewhere that had a flood a long time ago. Archeologist hope that there is something that is interesting about the worlds past.       Archaeologist usually have a team in which help (him/her) to dig more in a shorter time. They will most likely set up a camp at the dig site to stay near it just in case someone else tries to claim the site. Most dig sites have one person in charge of things like how many people should dig in what area or who stays and who goes. Usually the person in charge of the dig supplies the money for it.

Arceologist are people who search for artifacts that are important to history and life of great famous people or people who did such great things to the world and support it. Like scientist with there inventions                Archeology is an imporant task because you can find stuff that is valueble and that can be collected or sold.It is not just a simple object it is an artifact that has to do something in history.              If you want to be an archeologist you need to know what your doing what your looking for and how it works and what you need. If you want to be an arceologist you need to know a lot about history in the olden days.                 Hopefully, one day you get to know a lot about history and, What is  archeology? You'll need to have Knowledge and education in history.   	NNP WP VBP VBP .

In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past of the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological project                        the project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, virginia. For over 200 years,                        people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. The first object was found in 1861 over 100 years                        later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.The first thing they found was a set of                        markers showed where the fort's walls used to be.It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by                        people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started                        the american colonies.they made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.Then they                        realized there were stones ledges bulit over the river.The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection                        from enemy ships.They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.The archaeologists                        also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.                                 Now you know how the fort james was discovered and jamestown too now you dont need to learn about the                        fort james, and the jamestown thing too i think with out the report i wouldn't know about the fort james, jamestown                        now  the story i mean the report was all about fort james and the jamestown all that was true things from the report                        now brag to your friends that you know about fort james and the jamestown.                                                                        ??                                                                                   Digging up George Washington's past                                 This this report is going to be based on the childhood and the life of george washington and how he became famous  and how they discovered george's house in ferry farm and how they found evidenced and the proof that the house under the dirt is george    washington's house true or not read the report to find out if it is true or false.                                                                                                                                                                           People have lived in the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000years.Its location makes it a perfect place to bulid a home.      it's not surprising because george's dad augustine washington, moved his family there. george was just six years old at that time.      No one knew exactly where the washington home was located since the actual buliding was no long gone. However archeologists      believed that the stone base under the house was still there.They started digging in 2003.It took over a year, but they finally found it.

It could be boring, but it could be exciting at the same time. Also an archeologists is a person that finds and studies objects from the past. An archeologists is an important person because with out them we wouldn't know the person that are famous how they begin there childhood and what happened to them. Also you will need a team to help you and you will need tools.                                                                                       When you are using tools you need to be gentle. If you are not being gentle and you found something it could break because its over 100 years or more. The most safest and gentle tools are a pick, a shovel, a whisk, dustpan, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.A pick and shovel gets you close to the object. A whisk and a dustpan clears the object and removes dirt. A knife is to scrape of the doirt and use for careful digging. A wheelbarrow could move items and carry dirt. a skim shovel has a flat edge so you can use to carefuly remove a thin layer of soil . A Trowel is use to scrape and cut layers of soil.                                                                                        It could take a long time when you are looking for something. It could take for years. you could feel bored when it takes a lot or it could be exciting because you are looking for something you'll never know. You got to take your time. Be patient, and try your best!                                                                                       When your an archeologists, be sure to be patient and be exciting. I know it could take a long time, but you could do it. Be exciting because your finding something that no one ever seen. So be encourage of yoursely and be Happy!

I am not a Archeologist but I would not use a tool to put a artifact in because another person might go and put that tool away and might not see ( need good eyes ). I would not think a Archeologist is easy because you have to spent ALOT of time digging the artifacts up and cleaning them and they might be too heavy to carry.                       BE CAREFUL!!!!   You would have to know how to use all the special tools a Archeologist may use such as a wheelbarrow. For example you might be moving dirt around another person and you might step or run the artifact over.   When you use the knife tool you might break the artifact or damage and you might not get to know what that meant. Same with the pickaxe and the shovel you might be digging with the shovel or be mining with the pickaxe and damage the artifact.                    IS THAT ONE?????       Archeologist Have to have really good eye sight because you might have found a artifact but you thought it was a rock or a clump of dirt. Archeology would be important so we know thinks that we did not know from the past.

They also find artifacts about the people in history. For example when they were finding fort James, they found weapons and armor.          Archeologist also have speacial computers that help track what is underground. The diggers found burnt pottery in washingtons house. He had a fire in his house. Digging is called a dig. They have to get dirty. Diggers have to go down and dig dig dig. Sometimes they could find things they are ot trying to find like gold. in fort James they found floors of buildings. Some people thought it was wased away. Some discovered in the area hinted it was still there.

Archeologists progress has been high because the first objects have been found in 1861.        George Washington used to live in Ferry Farm and archeologist have found burnt pottery and clay pipes. Few pieces of fort james have been found but we are sure to find more. we have had luck and have found coin, trash and metal toys for kids.        Now you know that archeologists are on the job for looking for the artifacts that have been lost for decades. Even you can join them by looking around and finding things.

Archaeologist find out the past for everyone to know about the past. Some archaeologist job is to maps the area using the 3D computers to to track what is underground. Other archaeologist job is to dig underground to find the artifacts. Another archaeologist spend days in the lab studying the objects that are found. It toke a long time for the archaeologist to know the truth about the past.       For example it take archaeologist over 100 years to find James Fort exact area where the fort was built. Then they used computer mapping software to make an image of the area of the fort use to be. They found a marks on the ground, it showed where the fort's wall used to be. That when they know they found James Fort.          Another example is archaeologist want to know where George Whasington's framhouse. It take up two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section. And it take days for the other archaeologist to study the the objects that are found in the lab.The process was slow and tire but now they know where George Washington's farmhouse is.

The main idea of an archeoloist is to dig up stuff from the past.           The tools of an archeologist ar pick axes and to types of shovels.The shovels are your shovels that have the pointed end and the skim shovels that have flat edges on it. We also use whisks , dustpans , knives , wheelbarrows , and trowels.

Archeologist not only get to uncover dinosaur bones but they also get to uncover historical which I think is an amazing opportunity!                                                Being an archeologist isn't easy! I  am not an archeologist so I have no experience but I have read many articles on the hard work and precision you need to be able to uncover the past. Archeologist aren't the only ones who help bring back the past but they do play a major role. An archeologist must be very careful when digging up bones to be sure that none of the bones were snapped or broken. Some of the tools that the archeologist must use are a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. Most of the time when bones are found they need to be dusted or brushed off, that's where the precision comes to play.            Archeology isn't just digging up dinosaur bones! Archeologist have really amazing jobs, they not only look for dinosaur bones but sometimes they get to dig historical figures. Digging historical figures is a super precise job and not only does it take time and precision but it also takes patience. When they dig historical figures they need to be very careful that they do not rupture any wonderful artifacts. If any artifacts are ruined I have there is way to put to the bones back together, but I'm  pretty sure archeologist try for no bones to break. I think it's an amazing opportunity to be able to dig up a historical figure especially someone like George Washington. Finding the perfect spot wasn't that hard, but it's not always that easy.         An archeologist  uses tools everyday! When they use tools they have to make precise cuts and scrapes. Pick and Shovel, most digs start with pick and shovel because you have to make the first hole with the regular shovel unless you are only cutting off a very thin layer. Whisk and Dustpan, used to brush off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. Knife, used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow, used to move items from one place to another or to carry the dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel, a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Trowel, probably the most common used tool in archeology. used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.          If  you haven't noticed already archeology is a very big job! You get to learn new things and get to experience amazing opportunities. I think digging up historical figures is the best part!

Have you ever wondered how archealologists find achent items?  Well they also have to find the right spot, and  they have to have all of the right tools.       The first thing that archeaologists have to do is find the right spot. They can do this by looking for an anchent place. They also need to get everything to that place and find out exactly where to dig so they can start the dig.They also use a high tehc 3D computer to map out the area that they are at and it can also see whats under the ground.       Next they have to get all of the right tools for the dig before they start. They have to have a pick and shovel so they candig into the ground close to the artifacts,a whisk and dustpan to clear away dirt on the artifact and from the site,a knife used to carfaly to get dirt out of all the noocs and cranes, a wheelbarrow to cary heavy artifacts,a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of the earth near the artifact,and a trowel to scrap and cut to see the different layers of the earth.       Now you know how the job of anarcheaologist is almost every day.     	NN NN NN . '' NN DT NNP NNP VBD NN CC PRP VBZ IN DT NN NN . JJ NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WRB NNS VBP NN NNS .

We know about every president and his years as one. Also we know about every famous soldier. What makes Washington so different from the rest?  Archeologist help find what made Washington different. Most of the biographies    don't have very much on his childhood. Well, that is all about to change. As years go past, archeologists are finding more and more artifacts about Washington's childhood.       People have lived on land known  Ferry Farm for more than 12,000 years. This location makes a perfect place to build a home. So, it is not suprising that     Augustine Washington, Washington&acute;s farther moved there. Since at least four other houses  have been built on the Ferry Farm, archeologist have to find proof that Washington and his family were living there at a time.           Records show that the Washingtons had a fire in their house. To prove that,    Archeologist found piecies of burnt pottery. The diggers also found piecies to clay pipes. We know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so that gives more proof that it is the right house.           The discovery of Washington&acute;s home is very improtant to many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who                  George Washington was before he became our first president. We also begin to know why he made the decsions he did. Another thing is it histortians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. Alll of these things are the key parts of our past of Americans.

Then, you map out the are to make sure it is the right place.  After that, you have to start digging until you find artifacts.  When you found some artifacts you have to dig around them careefully to make sure the atifact doesn't break.  Then, you carefully take it out and take a whisk and start to brush dirt off the artifact carefully.            When you are done with that you give the artifact to another archeologist and they will take it somewhere.  After you find another artifact you take a knife to carefully dig around the artifact to get it out.  When you get it out you take a whisk and clean it.  Once you are done with that you have to take all the artifacts and make sure all the dirt is off it.  Then you take all off them to a plce where people put them in a museum.  An archeologists job is alot of hard work, but it is worth it.

Many search for artifacts from years ago, but they all do the same thing.       Archeology is very interesting in my opinion. You get to find things that maybe no human being has ever discovered in history. Archeology helps uncover the mysteries of long ago.       Archeologists use many different tools to help them find things. There are picks and shovels, whisks and dust pans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels and trowels. The tools all have different purposes.       I enjoy writing about things that interest me. I also like learning about ancient artifacts and my history. I truly think that archeology is a great topic to learn about.

Many of these are very old and breakable, so they have to be careful. In order not to break old items hey must use different tools.They will use tools such as a knife, weelbarrow, trowel and shovels.Useing all of these tools an archeologist can discover many cool /rare things.                       One cool thing they have found is Gorge Washington's house. They had to dig for a long time to uncover this historical place. A clue that signald that they were in the right place was the clay pipe that GW's father smoked.Also they found burnt property there.Records show that Gorge Washington's house had a fire so it would make sense that things were burnt.

Archeologist have an important roll in fing history about places.They dig up atfifacts from the past.They often do jobs that are discovering something from the past. They have to use certain tools and procedures when finding artifacts.               Archeologist use many tools. The most important one is the skim shovel. The skim shovel allows them to dig up very thin layers of soilm at a time. A wisk and dust pan are very useful when digging. If you find an artifact the wisk and dust pan are used to brush of the excess dirt of an artifact. The trowel is one of the most common tool in acheology. It is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. The other tools are the wheelbarrow, a pick and shovel and a knife.                In archeology their are many important tasks to get the job done right. There are two different 'teams' in archeology. One team maps they area digging on a 3-D computer that can track underground. That team also figures out what to look for before the digging starts. Another team does the actual digging. They start their job using a skim shovel. If the archeologist come about an artifact the soil it is in will be placed in a wooden box with a half inch screen at they bottom of it. That allows dirt to fall through and the artifact stay in the box.This is when they use a paint bruch, small shovels and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifact.                 I hoped you learned about archeologist tools and their many tasks in this essay.

In 1994, a group of people interasted in studying the past started the Jamestown, Virgina. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sence that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearly suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably from enemy ships.The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. Thay also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

Archeologist are important in the world because they help us learn about history.     Archeologist find artifacts on different things.Archeologist work at different places from long ago to find information on back a long time ago.This informational report is going to tell about the job of an Archeologist.           Long ago a group of people were interested in studying the past start of different areas which was the Archaeological Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of different areas from long ago.Archeologist are the people to go and look for different things from long ago and study the past time.Archeologist go and search for things like old clothing,homes,and more of things from American history.Archeologist thinks it is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.           Archeologist work at different places that they go to find materials.From along ago people may have put some things in the ground so Archeologist go and work by digging up dirt to find materials.When Archeologist discover materials from long ago it is also very important to them because they had to work hard to find those things.When Archeologist work they help historians learn about the tpye of life Americans lived.Everything that an Archeologist works for are key parts of our past of Americans.           Americans should be very proud of Archeologist because if it was not for them then we could not know a lot about history now.Archeologist help us Americans a lot by discovering old materials.Archeologist work very hard when they find things from long ago to help us learn.When Archeologist discover things they also learn too because they might not have known some facts about a person and when they find things themselves then they learn more.Archeololgist find very interesting artifacts on Americans long ago.

In this report I will be discussing the job of an archeologist. The job of an archeologist is difficult, but can be very interesting. An archeologist uses many tools and has to know how to use all of them and to do their job.          The job of an archeologist is very difficult. For example it may take years to excavate one dig.An example of this is when the James Fort was being excavated, it took over five years. Another difficulty of being an archeologist is that you have to work very carefully. An archeologist must also work very hard digging and looking. Archeologists have to be very smart, because they need to be able to date things, to know how to map their surroundings,and many more things. These are some of the things that make being an archeologist so difficult.          Although an archeologist's job is hard it is also very interesting. An example of how an archeologist's job is interesting is when they make an amazing find. An archeologist gets to meet many different people and go many places, which can make their job very interesting. May we not leave out the things that archeologists find that have changed history. These are some of the many interesting parts of being an archeologist.         An archeologist uses many tools and does many things. The one thing archeologists are known for is digging, but they do a lot more than dig. An archeologist dates things, has to talk about what they find, and a lot of other things. An archeologist uses many tools here are some of them a pick, a shovel, a whisk, a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, a trowel, and many other things. These are the tools and some of the things an archeologist does.        In this report I talked about the job of an archeologist. I talked about how difficult and interesting an archeologists job is. I also talked about the things an archeologist does. I lastly talked about the tools an archeologist uses. I hope You enjoyed my report on the job of an archeologist.

I will first tell you what an archeologists is then how careful they have to be and how boring there jobs are. Last I will tell you what tools they use. First is what are archeologists.       WHAT ARE ARCHEOLOGISTS           Archeologists are people who find artifacts from history. In two sorces that I read I found out that they have found many important artifacts in history. If we did not have archeologists we would not know about what dinosores look like or important information that we know today. So that is why I am going to tell you know.       WHY ARE ARCHEOLOGISTS SO SLOW           Archeologists are not slow they are careful. I they were not they could break important artifacts or hurt themselfs. The tools archeologists use are sharp and could hurt them easily. And because they are so sharp they could also break thier artifacts. This explains why thier jobs are boring. They just sit there and work on something that may take months to uncover.       WHAT TOOLS DO ARCHEOLOGISTS USE         Pick and Shovel Whisk and Dustpan Knife Wheelbarrow Skim Shovel   Trowel            Archeologists are cool people. I would love to be an archeologist when I grow up. I wonder what kind of rocks they find. I gusse that will  be my next paper.

Archeologist have 35people on a team. The first team maps  the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The shovel they use  are small, flat, and sharp that can remove thin layers one at a time.  That  soil is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts sty in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Another team spends days inte lab studying objects that are found in the whole prcess  is slow and tiresome , but its worth it. the diggers also uses a process called troweling it is when they use shovels, paint brushes, and picks to remove dirt.It takes up two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section.

For exampl, maybe they wanted to find Aberham Lincons hat,  or Amelia Airherats plane.  There is not only a group that digs but there i also a group that looks at the item to see if its afake or to just expirement it.       They dont just have to be from the olden days but usually it is.  In source #2 it says That the archeologists started digging for the stone base under George Washingtons house in 2003 and it took them over a year.  So they dig in order to find things and they use  	DT NN IN DT NNS VBZ DT TO VB NN IN JJ IN DT NN NNS CC PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ NNP NNP NN , RB PRP VBD TO VB NNP NNP WDT , CC NNP NNPS NNP NNP VBZ RB RB DT NN WDT VBZ CC EX PRP RB DT NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN TO VB IN PRP$ NN CC TO RB NN NNP NNP NN RB VBP TO VB IN DT NN NNS CC RB PRP NNP NNP NN # CD PRP VBZ IN DT NNS VBD VBG IN DT NN NN IN NNP NNPS NN IN CD CC PRP VBD PRP IN DT NNP NNP PRP VBP IN NN TO VB NNS CC PRP VBP

A famous person from the past I would want to find an artifact about would be Amelia Earhart's hat and goggles.  Being an Archeologist wouldn't be fun because you don't find a whole ton of things and most of the time you are digging and carefully sorting through dirt till you find something.

It gives citizens of the u.s. a better understanding who gorge Washington was when he was famous. It was a type of life colinal Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.            Most of what we know about gorge Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood. That's changing, however. Recent discoveries at Washington childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.                         No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone. However, archeologists believed that the stone                                                                                                                           	DT NN IN NNP POS NN VBZ JJ IN JJ NNP NNP VBZ VBZ IN DT NNP DT JJR NN WP NN NNP VBD WRB PRP VBD NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN NN JJ NNS NNP NNP IN DT NNS VBP JJ NNS IN PRP$ JJ IN NNP NNP IN WP PRP VBP IN NN NNP VBZ IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN CC NNP NNPS VBP RB VB RB RB NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP POS VBG , NNP NNP NNS IN NNP NN NN VBP VBN NNS VB RBR IN NNP IN DT NNP NNP CD JJ RB WRB DT NNP NN VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN VBD JJ NNP NNP , VBZ VBN IN DT NN

When they dig they dig for old artifacts such as dinosaur bones or pottery. When they find one artifact it could lead to another discovery which could lead to another.         For example digging up George Washington's past could have some imformation about his friends and family. It could also have imformation about where he lived and how he got to be the president and so much more.         If you were a archeologist you would have a hard life but fun because if you find something it will go down in history.

An archeologist tools help them to uncover artifacts.when you are digging you have to be careful not to harm the artifacts.many archeologist use a pick and a shovel.Most digs start off with a pick and a shovel to dig close to the artifacts.They also use whisk and dustpans, these help them to carefully remove dirt from the artifact.Knifes are also used to carefully dig around the artifact.A wheelbarrow is also used to remove dirt and artifacts from a site.Skim shovels are also used to carufully remove layers of soil.One of the most common tools is the trowel which gives different angles of the soil.       To find Washington`s home, computers set up a 3D layout of the area where they thought the stone base where the house once stood would be.Even though there were many homes on Ferry Farm, where Washington lived, the tean knew this was the Washington`s home ,why? According to record the Washington home had a fire.The team has found a burned clay pot. There was also a clay pipe. According to record George smoked a clay pipe.       I hope you have enjoyed my paper on archeologist tools, and the digging of the Washington home.I learned that archeologist have found the Washington home. I also learned about the tools archeologist use.If I did another paper it would be on George Washington because I would like to learn more about him 	NNP IN : NNP NNP NNP NN VBZ NNP NNP CC PRP VBP RB NNS -NONE- NN VBZ IN JJ NNS VBP IN WP NNS VBP NN , CC DT NN RP IN DT NN NNP NNP VBD IN IN DT NN VBZ PRP TO VB IN DT NNP NN PRP VBP PRP$ NNP NNP NN NNS VBP PRP TO VB JJ PRP VBP VBG PRP VBP TO VB JJ RB TO VB DT JJ NN NN DT NN CC DT JJ NNS VBP RP IN DT NN CC DT NN TO VB JJ TO DT JJ RB VBP NN CC NNS , DT NN PRP TO RB VB NN IN DT NNS VBP RB VBN TO RB JJ IN DT NNP NN VBZ RB VBN TO VB NN CC NNS IN DT JJ NNS VBP RB VBN TO RB VB NNS IN JJ IN DT RBS JJ NNS VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP VB JJ NN , NNS VBD RP DT JJ NN IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD DT NN NN WRB DT NN RB VBD MD VB IN EX VBD JJ NNS IN NNP NNP , WRB NNP VBD , DT JJ NN DT VBD DT JJ NN , WRB .

Being a Archeologist is fantastic because you use dangeres tools like the knife or the pike and shovel.those tools are dangeres because you may cut a finger or something else thats why i think those tools or dangeres. Archeologist is fun and intresting too because you learn about long time ago people becuse for example you get to learn probably there porsonal stuff and another example is you get to know what they like or what they likeded to do more.

I'll tell you what  I think of the job of an archaeologist.       In my opinion I would like to be an archaeologist and I wouldn't.I would like to be an archaeologist because you can learn about the past and how people lived. For example, maybe you wanted to learn about Abraham Lincoln. So you could become an archaeologist and find artifacts that teach you more about his life.       I wouldn't want to become an archaeologist because I'm not very patient and if you want to become an archaeologist you have to have lots of patience.? Say you were digging for something and you knew exactly where it is, but it's way far down in the ground. It would take a very long time to get it out so you would have to require lots of patience.  That's why I would not want to become an archaeologist.             	DT NN VBZ DT NN WP NNS VBP JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP MD VB CD IN DT JJS NNS IN DT NN CC VBZ PRP .

They need to be good at computers because they might have to plot the land befor the construction workers tear it up! that is another thing you have to be good at, construction. You have to be good at construction because you dig up stuff deep in the ground.                An architect is someone who digs up old foundations or uses a computer to map the land before and after the foundation is doug up. They do this to find old stuff and belongings.               In 1994, architects began the James town rediscovery archaeological  project. They wanted to find out the secrets to the James Fort in Verginia. The National Park service led a 5-year study of the area. The people that used the computers used software mapping to make an image of the area. That helped them succeed big time!!!!!!               They use the pick and shovel to start the dig. Then, they use the wisk and dust pan to brush and carry the dust away from the site.

Well when being a archeologist its not just digging around its way more its finding pieces that could change how kids study it could uncover new thing for museums and more.                        To be a archeologist you have to love the out doors because your outside a good amount. Also you have tohave patines because its not like your going to find something in a split second and lastly you have to be willing to learn                         The good things about being a archeologist is that you it to be the first to get to discover these things. also there are helpful tools that can be used to carry to dig and even to uncover new things.              The bad thing is how long it could take to just fing a little thing. Also the hard work that is put in to find pieces.               I concluded that archeologist can have a hard tiring job but in the end it doesnt matter because of all the amazing things found.So if you want to be a archeologist you have to STUDY hard and work hard.

They find imporiant things that help people learn about what really happened in the past. Some people decide to become an Archeologist for many reasons. Some for the money , because after they find these imporiant things they can sell for lot's of money. Others because they just love history and want to learn more about it.            Many imporiant things have been found over the years by Archeologists, but how do they find these things I mean they can't just be laying on the ground super  easy to see! So Archeologist have to use special tools. For example they use a skim shovel, a skim shovel has a flat edge meant to remove one layer of dirt at a time. This helps with finding artfacts hidden under the dirt. They also use a whisk and a dustpan which they can use to brush little pieces of dirt off at a time.           If you want to be an archeologist you better be ready to get dirty because almost all of the artfacts will be underground so don't wear your nice clothes! But other then that being an Archeologist can be exicting and an awesome learnig experence and hey, who knows one day you might find an artifact that will change how we thought about the pass forever.

An archeologist is a person who finds artifacts about things like life back in the day.Archeologists also finds bones from what is now dinosaurs they brush them off carefully then bring it to a museum for people to see.                First, we need to see what they do and what the teams are? The archeologist comes in teams of 35 people and the teams try to figure out where the bones are.Some tools they use is the pick and the shovel, the whisk and dust pan, the knife,and etc.The pick and the shovel are used for digging up the earth to get close to the artifact the whisk and the dust pan is used to brush the dirt off of the artifact and finally the knife is used to scrape the dirt off of the artifact.                Secondly, One team of archeologist get the artifacts by a 3-D computer and it tells them what is under the ground then it is recorded so they know where it is! The other team does the digging and they are called the dig team. A fact is that the team that digs, it can take up to a week to dig a 25-square foot section!                 Thirdly, after the digging team digs the dirt the other team study's the dirt this process is long and tiring but it is worth the try because if they do not study it they can miss something that is very important and mess  up the whole process by just doing that.                 In conclusion,you can see how the archeologists find, study and how important this is so we can bring back history in another way.The job of an archeologist is hard and tiring but it is always worth a try they can always use another hand!
