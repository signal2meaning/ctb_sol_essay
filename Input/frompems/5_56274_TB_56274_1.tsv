An archeologist is a scientist who studies items from the past. Being an archeologist takes hardwork. For example:   Did you know when archeologist dug for George Washington's past, it took 2 weeks to dig a 25 square-foot section!!!(Look back in Source #2).   Archeologists are usually strong and smart. If you become an archeologist, you will find cool things.     Archeologists also use tools. Some tools archeologists use are a trowel, a shovel, a whisk, a wheelbarrow, and a knife. The most common tool an archeologist will use is a trowel. This tool cuts to see diffrent layers of soil. If you plan on using tools, BE CAREFUL!!!     An archeologist doesn't only deal with the history of people but, you could also find LOST TREASURE!!! Being an archeologist will get tiring but eventually it will pay off. Artifacts could be founded anywhere. For example:   The archeologists who studied Fort James founded uncovered armor and weapons.(Look in Source #1). That is some information you need to know on an archeologist.

Archeologist are scientist who study objects from the past.The uncovered armor and weapons.They discovered the floors of buildings.     Tools Archeologist Use   Archeologist use a pick and shovel to dig into the close to the artifacts.They use the whisk and dustpan to clear of dirt from the excavation site.They use the knife to scrape from around the artifacts.They use the wheelbarrow to move carry items away from the excavation site.They use the skim shovel to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.They use the trowel   to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.I hope that when you grow up you want to be an archeologist.

They would also learn about the kinds of things they do.Something else they do it would be that the fisrt objects were found in 1861 Archeologists , the name for scientists who study objects from the past , uncovered armor and weapons . They also discovered the floors of  buidings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was build began.                                                      After, thats when they finally found james Fort ! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the forts walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read , and drawings they mada, the archeogists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. Then they made maps and found out that the fort streached all the way to the river .                                                                                                             Then, they realized there were stone ledges built over the river . The ledges were disigned to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars , dozens of burial sites , and ten buildings all within the border of the fort . Today , the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year . The objects include pottery, tools, coins,and even metal toys for children .

Archeologist have a very unique job as well, they dig up artifacts left from historical times. They also help discover artifacts that have never been found before, as well as things we know of but have no clue where to look for them at.               An archeologist has many different tools that are available to them when excavating, they have a pick and shovel most digs often start with these two items. They are used to dig into the earth, fairly close to artifacts. They also have a whisk and Dustpan these are used to brush dirt from artifacts and clear it away from the dig site. They can also use a knife the knife is used for scraping dirt away from the ground and artifacts. Wheelbarrows are also available to archeologist, a wheelbarrow moves items from one place to another place that are to fragile to carry or it can be used to carry dirt away from the excavation site.                        Archeologist also have lots of ways to use technology to help them as well. Computers can find were objects are in the ground by digitally scanning the area, computers can also tell how deep some artifacts might be berried in the ground. Computers can also tell where objects are and where to dig to find them at. Also computers can also tell an archeologist were to start digging.                                                         Archeologist also have to be very careful when working on a dig site mainly because they could skip artifacts and or break artifacts. Archeologist have to use there special tools very carefully to insure they find as much artifacts and objects they can. Archeologist also have to be very careful with what tool they use for excavating. They have to use a different tool for each different type of soil.                         Archeologist have a tough job that can be exciting, scary and fun at the same time. Many Archeologist have helped discover things of the past and things no one had ever knew existed. That's why today we can thank archeologist all over for helping us to discover some of the worlds most famous artifacts and pieces of history. We can also thank archeologist for the help they give and all the artifacts and treasures they have found for all the museums all over the world. Archeologist are a great help to the world and without them we would not have all the knowledge we have today, we would not have hardly any of the artifacts in museums or in galleries, nor would we have the knowledge on objects like dinosaurs and fossils without the help of archeologist.

Today millions of people a year find many ancient objects such as pottery,tools,coins,gold,and even metal toys.In the 1600s people used to throw trash in an unused well or into a big pit. Archaeologists went there to dig into the area and found the trash including the animal's bones.They had learned from these objects help us understand people in Fort James lived.It is still exciting to recover ancient artifacts from exciting places.         Have you ever wanted to know where Gorge Washington lived exactly?Well no one alive knows exactly where he lives,but some people know.The dig started in 2003 by a bunch of archaeologists.It took over a year to dig and recover the remains.They found the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.they found the main farm house a few years later.          The pick and shovel is started with theses two tools, they dig and destroy.The whisk and dust pan, they dust off the artifacts from dirt.The knife is used for careful digging.The wheelbarrow is used to carry heavy items.The skim shovel has a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scope.The trowel is probably the common tool to scrape and cut the layers of soil.

They want to find out because they're interested in studying the thing.      2.      How do they know if the place or object is the actual thing?   They link things they already know about the thing to an object, person, or place.                                Did you know our first President George Washington had fake teeth? Some say it's made out of wood. How do you think people found out that he had fake teeth? Archeologists of course!Archeologists are scientists who uncover and find artifacts from the past.   I'm going to to explain to what an archeologist does during their job.                          A job an archeologist has to do is mapping the site of where they are working. Mapping is important because without the map they wouldn't know what the site looks like and where objects could possibly be. For example scientists made maps and found out that the fort (James Fort) stretched out all the way to the river. 	CD WRB VBP NNS VB TO VB RP IN DT NN , NN CC NN PRP VBP VBG .

The wisk and dustpan is used to wipe the dirt from the artifacts.  The dustpan gets the dirt and dumps it out.       The knife scrapes the dirt of the artifacts that was stuck on it.  It carves disinges on the artifacts.  When sraping off the dirt that won't come off you have to be careful so you don't carve anything in the artifact.       The wheelbarrow moves dirt.  When they dig they use a wheelbarrow to remove alot of dir from where they are digging.       The skim shovel is a shovel with a flat tip.  It is used to remove thin layers of soil.

Archeologist are a part of a dig group to find the past between peoples life or animals life what they depend on is to have a whole back ground of there noledge. They also have to know all of it not just parts of the past the need to all of his or her back ground.They also tell when  how long is was ago and if they find edvidence they tell u when u came here and how it came here and who made it.           Also for History Day ,archeologist  have a big job to find thing far away or close to find about the past.They can also find when somthing was found and he made is or who created it and when.They can also find about what kind of stuff the used or how they used it.The archeologist can help u find somthing somthing that doesnt exsit any more or doesnt belong here anymore but they will find the history for u. They can find the past anywhere for u where ever u need it. 	IN NNP NN PRP VBP VBG IN NN PRP VBP NNS WP NN IN NN IN DT NNP NNP MD VB RB VB VBN TO VB IN NNS CC NNS JJ .

Jones                   Most people think that Fort James was washed away by a river, but now people are finding the Fort James's secrets. The Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project has found clues that hinted that Fort James my still stand. The fort's history goes way back to 1607 when settlers started a new life and built Fort James. Most believe that Fort James was built by a river but not curtain that it was. For over 200 years people thought that the structure was washed away by a river.                         Over 100 years later a group found the exact spot the fort was built at. The giveaway for this spot was having all the floors on the ground and finding armor and guns and remains of bullets. The National Park Service (N.P.S) led a five-year study of Fort James to figure out what the land was used for. The N.P.S used a computerized system to make a map of the land. Then they found Fort James! The first thing they found was a set of scuffs on the ground and then it was the stories that they made and they knew it was Fort James!               Most of us know that George Washington lived in Fort James and George Washngton's Father moved there just when he was 6.

There are very few jobs in the world that are more important than an archeologist's job. One reason an archeologist's job is so important because we would barely know anything about our past if there were no archeologists. We might be able to find little pieces of evidence, but we would still only know little bits of evidence about our past. One of the many things that we might not know about in our history if we didn't have archeologist's are what happened to George Washington as a child, because George Washington didn't write down what happened in his childhood (at least that we haven't found yet) archeologist's first had to know where George Washington grew up as a kid to find evidence of his childhood. Then they had to do lots of digging to find evidence.               An archeologist's job is very hard. One reason an archeologist's job is very hard is that when they are digging for artifacts, they can only dig tiny bits of soil at a time because the artifacts would probably be very fragile because it is from a while ago and if they dig too much soil at one time, they might accidentally break the artifact with the shovel and then we might not know a part of our past because the evidence for it happening would be broken. Another reason archeologists job is hard is because they have to use shovels that can only dig up a small part of the soil, it can sometimes take day's to dig up 25 square inches of sand! That is a very long time for that amount of soil. If I had to do that job, I would start getting very bored and frustrated because it would take forever to dig up a tiny part of soil that might not even have any artifacts in it. One other reason an archeologist's job is very hard is for the archeologist's that work in the lab. They can study one artifact for days. That is a long time to focus on one object. Again if I had that job I would start getting very frustrated.               An archeologist has to have a tremendous amount of patience if they want to do their job well. Archeologists have a shovel that can dig a lot of sand in one dig. If the archeologist did not have very much patience, then they could take that shovel out and start digging with that shovel and if they did do that, then they would probably break a lot of the evidence and the evidence can't just appear in that spot again so the evidence would be broken and we might never know about a really important part of history. Also, the archeologist's that work in the lab have to have a lot of patience because if they didn't have a lot of patience, then they could just say that they studied every little detail of the artifact even if they didn't and again we might not know about a very important part of our history. If the people who carry the artifacts that are too heavy to carry by hand don't have patience, when they start taking the heavy artifacts away, they might want to speed up the process by running to wherever they have to take it. If they run with the wheelbarrow full of artifacts, two things might happen. One thing that might happen is that the artifacts could fall out of the wheelbarrow and break. Another thing that could happen is that the archeologist could drop the wheelbarrow with the artifacts inside of it. If either of the things happen the artifacts will probably break because the artifacts are from a long time ago and are very fragile. Those are a few reasons why an archeologist has to have a lot of patience.

Archeologists spend time researching and studying every day. They forage for a variety of flabbergasting objects all over the world.  Every day, archeologists are working ceaselessly to finish their stimulating tasks. They go to ancient destinations and forage for anything vital. They also discover interesting secrets from the past! Archeologists also use a mapping software on a computer to visualze the area. They have found almost 1 one-million possessions each year for, they do an astounding job in their work. In conclusion, archeologists do a lot of profound things for prodigious reasons  Years ago, archeologists found enchanting object from our great president, George Washington! They found astonishing things such as his kitchen, storage houses, and slave quarters. They discovered that George Washington had a fire in their house! In order for Archeologists to track what is underground the use a special 3D computer. They discover these extravagant objects because it will give citizens a gratifying understanding of who our remarkable president was, why he made his tough decisions, and to learn about the Colonial life. As you can see, Archeologists spend and exceedingly profound amount of time to discover the great life of any vital, ancient person!

In the past things were a little different and wasn't exactly like you would think it is. Most people think the past is just something that already happened and we don't need to worry about it but really it's how our world came to be today.       In Finding Fort James it talked about how the Fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life, and most thought that James Fort was built near the river. So they were all thinking ' Oh we will get there and we will get to see that fort, and experience what it's like to have hat fort.' But really when they got there the fort wasn't there. So they thought ' Well it must of been washed away by the river.' But seriously could a river wash away a fort? I would think not just because usually a river doesn't have waves and waves would be what could have knocked it down and washed it away. But there were hints in the area that the Fort was still around so was it really around somewhere else? It made sense that it wasn't there because they probably moved the fort to a new place to protect from enemy ships. So this was important in history, did they move it? What happened to it? They couldn't just forget about this.       The first objects were found in 1861, 254 years after the fort was built, they found uncovered armor and weapons, and they also discovered floors of buildings. So if they lost weapons and armor what could have happened? Did they get attacked? Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built again. What they were trying to do is relive the moment do it over again see why the fort was in that exact spot. And they were trying to see what happened to the fort, they wanted to see what caused it to fall down or leave.       In Digging up George Washington's Past like in Finding Fort James they were looking for a shelter, they were looking for where George Washington lived. No one knwe exactly where George Washington and his family lived since the actual building was long gone. Archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there, so they decided to start digging in 2003, it took over a year but after that long year of digging they finally found it. They looked at it for a long and hard time trying to figure out what kind of rooms were still there. What they found was kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. And they didn't think that that was all that was still there and so later they found the main farmhouse a couple years later. So this was all very good information in history because they found out where George Washington lived and what some of the rooms in his house were.       All of these facts that archeologists found that they needed to know for some history. As you can see shelter was also very important in history so that was something very good that acheologists found. So all these facts were how the world became today and these are things that were very long gone but we worked long and hard to find them to make our world better today.

The objects include  pottery ,tools ,coins ,and even metal toy's for children . In the 1600s , people  used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. while  digging in  the area ,the  archaeologists found  the trash  the settlers therw away ,including the bones of animales they ate .The information leared from  these objects.Ferry farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involed . The George Washinton society  runs in the summer workshops with both classroom and out door actvites . Kids can explore the site , experience colonial life , and become junior archeologists . Kids sign up for classes, games ,and crafts .Digging around the dirt can give you more then just dusty jeans.The folks at Ferry Farm are bringing to life the country's first preident in ways we have never seen.The discovery of Washington 's home is important for many reasons.First , it gives the  United States a better understanding of who George Washington  was before he came famous.We also begin to know why he made the  decisions he did Anther thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived.  All of these thing are key parts of our  past as Americans.

Archeologist also can discover clues that can lead to a very important thing like the armor and weapons from 200 years past in Jamestown,Virginia.This discovery proved that there was an ancient town built in that spot for about 200 years in the past,and there can be alot of digging involved in finding objects that can take a long time.        Archeologist's job takes a long time to complete and they  need to be careful most of the time.But they dont work alone,there is a team of archeologists that work together to complete research and uncover the truth about the object they discovered.They also have special labs and computers that are specially programmed to help them analyse the object and study more about it.         Being an archeologist is important work and can be fun to discover things at the same time.Thats why most scientests choose to be archeologists and help to discover ancient things like  pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.Thats why being an archeologist is adventurous and important at the same time.

I know I would love to be an archeologist one day.Archeologist use special tools to dig up stuff, and to find the stuff they use 8 things to find them.Did you know that archeologist dug up George Washington's poetry book and Washington's clay pipe.Then they found the animal bones that Fort Brown had eaten and thrown away.                            Archeologist use special thing to find the old age stuff.Fist they use a pick and shovel to start the digging.Second they use a whisk and a dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts.Third they use a knife to scrape the dirt around the artifact,fourth they use a wheelbarrow to move items one place to another,fifth they use a skim shovel to remove a layer of soil,sixth they use a trowel it is the most common tool used in archeology it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.            The reason why I want to be an archeologist is because if I were to find something I'd like my job a lot!Anyways archeologist use these computers that can see underground so if you look up USA you could see underground if you wanted to do so those computers are called 3D computers.Did you know that there can be up to 35 people on one team?I did!35 people maps an area using 3D computers so they track underground the information is recorded so that people started digging.Another team focuses on the actual digging,and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.They start their dig with a skim shovel they are small, flat and sharp.Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found.the whole process is slow and tiresome,but it's worth it.

The first one is about archeologists finding artifacts about Jamestown. In 1994, so many people were interested about the past of Jamestown because of a fort built in 1607. The time of when the fort was built in 1607 there were settlers from England who came to Jamestown to start a new life. Most people believe that the James Fort was built near the river. They say the new spot probably gave the settlers more protecion from enemy ships. The National Park Service has led a five-year study to figure out how the land was used back then. Then they have finally found the famous James Fort. Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. I think this takes such hard work to find many important artifacts each day, week, month and year.           Here is the second most important past also many people might and might not know George Washington. Many things we heard from George Washington is that he was a president, a soldier and a leader of an army. There is one thing we really don't know and it's much about George Washington and it's his childhood. There have been recent discoveries from historians when Washington was a boy. George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family to live in the Ferry Farm when George was just six. The archeologists were digging down deep for evidence. Then they have found evidence that George Washington and his parents did live in the Ferry Farm. It appears there was a fire inside the household because the diggers found pieces of burnt pottery and they have also found a clay pipe that Washington used to smoke so they knew it was the right house. Digging in Washington's past was hard for the archeologists because there was hardly any evidence but learing about the past is very interesting and that is all i can share.

Archeologists need to find the right spot so they can find artifacts.Some archeologists can take many years to find the right spot.Some archeologists say what they know where Washington home is.It took over a year for them to find a home.They also fond a farmhouse, slave quarters, and a kitchen.That the best they ever did.         You can also be involved in this.Ferry Farm offers kids opportunities for kids to get involved in it.They run a summer school for kid to learn how to dig.Then they help them in a work shop so they can learn how to make tools and many more things.

They can also dig up items from historic places. They also look closely at historic art to see if there is something that nobody has seen before.       As I said before that they dig up stuff. Well they do with tools like pickaxe ,shovel,skim shovel,trowel and wheel barrel.Oh how can I forget they use knives to cut off small stuff.       Archeologists all study the same thing historic ground's. They study battle field's. Also they look at historic art to see if there are any clues in the painting.

Acheoglist will get up to work hard for us to have the information we have today. They have to dig learn how to use computers and many other things. But for right now im just going to show you one day of work for an archeoglist.        They probably wake up very early to get where they need to go. when they get to their job they have many chores to do before they get stuff done. But there are different kinds of arceoglist. Ones that use the computer for data and mapping out areas to the ones that dig up the artifacts.        The diggers would work hard to do what they do. They would get dirty and wet. On the other hand the archeoglist who use computers dont get so dirty. But they get dirty in a different way. They would work hours probably sometime even days to map out the premiscence.That would take years to learn how to map out and learn everything about a computer.        It would be interesting being an archeoglist. Feeling the excitement digging up artifacts and many other things. Possibly something never seen before?

An Archeologist finds things from a long time ago. Back to when George Washington was president!! Being a Archeologist is lots and lots of hard work but its worth it in the end. Archeologist, is the name for a scientist who study objects from the past. Today, the group finds nearly one million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children. The Archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of  burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.                   The first objects were found in 1861. They even discovered the floors of buildings. The Archeologists found the trash that the settlers threw away.

So James Fort and a group of people wanted to do an archaeological project, Now for that project they wanted to find a hut built in 1607. Next the first artifacts were found in 1861. These archeologist find weapons, uncovered armor,and washed away huts. We find them very important cause the piece of artifact is like 100-200 years old.                 When these people find the artifacts they wipe them off with a whisk. There are a bunch of tools they use as an archeologist they use a wheelbarrow, shovel, knifes and a bunch of other stuff. A wheel barrow was used to take dirt away from the site, and transfer dirt to the site. Now the shovel is used to dig out dirt to put in the wheelbarrow to take it away. so the last wepon  but not the least the knife is use to cute hard ground and to gross stuff of of the artifact.              Well people always ask how do u find the spot to find the stuff, well people have live on the Ferry farm for 1200 years. So that gives you the idea to look there because 12000 years ago is along time ago. Example no body knew were Washington home was located but guess what archaeologist thought that the stone under it was still there so they started digging 2003 it took over a year but they finally found the stone, See what i mean there smart.                 So people always want to know why and how archeologist just know were these thing are well they don't just guess. So there are many electronics involved now but back then there was not ,but know this is what archeologist do they take a 3d computers that track the underground. thell find were it is then find all they'll need and then they will camp out at the site because they'll be hear for awhile. and the dig the whole day.

First thing you need to know is what the job of an archeologist is. The job of an archeologist is to study the past.            The second thing you need to know is what tools do they use. The tools are a pick, shovel, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and a trowel. They use a pick and a shovel because most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. They use a knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. They use a wheelbarrow to move an item from one place to another. They use a skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt away from the excavation site. They use a trowel to scrape and cut view the different layers of soil.            That is all you need to know about archeologists.

For example, Fort James in Jamestown, also, the Washington house in Virginia. Lets see how they do it.          In 1994, a group of people wanting to learn more about the past made the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. This project was made to find the mysteries of the Jamestown Fort. for more than 200 years people had thought the fort had been washed away by the river it sat next to. But, discoveries from around the area have said otherwise.          Archeologists have been using tools to find objects from the colonists from over 200-300 years ago. They used the pick and shovel to start digs with. They used the whisk and dust pan to brush away the dust of the artifacts.           So as you see archeologists use many of tools for many diffrent reasons.

An Archeologist is a person that digs up bones from prehistoric animals from dinosaurs to wooly mammoths.  When they finish digging up the animals bones they ship them to a museum, and from there they put them together like a really big puzzle and put them on display in the museum.  They yous many tools to help them dig up the bones like.       Pick axe and shovel- Most digs start with these two tools.  Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.       Whisk and Dustpan-Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.       Knife- Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts.       Wheelbarrow- Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.       Skim shovel- A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.       Trowel- Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the   different layers of soil.       As you can see there are many tools to help them find the artifacts.  Archeologist are very important in life  because if we didn't have them we wouldn't know as much as we do if they didn't dig them up and tell us about the bones and what animal it was.  The museums wouldn't   have as much cool dinosaur bone if there weren't any archeologists.  In conclusion, archeologists    are more important in life than we ever imagined.

Archeologists dig in spots were people use to live and keep on digging until they find some artifacts.        In 1994 archaeologist looked for a fort in jamestown. It was built in 1607 when England came to start a new life. People thought it was washed away for over 200 years. People that have found discoveries has hinted that it might be still around.       The objects were found in1861. Archeologist found armor and weapons. They also found floors. Then 100 years later they found the exact spot were the fort was.       It took a long time to find the fort. The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.

As they work hard to reveal they have already found something, a piece of the old James Fort! Imagine, thinking that this old structure was washed away many years before but now discovering that that was just a myth! Now you will work even harder to find out the real truth, is Fort James still standing today? Archeologists use many tools to help them with their jobs such as a pick-ax and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. These are all very important tools that help get the job done. Once you've stepped into the concentration zone of finding that fort, there's no turning back. Your heart is pounding as your getting closer and closer to the great Fort James. All of a sudden you step on something sharp. It stings so bad, you don't dare look down to see what you've arrived at. One of the other archeologists quickly helps to pull the unknown debree out of your foot. Finally they get it out, it was an old piece of a painting, dating all the way back to 1856!!! This means your getting very closer to your destenation. Archeologists were very concentrated on their work so they could get the job done. Or else they wouldn't get to go on any more adventures!

Some archeologists discover dinosaurs, towns in the past, even famous people that are still famous today. Like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Those two guys were two presidents. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president and George Washington was the first president.           One thing was the Jamestown colony in 1607. In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river, but some discoveries  in the area hinted that it might still be around.            The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near a river. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers  more protectoin from enemy ships.            Sometimes being an archeologist can be fun. Do you think you would be a good archeologist?

The second detau il is the archelogists. They are the smartest people who know people from the past. If you meet a archelogist, he can tell you about the people from the past. The last detail is researching. To become an archeologist, you must study the people and research the people from the past. Maybe you can become an archelogist when your older.

They read a lot of stories and made some drawings and the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. Today archologists find nearly 1 million objects each year. They foun pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. it is exiting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.

The settlers thought the fort was built by the river, so they thought it would be easier to settle there so they could get picked up and dropped off at the docks. Anyway, the first objects were found in 1861. Over 100 years later, a group found even more ancient artifacts. Archeologists, a couple years than that, a group found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings.       Next, I am going to tell you about the time people have discovered George Washington's Past. Archeologists believe that they found his past in 2003. Their equipment helped them a lot in this case. They mostly used the whisk and the wheelbarrow. The archeologists have even found George Washinton's old burned pottery.       Last, I am going to tell you about archeologists equipment. First, is the pick and shovel. Most discoveries start with the pick and shovel because it is used to chop through walls. Second, is the whisk and duspan. the whisk and dustpan are for the cleaning portion of the job. The knife is used for the careful digging. The wheelbarrow is used for moving the objects from one place to another. Skim shovel is used for the careful scooping of the object. Last, is the trowel. The trowel is used to scrape and view the different layers of soil.       That is all there is to know about archeology and archeologists. I hope you enjoyed these facts.

Archeologists have to be careful and take their time.  Some artifacts take up to two weekes to dig.     Archeologists' first use a pickaxe and shovel to start.  They dig until their close to the artifact and stop.  They have to stop or else the would break the old artifact.  Some artifacts are very deep in the ground so archeologists have to dig very deep.

And that location is a perfect place to build a home.However,archeologists stated digging in 2003,and it took over a year,but it finally found it. The first buildings were fond the kitchen ,slave quarters,and storage houses.There can be 35 people on a team!Those archheologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels.The discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons.First,it gives the citizens of the united states a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous.We also begin to know why he made the decisions he did.Another thing it does is help historians laern about the type of life Colonial Americans lived .All of these ar key parts of our past as Americans.Ferry farm offers many oppertunities for kids to get invovled.The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities. kids can explore the site ,experience colonial life,and become junior archeologists.

They have found reminants of Jamestown and George Washington's past.   In 1994, a group of archeologists got interested in finding Jamestown. The fort was built in 1607 when English settlers came to start new lives. They thought the fort was built near the river because it was easier to dock ships there. But they were wrong. It was farther away. It took ayear to find it but they did. They found where they put their garbage back then. They found what toys kids used back then.   They also found George Washington's childhood stuff. It took, again, a year to find it but they did. They found his kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.   In concusion, archeologists have discovered two places from the past it took them over a year each to find them but they eventually got info. on the two places.

I know some good information on archeologists and now, you'll know too.                   First is the jamestown rediscovery. Fort james was built in 1607 and some people believe it was washed away by a river and some believe it is still there. when the found James fort, the first thing was a set of strange marks on the ground. The marks showed where the forts walls used to be.                    Next is George Washington's artifacts. Most of the things we know about Washington is his soldier and his presidencial times. Now that is changing because of the artifacts of his childhood. He lived on Ferry farm when he was six years old. People have lived on Ferry farm for over 12,000 years.                   Last, im going to tell you about the tools of a archeologist. Most digs start with this one, the pick and shovel, which are used to dig into earth. Next is the whisk and dustpan, which is used for dusting of sand and clearing it away from the site. Then comes the knife and wheelbarrow. they are used for carful digging and bringing dirt from one site to another. Last is the skim shovel and trowel, used for digging into hard earth and sand.                   Now you know about an archeologist and all of the stuff they do. You know about the Fort james rediscovery. You know abought the washington research, and you know about the tools of the archeologists.

Well if you like history,digging, and getting dirty than you might want to consider being an archeologist.have you ever been to a history mueseum and wondered how did those things get there, or read a history or science book and wondered how did they get that information or those pictures, well I might just have the answer for you it's one word Archeologists. Archeologists are kind of like scientists some work in lab others work on a historical sight like Fort James or George Washington's childhood house but they both are working to find out more abou our history.       Shovels,pick axes,whisks and dustpans,knifes,wheelbarrows,trowels,and skim shovels these are tools that archeologists use while finding out about our history. first the archeologists will use shoveles,pick axes,skim shovels,and trowels to dig inti the dirt until they find an artifact, then tthey will tke dirt awy from sight in awheelbarrows, next they will knifes,whisks,and dustpans to clen the artifacts off as good as they can, last they wil take the artifacts will be taken away in a wheelbarrow to be studied and maybe someday be put in a mueseum.       There are many kinds of different Archeologists lets learn about afew of them. When archeologists are at work there are many archeologists there the archeologists are split up into teams (there can be up to 35 people on a team).The first team maps the digging sight using 3D computers the computers can track what is underground, the information is recorded so that people will know what the area looked like befre they started digging. The second team will be doing the actual digging the place the people do the digging is called a dig. The third team spends days in the lab studying the objects that were found.This whole process of digging and studying is slow and tiresome, but if people didn't do this job we wouldn' know alot of stuff about our history such as dinosoars.       Some archeologists teams have camps for kids so they can learn more about thier history such as the teams digging at Gerorge Washington's childhood house have a kid;s camp where they do classroom activities and outdoor activities to at this camp kids explore the digging site, expierence colonial life, and alsop become junior archeologists.kids can sighn up for crafts,classes,and games. Ther is also an interactive website where children can solve puzzles of the work being done on Ferrie Farm.So if this job sounds fun to you then you might want to consider being an archeologist.

They find historical objects all over Earth. They can gather in groups of 35 people. Archeoligists can find hidden objects explorers can't even find! Archeoligists are famous for finding dinosaur bones and many other historical things.           The tools they use range from pickaxes to trowels. They,if it is absolutely necessary to mine,can use a pick to mine with. If archeologists have to scrape and cut the surface,they use a trowel to do that. They also use shovels,wheelbarrows,knifes,whisks,dustpans,and skim shovels. And,if necessary,they use their hands to dig also.           Archeologists can come upon many dangers in their expeditions. There co.uld be cliffs,holes,caves,sink holes. If they are in a snowy mountain,there could be a tragic avalanch. Another danger is freezing weather. And,of course,they can come upon dangerous creatures.           If there are expert archeologists in a group,the others are lucky. Experts know how to avoid creatures like snakes. They would also know how to avoid the other dangers. They could find areas the other archeologists couldn't. Also,more secrets could be revealed. There would also be a great leader for journeys into places like caves.           When it comes to history,archeologists are the greatest. They can uncover hidden secrets. They can dig up fossils. Experts can find that stuff quickly. Archeologists have an amazing job.

The National Park Service had a five-year study of the area to find out how the land was used.After all these years they finally found James Fort!The first thing was a set marks on the ground.The marks showed where the walls were.They found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.      Archeologist found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.Today,the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The archeologists found the trash the ssettlers threw out including animal bones from what they ate.The settlers fought the Powhatan tribe who often attacked them.This ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.

He fought for are rights and started the united states of america, so of course we know.  But, what if there has been something missing? Something we don't know about this great man? I mean he has been the first president. We don't know his life as a child.        Archeologists have been wondering this and they got to work. they went to washingtons child  house and began digging. They had people on computers making diagrams of where thee hundred year old items where. It took a year before they found just one clay pipe. how did they know this was washingtons? Well they histaoians know that washington had smoked clay pipes. Funny isn't it. Anyway, a fough weeks later they found buildings. The buildings contained a barn, house,and slaves couters. Later they found plow wheels and others        Now you might be wondering how they got these delecate items, but they have special tools that I am going to state. First how did they get it out of the ground with out breaking the item? They used a skim shovel that is used to get thin layers of dirt. they also used a whisk to remove false dirt. Don't forget the pixaxe and the shovel.

The article 'Finding Fort James,' talks about how archeologists found artifacts at Jamestown island. The archeologists were working on discovering the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people had thought that James Fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries say that the fort might still be around.         The James Fort was built in 1607. Most people believed that James Fort was built near a river. The settlers that came from England went there because it was easier to dock their ships there and the fort was located further away so it probably gave the settlers more protection from their enemies and their ships. The archeologists uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. over a 100 years later, archeologists made a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built         The National Park Service led a 5 year study to figure out how the land was used. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. Finally, that's when they found James Fort. The archeologists found out where the walls used to be and that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and they found out that the fort went all the way til the river. The archeologists also found cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.         The article 'Digging up George Washington's Past,' is about archeologists working at George Washington's house. George Washington's home is also known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. Nobody exactly knew where George Washington's home was located since the real building was gone. Still archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in 2003, and it took over a year but they finally found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They also found the main farmhouse a few years later. There were at least 4 houses that had been built on the Ferry Farm land so they need to find concrete proof that that was George Washington's farmhouse.        The archeologists found out that the Washington's had a fire in their house. The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery and they also found part of a clay pipe. The archeologists knew that George Washington smoked clay pipes, so this gives more proof that that was the right house.         These are the kind of jobs archeologists do. They find nearly 1 million objects each year. For example, pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Objects from the past helps us understand how people lived in the past. It is more than exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. It also ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.

75	AI-XC	20131118131242	1500	1500	W			F	402028	5	10465742	Y	56274	          ARCHEOLOGIST      In this report I am going to tell you how Archeologist work , and how they have to do it and what they use when they work in the lab or in the world or in a city or state.A question i would like to ask a Archeologist is do they like their job or do they wish they could have it forever and does their life revolve around their job?         First I am going to tell you what they use. When you are a Archeologist you use a pick and shovel used to dig marks and with them both you use them to dig into the earth to where the artifacts are burred. A whisk and dustpan is used to brush off dirt on the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. They use a knife to be used careful to dig or scrape away dirt form around artifacts. A wheelbarrow is used for moving one item to another or to carry away large amounts of dirt.Also a  skim shovel used to shovel with a flat edge and used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last their is a trowel most common tool in archeology, used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. And all this is used with Archeologist.            Archeologist work in a lab and have to work together to get stuff done. They also have to come to work to be able to do what they like to do. They all have to be ready for the day and have to be willing to stay with each other wither they find something or not they have to be there and work together . Archeologist have to be there and work together  no matter what to help us learn about history. I wonder how do Archeologist do what they do and not get mad at each other during the process. If it were me I would have not been working together I would rather work by myself.I wonder can they work together or apart?           Last there is how they have to work. They have to work slowly so that they can    get every little detail that they can possible get. They have to  get it all correct so that whenever you read it you can have the right facts and learn the right stuff.Archeologist have a very important job. If a Archeologist doesn't get the right facts could he or she get fired or maybe even  token off of the team for being a bad Archeologist. Archeologist are very patient in my opinion. How can a Archeologist go to so many places and have not get paid or do they get paid?           In conclusion Archeologist have a very fascinating job in my opinion and they have the approntiy of learning lost more than we can or they can learn it a lot faster.They also have the appronity of going to different places and learning about their lives and how they live. Archaeologist are very important and special in my opinion.I am still wondering why do they do what they do is it a hobby or a dream of being a Archeologist?

First of all Indiana Jones is not your typical Archeologist. Second of all he was not real. Archeologist's are people who discover the lost and mysterious, treasures of history. Archeologist's have found some of the most historic places in history such, as the mythical city of troy. Howard Carter was a famous archeologist who found the tomb of king Tut. The discovery was amazing because most of the tombs in kings valley where robbed by grave robbers but, king Tut's tomb was completely untouched.Archeologist's find history and that is what they do for a living.                  An Archeologist's job dig up the past, basically. The common tools for an Archeologist is an pickaxe, a shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, a Trowel, and a whip 'Just Kidding'. Sorry for the Indiana Jones reference, anyways those tools have specific uses. The pickaxe and shovel are used usually to start a dig. The whisk and dustpan is used for dusting of dirt and dust delicately. The wheelbarrow is used for carrying dirt away and some times it is used for carrying artifacts away. A skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of dirt. Trowel is the most common tool for archeologist's. It cuts away different layers of soil.                   In 1993 Archeologist's were looking for the seventeenth century Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. People had thought that the fort had disappeared because they thought it was washed away by the river that was next to it. The fort was built in 1607 for a new settlement in the America's. The first discoveries of the fort were found in 1861. They had uncovered weapons and armor. Then over a hundred years later Archeologist's finally found it. The used computer mapping and drawings to find where it was. The first thing they found was the marks in the ground. Those marks are they indication of where the walls were. The fort was in a triangle shape. They soon found the stone ledges that held the cannons for the fort. Archeologists found four cellars. They found ten buildings within the perimeter of the fort. They found dozens of burial sites around the fort too. Every year nearly one million objects are taken from the site each year. Those artifacts include coins, pottery,tools and children's toys. That excavation is an example of what the Archeologist's do every day for a living.                   Archeologist's work hard to find history. They work hard to protect the history of the world. The things they uncover are amazing. Fort James is one of many excavations that archeologists do. Archeologist's find most of the things you can find in the museum. Archeologist's are my hero's. I want to be one when i grow up.

In 2003 they started digging. It took over a year to dig but they had found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage rooms. A few years later they found the main farmhouse.        The diggers needed  to find proof that that was George's farmhouse. They had also found burnt clay pipes, so it gives more prooof that it's the right house.                 On this site, each year a group of archologists will work on the site. The first group uses 3D computers to check out what is underground. That data is recorded so that they know what it looked like before it was dug up. The second team is focused on the digging. This group uses shovels that can remove thin layers of soil. but one at a time. This team also does a job called trowling. Troweling is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifacts.The third team stays in labs studying the objects found by the two other teams.          Some of the tools they used are skim shovels, wheelbarrow, knives, and a trowel.                             This job takes time, but it can be worth it!

Some people discovered in the area hinted that it might still be around!The first object was found in 1861.Scientists have differnt names like cheologists.they discovered armor and weapons.Tey also found floors from building.100 years latera group of people had effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built.people are interted to learn about diffent thing in the past like clocks,cloths and more stuff in world.

People not trained to do this job could wreck the things they are digging up or uncovering.  Archeologists can work at one site for a couple of years.           The objects found at Fort James found can include pottery, coins, tools, and metal toys for children.  The settlers at Fort James use to throw their garbage down a pit/well and the archeologists found that pit/well and now we can see what they ate.  Also, the archeologists found a wall that was used to fire cannons.     No one knew exactly were George Washington's childhood house was actually located.  Archeologists believed that the stone base of his house on Ferry Farm was still there. It took a little over a year, but the archeologists finally found it.  Some of the first buildings they dug up were the slave quarters, the kitchen, and some storage houses. And a few years later the archeologists found the actual farm house.

Archeologists will use a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel find things. They can dig, brush dirt of artifacts, careful digging, scraping dirt of of artifacts, and move heavy things from place to place with the items.           Their jobs can be hard and make them just want to give up, but they don't. Archeologists know how important their jobs are so that is probably why they keep on going and try their hardest to find the answer.            Some of the things they discovered are James Fort and George Washington's childhood. both of those people had no idea about until archeologists set their minds to it and found out everything there is to know about both of them.

Well, an archeoligist used a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim showel, and a trowel. they dig holes. The pick and shovel are to dig into the earth. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off and clear away dirt. The knife is to carefully dig and scrape. The wheelbarrow is to move items from on place to another. The skim shovel is to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last but not least, the trowel. The trowel is he most omportant tool for a archeology, it is to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. Those are the tools for the archeologist. One time in the past, some archeoligist found lots of things that were in Washington's houe. In every team there can only be up to thirty five people. Did you know that it can take about two weeksto dig a 25- square-foot section? Can you believe that? Well, I can't either! The whole process is slow and tiresome, but its worth it. They had to find proof to see if it was really George Washington's farmhouse. Did you know that they started diggug since 2003, that's a pretty long time, don't you think? Do you know what the discovery of Washington's mean? It means that citizens of the United States a better understandingof who George wasbefore became famous. Also, now begining to know why he made decisions he did. I'm sorry, that is all I know from an archeologist. I just know that they dig holes 25 feet with some of their tools.

They find all sorts of cool rocks, bones, and even fossils! There is a lot of tools like the trowel, the skim shovel, and they even use a wheelbarrow to work on and carry certain architectures. Archeologists use a process called troweling to take away layers or dirt to find more fossils and bones.                Archeologists have a team that stays in the lab all day and studies the things that they found. This team uses many tools like magnifying glasses to see small details.

An archeologist digs up historical evidence from many years ago underground.They usally have teams up to 35 peole on a team.They use 3D computers to track what is underground.They use up to 8 tools of equipment on a job that there finding information on.            First I will tell you about some of the tools they use to find there information that is underground.There are many types of archeologist but I'm going to tell you about the ones who actually do the digging process.Archeologist use the skim shovel to start out digging.A skim shovel has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Once they have the soil the place it ina box with a half-inch screen at the bottom.This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.           The diggers also use a process called a troweling. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section!Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that they found. In a project it is slow, and tiresome, but you will find some really cool historical facts!              If you are a kid or an adult who would like to expirence what some of the archeologist do then you should visit Ferry Farm . Kids there can explore the site , expirence the expirements some archeologist do,and become JR.ARCHEOLOGIST!               Archeologist do many jobs in the dirt and discover new artifacts everyday. if you like to get in the dirt , use computers and other machines,dig in the dirt with lots of different tools, and fing neat historical facts no one has ever seen before and let other people learn about the history of America then being an Arcgeologist is a great job for YOU!!!!

We do it every single day. I Cameron Cancha am an archeologist that is in the team that studies the artifacts after they have been uncovered, so basically I get to see what the artifacts are.             One team maps the site on 3D computers that can track what is below the ground. Another team actually digs, the place they dig is called a dig. Those archeologists start with a shovel called skim shovels. Skim shovels are so small sharp and flat that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. The soil that has been removed then is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. The soil falls out and the artifacts stay in.                 The diggers also use a tool called a trowel that is a tool that is the most common, it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Troweling is the hardest process in archeology. You use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It takes a lot of time and effort!                Then comes the last job, my job. My team and I spend DAYS in the lab studing the objects that were found. But finally we finish. My eyes get SO tired that I almost fall asleep, but I keep on working, my team needs me and I need them!                            Well those are the different jobs of the archeologists.

They have found imformation on Jamestown and George Washington. It takes many different tools to find these things.                                                                               There are many different people and groups that it takes just to find one part of history. It also takes many different tools .I'll tell you how to dig up an artifact.   First you find a historical place in your town.Then you get certain materials that will help you dig your artifact.These are including pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel, and a trowl.           Next you start taking off layers of soil.This may take a while but it is so worth it. After that you should have reached an artifact. Once you have your artifact brush it off.Finally you may take it to an archeoligist and see how much it is worth.                                                                                                            They will tell you how much your artifact is worth. It is a great possession to have. It has taken years to find many different arftifacts so don't garentee you'll find yours in one day!

Most of the tools they use are not very complicated and are almsot every day items!Let me name a few to you   Pick and Shovel a every day shovel and pick are used to dig up the earth. Whisk and Dustpan are used to dust off dirt from artifacts or the excavation site. Knife is used in kitchens but also to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Skim Shovel is no ordinary shovel!It has a flat edge to remove a thin layer of soil. Last but not least a Trowel is the most common toool in in acheoligy and is used to scrape and cut to veiw diffrent layers of soil.               Most of the time it takes archeoligist over a year to discover the correct spot to dig up to begin the search!Because of this the teams have became larger than they use to.At times a team can be 35 and up for certain expaditions but if the expadition is just a small one than the teams will not be as large.Lets hope all archeoligist find what their suppose to and work hard in the teams.           An archeoligist has know what their looking for but not only that but why.Learning to be an archeoligist is pretty tough you have to know certain thing and why.So if your planning to be a archeoligist than I would start learning more about the job,and focussing on  what they do and how they do it.

The fun part is to see or know what is was like a long time ago and getting involved in America's history.       An Archeologists job is hard work but you get paid good and it is a good job to have you get to meet new people and make new friends.       They put a lot of hard time work and effort into their job just like digging up a whole town and searching for that long. You have to be very educated if you want to be an Archeologist.

An Archaeological is a person who has to find a lot of cluse of the past like George Washington and his house and also about George Washigton's childhood but reading biographies don't have very much information Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.

How do Archeologists collect the objects that they will study?       The awnser to the question that is listed above is: The first team of  Archeologists start to dig with an object called a skim shovel. Next, the Archeologists place the dirt in a box with screen at the bottom which sifts the dirt out of the box and keeps the artifacts inside. But it is not as easy as it sounds. The skim shovels are small and flat and only pick up a small amount of dirt at a time and so it takes longer to fill the box with dirt.Then the Archeologists do something called troweling. Troweling is using paint brushes, small shovels, and wooden or metal picks to remove the dirt in and on the artifacts. Next, the Archeologists do a study and find the history of the artifact.The other team spends a few days in the lab studying the artifacts that are found.The process is very slow but to the archeologists, it is worth every minute. And that is how Archeologists do their job.           SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT ARCHEOLOGISTS ARE:           sometimes, it can take up to two weeks to dig up a twenty five square foot area!        some tools used by Archeologists are a pick and shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a skim shovel, a trowel, and a wheelbarrow.       the computers used by archeologists can track what is underground.       QUESTION TIME!!       What are the teams in the process of the Archeologists?       The awnser to the question that is listed  above is: Each year, many people will work on the site. There is up to 30 people on each team. Each team does a different job.     	DT IN NNS NNS VBP NNS WP NN VBZ IN DT NNP NNP VBP NNPS VB DT NNS WDT PRP MD VB .

That's so long, imagine living there for overt 12,000 years.       The archaeologists started to dig in 2003 and it took over a year to find it the first buildings they found were the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses. They found the main farm house a few years later.Did you know that they found a clay pipe,George Washington used them!       Here's a little bit more,the discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons.First,it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous.We also begin to made the decisions he did.Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived.All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.                              Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans.The folks at Ferry Farm are bringing life to the country's first president in ways we've never seen.Tools used:Pick and Shovel,Whisk and Dustpan,Knife,Skim Shovel,and Trowel.                Wasn't that awesome to read,finding out more about our American history,what cool things you can find digging and getting dirty?Look up even more about this topic on the Internet! Bye,got to go dig!!                                                               THE END!!             	PRP$ IN VBG IN NNS VBP VBN VBG IN JJ NNP '' IN IN CD NNS .

The reason is so they know what people did back in the day and have an idea what they look like.They can find many differnt things like maps,treasure,and old broken down houses,and newspaper.If they were to find these things they would be able to discover other places.                   The tools the archeologists use are picks,shovels,whisks,dust pans,knives,wheelbarrows,trowel,and a skim shovel.A skim shovel is a flat edged shovel used to carefullyremove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.when they start digging they use a pick and shovel then when they find things they use a whisk and dustpan to brush off the dirt to clear  the artifact.That is what i know about archelogists  i hope you liked it.

It is a hrad job to map out the area. you map out the area so you know what it looked like brfore you start diging. This is the begining to find out what is happening.              I hope you like diging.  The archeologists nedd to dig a lot with a shovle and pic. it takes them 1 hour to dig 25sq ft! but it is worth it soon they find a lot of helpful and valuble things and then there off to the lab.              They need to move a lot. When they find somthing helpful or valuble they bring it back to the lab. Or if they have so much dirt they bring the dirt away from were they work. The weelbarow i think is the most helpful tool.             Then the last step analizing.  They analize the items, they bring back and they find out if the item are helpful or not. if they are they make history with it if its not its sadly junk most of the time. If it does make history it is worth all of there long and hard work.                                 	NNS VBP NNS IN DT JJ NN .

The first objects were found  in 1861. Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered floors of buildings.            They found things out of George  Washington's house from when he was a child.   The discovery of George's home was very important.  It was very important for many reasons, first it gives the citizens of the US a better understanding of who George Washington was.           At least four houses have been built on Ferry Farm land.

Today I'm going to tell you about the job of an archiologist. I reaserched some interesting articles about archiology that tell how and what they did. I found these articles very interesting, and they helped me write this report.               The job of an archiologist can be very interesting, and complicated. It involves brilliant people and careful manuvering. Each year, several teams of up to 35 poeple come to work on the project (AKA the dig). The first team is all computur geniuses. They map the area using 3D computpors that can track what's under ground. This information is recorded so that people will know where to dig and what it looked like before people started digging.           After that process is all done and through, they get the team in that does the actual digging, and thenanother team spends a day in a lab, studying the peices of things found. There is also more to this cool process, but I don't have enough time to finish this, cut I would definetely recomend archiology. 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP DT NN .

The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed by the river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.  Most beleved that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to the dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However , objects found nearby suggested the settlers more protection from enemy ships. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologist, the name for scientests who study objects from the past, a group effort to find the exactspot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.

Two of the most common are the whisk and dustpan and a trowel. Tools are used for different purposes in archeology but all of them help in their own way.                         First we have the whisk and dustpan. If an archeologist ever needs to clean an artifact he/she probably will use this tool. It's bristled end can brush dirt off artifacts, which can be important if there are any inscriptions on the artifact. The whisk and dustpan can also clear away any dirt from the excavation site, this is important if animals live near by. The whisk and dustpan is and always will be an important tool for any archeologists.                          Finally, we have the trowel. it is probably the most common tool in archeology. Why, you might ask. the trowel is the most common because it's sharp end can cut and scrape through dirt to view different types of soil. The trowel is important because you can find many fossils in soil. Fossils are valuable after they are analyzed by an archeologist.Without the trowel, archeologists wouldn't find nearly as many fossils as they do with the trowel.                           Tools are by far the most important element of archeology, two of the most important tools being the trowel and the dustpan and whisk. With these tools archeology is a lot easier. Archeology would be nothing without tools so all archeologists are thankful to have them.

You get to spend a lot of time with the people you know. And you find new things every day. We also study a lot of old artifacts from a lot of famous people's things and clothes.         We also use a lot of cool stuff such as a pick, shovel, whisk dustpan, knife wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowl. And do a a lot of work in the field. Sometimes we get cold so we bring a jacket every day, but if hot we make shure to bring an exra pair of clothes.           Most of the time on the field we don't find anything, but when we do we make shure we do an exra good job analyzing it. When we were looking for George Washington's old house we found so many things such as his clay pipe, burnt pottery, and with all of this information they found out that there was a fire.         They also found the kichin some floor bourds and a room. In the Fort James they found the fort, wall, and the how big was. It's really dool when we analize the artifacts, because we use 3D computers.         When I was a little kid I always wanted to be an archeoligest and I hope you do to.

One thing I learned is there always on the verge of discovery. How do they do this? Whats the process? Well that's what I am about to dig up for you.           When archeologists first start they use a 3D computer to see whats under the ground. The information is the sent to the dig site that way they know what and were there looking for. But it can spend a couple days at the computers depending on how big the site is but that's only part of the process!            Secondly the send the lay out to the dig site were it`s examined carefully. Then the digging begins! The diggers start the dig with skim shovels. they are used to remove thin layers of soil with every scoop. Then they can use the pick and shovel. the are mainly used to tear up the ground close to the artifacts.Thanks to the handy trowel they can usually find one million artifacts a year!  but seriously we can`t forget the whisk and dustpan, it sounds like something you would use at home right? Well its also used to clear dirt off artifacts and get dirt off the excavation site. Last but not least is the wheelbarrow its used to carry things on and off the site.            Now lets talk about why they would do this. Is it just for fun? well not really. You see its archeology that brought us the dinosaurs, its archeology that puts suits of armors in the museum! Like I said archeology is amazing! Oh big deal right. Well did you know that kids can get involved to?  archeology is also educational. Who knew?            you are all familiar with the name George Washington well did you know that archeologist found his house. You see archeologists aren`t two year old's playing in the sand box no, these people all have families but they choose to help dig up historical sites because they know how important it is. There like detectives of the past. and I`d just like to tell them thank you. I`d encourage you to do the same.Well now you know about archaeologists and what they do. That`s my report and I hope you enjoyed it.                                                    (But there is lots more to find out) 	NNS CC WP PRP VBP IN CC NNS : NNP NNP NNP VBP NNS IN VBG NNS .

For over 20 decades people thought that the fort was washed away by a river. Discoveries around  the area were the fort was.                              Fort James was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life many people today believe Fort James was built by a river so it was easier to dock ships there. The first objects were found in 1861they found armor and weapons they also discoverd flooors of buildings The National Park led a 5 year study trying to figure out how the land was used.                                        Today, the groups find nearly 1 million objects each year the objects include pottery, tools, coins and even matal toys for children.In the 1600s, people would throw there trash dow anunused well or a big pit. It is exciting to find to find things that were used 100 years ago.                          In conclusin, those are some facts about archeologists.

From source #1 'Finding Fort Jamestown', Jamestown was founded 1607 when the settlers came to the U.S.A. to start a new life.  Very many people believed that Fort James Fort was built near a river.  Objects found near the area suggested that James Fort was located farther away.  The suggested spot gave the settlers more protection from enemy's and there ships.  The first of many objects were found in 1861.  The Archeologists found armor and weapons, They also uncovered the floor of buildings.  It took over 100 years to find the exact spot where the fort was built.  In 1994, many interested people started studying the past of Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological (JRA).  JRA was designed to discover the secrets of James Fort, Jamestown Virginia.       The group found nearly 1 million objects.  That's an interesting piece of the American colonies.                From Source #2 'Digging up George Washington's Past', George Washington was a president and soldier.  George Washington lived on Farry Farm.  Archeologists Started digging in 2003, it took over a year but finally they found it, they found a kitchen, slave quarters and storage houses. Their was a fire in the Washington's house so they needed proof that it was his house and indeed they did the diggers found a burnt piece of pottery.  The diggers found clay pipes and Washington smoked clay pipes.  JRA used a lot of different computer scanning system by using maps and a 3D scanner that can track whats under grown.  'The process is slow and tiresome, but worth it.'            From Source #3 Tools used by Archeologists.  Source #3 was interesting it showed me what they might have used like a pick and shovel, whisk and dust pan or a knife.  I know what your thinking a knife why a knife? A knife can be used for carefully digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts cool right I would have never imagined a knife for a tool!               That's my essay on Jamestown, George Washington and Ttools Used by Archeologist.   I hope you like it.  This informational text helped me understand what all they meant to the American colonies and to finding amazing history and memorys.

They were anxious for what was going on in the past. They went to go discover because they used to say he died because a river washed him away. They went to check if there was any discoveries. In 1607 setttlers came to stat a new life. They lived there and built a new habitat. That place gave them a spot with more protection from their enemies. Some stuff were discovered in 1861. They took them to the archeologists. They studied the objects. Some places did a five-year study. Then they knew that they had found James Fort. Their first clue was marks on the ground. They sowed were his stuff used to be. They had also found other of his stuff. They got happy they had discoverd somebody elses things from 100 years ago.        Alot of you peple know George Washington. Book's, dictionaries, biographies, and etc. don't really have alot of information of him. People haved been digging up the past and haved tried to find new discoveries. People haved been digging for a long time. They all work in groups of 35 people. They work hard to find new stuff. People do different stuff so they can help look for George Washington's past. His home was important for them. It gives them more information of Ggeorge Washington's past. People also get to know why he made those decisions.                 That's how they dig and find new discoveries they used the following tools pick and a shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow,skim and shovel, and a trowel. that's what helped them dig up the past.

I said being a football player is the hardest job. Jake and Bobby both said that being a archeologist is the hardest because you could spend two years looking for stuff and find only one thing. Plus you have to dig up a bunch of dirt in the hot sun.I told them that they were so wrong and that football's way harder, but that night everything changed.            When I got home I did my regular routine. I ate a snack, did my homework, watched some TV, and went to football practice. It was eight o'clock when I got home, so I ate dinner and went to bed.                I woke up the next day, and got out of bed but something was different. I was already wearing clothes! They weren't just regular clothes they were digging clothes! I went outside and guess where I was? I was in 1994, digging to find Fort James! I didn't know how I had gotten there but some guy yelled at me to keep working. So grabbed a shovel and starting digging trying to figure out what just happened. I woke up In digging clothes went out my door and ended up at Fort James. Something was wrong!                 It was really hard to dig because it was so hot out and I was getting tired. Not to mention that the ground was really hard to dig up and it felt like I'd dig on forever.After awhile we finally got a water break. I was so happy I sprinted over to get some water. This was hard work you have to be strong and have a lot of endurance. The thing is that we haven't even found anything yet. This was hard work, long, and tiring work I know I wouldn't want this for a job!                  After I drank some more water I got back to work. I still didn't understand what was happening, but I decided not to ask. i  was about to pass out from digging so long but when I stuck the shovel in the groung it made a thunk sound so I started to dig around it. With just a knife I started to dig aroundand guess what I found. It was a cannon every was watching and cheering but in between that someone was yelling at me to wake up. Every thing got fuzzy and I was back in my bed with my P.J's on. It wasall a dream! I told my mom when I grow up I want to be an archeologist. She asked me why and I said, 'It's because It's reall herd but in the your is making a discovery that no one's made before.' I know now never to dought a job before you do it!

It was to discover secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia.Also some people thought that the fort was washed away by a river.Although some discoveries in the area said it was still there       Now the fort was built in 1607 by English settlers to start a new life. Some people thought that it was built by a river. However some objects said that the fort was built further away. Also the new spot gave them more protection from enemy ships.           They found there first object in 1861. Archeologists, the name for scientists who study the past uncovered armor and weapons. Also the discovered some floors of buildings! Then 100 years later people found out the exact spot of the fort.       Then the National Park Service led a five year study to figure how the land was used.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.       Now that is how they found out about Fort James.

The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground that marks where the fort's walls used to be. Archaelogists studied the area by using a computer mapping software. The stories they heard and read, they knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. Archaeologists wanted to find artifacts of James fort. By the time they found the fort they found many artifacts. They found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings. They were all within the border of the fort.       Today,the group finds nearly one million objects each year. The objects are pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for the children. The settlers that were there long ago, threw their trash in wells or into a big pit. While the archaeologists were digging to find more artifacts, they found the trash the settlers threw away also including the bones of the animals. The objects they found helps us learn how the settlers that were there lived in the James Fort. We now learned how the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they barely had any shelter.       Settlers that were in James Fort lived in difficult years. Archaeologists studied about James Fort and learned how the settlers lived back then by finding the animals bones that they ate. Also, the ones that they threw in the unusual well or into the big pit. Back then, they didnt have any money or that much clothes.They had to hunt for food and when their clothes ripped the had to sew it back on. Settlers had a difficult life. Archaeologists learned how the settlers fought against the Powhatan tribe. The Powhatan tribe mostly attacked them when they were in there James Fort. Settlers in the James Fort lived a difficult life when the the Powhatan tribe attackted them.       Archaeologists studied many thinga about George Washington's farmhouse. George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved to Ferry Farm. So the archaeologists went to Ferry Farm, but know one knew exactly where the Washington home was located. They didn't know because the actual building was long gone. However, the archaeologists still believes the stone base that was under the Washington's home, was still there. They digged until 2003, they kept searching for the stone base, then finally, one year later, they found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. After a few years later, they have found the Washington's main farmhouse.       There are more than one archaeologists trying to find the farmhouse. They were split into teams. There are almost thity-five people on just one team! The archaeologists  trowels. Troweling  is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt. There are three teams. One team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what's underground. The second team focuses on the digging part. The second starts their digging by using skim shovels. Skim shovels are so small, flat, and sharp they can remove thin layers of soil. The third team spends days in the lab. They spend days in the lab because they study objects that the second team has found.

They have discovered most of the historical articals or books you have read. Archeologists dont just have to dig up things and write about it. They have to figure out who it used to belong to, what the item is, and if it is important. But, they do much, much more. An archeologists job is tough.            Archeologists have to be thinking about what they are looking at very carefully for many different reasons. One reason is because they have to see if it can be useful. Another reasons is so they can figure out who it belonged to. This job is not easy. Archeologists have to run the object into many different tests. But they have help by many different kinds of help, by many different things. They get help by machines, people, and their brains. This means they have to understand their job completely, and they have tovery smart! Archeologists are tough and have to be brave at times.            Archeologists dont just use their hands, they use many other tools. Their tools are very special and have their own special use. Some of their tools are: the pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and the trowel. Archeologists use much many tools, but these are a few I can name. these tools come in handy at times. They all have their own use. The pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from arounnd the artifacts. Also, the wheelbarrow is used to carry items from one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excation site. Another tool is the skim shovel, it is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Now last, is the trowel. This tool is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. There is a lot of tools involved in a archeologist's job.            Archeologists were trying to discover more about Geoge Washington. They have found bones the animals have chewed on. They have found broken pottery. They have even found George Washington's old clay pipes! This was an amazing discovery! The pottery they found looked burned, so they think they had started a fire in their house. But they are not positive. There is still a chance this could hve happened, but, it is not a fact yet. Archeologists still have a lot to discover and I don't think they will stop searching.            In conclusion, I think archeologists are super smart and are ready to face anything. Hopefully, they will figure out plenty of more things in history, but we just have to wait. There is no dought in my mind that they won't find out anything else.

Archeologists go to sites to look for where a well-known person used to live. Like, George Washington for example, recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped archeologists know more about him as a young boy.          Archeologists recently went to the Ferry Farm to discover George Washington's past and recovering about this long gone farmland. The process of digging at the Ferry farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams will work on the site. The can be up to 35 people in one team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information will be recorded so that the archeologists will know what it looked like before people before started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers one at a time. Then that soil is placed in a box with a half-inched screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! And another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. the whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's really worth it.

The archeologist have to dig and do other things to find artifacts the tools they use include, a pick and shovel used for digging into the earth to find underground artifacts, a whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off of artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, a knife used for carefully digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts, a wheelbarrow used for moving artifacts from artifacts from one place to another, a skim shovel used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop, and a trowel used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.       The job of a archeologist is probley hard because they have to be very careful and not harm the artifacts they don't know where the artifacts really are so they have to use very little tools to dig so they don't damage the artifacts which is probley hard to do because they don't know exactly where the artifacts are.       When archeologist are digging they use things that will dust off dirt from artifacts like the whisk. The reason archeologist take their time digging up artifacts is to learn about people who over hundreds of years ago and their life and childhood life and tell the world about their history so we can know their past and learn about througout are lives.

Another resin is so I can learn how many brothers and sisters he had and how old he was when he died. and how old was his brothers and sisters were and how old his family was when they died.And how many kids he had.       I would not want to be  a archeologist cause I would not be able to spend time with my family.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.Alot of people belived that James Fort was built a little bit near the river.It was easier to dock ships there so it made sense that settlers would choose that spot.Objects found near suggested the fort was located far away.The newest spot prbably gave the settlers alot of protection from enemy ships.       The very first objects were found in 1861.Archeolgists the names for scientists who study objects uncovered armor and weapons.They also dicovered the floors of buildings.Over about 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

His father was augustine washington, his father moved all his family to ferry farm a perfect loction to build a home when they moved there george was only 6 years old a couple of years george died and another president replaced him and so now archeologist burried him many investigrators tried searching for his house but they couldnt because it was nowhere to be found but,then diggers started to find pieces of burnt pottery. the diggers suggested a fire occured there. but they also found part of a clay pipe, but they knew thet george SMOKED CLAY PIPE!, so this discovery gives more proof of the house.  So this discovery was very important for many reasons. So in 2003 they found george washington house! it took over a year, but they found it the found were the kitchen,slave quaters,and storange houses were at. They found the main  farmhouse a couple of years later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  So i found all lot of new facts about him and more of what he use to do and where he moved where was his house discovered and so i learned alot from his pass.

Archeologists also have many other jobs, before construction company's build things it is an archeologist job to see if there are any valuable items underneath .For instance ,if a parking lot was about to be built for a casino and the land was an Indian reservation or once an Indian reservation there would have to be an observation on that land .       There are a lot of tools that archeologist use including:       the pick and shovel a whisk and dustpan a knife a wheel barrow a skim shovel and a trowel   Most of these tools are used in a regular everyday dig like the skim shovel, the wheelbarrow,and the whisk and dustpan.These three tools are three special tolls needed  in order for the team to do a dig and to be successful during a dig  archeologist doing the digging.The skim shovel is what the team uses to carefully remove a thin layer of soil to see where the artifacts are .The wheelbarrow is what they use to carry the items from one place to another or to carry dirt away.The whisk and dustpan is used to dust the sand off of the artifacts so the artifacts can be identified .       Sometimes an assignment may take up to 6 months or even a year .During these 6 months .archeologists are working hard to find new discoveries.They even travel out of the country sometimes .They go to different places like Germany, France and other places.One time a team of archeologist went to Egypt and they discovered some different things .       I think that the job of an archeologist  could be fun discovering new things  but it also  takes a lot of hard work .       finally you can see that an archeologist is someone who study things from the past , is someone who likes history and,someone who likes there job       sources the story's from the passage:  Digging for History Informational Performance Task                                 	NNS VBP NNS WP NN NNS IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NNS IN DT NN VBP VBG NNP NNP IN NNP , NNP CC NNP NNP NN CC NN NNP NNP RB VBP JJ JJ NNS , IN NN NN POS NN NNS PRP VBZ DT NN NN TO VB IN EX VBP DT JJ NNS NN NN NN , IN DT NN NN VBD IN TO VB VBN IN DT NN CC DT NN VBD DT JJ NN CC RB DT JJ NN EX MD VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN .

Archaeologists use cool tools like picks, shovels, wheelbarrows, whisks and dustpans, and even knives. So, if I ever got the opportunity to be an archaeologist I would take it!          Archaeologists don't just study artifacts they also study fossils. Usually when archaeologists do digs for fossils they don't do it near communities. there can be up to 35 people on a team of archaeologists. There are 3 different teams of archaeologists. The first team uses 3D maps to map the digging site, the second team actually does the digging, and the third team stays in the lab and studies the artifacts or fossils.          A lot of digs in the world happen in Egypt where they find mostly artifacts like jewelry, crowns, and idles. Sometimes they even find tombs filled with mummies.   They even find chambers and tunnels, but when they go in them they have to be cautious of boobie traps.                                                            Vocabulary:       Archaeologist- A scientist who studies objects from the past. Artifacts- An item from the past Fossils- Bones from creatures of the past, such as Dinosaurs or fish. Digs- The place a team of archaeologists does the digging. Idles- Statues that people worship.

Archeologists try to find very valuble things like abe licons watch at his fallen apart house.

Archeologists are people who dig up things from peoples past time. Archeologist use many different tools while doing there job because the art affacts are fragile. The whisk and dustpan is used to wipe away dirt from the artifacts.  The pick an shovel are usesd to to dig close to artifact. The kinfe is used to scrape dirt away and around the atrifact. The scim shovwl is used to dig up the thin layers of soil and dirt. The wheelbarrow is used to move artifacs from one place to another and to move dirt away from the construction site. The trowel is used to look and dig up different layers of soil.                     Archeolodgists have dug up things from Geaorge Wahingtons past and have found Fort James, IT is more than just fossils and bones it has more to it. The archeologists found burnt pottery in  Gearge W.s house and a clay pipe. There are speacial and old things thst used t be used everey day that they find.                      I learned that its not about the money that comes out of its learning about the past and learning about people you never would expect to find things about.

Now you can start to search.when your searching the first thing you need to use should be the pick and shovel to dig into the earth. Be careful when using the pick it can hurt you and stop your searching. When you use the shovel you need to make sure it is ion the grouond low enough then scoop it out like ice cream. But when you use the pick you need to make sure it's only for breaking down sediments like rocks or heavy trees.                                         Then when you get to a point and scooped to much dirt and sand you use the wheelbarrow to carry it away so it is not in the way. Once  you have done this you need to get the skim shovel and carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. After you have done this you can get the trowel to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.                          By now you should have found at least one artifact but if not that is OK. If you did find an artifact you need to first get the whisk and dustpan to get the dirt or sand off of it. Then you need to get the knife to scrape the dirt from around the artifact.

An archeologist is a person who finds rare artifacts about a certain topic. Lots of archeologists want to find artifacts that would impact on others people's life. Archeologists find facts about history and try to find the special details from that period of history. Archeologist don't always find the artifacts they want, they sometimes have to go by what the have.        People think an archeologist job is exciting. That is true, archeologist have a great job. They go back in time and find the history so they can present it into today's world. Most of the artifacts go in a museum. If they are very fragile and need to be handled with care they will probably leave them in a lab of take more care of it.       Discovering an artifact is something really exciting to do. When archeologist find an artifact they put them on wheelbarrows. A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry excess dirt and soil away from the site. After they collect all the artifacts they can find they take them to the labs so the workers of the labs can do their job. Archeologists have found artifacts from George Washington's house and from Fort James. Archeologist do have a cool job!       There are lots of different teams that archeologist have to work. There is the team that find the artifacts. They use 3D computers to find where the artifacts are in the ground. Then there are the actual diggers who dig the artifacts from the ground. Everyone has a certain job that really does matter!       The tools are really important while having this job. A few really important tools are      the skim shovel and the trowel. A skim shovel has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt and soil from the ground. The trowel is the most common tool an archeologist uses. It is used to cut the different layers of the dirt or soil.       Every person a job that needs to get done. We need to look in the past so we can understand about life back then. Thing that we think are not important actually are important. Going back in history can never happen, so that's why an archeologist's have a job.

Archeologists jobs can affect us in many ways.One way is we will be able to know alot more about that person or topic.If the archeologists were to dig up artifacts on George Washington then we would be able to know alot more about his life other than when he was president.Also their jobs can affect historians alot too.If they found where George Washington's house is and artifacts in it then historians could find out more about colonial life.               The archeologists have to dig very carefully beacuse if they just dig and dig with sharp objects they are more likely to break them.Sometimes the archeologists have teams to do different things.One team uses 3-D computers and creates a map of the area before they start to dig so the diggers know where to go.After that the diggers start actully digging.Where the diggers start to dig is called the dig.When the archeologists start digging they use a speacial tool called a skim shovel that is very flat,small,and sharp.It can take almost 2 weeks just to dig a 25-square-foot area.           Archeologists use alot of tools.Including the pick and shovel,whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and the trowel.They start out with th skim shovel to remove small layers of soil.Once they have found something they use a trowel.Trowel is a technique that uses small shovel,paint brushes,amd wooden picks to get into small crevices and get dirt and soil out.                Archeologists use many tools.This report included information about how their jobs affects us,how their jobs work,and what tools they use.They are helping historians every day and inproving on our knowledege about that past.

The list of tools and what they do is first the Pick and shovel most digs start with these two tools they are used to dig into the earth close to artifacts.  Number two is the whisk and dustpan these are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Number three is the Knife this is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts. Number four is the wheelbarrow this is used to move items from one place to another.  Number 5 is the skim shovel a shovel used for tiny layers of grass &amp; dirt at the top.

Archeologists dig up ancient areas to artifacts they can study. Archeologists often spend hours and hours digging and brushing old land just to find nothing. however, some archeologists are lucky and find something to study and hope is real.               In source two, Archeologists discovered George washington's house and part of his old clay smoking pipe. In source two, archeologist looked for the James fort and found it after a full year.         Something interesting happens in Jamestown evey year. Almost 1million objects are found in Jamestown every year. although Archeologists in Jamestown find almost 1,000,000 objects a year,they are not always lucky. Some mines barely find five objects a year.          Archeologists are scientists and discoverers. Without archeology, we would not know many things we know today. We may not even know where George Washington grew up in! Or even if dinosaurs existed! Archeology is very important and without it, we wouldn't have much knowledge about many things today,         	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNPS VBZ DT NN WP NNS VBZ CC JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP NN IN NN NNS TO NNS PRP MD NNP NNPS RB VBP NNS CC NNS VBG CC VBG JJ NN RB TO VB NNP RB , DT NNS VBP JJ CC NN NN TO NN CC NN VBZ NNP NNP NN CD , NNP VBD NNP NN POS NN CC NN IN PRP$ JJ NN NN NNP NNP NN CD , JJ VBN IN DT NNP NN CC VBD PRP IN DT JJ NNP NNP JJ NNS IN NNP NN NNP NNP CD NNS VBP VBN IN NNP DT NNP IN NNPS IN NNP NN RB CD NNS DT NN , PRP VBP RB RB NNP NNP NNS RB VBP CD NNS DT NNP NNP VBP NNS CC NNP NNP NN , PRP MD RB VB JJ NNS PRP VBP NNP NNP MD RB RB VB WRB NNP NNP VBD RP IN .

When archeologists start digging, the location is called a dig. They will use many different tools to look for artifacts. They will split into 3 teams.   The first team will make a computerized version of the area before the dig.   The second team will do the digging.   The third team will analyze the findings of the second team.   the rest of the people will go poo.

You could find things right away, if your lucky. Or not. You have to be very careful when you dig up things.  Make sure not to damage the artifacts.

Archeologists are people who find and study objects from long ago. There are many  types of archeologists who study different things like some may try to find dinasoaur bones while others find artifacts of our ancestors lives. However they all try to do one thing, uncover history and its mysteries.                                                  Archeologists spend from days to weeks carefully digging up objects or most of the time finding nothing! An important skill for archeologists to have is patience, because it takes sometimes months to find one artifact and that too might be worthless. if you have patience then acheology is the job for you!

One team uses computers to track what's hidden underground. Others stick to actually digging. They start by using skim shovels, which are thin and flat. They are used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Next, the archeologists place the soil dug by the shovels into a screen, where the artifacts are filtered out. They then begin the process of cleaning the artifacts with the whisk and dustpan, pick and even paintbrushes!                                                                           Paragraph 2             I have learned many things while I was writing and reading. Did you know that it can take 2 weeks to dig a 25-square foot section! That's quite a while for just digging. The whole process of digging, screening cleaning and repeating is slow and very tiring, but I guess it's worth it!

The materials include picks, shovel, whisk, dustpan, and many other related materials. Archeologists visit many famous sites and do their work. It takes long processing and time to find artifacts.         They have several ways of finding old and intresing objects. Almost all their work is digging. Their tools help them so they would not get hurt and does not let them put marks on the artifact. Some people use wheelbarrows, or instuments that help people carry things, to remove dirt so that the other archeologists digging could dig deeper. Archeologists have to dig very deep because new layers of sand keep on forming.         Although archeologists have very high hopes, they do not always find old objects. In a year, one group of people who study archeology can find nearly one million artifacts. Some of the objects they find are bones of animals, pottery, burnt piece of clay, and more. To make sure that archeologists do not get dirt, they use a whisk to wipe dirt off. Archeologists then study the object and make conclusions of what happend in old times. People who study archeology have a fun and tirering time.

Finding things about the past is an archeoligist's job, and although many people are not up for the challenge, an archeoligist is very important to finding more things in history. Without archeoligists, we wouldn't know as much as we do today.            An archeoligist's job is tiring because you have to go through a very long process that can go on for weeks. Many teams work on the project. One team used 3D computers that help find artifacts underground. This imformation is recorded so that the diggers know what to look for. Another team focuses on digging up the artifacts. They start digging with skim shovels and start removing thin layers of soil. Then they take the soil and put it into a box with a filter on the bottom, so the dirt can fall out and uncover any artifacts.            An archeoligist's job is helpful because it helps people find more imformation that they might have not known before. As I had said earlier, archeology also helps find more things in history. People have learned more things over the years and more things that they might not have known before.            An archeoligist's job is exciting because you never know what you will find next. Most of the time people don't find stuff, but that just helps them know not to search that area next time. Finding something that most people haven't seen yet is a very exciting experience, one that will also help others with their research.           An archeoligist's job is all of these things, and that is why we know so much about our past today. Being an archeoligist helps more than anything, and knowing that you just helped humans discover more things must feel really, really, good.

An Archeologist is a type of scientist who discovers hidden objects from the past. Archeologists help us learn how people lived in the past. They find what people used in the past and made in the past. Archeologists use many tools like picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, trowels, and many more.                      Archeologists need to be patient while searching for hidden objects. It takes a long time before they finish searching a site. First the Archeologists have to use a skim shovel and dig a layer out of the ground. Then they put it in a box with a screen on the bottom so most of the dirt falls through the holes. They use a whisk and dustpan to find the hidden artifacts. Some Archeologists work in a lab studying the objects that are found.                       Archeologists do a lot to teach us about the past. They use many tools and do a lot of research. Archeologists are discovering new things every day! Archeologists have found James Fort, George Washington's House, and many more exciting artifacts.

They probably were working on the Fort for about two or three years.The most tool that is mostly used is the skim shovel. It is proably used so they can pick up all the soil so they can get what they are getting.I think that the whisk and the dustpan are used so they can dust things off and see if it is the real thing that they are looking for.                 Some of the missions that they do are really cool like finding George Washingtons very old neighborhood.Also they had found Fort James.

You can find proof of the case your looking for and you need to find imformation that the proof is real or fake. Also you need to find historical fact to see if its the right proof.  An archeoligists is sort of like a bioligists excepted an archeoligists finds imformation about historical things.

The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage house.  They found the main farm house a few years later.  At least four other houses have been found so they need to get proof that it is george washingtons farm house.  Record shows that the washingtons had a fire in there house.  The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery.  This suggested a fire occurred there.  They also found part of a clay pipe.  We know that washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovory gives us more proof it is the right house.

You also have to be smart because you could find bones and you have to know what they are.  It is also interesting because you get to learn about a person and you get to find things that he used or had.It takes them 2 weeks to find something.  After they find something they have to study it  to see if it is valuable and then put it in a museum.  They also travel have to  travel to different places to dig.They also get a lot of money.That is how an archeologist job is like.

Once they find something they bring it to their lab and figure out what it is.        There are teams that work together there can be up to 35 people on a team. Archeology is really hard work. They use 3D computers that track whats under ground. Then they get ther tools and start to dig.         Why do people dig? People dig so they can now more about that person that they are digging. They also dig so they no more about how people used to live. Being an Archaeologist can be fun to!      Archeaologists use a pick and shovel when they start. They use a Trowel it is one of the most commonly used tools, you use it to scrape and cut to view the diferent layers of soil. Other tools they use too, such as whisk and dustpan, knifes, wheelbarrow, and a shovel.       You can get involved Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved.           It takes a very long time to find stuff. It took over a year to find George Washingtons house. It takes about 2 weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section.      I think It would br fun to be an Archeaologist for a job.

Archeologists also found fort James.  the the first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.  the marks were where the forts walls used to be.  Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made the archeologists knew the fort would be be shaped like a triangle.         the maps they made found out the fort stretched all the way to the river.  then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river.  the ledges were built to hold cannons.  The archeologists also found eleven cellars, several burial sites, and ten buildings within the boarder of the fort James.         Today archeologists find nearly one million objects each year.  a few of these objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.  Archeologists have found trash the settler threw down like bones of animals they ate.  Archeologists believe that the stone base of Washington house might still be there Archeologists began digging in 2003 it took more than one year but they found it.  the first parts of the building they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage houses.  they found the main farm house a few years later.

The archeologists were finding objects were found all over the world.   The tools that they used the most are the pick and shovel, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel, knife, whisk and dustpan. But they had someone help them find a house.   'The archeologists used the pick and the shovel for to dig to the earth, close to the artifacts, and the wheelbarrow is used is to carry dirt away from the excavation site.               The skim shovel is used to remove the thin layer of soil with each scoop, and the trowel is used for is to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil, and the knife is used for is to carefully digging around the artifacts.    The whisk and dustpan are used for is to dust the dust of the artifacts.    'The archeologists have to start with these two tools pick and shovel because if they don't they would have to dig with their hands and that would take for ever and ever  that is why they have to start with the pick and shovel.   The whisk and  dustpanare used for the artifacts and the archeologists have to use them because if they don't have a whisk and a dustpan they would have to use their hand and their hand will be covered in poop, mud, and dirt.    The thing is you will not know what it is and that is why they have whiskes and dustpans.             They had to use all those things to do what they had to do  and when they need to do it and they had the best time of their lives and they were happy about what they found and what they learnd.   They wanted to learn that because they wanted to learn that to tell everyone so they can become an archeologists and that is why they learnd that.

Archeologists have very very hard jobsthey have to uncover large foudations of colonel buildings.  Also they must find and not break the artifacts.  This is hartd because many of the are dried out and are very brittle.            Archeologists havevery many tool.  They have tool called the pick and shovel used to start most digs.  Also toused to dig into the earth to get close to the artifacts.  Then, theres the whisk and dustpan used tobrush off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.  Also they use a knife to scarpedirt from theartifacts.  Next, comes the wheelbarrowused to move items to or from one place and another.  Finally, theres the skim shovel and the trowel.  The the skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.  Finally, the trowel is probaly in archology used to scarpe and cut to view the diffrent layers of soil.            Doing their job archologists have found found much of American past like George Washington's childhood home and the James fort.   Archeologists have worked many long, hard, and tiresome days to uncover American history.

They have to dig, carry, hit, kick and so on to find a part of our history or evns someone elses.   Archeologists go to the most remote places on earth to a little history. But before they can find those artifacts they have to do a lot of other jobs.   They do jobs like digging, scouting, brushing, and a lot of other jobs.

They knew that they needed prove,so they started to dig 25 feet then they found a piece of burnt pottery and they know that Washington house had burnt down,then found a clay pipe and knew  that  Washington used to smoke.            Being a archeologist may be fun but hard work.

And the people who put famous peoples bones in museums are called archeologists.  They are always on a roll looking for artifacts and other things that were left behind by famous people who lived here a long time ago.  Archeologists have six tools to use for looking for artifacts or things that were left behind by famous people.  There's also a school event called History day it's when kids have been asked to give information on some different jobs for people who loves learning lots and lots about history.             'Some kids love history day because they love learning about famous people who lived a long time ago.  Mostly everyone in the world loves learning about famous people who lived a long time ago.  Mostly everyone in the world loves lerning about famous people who lived in this world a long time ago.  Kids love history so much that they wish that they could just jump back in the past and see how famous people and other people.  If I was going to choose a famous person who lived a long time ago andtry to find artifacts about him I would pick George Washington because I would like to know how long did he live for before he died.               'Now all you people have different answers of why you would or wouldn't like to be and archeologist but now I will tell you why I wouldn't like to be an archeologist.  The reason why I wouldn't like being an archeologist is because it is boring and I dont want to be outside and dig for artifacts and other things.  I would be very bored while looking for bones and facts.  Another reason why its boring is because you just walk around putting things in a computer.  My final reason why it would be boring being an archeologists is because we dont take a one hour break off looking for artifacts and other things.

How do archeologist find all these things. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. A team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found.                                                                                        The first team maps the area useing 3d computers that can track what is undergound. The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.

Archoligists use many tools to such as a pick ' a shovel ' a whisk ' a dust pan ' a knife ' a wheelbarrel ' a skim shovel ' and a trowel . archoligists study many things that seem usless but really are part of are history or past . so when you see an archoligist you know now that he/ she is in fact improving the worlds history and past learning more and sharing it with us . As they explore and dig up artiffacts some see them and think what a waste of time but i assure you they are not wasting their time .   archoligists take their time to do slow but hard work is it worth it ? the ansewer is yes we need history we learn that way about are past and about how to live . their are usally three teams their can be up to 35 people in each group ! they do their work very carfully .  their are people called historists that study history just because they find it interesting .   they study history and some times discover .

Most believed that James Fot was built near the river.However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The first objects were found in 1861.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.The National Park Service led 5 year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make image of the area.That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing thet found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be.Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawing they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a tringle.               Today, the groups find nearly 1 million objects each year. In the 1600s, peopleused to throw their trash down unused well or into a bid pit. While digging in the area, the archaeologist found trash that settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.The information learned from these objects help us understand how the people in James Fort lived. We noe know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. It is exiting to discover objects that were regulary used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. It gives us a peice of our last and ties us to people who first started the American colonies.

Like some pick up shovels, trowel and all kind of the tools. Thats how you could make a very perfect house. But be carefull with the house because you could mess it up and you won't get much money but sometimes they will give you a chance. or you could get fired. some times you will get tired because of the sun . Some people say that you have to bring your own lunch.                              Another job could be teacher and what a teacher dose is it teaches the kids and they have to learn there times,add,take aways ,and the ather things you have learnd when you went to school. But I do not know if you get paid or not. I would like to be a teacher because Ilike kids I like teaching them. And if Ibecome a teacher I really hope there really good kids.Because if they are very good kids you would not get tired and you won't have to argue with tem and I dot like to argue with kids.

Also people found out some of Fort James secrets for the past 200 years. People belived that fort has been washed away in the river. The fort was built in 1607 for the settlers in England. It seamed easier for the settlers to dock their ship in the rite spot they fit in. One of the first objects that were found by the settlers was in 1861. However, the objects that were found were suggested further away from the dock. The objects that were found were over 100 years of age. It took a long time for the England settlers to find.

Historians do not know much about George Washington as an adult. They know more about him as a little boy. People have lived in a perfect place to build a home. George Washington was only six when he lived in a place like that it was called Ferry Farm. Four other houses were built on that land. Archeologist found all of those things in George Washington's house many years ago.         George Washington's home has many reasons to be important. One of the reasons were because it helps historians about the type of Colonial Americans lived. The second reason was because it helps citizens know more about who George Washington was. The last reason was so we could know why he made his decision. most of these reasons are key parts  of our past as Americans.         During the summer the George Washington society runs workshops. Ferry Farm offers opportunities for kids to get involved. Kids can experience colonial life, explore the sight, and become junior archeologist. There is a interactive website. It chalenges the kids to solve puzzles about work being done at Ferry Farm.

Archeologist spend a long tie trying to find old things from important people from the past. Archeologists have to use a lot of tools like A pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel, and a trowel. Archeologists can find things from very important people that now will cost a lot of money. They can find things from many famous people like George Washington or Abraham Lincoln. Archeologists main reason is to dig up things from the past that now will cost a lot of money or we can use the things they find if they are worth using. There can be up to 35 people working as an Archeologist. They have recorded information before they start to dig things up so that they know what it looked like before they started to dig. The have 3D computers that can track what is underground. Another team will start to dig in a place that is called the dig. The Archeologists start there dig with a skim shovel. The shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil one at a time. The soil is then put in a box with a 1/2 inch scree on the bottom. The archeologist discover so many things that we never new about.

As the archeologists dig they use a wheelbarrow to  move all the dirt they dug up with the shovel and pick so they have no dirt piles in there way.  Starting with a pick or shovel helps archeologists because they can dig up more dirt than with a whisk and dustpan or a skim shovel.          When archeologists think they are getting close to a artifact they mostly use a skim shovel and then a trowel because they do not want to damage the artifact so to be carefully they use those tools.          Then comes the hard part.  Archeologists use a knife to carve out the dirt from around the artifact then use a whisk and dustpan to brush dirt of the artifact and then they are done.

For an example Fort James it took a long time for it to be found. But in 1861 archeologists uncovered armor, weapons, and floors from houses. Over 100 years latter archeologists found James Fort. Today archeologists finds nearly 1 million objects each year.             Archeologists have a long order of doing things. They have to map the areas using 3D computers that track what's underground. The information is recorded so that people what it looks like underground before they start digging. Then they start digging, the place were they dig is called a dig. When they start digging they use skim shovels. The soil is placed in a box with a screen in the bottom, the dirt falls while the artifacts stay in. They use paint brushes, small shovels and wood picks.             The job of an archeologists is very important. If archeologists didn't do their job we wouldn't know much about our past. Like we wouldn't have known much about George Washington's child hood. Or where fort James was. Archeologists use lots of tools. For An example Archeologists use a pick and a shovel to dig close to the artifacts. A whisk and dustpan is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the site. A knife is used for digging and to scrape dirt around the artifacts. A wheel barrow used to move items from one place to another or carry dirt from the site. A skim Shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil.  A trowel is a common tool in archaeology, It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.

I think the job of an Archeologist is to dig in the dirt to try to find interesting artifacts. I chose this topic because I thought that it would be interesting to write about something I don't usually think or talk about. Did you know that when Archeologists are troweling, it can take them up to 2 weeks to dig a 25-square foot section?                       To start off my essay, I am going to be talking about the job of an Archeologist. An archeologist is someone who digs in the dirt to try to find ancient and interesting artifacts. When they find these artifacts, they often sell them to museums for a profit. When the museums get that artifacts, they put them on display so that different people can see and examine them. The artifact often stays in the museum for a few years and them is shipped off and put in storage.                     My next paragraph is about the different tools that archeologists use. Archeologists often use different tools for different jobs. Most digs often start with a pick and shovel. These tools are mostly used for digging into the earth up close to artifacts. Another tool that Archeologists use is a trowel. A trowel is probably the most common tool used for archeology. It is used to scrape and cut the different layers of dirt or soil. The last tool that were going to talk about are a whisk and a dustpan. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off many artifacts in order to get them cleaned off.                       My last informational paragraph is about how the text relates to the topic. I think the text relates to the topic because....       The text and the topic are both on archeology. The text shows how and why archeologists do what they do.   The text clearly states that archeology is fun job.                    To wrap up my essay, I chose Archeologists for my report because I thought that it would be a fun and interesting essay to write about. I think that all of my paragraph clearly state how archeologists do what they do. Hey, did you how that when Archeologists are digging on a site, there can be up to 30 people? That wold be crowded!

Finding artifacts from years and years ago is not easy, but it can be made slightly easier with the right tools.     Most of the archeologists dig at the site where they think an artifact is. They use several tools, including the skim shovel, the trowel, and the pick and shovel. The many diggers dig through a very large area, and it can take weeks. You don't always find something though.     As mentioned before, you must be patient when digging. There were settlers in 1607 and the first artifacts found from them were discovered about two hundred years after. You also have to study, and a lot. The National Park Service studied for five entire years just to figure out how the land was used. Sometimes, it doesn't take as long, but it usually takes a while.     Also, you may not know whether the artifact you have found is from that time. People may have later settled in that same area and left more modern things behind, and you have mistaken it for something ancient. Or, you might just be looking in the wrong spot and not find anything at all. You might mistake something useless for something valuable, or vice versa. Archeologists have to be very careful when they examine the things they have found because it might be worth something. You never really know until you study closely.     When a group of archeologists is lucky, they can find nearly one million artifacts each year.

Archeologists are people who dig up ancient artifacts and see what they are, who they belonged to and when it was from.  It can take days to find something valuable.  Archeologists use special tools such as shovels, brushes, and picks.  They use picks to move dirt.  They use brushes to clear away dirt from the site and to clear off artifacts.       This is how they find artifacts.  First, they use computers to locate the artifacts.  Then, they dig up layers of the Earth's soil with a big shovel.  Then, they use smaller shovels to get to the last layer.  Next, they use the brushes to clear away the dirt on the artifact.  Lastly  they give it to the archeologist team who study it.       A 25-square-foot section can take up to two weeks to dig!  Finding things can be important.  They can tell us important things from history like finding George Washington's things.  They tell us about him as a child, maybe.  Or they can tell us what he liked to do for fun.  It'd be boring, but it would be worth it.       That is partly what it'd be like to be an Archeologist.  Maybe you'd like to be one someday.  It might actually be fun.  You could find coins, clothes, or a pipe! 	DT VBZ WP PRP VBZ IN TO VB DT NNP NNP VBZ JJ NNP NNP MD VB DT NN IN NNP NNP POS NN VBD .

For example in the passage Digging up George Washington's Past They are talking about the artifacts that Archeologists have found.  Archeologists use different tools for digging up different things like they use the shovel and pick to start digging into the earth.  They use other tools too like Whisk and dustpan, Knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, they also use a trowel like people might use in their garden.                     An Acheologist is a very interesting job, they have to dig for treasures all day in the hot sun long but they get to learn about people and places while they are doing it.  The bad thing about being an archeologist is when your digging by a river your hole might start to fill up with water or you might dig up a coffin covered in bugs and termites.                       A nice thing about being an Archeologist is that you might get to travel around the world to dig.  Now, that would be nice unless you have to dig in the desert.                    Archeologists have to learn how to use all the tools that they need for digging. So they have to learn how to use a knife the way their supposed too because they have to use it to carefully dig the dirt out from around an artifact so they don't damage it or to use a special kind of shovel called a skim shovel because they have to use it to scrape just a thin layer of soil of the top of the earth!              Acheologists jobs can go for more than a week so they might be a way from home for a long time.  In 1961 The National Park Service ran a five year study to find where Fort James was and they found where it was after five years of searching they found a mark in the ground.  Archeologists can Find very big things to during the five year study the archeologists found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites and ten buildings.                  Archeologists have very interesting jobs I think its really cool.  Do you think its cool to?                      	. .

My favorite historic person was George Washington because he did so much for our country while he was president! Today I will tell you about George Washington,how people dug his up his house, and what he did for our country while he was president.       George Washington was a fine man. He was very nice also. He did very good things for our country while he was alive. He had wooden teeth! He also had a bunch of kids. He lived a long time ago.       In 2003 some archeologists went to dig George Washington`s house up. They went to where he lived and tryed to dig his house up. It took about one year for them to dig his house up. They found his house and found his kitchen and other parts of the house. They got proof too. It was really cool!       When George Washington was president he did very good things for our country. He helped us in war and a lot of other things that we neede help in. He was a very good man! Everybody liked him. Then one day he wasn`t president and everybody was sad. He was also our first president.       Today I told you a lot about George Washington. He was very friendly. He was a very distibutive man. He was there for us in bad and good times.

You have to decide to learn about people, called archeologists, whose job it is to study objects from the past. You will also learn about the things they do.                                          Finding Fort James Facts               In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project.   The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near a river. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologist uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. That's when they finally found Fort James.                                                                                                        -Selena                                 	NN DT NN VBZ VBG TO VB IN DT VBG JJ NN VBN JJ NNP NNS VBP VBN VBN TO VB NN IN DT JJ NNS IN NNS WP VBP JJ IN DT NN IN NNP NNP VBP TO VB TO VB IN NNS , VBN NNS , WP$ NN PRP VBZ TO NN NNS IN DT NNP NNP MD RB VB IN DT NNS PRP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP CD , DT NN IN NNS JJ IN NN DT JJ VBN NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NN VBD VBN IN CD WRB NNS VBD IN NNP TO VB DT JJ NNP NNP VBD IN NNP NNP VBD VBN JJ DT NNP NNP JJ NNS VBD VBN IN CD NNP VBD NN CC NNP NNP RB VBD DT NNS IN NNP NNP POS WRB PRP RB VBD NNP NNP NNP	N		20131018154343	550		N	20131021105127	516		N

If not well here it is. an Archeologist studies things in the past. Like think about you're idol that died about 20 to 30 years dead. What information would you like to know.For example George Washington many Archeologist have found interesting thing with special tools of course.                       Some tools are picks and shovels as you know are to dig up things. Also there are whisks and dustpans which are to help Archeologist clean the things they find. Another thing is a knife that helps take dirt of , but careful. Something that helps move dirt or things they find is a wheelbarrow. Also there's skim shovels which carefully takes off a small layer of soil.Last,but not least a trowel which helps Archeologist cut to see soils that are different.                        Going back to George Washington diggers had to prove that it was George's house. There was a fire in George's house and   that's were they found burnt pottery and part of smoked clay which George Washington actually smoked clay pipes that was more than enough prove that it was George's house.                         Finally if you want more information of diggers then here it is. Did you know that in a team there can be more than 35 people on a team! To dig up a 25-square-foot section it can take up to two weeks. :D 	NNP NNP NNP CD JJ NNP '' NNP PRP VB WP DT NNP VBZ .

Well, an archeologist is where you study about objects from the past. Sometimes, when you you find artifacts about different things, it may take a long time to find, brush, and clean. Smaller artifacts can be very hard to find.                   Archeology is one of the most interesting studies. If you find an artifact you can use a special tool or device to help find out where it came, from how old it is, and how big or small it is. The National Park Service led a 5-year study to the area to figure out how the land was used. During the 1600s, archeologists found trash that the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.                    Objects found over years include pottery, tools, coins, rocks, and also metel toys for kids. Today, gruops all over the United States find millions of objects a year!

Do you know that a lot of people want to be a Archeologist because you can find a lot of cool things like what people made or had or done in the past.       Being an Archeologist is probably a good job because the things that people had in the past they dig it up and they are the first one who sees it and who finds it.       An Archeologist's job is not that hard because they get paid when they find an artifact and some of them is really old.       There are different kinds scientist like some find a cure for something and others find stuff in the past.   	NNP NNP PRP VB WP DT NNP VBZ .

The bones can help the scientist out. The archeologist get to see what the dieinsor bones look like.                       Archeologist is a great thing to study.

While digging in the area.                            its exiting to discover ojects that were regularly used by people who lived hunderds of years ago.

To begin with archeologists find all kinds of things that were at george washington's house from all these years.Then they have to carefuly process digging the ferry farm.Then each year many teams would work on site.             Another reason is that they spend days in the lab studying about objects that are found.The diggers also use a process that's called troweling.Troweling is when a archeologists use a small shovel and some wooden picks to remove the dirt from the ground.              In other words george washington's home wasvery important because of all kinds of reasons. Another thing is that historians also learn about type's of lifes in colonial americans.All kinds of things are like key parts from past at america.

To being with an archeologist helps people to learn more. A job of an archeologist learns the people from long time ago how they live, eat , and chores. An archeologist sometimes inspcets the  old-style house. Then the discovered how they did all of that.                      Next example, an archeologist hads to study about them . An archeologist studys books to discovered what the learn. Books help them to understand how the old-style people. It takes time to learn about them.                                                                                                        Last reason, an archeologist has to be clever to be an archeologist. Sometimes an archeologist has to be clever because when they learn something inportant thety have to think of cleverness.  If they are not clever they can't study good. An archeologist is really a tough job.

The fort was built in 1607, when the people from England came to start a better   life. The settlers think the fort was built by a river. So over 200 years the people thought   the fort has been washed away by the river. some stuff hint it mite be still around. The first object was found in 1861. The Archeologist also found armor and the floors of the   building.                 Over 100 years later the Archeologists to find the exact spot the fort it was built.   The National Park Service led a 5 year study. Today the groups finds one million objects a year.

People who really do like digging up the past want to dig up the past because they want to learn about history which some people think they can Google it up and that's all the history there is. Oh boy sure they are really wrong. Right now there could be a dinosaur we don't know of.       If I were an archaeologist I would like to find Cleopatra in a pyramid in her tomb. Some artifacts I would like to find are her shiny red clothes and her sparkly jewelry. Now this always gets to my mind 'Are history books really telling the truth?' I'm guessing they don't just guess the past. They take the artifacts and see how they've been handled and that tells us the story. Cleopatra wouldn't of existed to us if we didn't find her tomb.     I think the job of an archeologist would be fun because you get to find history and ancient artifacts or fossils. I wouldn't like the job of an archeologist because I have no patients to find something. I'd rather be a vetanarian.       So there's my point of view. Others may be different but mine's totally me.

These items are called artifacts.             Archeologists usally search underground for artifacts. They can look anywhere, houses, battlefields, and more. Sometimes archeologists are payed money to put the artifacts in museums.            They are usally very smart when it comes to where to look and what technology to use when looking for artifacts. I'd think that the most used tool is the skim shovel. It is flat edged so it can remove an entire layer of soil with each scoop. The pick and shovel are 2 very important tools for an archeologist. They're used when the archeologist know they're close to an artifact.                I hope this was a convincing report and hopeful, you will become an archeologist. 	MD PRP VB TO VB DT NN .

Once they find fossils, they go and clean those fossils and see what they were in the past. Archeologists spend alot of time cleaning and finding fossils. Archeologists have special tools theyuse for digging and cleaning.

By:Chloe Dockham                        In this report you will learn what tools, where, and what archeologist did to find historical items that were left by Native Americans and people from all over the globe. The archeologists have to first locate where they want to find the old artifacts and have to figure out the exact location of that artifact.              When they figure out where the spacific artifact they have to find  the correct tool. They have to ask theirselves',Do I need a pick or a shovel? Or a whisk   could help.'                When they find the correct tool its time to start the search. They continue to look for the artifact. Once they've found the artifact its back to the lab to do some reasearch.                  They arrive at the lab time to get on the internet and hit those books. They have to find out what its made of where its from and who made it. They find it out and send the information to a publishing center and they make it into a book for us kids to learn about.

Without them we would not know much about things like what tools people used or even where they lived. They teach us about how the people survived and also how they fought enemies. It also lets us know why people made the decisions they made and what they were like.       How do archeologists find all that information? First, they must find the site that the place they want to find out about is on. They look for artifacts that were used at the place and when they find some they know that the place was near or where the artifacts are. Next, they use a 3D computer that track what is under ground so that the archeologists know what to look for. Then, they start digging. They are very  careful not to damage any artifacts that are under the ground so they only dig up a bit a of dirt at a time. Finally, they study the artifacts they found and decide what they mean.       What tools do the archeologists use? Some examples of what they use include:       A pick and shovel for digging A whisk and dustpan for brushing dirt off the artifacts A knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt off artifacts A wheelbarrow to transport dirt and items from one place to another A skim shovel to remove thin layers of soil A trowel to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil       This is a bit of an archeologists job.

Archeologists have a very important job. They find old pieces of pottery or bone, which then go to the museums that we go to today.It might be cool to do such an important job like this, but it can be hard too. Image being out in the hot sun or the cold wet rain, weather is a big part in digging for old treasures. Such as if it's raining the miners cant mine and if its too hot they will be uncomfortable and they might rebel.         First of all, some artifacts help people learn more about our past and the artifacts can also help us find old burned down buildings or some that are so old that the walls are barley standing. An example of this is Fort James. Fort James has lots of artifacts around it that lead archeologists to believe that Fort James was farther away than it actually was and is. The archeologists used different tools to help find the artifacts. Such as a pick, shovel, knife, trowel, and a skim shovel.                                                                                   Thats most of the work that some people will do today.

One thing archeologist do is searching for artifacts like pottery, maps, book and more some people think as archeologists as people who find dinosaur bones. That is sometimes true but archeologists really are people who find the remains of the past.         One group of archeologists went to try to find Fort James from 1607 when the settlers came to acquire land. They found Armor and weapons in 1861 they also found floors to many buildings.           Another went to the area George Washington's house was built at and found many items like a clay pipe and burnt pottery. Which many people may find fascinating.         Archeologists use many tools while working. One tool they use is the pickaxe and the spade or shovel. They use these tools to start the dig down to artifacts. Another tool they use is the skim shovel which I find very cool. It is a shovel that has a flat edge and is used to remove a thin layer of soil. There are many other tools archeologist use.         Therefore, archeologist are people who look for lost artifacts of the past and use many tools like a skim shovel or pickaxe.

That is what I am going to tell you about, and how the archeologists found it.        George Washingtion lived on Ferry Farm, in a farmhouse. He moved some were when he was six years old.       George Washingtion smoked clay pipes,and he had fire in the house to cook things and to keep hem warm.        The archeologists had to find proof that they found George's house. They found parts clay pipes. and burnt pottery  and burnt wood.        The reason why the archeologists when looking for his house, is so we would know what he was like before he was famous.        So now you know what George Washingtion was like befor he was famous.

Basically, they have to investigate the lives of those who lived long ago. But, they also have to have the correct items to identify what people ate, did, etc. After cleaning those items, they relate them to what they would have been used for. For an example, if an archeologist was examining the life of Native Americans in one of their ancient huts, and he/she found a rabbit skeleton, then he/she would know that Native Americans ate rabbits. They study the past, discover new things about it, and can teach others about what they've learned.       An archeologist studies the past in order to get information on what they are trying to discover more about. That way they already have an idea of what else they need to know. Then, they head out to explore more about the subject. It might not be as fun to just learn about something, but it pays off when archeologists get to uncover artifacts and discover things about them.       An archeologist discovers new things while obtaining old artifacts. By finding one item, the archeologists are able to find out more things based on this 'newly discovered' object's uses and relate them to what people did. As I said earlier, we could find out that Native Americans ate many rabbits, and if rabbits were extinct today, we'd know what caused that extinction. It is also very useful to learn about because we can discover the cause of things that have happened. For an example, if we didn't know why the sky is blue (even if we do), and let's say that we found out that there was some 'blue chemical' released into the air because there were hints of it in crumbling caves from long ago, we could get rid of other fears that we have, like excess carbon dioxide makes it blue or some nonsense like that.       Lastly, archeologists can teach others about what they have learned. Obviously, they don't just find information and store it in their brains. They tell others, let's say some scientists who will then scientifically analyze that artifact and find out even more. Then those scientists will put what they learned out to the public, in a book, most of the time, to educate others. It is always good to know more about a subject because it benifits you with more knowlege. So, technically, archeologists teach the world about what they've learned.       Archeologists have a challenging job that benifits the rest of us. They study the past, discover new things, and can teach others about what they've learned. They have an important job in our society. They dig for history!

That may have been an artifact from long ago! This is what some people do for a living. They are archeologists.                How do they do it?Archeologists use special 3-D computers to track what is underground. next they record the information. Then they go to the site where they found the artifact and then they go dig. First, they use a small, sharp, and flat tool called a skim shovel and remove each layer one at a time. Next they put the dirt they had just shoveled out and put it in a sifter so that the dirt goes out and the artifacts stay in. Diggers also use troweling to find things as well. Troweling is where people use paint brushes wooden picks and small shovels to find the artifacts. It can take up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five-square-foot hole! Then they go to the lab and examine all the different things they found. Trying to find the artifacts is very difficult, tiring, and a lot of work, but it is worth it because we find out so much about our history through the artifacts.                Some tools they used include: the pick and shovel, whisk and dust pan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel and used to start digs and tom penetrate the earth to get to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan were used  to brush the artifact clean and clear the dirt away from he digging site. The knife was used to scrape thick layers of dirt that are on the artifact off, and to carefully dig it out. The wheelbarrow is used to move the found items and dirt to different locations. The skim shovel is used to remove a thin layer of soil at a time with its sharp flat edges. Finally, the trowel is is used to cut soil so the archeologists can see the different layers. It is probably the most common tool an archeologist uses.                        Archeology can give us a better understanding and more knowledge of someone and/or a time period. For instance when they found George Washington's home that he grew up in, we learned more about: him as a boy, what led him to make the decisions he had made, how people lived in colonial times, etc.                In conclusion, archeologists have a hard, fascinating, long, and knowledge-gaining job. We can learn so much about history from archeologists work. I want to be an archeologist when I grow up so that I can dig up our past!

You'll need the patience, passion, and precision.      You might have to wait a while before you start digging. And even if you do dig you might not find what you are looking for. Most archeologist have to search for decades for the artifacts they want to find. Sadly, sometimes when they do find artifacts they are entirely fragile and break within seconds. It is important to wait for things to come before you start looking like clues of its existence. Often, seeking something without patience will quickly diminish.      You need some passion for discovery if you are going to become an archeologist! Don't just say,' Oh I'm going to be rich and famous because when I am an archeologist I'll find a gigantic chocolate city!' That's not how it works. You want to be an archeologist because you are doing it for fun. It is important to think about what doing a job is really like. In life, don't look in the past or future, focus on the present.      Precision with tools is what you also need to be an archeologist. The pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skin shovel, trowel, and many of tools are involved with the job. If there is a ancient pot need to be dusted for futher examination and you sweep it like a madman... CRACK! It is important to be careful with everything. Generally speaking, not everyone can do everthing.      If you have patience, passion, and precision these thing you are the man for the job!

These artifacts that they find teach us, students, about the past and how we can learn stop these mistakes from happening in the future.             Learning             Many archeologist have to research where they are going and what they are expecting from this place. They have to study, study, study! These fantastic scientist work with people other than archeologist, they work with teachers,scientist, and more!        How You Can Get Involved           You can get involved in your community by going to the library and going to different camps and things. First, you can get books about archeology and learn more, find information, and see how you can find items. After, you do that  ask your parents to help find camps near by you. Finally, you can go to college with archeologists and more! Thank you for reading my tips.

Next,  they have to sift through the dirt very slowly. You also would have to use a lot of tools. Plus if you don't use them right, then you would have to go out for another dig!       Well if you want to be an archeologist you would have to know some history. If you found a special artifact, then you would want to know what it is so you could identify it. You would also want to be able to know who had it before you uncovered it. Back in the 1600s there were a lot of famous people that lived in that time period.       One more thing, you cant be afraid of dirt! If you were to kneel down in the dirt to get something you would be covered with dirt. You would have to be willing to have a little layer of dirt on you once in a while. An archeologist has a pretty tough job. Although, it would be fun!!

Archeologists search for many things.  They look for artifacts from certian people in history.  But they also look for all artifacts in general too.  They look for artifacts from a famous person in history's childhood.  They look for historical places and boundries too.  If they find a historic site they'll search for artifacts within that boundry.  Artifacts they find are from all times in history.  They could find artifacts from the dinosaur time to Rosa Parks' time.Once they do find an artifact they restore it.           It takes lots of work to find an artifact.  They use lots of different tool too.  They use:   A pick and shovel A whisk and dustpan A knife A wheelbarrow A skim and shovel And a trowel   They use a pick and shovel to simply dig into the soil.  That is how most excavations start.  The whisk and dustpan is for brushing away any loose dirt from the artifact, or taking dirt away from the site.  A knife is used to scrape the dirt off the artifact.  It is also used to dig very carefully under the soil.  The knife is used for very careful projects.  The wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt away from the excavation site.  It also carrys different items away too.  The skim shovel is used to dig a thin layer of dirt at a time.  And a trowel is used to cut and to scrape the dirt away so they can view the different layers of soil.  A trowel is probably the most common tool.      Some of the items I read about that archeoligists have found are items from George Washington's barn and James Fort.  They have found George Wasahington's clay pipe.  they also found where his family barn used to be.  At Fort James they found armor and weapons, floors of buildings, ledges to hold cannons, eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, ten buildings, pottery, tools, coins, metal toys for children, and where they through all their trash.  All this helps us learn things.  Thats why people are all still searching today.  That is what an archeologist does.

For over 200 years,  people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock  ships there, so it made  sense that the settlers would  choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.       The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would hep them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.       That's when they  finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawing they made,the archeologists knew that  the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched  all the way to the river.Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons.The archeologists also found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.       Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The objects include pottery, tools,coins, and even metal toys for children.In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While digging in the area, the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.The information learned from these objects  helps us understand how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. We also know how the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.       It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.

Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.       The fort was built in 1607, when settlers came from England to start a new life.   The first object was found in 1861. Archeoloists, the name for the scientists who study objects from the past ,uncorered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of building. Over 100 yearslater,a group effort to find the exact spot where the front was built.

An archeologist is some one who studies history and objects from the past, uncover armor and weapons. They are very signifficant in many ways. For example, we need scientists to discover and teach us about how life and earth was in the past. So archeologists and people know how and why things happened.       Archeologists have been discovering rearly one million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Archelogosists have discovered many things. For exaple, in the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. The also know how the settlers survived when they had little food. Archiologists have been using technonlogy and hand tools to dig up the best and finest information they can find from the past. For example, the used tools like pick and shovels, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. These tools where really important.       Most digs start with the Pick and Shovel. It is used to dig the eatrth, colse to the artifacts. The Whisk and Dustpan is ued to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knifes are used for carefuly diging and crapping dirt from around artifacts. The wheelbarrow was an important tool. It is used to move itmes from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The Skim Shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. And the last tool is the trowel. It is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is ues to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Archelogist are also using small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. Archiologists are using 3D computeres that can track waht is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know how it will look when they start digging.        In conclution, Archeologists have a really important job. Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. Archeologists are bringing to life the county's first president in ways we have never seen.

There can be up to thirty-five people on a team just to find one artifact! The first team can map the area by using 3D computers that can track what is right under our feet. The information is recorded so that people will know what the item will look like before people start the actual digging.                    Another team has to focus on the actual digging, and the spot the team does the digging is called 'a dig'. Those archeologists start their dig with skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove layers of soil, one  at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out well while the artifacts stay in the box.            The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.              The discovery of Washington's house is important for many reasons. First, it gives the people of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he was famous. We also begin to know why he made the decisions that he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are parts of our past as Americans.                        And that is the job of an Archeologist.

It must be hard for them for just sitting there and dinging things up all the time. and i wonder what crazzy thing they find with the bones if i did tings like that it would be cool.                   i hope they stay safe when they do thing like that they could over heat get to could or othe tings like that.some of the thing i se on tv about that it looks cool to do but tireing.

Then a hundred years later in 1994 They had a search go out to find Fort James succeeded. they had found the structure marks that had bean there since 1607. They had found burial sites,cellars, and pottery. The border of the fort was the way all the to the river. There they found were cannons had bean laid for defenses   against their foes. It was first suspected to be there when a  archeologists in 1861. He had found armor and weapons during his dig. These items were found by a group a hundred years later. National park had a little study that went to five years. Now they they find a lot more items then they did on the first day. They are mostly money, pottery, odd and old tools, and metal toys. These discoveries could help us see into the past and relativist.

The dig had started in 2003.His house used to be in/on Ferry Farm.They did not know were his house was until a group found artifacts like a pipe. However this is a small piece of evidence, but we do know that George liked to smoke pipes. It took them a whole year just to find one building.They found a farmhouse a couple years later. Also there were four other houses in the area they weer digging in. So, they needed to find more proof.                                                  Source #2                                        Digging up Objects        A processes of digging is a hard work for people who are not. Any ways there is a first group of the computer guys who do the 3-D of what the land would have looked like back then. Then the second team works on the real digging rather than the 3-D computers. They start out any dig with the skim shovel rather than a regular shovel. The reason why is because of how takes a layer of soil one at a time.   Then the soil is put into a small box with a screen at the bottom this lets the chunks go into the screen and the soil slips into the small holes in the screen. Troweling is also a good way to dig. Troweling is what archeologist use with a small shovel, paint brushes, and wooden pick axes. They all remove the dirt, this procces can take up to two weeks just to dig a 25-square-foot hole!The last but not least science team actualy examines and determine what the object actualy is and was used for.

First if you want to be an archeologists you have to study alot and if you do not like studying then you will not be able to do this job because it  has alot of studying you have to do .       Then you will have to go to other people's house to do this job and other places that you have to discover.The project was  designed to discover the secrets of Jamestown.For overe 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away.       After that you will study objects from the past and what they did and how they did it and who made it.You will find alot of thing's and you will have to study them.       Last you have to be ready to do this job and if you  are not ready to do it that mean you have not been studying for this job and you have to know how to do the wisking and dusting and that is how you do this job to be a archeologists.

Well, there is a lot of reasons people all over America treasure these. First, They are objects fom hundreds of years ago and it is fascinating to many people how humans lived over 300 years ago.                  Also, the artifacts can teach us how people lived 300-400 years ago and see how innovative they were, and help America become as innovative and resourceful as humans were back then.                  Although there is many productive reasons why these artifacts are important, there is many other reasons that people save these artifacts. Well, for one who doesnt like books? many people take a look at these artifacts and can learn a lot more about Goerge Washington and settlers in Jamestown so they can create and best-selling biography or a book of facts.                 One last reason why people all over America treasure these is, well, Why not? they are fascinating objects that people used centuries ago and are great for collecting and giving to someone as a gift, the pottery can be beautiful and some people can trace the artifacts back to their ancestors.                  So, as you can see there is many reasons people work so hard to discover and treasure these. It is a very important part of American history and it always will be.

They have to fit the past's puzzle pices together so it makes cence.They have to find out where they need to dig so they are not digging forever.They also have to map out where there going to dig.Then, they start digging  with piks and shovels (Most digs start with these two tools,used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts) and they probly have to use  skim shovels( a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin  layer of soil with each scoop) or they use a Trowel (Probsbly the most comman tool in archeology.Used to scrape and cut to view the differnt sayers of soil).After they find the artifact they use whisks and dustpans(Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavetion site) and knifes( Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts). Theyhave to be very careful no to destroy or hurt the object in any way.       Lots of people and time!!       There can be up to 35 people on a team!There can be about two teams to a section! It takes about to weekes to dig a 25-spusre-foot section!But all of this work and time is worth it because finding important stuff such as George Washington's first house teaches us a lot about history and helps us understand history better.They found lots of stuff like pottery,tools, and even metal toys for children.

It may take months or years to find what they may be looking for, and they have specific tools. Archaeologists may find everyday objects from years ago, or one of our old presidents houses!        Archeologists use tools you may even use in your garden. Some of them are: wheelbarrow, trowel, and a shovel. Though some aren't everyday objects for example: Whisk, pick, or a skim shovel. A skim shovel is used to remove small amounts of dirt at a time. The soil removed is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This screen allows soil to fall out while found artifacts stay in. Another tool is a whisk and dustpan, these are used to clear soil off artifacts. one tool that is a good use outdoors in general is a wheelbarrow. wheel barrows can be used to move artifacts and/or other items. they may also be used to clear dirt away from the dig.       Finding one item or place can take many years of work from many teams. When finding Fort James,   Archeologists uncovered armor and weapons, they also found floors from buildings. Over 100 years after those discoveries, multiple teams  put in effort to find where the fort was built. These teams took more than 100 years to just begin searching for where Fort James was built. finding objects from hundreds of years ago may take a hundred years.       Some things or places Archeologists searched for were fameous landmarks, such as George Washingtons house as a young boy. No one knew exactly where THe WAshington home was located because the building was far past gone. Archeologists believed that the base of the house was still there. they began digging in 2003, It took over a year to find it. but they only found few rooms at first, the kitchen,, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found th farmhouse years later. The diggers needed to prove that this house did belong to the Washington family. Rocords had shown that there had been a fire. THey found pieces of burnt pottery, witch shows a sign that there had been a fire there. They also knew  that Washington smoked clay pipes, when they found part of a clay pipe, that gave more evidence that this was george washingons house as a boy.       Argheologists look for things over very long periods of time, with specific tools and artifacts could be part of a fameous landmark.

People have lived on the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000 years. Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home.       Therefore, it's not suprising that George Washington's father, Augusting Washington,moved his family there.

Their job is to study and discover objects from the past, those objects will teach us about what people in the past ate or what they hunted with, even what they created shelter with. Also their studies have found fossils of plants and animals. Sometimes they have even found skeletons or just bones of animals.                    When archeologists are searching for fossils, bones, or an object they use a pick, shovel, skim shovel, trowel and knife to carefully get the artifact without fracturing it. Once the archeologists have gotten the artifact out from the ground they use a whisk and dustpan to carefully dust of the dirt from the artifact. Finally if the artifact is to big or heavy for them to carry they use a wheelbarrow to move the heavy artifact safely.                    Without archeologists we wouldn't have known about dinosaurs. So if u ever see something in the dirt, dig it up and see what u can discover. Who knows maybe u will be an archeologist and discover something new.

Archeologists can study historical artifacts, prehistoric artifacts, and a lot of others.They use tools and resourses to help them.For example they use shovels to dig deep into the ground and Archeaologists that dig for bones use brushes to wipe the dirt off of the bones so they can see the bones better. They also use a knife to dig or scrape dirt from around the artifacts, the wheelbarrel is used to take things from one place to another or to take the dirt away from the artifacts or where they are working, the skim shovel is used to carefully take a thin layer of soil with every scoop you take, and the trowel is used to scrape and cut things to see the layers of the soil.        Archeologists study things from the past and the things they find can somtimes help us know what life was like a long time ago when we weren't alive to it.

The first objects found in 1861.A more specific name for scientists is archeoligist.Wow I never knew that!The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.Today the group nearly 1 million objects each year.They also knew what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.           It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years of ago.It gives us a piece of the past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.I'm learning that what we know about George Washington comes from his time as being a soldier and president.           The discovery of Washington;s home is imprtant for many different reasons.First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous.We begin to know why he made the decisions he made.                      The George Washington society runs summer worshops with both classroom and outdoor activities.Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans.The folks at ferry Farm are bringing to life the country's first president in ways we have never seen.

It is important because an archeologist has to be patient, careful,and know how to use all the tools.         To begin with the job of an archeologist is to dig up interesting obects from the past.An archeologist must be patient and careful while doing this. They must be patient and careful because if they stop being patient and dig very fast they could break the  artifect there digging up. But to do all this stuff the archeologist would need some special tools.      Some of those tools are a pick and shovel. Those are important because most digs start with those tools.Other tools they use are a knife that is used carefully to scrape dirt off artifects.A whisk and dust pan wich are used to claen the item. Also a wheelbarrow is used  carry items from one place to another or to move dirt.Skim shovels are shovels with a flat edge used carefully to remove a thin layer of wich each scoop.But a trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.          In conclusion, an archeologists job is very important because it recuires patients, carefulness, and you need to know how to use the tools.

I'm going to tell you all about the tools we use.The first ones i'm going to tell you about is the pick and the shovel they are used for to dig into the earth.Next,there is a whisk and dustpan it's used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.Then,there is a knife it is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts and there is a wheel barrow it's not really a tool but it helps by to move things one place from another like dirt.The last two tools are a skim shovel and a trowel a skim shovel isused to shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop and a trowel is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.           To be an archeologist you have to study a lot science.An archeolgist job is to find bones or ancient artifacts.Did you know that archeologist start their did with a skim shovel.At Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved to be a junior archeologist.These are all things that archeologist do.

First you have to make the bottom this is when the saw comes in handy cut some of the wood however you want the bottom of your raft. Be carefull don't cut yourself! Cut it smoothly but remember be carefull! Next you can do the sides of your raft! Do the same directions as last time with the bottom. The only difference is you can nail  both peices together.      Now you can nail them in with the hammer and nails. After you do that you are allowed to paint your raft any color. (I would choose gold but you can use whatever kind you want)  So now you are going to make the paddle you can make the paddle you can use the left over wood to make the paddles you may only need two peices of wood.

They need to answer important questions correctly.                 An archoelogist is smart, resourcesful, and tough. They must be able to come up with a plan, find the resources the need to follow through wth it, and exucute correctly. The have to be able to deal with bad weather, tired co-workers, and harsh conditions.               The archeologists that were digging up jamestown were  there for five years. If that does not show toughness, then I don't no what is.               The traits of an archeologist  all help him/her complete the task ahead of them. If I were an archeologist, this would be my plan: travel to diging site, set up camp, get rest, dig the next day from morning to night, find artifacts, eat, sleep. Repeat until task is complete.

They can get lots of clues to what they are trying to find. They also get to go to cool plaes, like the ocean or the forest. They find things that are very interesting and they just have to study it and sometimes it is a very big clue to what they are trying to find. Archaeological have to read a lot and ask queshcns.               They would also have to draw things so they don't forget the thing or plaes. When they would make drawing the draw would sometims go togther and that would be a big clue to what they are trying to find. They would find or draw maps and findout that sometimes they where wrong and the plaes or thing wasn't there.                 Sometimes after the mishion they would still find things. Sometimes they find things about other people in history and findout that something elas happen there.                  When archaeoloicals go into a area they name it something, like when they were diging up the past about George Washingtion's childhood they called that the dig. When archaeological are diging they have to be very careful and take there time because they might break something and they may not know how to put it back togther! How they know were to dig, you might ask. Well they use this 3D comuters that can track undergroud.                    Every year, teams will work on one area. Did you know there can be up to 35 people on a team. That is a lot of people working on one area.

Fort james will coax archeologites into going to find more critical things it has reseverd in the ground. Recovering Washingtons past, his ferry farm, took many rough years to find but payed of after the the shocking things they found. there are many of tools that seem ominous but helped us find those amazing artifacts. History has all of our urgent things.                Fort james is a importent place for our miners for, they disoverd all of its fantastic items it had to offer. Notably, we found their ominous swords and armor while looking for Fort James. The floors of the buldings while digging in the treacherous ground.

Well of course it is! Here's why this is my belief: Archeologists discover a lot of artifacts and they even discover long lost places. They dig for certain things with certain tools. That's super interesting! Archeologists find bones, marks in the ground, and they even find fossils. But most of all, they dig up history.                You see, archeologists discovered dinosaur bones. But they also discovered Jamestown's Fort James. The story behind the fort was that it was washed away by a river flood. But soon, archeologists discovered that it still exists. Actually, none of it was still actually there but the memories and marks in the ground showed that was exactly where the fort was. Archeologists found artifacts near the marks in the ground where the fort was so then they new that the fort was there because of the evidence. That's how archeologists rediscovered Fort James.                   So far, archeologist's jobs sound fun! Not only did archeologists discover artifacts and Fort James, but they discovered George Washington's childhood home. Now, Washington's home is still around...Still standing...Still active! Archeologists decided to keep the house open for visiting, so people can check out how it was like to live like a colonist. Also, they hold classes where children learn to become a junior archeologist and to solve puzzles about the colonial time period right inside and near Washington's home at the site where you can see the giant artifact, his home!                   The tools are most important to archeologists! If an archeologist doesn't have tools, how is he or she supposed to discover artifacts. Think about it, if archeologists don't have tools, then museums wouldn't be around today. Picks and shovels are used for digging. When digging, these are normally the ones that archeologists use first. They use whisks and dustpans, too. The whisks are for dusting off dirt and the dustpans are to collect that dust. Knives are used for scraping off the dirt and cutting the dirt to dig. Wheelbarrows are used to carry an artifact from one place to another. Skim shovels are used for removing one layer of soil every scoop. Trowels are used most commonly because in archeology, they truly are the most helpful.                  So, I hope everyone thinks that archeology is important to history. Archeologists truly do have an fun and important job. They sure do know how to dig up history! 	VBG IN NNP . VBZ DT NN POS NN NN .

The fort was built in 1607 when a group of migrant came from England to start a new life.                                                         The name for scientists who study object from the past and uncovered a armor and weapons is called a archeologists. Finally the archeologist group found James Fork.                                     Some tools used by archeologists is a pick and shovel,whisk and dustpan, knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel and trowel.

The tools used were called picks, shovels, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel.These tools were useful in many ways. All these tools were use for special causes.In the passages below they will explain what the tools are use for.            The picks, shovels and trowels were use for different causes. For example the shovels were use to dig deeper into the earth. If the archeologists wants to make a deep hole for a pond he will have to use a shovel to  make it really deep. The skim shovel is use to remove thin layers of soil out of the ground. The flat edge would be really great help because the normal shovel is round so it will not help on flatting the soil. The pick is almost the same thing as a shovel it will dig far into the earth. A trowel is the most common tool there is. It is use to scrape off soil from very old things.            The knife is used for a little reason. For example the knife is used to chisels things from the past. If the thing has a little dirt the knife will chisel it right out. The dustpan is used to clean anything left over from the past. Wheelbarrows are the most common tools it is used to move heavy items from place to place. The wheelbarrow could do more than carry things place to place. It also helps move dirt. The dirt could be useful like it could be left behind to remember why it was left there.

Another hard job would've been finding fort james they had to dig for it for a while then they finally found artifacts. Then after that they keep on digging a found about 1 million each year.   All the tools they use for this a georges washingtons house historyare pick and shovels, whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel and probably more tools.

You can dig in histroical places that aren't open to the public. You can study ancient artifacts and maybe become famous for a discovery. You will have an exciting but tiring time in the digs or the lab. Here are some things that you can experience as an archeologist.                  Here is how you find and study artifacts. First, a team map the area so that you can find what's underground. Next, another team called the dig does the actual digging. They start the dig with skim shovels to remove thin layers of soil one at a time. The soil is placed in a special box where there is a half-inch screen at the bottom so the dirt can fall out while the artifacts stay in. Then, the archeologists use a whisk and dustpan, small shovels, paint brusthes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. Finally, the objects are taken to the labratory to be studied.                As an archeologist, you will use many different tools while you are working. The pick and shovel most commonly starts the digs. They are used to dig into the soil, close to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan is used to brush dirt off artifacts and away from the digging site. The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the objects. The skim shovel is used to move a thin layer of soil with each scoop. A trowel is the most commonly used tool. Its used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. The wheelbarrow is used to carry items from one place to another or to take dirt away from the excavation site.                Kids, if you're intrested in becoming an archeologist when as a job when you're older, here are some suggestions. You can go to the place where George Washington's home was discovered before he became famous, Ferry Farm. You can go to their summer workshops with both indoor and outdoor activities. Kids can explore the site, experience colonial life, and become junior archeologists by signing up for classes, games, and crafts. You can even go to their website and solve puzzles about work at Ferry Farm.               Being an archeologist is a nice experience. You can dig in historical places that are closely guarded, study ancient artifacts, become famous, and have fun. Don't miss your chance to become an archeologist, no matter what your age is!

Whisk and Dustpan: Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.   Knife: Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow: Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.   Skim Shovel:A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.   Trowel: Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrapeand cut to view the different layers of soil.           Finding Fort James   In 1994 a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeologcial Project. The project was disigned to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia.                     The fort was built in 1607 when the setters came from England to start a new life. Most believe that James Fort was built near the river. It was eaiser to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.                   The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists, the name for scientist who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later , a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

They were also sure that James Fort was shaped like a triangle in a forest.And spent a long time serching for everypice of history.While using all those tools and all that people in a year.

When they are getting closer to an artifact they might start using the skim shovel to take off layers of dirt. Once they get to the artifact, they would probably dust it off with the whisk and dustpan.After that they would take it away in the wheelbarrow.                 Archeologists usualls work in teams of up to 35 people. They would map the site using 3D computers first. Using that, they can track what there is underground. Another team focuses on the digging. they start using skim shovels. The soil is placed in a box with a half inch screen at the bottom. Some archeologists use a process called troweling. That is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and picks to remove dirt. Another team spends time in the lab studying the objects.            Some projects they might work on are trying to find out more about the things they find. They would probably try to connect their discoveries to tell a whole story. Some examples are the colonies and more about the American Indians. Others might try to find more about famous people's past.

If you want to be one of the archeologists that helped in finding Fort James then you would be their for a long time. And sometimes they even took almost five years like it says in the passage that they took five years just to study the surroundings.   Even though the archeologists  want to know the results they have to take their time. And sometimes they get really wore out because of that. The archeologists take their time, and I bet when they get finished in the end they are real proud because they spent so much time on it I know that I would be really proud to know that I accomplished something that big and magnificent.   But one other thing is that they go to collage and school or they used to. Like I said it would take a lot of time to just get were they started in their career. Now I certainly would love to be an archeologist to discover all sorts of different things and get to be really,really smart after a really, really long time. But after all that I bet they get used to the late nights,early start offs and, the really hard work!

A few other things they do is help out with the police to help with investigations and clues to get the criminal they need to catch.

Where they dig up stuff is called a dig. In this report I will tell about two digs: the dig of George Washington's home, and the Fort James dig.       The  dig of G.W.'s home was hard, since his home is no longer standing. It took over a year to find his home but they did in the end. They found the farm several years later. Since then they have found a large number of things,from pipes to pottery.       The Fort James dig started in 1994. They have found 11 cellars and several burial grounds. The study took 5 years. The fort is shaped like a triangle.       The tools used by them are the pike, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel.As you can see, archeologists have interesting jobs.

It says that he did a projet he discover didings.He start a new life in England.For over 200 years people thout that James Fort was died because he had been washed away by a river.There was a fort that was built in 1607 when some settlers came to England.The settlers did whatever to survive the difficull years they had a little water and food.                          A girl wrote an essay about Gorge Washinton he was an clever man and he never gaved up.Ones they sayed that Gorge Washinton cut down his fathers tree.He was the first presedent of the Unitied States of Amirica also known as USA.He was an a war aganst patriots and the red couts.He nevered lived in the white house.

In this story you will not just learn what they do you will learn how they do it.               Archeologists have a very important job. They find our history so we can learn too. Read on and find more about Archeologists.                                                                         Nobody knows where the Washington's house was. Archeologists believed the base was still there. In 2003 archeologists started to dig. After they start digging they have to be prepared to prove stuff too. Like after they found what they thought was Washington's house they had to prove it because 4 other houses have been built on that lot. They proved it by finding burned clay in the house because the Washington's had a fire in the house. Archeologists also have teams. One team uses 3-D computers to find where the stuff is underground. Another team digs up what the other team finds with tools like Pick Axe, Whisk, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. And another team study's the findings.                           Archeologists have to guess sometimes too. Like when they were trying to find the James fort. They didn't know where the fort was. They thought it was by the river but others said it was farther away from the river. So they had to guess which one and they found the fort away from the river.                  Archeologists have to be very, very careful also. They have to use tools that wouldn't damage any of the findings of the objects like whisks, and trowels. That would be the last thing archeologists would want to have our history damaged. Sometimes it can take 2 weeks to dig up a 25-square foot section. It takes so long for this process to take place but it is definitely worth it.                       Today 1 Milloin objects are discovered each year. Archeologists have cool jobs, maybe you would like to become one someday.     	NNP PRP RB VBN IN NNP . NNP PRP VB WP PRP VBP .

You also have to have at least some prior knowledge. Finally you have to be interested in what you are discovering, if you are not it takes half the fun out of it.        The other part of archeologist are working the computers and other technology. They find locations were the might be artifacts or any other old artifacts. Personally I would like to be one of these people if sports didn't take off for me. Archaeologist have a cool job.

Moss                An archeologist job is sometimes easy and sometimes hard to do. It has a lot of things involved in it like finding more about human history and finding new places that will help us understand more about animals too. You can find out more about what they made and how they made it. Also you can figure out how and what they use to hunt and make food. You can find a lot of things about human history with just digging and researching things.                How is it easy and how is it hard to be an arologist? It is sometimes easy for a archeologist because if your use to being an archeologist (Like if your an expert at it). Its mostly because your use to it or you have researched being a archeologist. But mostly its hard for a lot of people because their beginners at being a archeologist. Like they might do something wrong once or twice.                You can find a lot of things under the earth like bones,trash,and sometimes things that the past owner of the house,land,or place had or buried underground. Like maybe you can find cooking tools or toys and books. Also if you do find a book it could be somebody's diary back in the or while a war or event was going on. If you do dig up bones you can see what kind of animals use to live in the world there. Maybe you can even see different type of rocks and jewelry they use to make back then and sell it and make a lot of money.            You can find out new way they use to do things. Like maybe they don't wash dishes like we do. Or maybe they don't wash clothes  like we  do. We could find tools they use to help them. And we could probably find weapons they use to fight with during war. And if you do find a tool you can always find out how it works too.

Sometimes archeologists will study some historical sites from where some past presidents have lived. Just like where George Washington lived when he was a boy before he became president. Or maybe you could explore a fort like Fort James! Being an archeologists could be a fun job for a lot of people.       Archeologists have to use many tools. Some examples are: a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. A pick and shovel are used for digging into the Earth and getting close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan are used for brushing dirt of the artifact  and clear away dirt from the site. A knife is used for for careful digging and to scrape dirt away from around the object. The other objects are used for different things too. Those are just some examples.       Finding the things that archeologists find at the location has a long process behind it. Especially the project at George Washington's house. Their process is a very careful one. Each year they have A LOT of teams work on the site. There can be up to as many as 35 people on a team! Now that is a lot! The first team will map the area using a 3D computer, that can track what is underground. The information is recorded  so that the people on the teams know what it looks like underground before they start digging.One of the other teams that are on the project will focus on the actual digging. The place where the actual digging is done is called a dig. Well that makes sense!       Once they have finished digging up the soil, it is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This will let all the dirt fall out while artifacts stay in. The diggers use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It could take up to 2 weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section! Then one more team spends DAYS in the lab studying the artifacts that were found. The whole process is slow and not so fun, but it is totally worth it.       As you see, being an archeologist is hard work. Even though it seems hard, I bet you would still want to be one!

Archeologist are here to help you understand. In 1994 a group of people were trying to discover the secrets behind Fort James in Jamestown Virginia. Over 200 people say that it was washed away by a river. Discoveries say that it still may be around.It was built in 1607 near a river. They built it there so ships could dock there. There are objects that suggest that there was another fort located farther away.The new spot gave settlers more protection and safety. Archeologist first found the objects in 1861. The national park service led a 5 year study to the area to figure out how the land was used. They used mapping on the computer to make an image on the area. That's when they found fort James.            Archeologist are people who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered floors and buildings over 100 hundred years old. Some of the tools that Archeologist use are a knife, pick and a shovel,whisk and dustpan, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.            Do you know much about George Washington's childhood? Let me tell you a little bit about it. He as a boy moved to Ferry Farm when he was 6 years old. The Farm is 12,000 years old. Archeologist didn't know exactly where the house was, so the Archeologist had to do some research ion where it was. In 2013 they started digging. In a year they found where the house was. The first building they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main house a few years later.               Now you know what Archeologist do when they have to find information when they need it. You also know what kind of tools they use. Let's review. They have the whisk and dustpan, pick and shovel, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel, and last but not least the knife. Thank you for reading this article. This information you should now know now.

It was created to find the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 2 hundred years, people thought that James Fort was swept away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. When the fort was built ,in 1607, settlers came from England to start a new life. Most belived that James Fort was built by the river. However, objects were found nearby showed that the fort was further away. The new spot probably gave more protection from enemy ships.                          Digging Up George Washington's Past                              Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his years as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have very good infromation of our first president's childhood. That's changing, however recent discoveries have helped historiansknow more about Georges childhood. People have lived on a land called by the name Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It is a perfect place  to build a house and thats what Augustine Washington did. George and his family moved there when he was 6 years old. No one actualy knew where his house was because it was burned down in a fire. Though it was gone, people actually found the stone base of Washington's home and a few artifacts.

An archeologist is a person who study's objects from the past. Archeologists are sorted into teams, there can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologists start to dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Trowling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.

One of the stories is Finding Fort James. It's about a group of peaple that are interested in studing the past of Jamestown rediscovery.  Another story is  Digging up Goarge Washinton's Past. It's about Goarge washinton came from his time as a soldier and president.           They are both alike by discovering Jamestown and Goarge Wasthinton. They both talk about information. Also the archeologists. In 1994 a group of people are iterested in studing the past of James Town Rediscovery Archeologists. It was designed to descover the town of James Town, Verginia. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life for them. The archeoligists found evedents from James Town.                   As you can see archeologistsfound all of these things about Fort James Town. Those archeologists dig up things that we can not find right now they diged them with a shovel that was called the skim shovels. They are usually small,flat, and sharp they can remove thin soil,one at a time.                 	JJ NN '' . DT JJS NN , VB PRP VB PRP DT NN VBP PRP IN NN .

They find the artifacts by doing a dig. A dig is where archeologists go to a site and use computers that make a 3-D image that shows a picture of what is under ground. Once they find the spot where the artifact is they will Start digging.                 To start a dig they get into teams of about 35. One team gets the 3-D image ready and the other team digs. Some digs are really long, like the Ferry Farm Dig. Ferry Farm is where George Washington lived. In the Ferry Farm Dig they found a clay pipe witch George Washington used to smoke.                 Another major dig was the James Fort Dig. This dig was to find James Fort. Before they started the dig people thought that the fort got washed away. But as they started to dig they found that the fort stretched miles out from the river. They found signs of the forts walls which was one of the clues that told them that the fort stretched out so far.                 Some tools used for an archeological dig are:       Pick and shovel   Most digs start with this tool. Used to get further into the soil and closer to the artifacts.       Skim shovel   Used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil.       Whisk and dustpan   This tool is used to clear away soil from above or an an artifact.       Knife   Used to carefully remove dirt from around the artifact.       Wheel barrow   Used to move dirt and artifacts around.       Trowel   This tool is probably the most common tool used in archeological digs, used to scrape and cut through the soil to see the different layers.                 To review an archeologist is a person who studies artifacts from the past. A dig is when people dig to find artifacts. To start a dig they split into two teams and use a computer to get an image of what is in the ground. to finish there are seven main tools used.

I had already written everything about archeologists. You were supposed to write about something to do with history.         I started talking about my project. Archeologists were now studying Fort James. This project was planned to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in an area hinted that it might still be around.         Next, I started talking about Digging up George Washington's Past. Most  of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood. That's changing, however. Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.         Lastly, Archeologists use a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel.         As you can see archeologists have many things to do.

For your directions to beginning you will look at several sources.You can look at any sources you like.Source #1 will be on the article about how archeologists find artifacts at Jamestown Island which is based on information in the following sources:     http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/chronology-of-jamestown-archeology.htm   http://historicjamestown.org                                                                                              http://apva.org/rediscovery.                                                                                                                                        FINDING FORT JAMES                                            by  Cheryl Bradley             In 1994,a group of people were interested in studying the past starting at the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.this project was designed to discover the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia. For around 200 years,people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river.Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.The fort was made in 1607 when settlers came from England to begin a new life.Most believed that James Fort was build near the river.It was easier to dock ships there,so it finally made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.Their new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from the enemy's ship.            Source #2's article about archeologists working at George Washinton's house is based on information in the following sources:       http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/digswashington-200809.html c=y and page=1       http://www.kenmore.org       http://diganthro.wordpress.com/ferry-farm       http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/ProcessArch/ProcessArch/feild excavationtech.html       http://diganthro.wordpress.com                              TOOLS USED BY ARCHEOLOGISTS       PICK AND SHOVEL:                                        Most digs start with these two tools.Used to dig into earth,close to the artifacts.       WHISK AND DUSTPAN                                             Used to brush off dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.       KNIFE               Used to careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.       WHEELBARROW                                  Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away away from the excavation site.       SKIM SHOVEL                            A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.

You may think he's an adventure character, but actually he is an archeologist. His job is a lot of work.   Archeology is digging to find artifacts and learn about our history. Depending on where they dig, they can find out where George Washington lived as a child. They can also find out about the early American colinists. Their work takes years for just finding out one thing. Archeology is the study of finding out about the past.    Archeologists use many different tools. When they start a dig, a search for artifacts, they use a special shovel called, a slim shovel. It is used to take the thinnest peices of soil. Then they use a trowel, a device that seperates the soil from the artifacts. Archeologists use different tools for different reasons.   Archeology is a hard career, but it is amazing what you would find. They use certain tools for different reasons. And they find out about our past. If there weren't any archeologists we wouldn't know anything about our past.   	NNS VBP PRP RB VBD DT NN POS NNP NNP .

I think about George Washington, Harriet Tubman, and sometimes even Abe Lincoln.  Archaeologists don't only examine people, they can also study objects.  Archaeoligists do research, and examines objects.       First, they do research.  They usally do reseach on dead people who they don't know about.  They could also do it on a tv star that is really old.        Sencond, they also examine things or objects.  They could dig up a house that burnt down to envestigate on it.  That old stuff  would be worth a lot of money now.           An Archeoligist sound like a lot of fun.  Researching things, and  examing.  Mabye I will grow up to be a archeoligist.

In this statement you will see how they teach us about the past, find valuable artifacts that help us under stand parts of history, find helpful diaries and books, how they find important inventions from long ago, and how they find ancient civilizations.      Archeologists teach us about the past. They find old ruins and evidence about battles that have taken place. They find skeletons of warriors, cavemen, and so many more. Scientists can study these skeletons and see how they died and other tings that answer questions society has for that specific time period. We have even found Noah's Ark from the Bible.      Archeologists find valuable artifacts that help us under stand parts of history. We have found many artifacts in James town that have helped us figure out how they lived, even some of the food them and their pets ate. Also, just by studying the trash from the time period, we know more than we did before about James town. Also, from the fossils we find we can know about many of the species at the time.      Archeologists find helpful diaries and books. We have found diaries of many presidents and other important people we didn't have much history about before because of archeologists looking in the right places. Also, we have also have found many books such as the bible, we even have the first bible ever made or so people say. We now many things about different time periods because of diaries and books from long ago.      Archeologists find important inventions from long ago. Without archeologists, we wouldn't know how people from long ago wrote, collected water, and much more. Also, they have found many useful things that we would wonder about like, how people sowed and what did they use, where did they store their trash, and these are just a few of the questions I have myself.      Archeologists find ancient civilizations. Archeologists have found civilizations such as James Fort, temples, and what used to be great fortresses. By finding these, we now know about the ancient civilizations. We now know about what conditions they lived through, how well they built their structures, and how they survived threw what they did.   Also, we also know who or what they worshiped.      Archeologists help us understand the past. They help us figure out so much about our peoples history. I hope now you realize how important archeologists are. They help us find valuable artifacts, civilizations, diaries and books, and important inventions.

There can be different types of them. first there are ones were they are on computers landscaping the area in 3D. they find out what the land looks like were the primary source would probrably be are were the people on the ground should go. they use the satilites to see what the area looks like and thenthey hve to hunt down the area and tell them were it is.        Tthen there are the people that dig they use tools such as a pick and shovel.most digs start with these two tools. used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. they also use a whisk and dust pan. used to brush off the dirt and clear away dirt from the exination site. and a knife used for carefully digging and to scrap the dirt from the artifact. there is also a shovel used to carefully remove soil with each scoop. and last but not least the trowel. the most common tool used in arceyologe. used to scrap and cut thelayers of soil.

They use tools to dig up things that have been buried underground for many years. They use tools like a pick and a shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and the shovel are used to dig into the ground and dicover things. The whisk and the dustpan are used to brush dirt off of artifacts. The knife is used to do careful digging around the artifacts. Now, the wheel barrow is used to carry items around or to move dirt from the digging site. The skim shovel is used to carefully remove soil that is thin. Last but not least there is the trowel. The trowel is used to scrape, cut, and view different layers of soil. Now that is what an Archeologist is and what him or her does.

They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was began.           People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefore, it's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was just six years old at the time.       No one knew exactly where the Wahington home was located since the actual building was long gone. However, archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year, but they finally found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later.       How do the archeologists find all these things that were in Washington's house all those years ago? The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started igging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the dissing is called a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling.       Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. it can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.       The discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons. First it gives the citizens of the United States a better understading of who George Washington was before he became famous. We also being to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.

It was fun going throw the field. Wants we got there we all grouped up.       We all learned fun facts about the house and George Washington. We got to see were his bed room was. We all got suveners from the people there. When we went to the playground it was a old playground. It was all made out of wood. No one got to play on it, but we all did get to play on a different playground that wasen't so old.

They have to stay up late looking for artifacts and other special things.They also have to be very intellegent.Also,when they first start looking for something they take about two years at average just to find the location of the place!               The job of an archeologist isn't always hard or boring. Sometimes it's actualy exsiting and important. Well, thats only when you find something exsiting, of course. Also, when you find something, it actualy could tell us more about our history! You also get paid a lot of money!            Did you know what would happen if there wheren't any archeologists? Well, if there wheren't any of them we wouldn't have any Social Studys! So in this report i'm going to say' Thanks archeologists for all your hard work'.

For over 200 years some people thought that Jamestown was just a washed away river well i dont think they were right? Wel those people were wrong.        Some of the discoverys in that area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built when settlers came from England to start a new life and when they did they were much happyer.        However objects found uncovered the past.They are on presentation now but what would our life be without Archeologists!

They use many tools like pick and shovel whisk and dustpan knife wheel barrel skim shovel trowel.Theese tools have many uses for archeologists.In 1994 a bunch of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown rediscovery archeological project   It was made to discover the secrets of the james fort in jamstown, virginia.For over 200   years ,people thought that the the fort had been washed away by a river Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built im 1607   when settlers came from england to start a new life. Most belived that james fort   was built nearthe river. It was easier to dock ships there,so it made sense that the settlers   would choose the spot however objects found nearby suggested that th=at fort was located further away the new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemys ships.

Actually archeologists are people who find things in the past or in history as you call it. Archeologists find dinosaur bones, villages, statues, and many other things. They actually found Fort James and George Washington's house! Read on to know what these people do for a living:       Archeologists found many things in the past. For example, Fort James. When they found Fort James it was hard cause the area was underground from storms and floods. What they had to do first was scan the area with computer mapping systems to locate the area. Then they had to finally dig with tools such as picks, shovels, whisks, knifes, skim shovels, trowels, dustpans, and wheelbarrows. It took more than a year and then somebody found a broken down house with the items still in it! They found pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Then somebody found the pit on where the settlers at Fort James put their trash in. They found in the pit for example bones from animals which they ate. Soon enough they instantly found villages of houses in the area. Now thats a huge place!       Then archeologists had another mission to do finding George Washingtons house. Of course they did the same thing. They started digging in 2003 and then they found it a year later. The buildings they found were a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Soon they found a farmhouse. But after they found their victory nobody believed them. So they had to find some proof. In stories, people say that a fire accured there. The diggers found burnt pottery and ash. That means a fire occured. Also history says that George Washington smoked and they found clay pipes! Soon the discovery was proofed to be the right house.       Archeologists still do many other things, but thats just some of them. They still are working right now to figure out the past themselves. Let's just hope that this history will still exist. 	NNS WP VBZ DT NN VBP . NNP PRP VB NNS . NNP PRP VBG CC NN .

OK so archeologists are like paleontologists they study things from before you and me were born like in the 1600`s they find insisting artifacts and study them and some even end up in museums.   Some famous archeologists like the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project were interested in studying the past colonie known as Jamestown. Some archeologists use tools like the knife, skim shovel, trowel, wheelbarrow, pick and shovel and whisk and dustpan.Well that's that's I really hoped you liked my report and I hoped this may have inspired you to maby become an archeologist and study what happened way back when.

Archeologist descovered the secerets of James Fort that he was a builder. The archeologist found lots of idems of his near the river. The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologist find stuff from the past like amor and weapons. Sometimes they find 1 million objects each year.They found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys that children played with.                           The archeologists also found atifacts about George Washington to.People lived on a land called Ferry farm for over 12,000 years. When George was six years old he moved. Archeologist started to dig in 2003. But it took over a year. It can take two week for a archeologist to dig a 25-square-foot section. There can be 35 people on a team to do their work.

I think that it would be very interesting that archeologists can find such cool artifacts, lost homes, lost forts, lost buildings, and lost things. I think that an average person would have such a dificult time he(or she) would never find it. So what I'm saying is that archeologists are pretty much heroes.        Archeologists don't only find lost artifacts they alsoe find awesome Dinosours. Trust me Iknow that because my little brother LOVES dinosours. So I know quite a lot about dinosours. My favorite archiologist is Sue. Because she found the biggest T-rex. I alsoe know that because of my little brother.        My favorite tools that the archiologist used back then and use today are the 'Pick and Shovel'. Becuase they are used at the very begining of every archiologist search for an artifact and is used with brute force. And are hard to handle. my least favorite tool is the knife because it is smaller than the other tools and doesn't do that much for the digging site. the tool that I kind of like is the wheel barrow because it isn't as hard to handle and it does a lot of work. So over all my opinion about archiologists is that they are very hard workers and help the comunity by giving us more knolidge.

Also when he was little is house burned to the ground. when people were searching they knew there were four other houses in the same area so they had to find the right place. Also people had lived on the farm called the Ferry Farm for over 1200 years so thats why they built there home there. Also no one knew where the house was built so it took a while. It took the archilogists a while but when they found the burnt house they knew it was Washingtons.

An archeologist is a person who digs up artifacts to learn about the past. Archeologists use many different tools to dig up some very important history. The tools these archeologist use are stuff like a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, a trowel and a knife. These tools are very helpful to them.          An archeologist digs to find something that helps them learn more about the past. Many archeologists can look for objects anywhere. Some look for information about their old life or someone else's.          Usually archeologists find information on what their trying to look for. Sometimes archeologists can't find what their looking for. Some can find what their looking for in a short time and some can take forever to find what their looking for.                                    	VBG IN NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP PRP VB WP DT NN VBZ .

If you think about it, their work is very hard and it takes a lot of work. Archeologists take a lot of time to dig up objects and to study the things that they found.                                      Archeologists use very special tools to investigate things and to help them dig fossils and other things up. They have to be very careful and concentrate on their work because when they dig things up such as fossils, they could break. They go to special places to investigate and try to find interesting things to try to tell what the past was like in that area. Sometimes, when they dig up something interesting, they can find out how people in the past used to do things.                                           I think we should all appreciate the work of an archeologist more than we do because they do very hard work. I hope that in the future, archeologists get a little more credit for what they do. The work that they do is very important and people should congratulate them more often.

It talked about of they found different things and what they used to find the thing. They told were they found the fort or where sum different Washington materials are. Ill tell you different thing about fort James and Washington.       the people fond that fort James was a triangle and not a different shape.   they found that it wasent by a river it was by canons. When they found were Gorge Washington was they first found was the kitchen, slave quarts, and storage house. they found at in 2003. they found lots of things.

Also archaeologist have to use very important tools such as brushes, shovels and a knife.        And archeologist jobs are very dangerous because everything they touch is very old and weak.  So everything that archaeologist do is very important because they find stuff in the past that is very interesting.       so if you want to be an archeologist you have to be prepared to do a lot of careful thinking and preparing.  archeologist have to be very careful because they don't want to destroy the old stuff.       After the archeologist found the important stuff they have to put the stuff in Museums for everybody to see. and there is a strict no touching policy for everybody in the whole wide WORLD!!       so the archeologist have an important job to find stuff that is interesting to other people. And if  anybody wants to see the ancient artifacts go to an museum.

They work hard every day at one poject. They have one job, many tools, and determination.         One example is from a article called 'Finding Fort James', by Cheryl Bradley. Archeologists searced long and hard to find the outline of the walls to James Fort. They also uncovered many other things, such as cellars, burial sites, and buildings. It took five years to finally uncover the site of the walls. Archeologiss never ave up. They researched the shapes of forts and other important location hints. Other people have found pottery, coins, tools, and toy like objects since the time they had found the outlines.         Another example is 'Digging up George Washington's Past'. Archeologists had to infer that it was indeed Gearge Washington's house they had found. It took them a long time, but they eventually found the kitchen, slave room, storage rooms, and the farmhouse. They used a mix of different tools to excavate he area.         Archeologists use many different tools for many different uses. They first use the skim shovel to remove layers of dirt easily, and then they use trowels and the whisk and dustpan to carefully remove the artifacts.         It takes a lot of hard work and teamwork to uncover such big sites. Archeologists are very important in finding out the history of things. Without them, we probably wouldn't know that much about what the Indians made or ancient settling locations.

It is a mysterious job that can be boring or amazing. i am going to tell you about the job of an archaeologist.             Archaeologists get to use all kinds of special tools such as a pick and shovel, a knife, whisk and dustpan, and lots more. There job is to discovery stuff that has been forgotten from the past. For example, if there was dinosaur bones somewhere an archaeologist would go and use his tools to find it. If we didn't have archaeologists then we wouldn't have museums with all the cool stuff.            Being an Archaeologist is important even if it can be boring just digging for something that you dont know for sure if it even exists, but if we didnt have archaeologists then we wouldnt know as much as we do now about our past. Being an Archaeologist might be tiring at times but it is also one of the most important and fun jobs that exists.

They also use computers locate things in the ground where historical things might be. Here are the tools they use are picks, shovels, whisks, dustpan, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels.                  In 1861 armor and weapons were found in Jamestown, Virgia in a location that archeologists thought were the mysterius Fort James. Over a hundred years later archeologists started a search for the exact spot where Fort James Was. In their search they found dirt markings that were from the wall sourding Fort James. They used all of the tools I listed above. They also found a hole that the Fort James people used to put all of their trash in with animal bones that they ate. The archeologists have comformed that they have found Fort James.                   Archeologists found that George Washington lived in Ferry Farm but their house burt down. Archeologists could not find the house, but the stone base was believed to still be there. They started to dig in 2003 it took over year to find it but they did. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage house. Since the house burned they found remains of burnt pottery. Archeologists comfirmed it was George Washington's house on their computers.                    Archeologists are awsome people who find remains of history, but sometimes it can be hard to find that history. Archeologists found millions of artifacts in the years.

In 1861 some Archeologists had found weapons and armor, also they found buildings and floors.The National Park Service had a 5-year sudy of the area. It would also help them decide where to llook for proof.The Archeologists made maps after they had found Fort James.the maps stretched all the way to the river.The Archeologists soon found cellars, dozens of burial sites, ten buildings all within  the border of the fort.       Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects every year.It includes pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children!they say it is exciting to discover objects  that were regulary used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a peice of our past and ties us to the people who first started the american colonies.       The process of digging at the ferry farm is a careful one.each year many teams work on his site.The team uses 3D  computers that track what is underground.the information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.The diggers also use a process called trowling.Ferry farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved the George Washington  society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities.thr folks at ferry farm are bringing to life the country's first president in ways we have never seen.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.Most believed that James fort was built near the river.It was easier to dock ships there,so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probabley gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.           The first objects were found in 1861.Archeoligists,{the name for scientists who study objects from the past}uncoverd armour and weapons.They also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.

It's very hard and very tiresome we have to dig for hours and hours on end until we find an artifact.  If you would like to know more let me just tell you it's not very easy at all, beacause all the artifacts are very fragile.                                   Archeologist have to be very very careful not to mistreat the artifacts or else they could fall and break.  We all have to be extreamly carful because some of these artifacts can break easier than others can.  In the report about  Finding Fort James some of the artifacts are very old some older than others for instance pottery, and metal toys that young children used to play with, weapons, armor, and the original walls that used to be protecting James Town.  While digging the the archeologist stubbled appon the trash that the settlers threw in the trash pit.  This information was very helpful to us.  It helped us understnd what the settlers ate and what kind of animals the usually hunted in the area, and what kind of vegtables the grew too.                                        There are two teams that can have up to 35 people on each team.  The first team is the one that does all the digging.   That team uses tools such as skim shovels, whisks and dustpans, wheelbarrows, and trowels.  When the first team is done digging it puts all the dirt into a small bin that has small holes on the bottom of it so that the dirtcan fall out whilr the artifacts stay inside it.  The second team is the team that records all the information about the artifaces the first team has dug up.  This team uses tools like 3D computers to track what is underground and maps the area with the computers.   	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP PRP RB JJ WP PRP VBZ IN TO VB DT NN .

It all started in 1994. When a group of people were interested in learning about Jamestown. they were interested in   learning things such as the secrets of James town fort. for over 200 years people thought that the Jamestown fort wasn't   there any more they thought it was washed away. But there have been discovery that it might still be around.   the fort was built in 1607 when settlers from England came for a better life and that's what happen but archaeologist believed that it was right next to a river. And that that's why it was washed away but its not true.                             Archeologist also give facts about George Washington and others but for now why don't we just talk about George Washington. George Washington as we know was a soldier and a president but hes much more than that he was a hero to the united states of America and to others. Biography's don't have that much information on his background but archeologists are finding more about him and his childhood i fact this is a lovely topic to help historians find out more history in George Washingtonians life and others of course. Archeologist help a lot of other peoples life's a lot essayer as in historians, scientists, and authors.                              Archeologist use a lot of tools to help them find out facts i guess i could name a couple of the tools they use.          One of the tools they use is a pick axe and a shovel most digs start with two tools like these used to dig holes in the earth to try and fined artifacts and other things like minerals and dinosaur bones. Then is the whisk and dust pan these tools are used for brushing dirt off of delicate artifacts. Next is the knife its used to gently scrape dirt off of artifacts and dinosaur bones. Another tool used is the wheelbarrow that can essay move heavy artifacts such as giant rocks and minerals. The skim shovel has a flat edge used to carefully move thin layers of soil with just one scoop. And last but not least there is the trowel probably the most common tool used for archeology its use scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. being an archeologist sure sounds like it takes a lot of work but i think I'm up for the challenge.

He had some one wright the constatusion.        2.  I think we should just mine un till 3013. We should get as much as we can on him. We should make make some mashines to mine. We should get metal decktors.

But it's not as simple as it looks! In this essay you will read about the process of a job of a archeologist, it will include tools, artifacts, and locations where they found our first president's house!          There are many teams of archeologists.  The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track whatever is underground.  The information is recorded so that other people can use the information to locate where to dig.  The second team focuses on digging, that place where they would be digging is called a dig.  After they dig up all the artifacts such as pottery, clay, metal toys, even gold! The third team would take them to the lab and examine them.  It is a very big process.           But how would you do all this? Well the archeologists have special help by their tools.  Here in this paragraph you will get to read about these tools.  When they dig up all the artifacts, they use a trowel which is most likely to be the most common tool in archeology, it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.  They also use a skim shovel which has a flat edge used to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.  If you find dirt on a artifact you would use whisk and dustpan or a knife to scrape dirt around the artifacts.  To carry the artifacts to the lab you could use a wheelbarrow.          That is a job of a archeologist, you could be a archeologist someday.  You could start in your own backyard.  Just follow these steps and use the proper tools!

Well they use lots of tools and groups even jobs.         First of all, an archaeologist is a scientist or an explorer. An archaeologist has many jobs. Archaeologist also use many tools too.Archaeologists are put in groups or jobs and are split up into three groups.                Archaeologists have three jobs. The first job is a group that uses a 3D computer to observe what is under ground so they know where to dig and places to be careful. The second job is digging the artifacts out of the ground with special tools. The third job is is observing the artifacts that were dug out of the ground.            Last but not least, is the tools that archaeologist use for their jobs. They use a shovel and a pick to dig in the ground close to the artifact. They use a skin shovel to scrap thin layers off the ground.Archaeologist also use a trowel which is probaly the most common tool used to take different layers out of the ground. Then they use a wheelbarrow tocarry the artifacts to the lab.             Now you know what a archaeologist is. You know their jobs their tools and what hey are.                                                                                 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT NN CC WP PRP$ NNS CC NN PRP VBP VBP .

Archeologists are people who dig things up from the past,they have dug up alot of stuff bu today I will be talking about Finding Fort James and also Digging up some of George Washington's past. We have plenty to talk about so please get comfortable and enjoy.               The finding of Fort James started along time in, 1994. A group of people started a protect called the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Protect.It was made to find out about Jamestown,Virgina.For about 200 year people thought it had been washed up by a river. We know that the for was built around 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.Most people believed it was build by a river so it was easier to dock ships there, so it would make alot of sense why they would pick that area. But, they found items that were farther away from the river.                  Then after a five year study they finally found James fort! They found marks that indicated were the forts wall would be.Then they found out that the fort was in the shape of a triangle! Then they made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.Then they found out that there were stone legs built over the river that were built to hold cannons. They also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. Today they found nearly 1,000 objects a year.They found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys.                      Most of what we`ve learned about George Washington is that he was a president and a General to our solders.But we knew nothing about hes childhood. Alot of people lived at Ferry Farm and knew alot about it for about 12,000 years. We also know that George Washington lived on Ferry Farm as well. His father had built their famliey a house there when George was only six years old.                 We never really knew were the house was because it had fallen a long time ago but we do know he lived there. But the archeologists thought that the stone base was still there, and by 2003 they had finally found it. Then they found the farm house just a few years later. About 4 houses were built on Ferry Farm, so diggers needed to prove that it was George Washington`s farmhouse. Then they soon learned that Washington's house was in a fire, then one day they found burnt pottery and a clay pipe.George Washington smoked clay pipes so they believed it was his. They later found more proof that it was the right house.                  When they we digging up Washington`s house they had to be very careful not to break anything. It was a very delicate process. They also used 3D computers to track what was underground. They recorded information so they would know what they were looking for when they were digging.  Archeologists first used what is called a skim shovel, they are small, flat, and very sharp. The down side to all of this is that is could take up to 2 or even 3 week just to dig a 25-square-foot whole!                       All of this is very important to American history and that's why archeologists want to know more about it. The discovery of George Washington was important because he was our first president and we need to have a better understanding of him. We also want to know how life was like when he was alive. There is also a lot of ways we can learn more. They have activities at Ferry Farm just for kids. I hope you learned a lot today and I hope you learned about archeologists and want they do. The End.

Archeologists uncover dinosaur    fossils, plant fossils, old colonies, old houses and the items inside of it, sometimes human bones, and much, much more.  They have many tool they use to uncover these artifacts. They use picks and shovels to dig. They also use whisks and dustpans to brush dirt off of the artifacts, they use knifes for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. They also use wheelbarrows to move items from one place to another. They use much, Much, MUCH, more tools than this.             Some interesting artifacts the archeologists have found is Fort James. In fort James in 1861 archeologists found armor and weapons buried under the ground.  A hundred years or so later a group effort to find the spot where the fort was built. They studied the area for 5 years. Eventually they found fort James.           The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's wall used to be. With all the stories they heard and pictures they had seen they knew that the fort was shaped like a triangle. The fort went all the way to the river. There they found small ledges over the water. They soon found out they were cannons. Now the archeologist group finds about a million items a year. They find things like pottery,tools, coins, and children's toys.           Archeologists are very important. With out them we would not know about the past. You would not know what dinosaurs may have looked like because they would not have uncovered all of their bones. You wouldn't know what kind of tools the old colonists once used because they never would have found them.

They help know what was here on Earth hundreds of years ago. We know what we know about Earth because of them.           What does archeologists study? Why, anything you can dig up from the ground, they study. Fossils were found by them. We know that dinosaurs once roamed Earth because they discovered them.            Don't think this is an easy job, because it isn't. It involves hours and hours of digging, sometimes just to find a pile of dirt. But don't think it isn't a fun job, because it is. You might discover a new species that was extinct! The possibilities are endless!            Here are some things you probably need to know if you want to become an archeologist:   Patience-You won't find something in a day. Teamwork- You can't dig, take pictures, and wheel artifacts all at the same time! Science-after all, an archeologist is a type of scientist! Math-measuring bones, finding area, all of this plus more is what you will need to do math-wise.           Some tools an archeologist uses are:   Shovel (we all know what that is) Picks (much bigger than toothpicks) Knife (not the kitchen ones your mom uses) Wheelbarrow (not to ride in) Skim Shovel (Not skim milk. Skim meaning 'to remove small surface') Trowel (midget shovel you probably used when you were gardening as a kid)            Did you always enjoy playing in the garden or sandbox, hiding objects and digging them up again? Well, it sounds like the archeologist job is good for you!

Archeologists once discovered James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia.  Their job was to dig up and discover objects from the past.  Once they do that they study the objects.  Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.                  Archeologists have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy because of recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home.  They have found lots of Washington's house by digging them up.  They know it's his house because they found clay pipes that he smoked.  Also they found burnt pottery and records say that Washington had a fireplace.  That means that there had been a fire that occured.                  Archeologists used many tools during their digs.  They helped them with many things.  They start digs using apick and shovel.  They help archeologists dig into the earth close to the artifacts.  A skim shovel is used for removing thin layers of soil.  When you are done using the skim shovel, you can use a whisk and dustpan to brush off the extra dirt.  If you find objects you can use a wheelbarrow to move the objects from place to place.  A trowel is the most common tool.  it scrapes and cuts to view the different layers of soil.  As you can see an archeologist's job isn't allways fun.

Archeologists play an important role in understanding people and things alike from past times and even present time.               Some tools  they used were the: pickaxe and shovel most digs start with these tools to dig close to artifacts, the whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off artifacts and clear away dirt from excavation sites, a small knife used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts, the wheelbarrow such a common household item used to carry dirt and artifacts from one place to the next,a skim shovel a specially made shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop,a trowel probably the most common tool in archeology used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Many archeologists use these and many more tools               If your thinking about being an archeologist then be prepared for a long college archeologists have to go to a lot of schooling and training. Think about it you have to know what your looking for were you should look for it and how.                I love archeology and I hope this career and lifestyle never goes away.

They have to dig all around the site they have to know ahead of time before they dig. They use computers to do that. Every archeologist needs the proper tools for the job mainly they just need the shovel and pickaxe but they need all there tools to do the job right. Most of the cool things you see in museums are discoveries archeologists found and rare and important to history. artifacts are important and cool and that's what a archeologist dose.

Well, not to long ago in 1994 archeologists started the Jamestown Redicovery Archaeological Prodject. For over 200 years people thought that Jamesown was washed away by a river, but some think it's still around today. Jamestown was built in 1607 when settelers came there from England to be more independent from the king.      The first Jamestown discoveries were found in 1861, archeologists found mostly armor and wepons. After about five years they finally found Fort James.    They first found marks that showed where all of the forts and walls use to be. Archeologists also found out the the fort was in the shape of a triangle. The fort streached all the way to the river where they relised there were stone leadges built over the river desined to hold canons. They also found many other things.

Today is a very hot day and I am sweating like crazy, but i work through it. I am digging at Ferry Farm trying to find some information about George Washington's past. I am about 30 feet deep into the Earth and my shovel hits something.        I yell for my boss Logan, 'Logan, come here! I think i found something! Come quick and bring the whisk!'. Logan comes a few seconds later and he brought me the whisk. 'What did you find?', he asked. 'I... I don't know exactly', I said. I brush some dirt out of my way with my whisk and I tell Logan, ' I think it might be a piece of burnt pottery. Can you go get me the trowel please?'. 'Sure. i will be right back.', he reply's.         When Logan returns with the trowel he also brings me a water. ' Here is the trowel. I brought you a water also.', he says.   I reply back, ' Thanks.'. I take a sip of water and grab my trowel. I find where the two sides of the pottery is and start digging under it on the right side of the piece.          After about 5 minuets i get the burnt pottery out of the dirt. I scrape some dirt off with my whisk. I can now see what was on he pot. It looked like it was a family standing in the middle of a huge empty field filled with growing flowers. Logan snatched it out of my hand and said ' Great work Riley. After 3 weeks of digging you are the first person that found something. Go ahead and take the rest of the week off. You need it.'. I grin and say 'Thank you'. Logan nods and walks away with the pottery in his pocket. I climb up and out of my hole and walk home.           I take a drink of my water and turn he corner, climb up the wooden steps into my cool house. I lay down on my couch and fall asleep.

They built a fort that Archeologists were despirate to find. They ended up finding it next to a river where they knew it was at because the boat was settled there next to there home. There in the fort, archeologists found dozen of stuff. Such as, tools, coins and toys for the children. The archeologists can tell that the settlers where starving because there wasnt enough food         Not much biographies of George Washengton give information in  his childhood. That is why archeologists went looking for his house. The reason they wanted to look for his house is so they get a peice of information of his childhood. When they found it, there was alot of toast (burned) stuff. But they needed proof. So they digged and searched.           There was finally a clue. They found a part of clay pipe, the archeologists all knew that George Washengton smoked clay pipes. So they had a little more confidence that, that house was the house of George.

Their job is to dig up artifacts from the past, so we can learn about history. A lot of archeologists dig to solve mysteries, like when a group of archeologists found Fort James.       Archeologists wanted to see if they could uncover anything from Fort James. In 1861, the first artifacts were found. They discovered armor and weapons. They also uncovered the floors of buildings. After about 100 years a group effort tried to find the exact spot where Fort James was built. After that, The National Park Service led a 5 year study of the area. They wanted to figure out how the land was used. People used computer mapping software, to create an image of the area. Then they finally found James Fort! A set of marks on the ground was the first thing that they found. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Because of all the stories they had heard and the drawings they had made, archeologists knew that the fort was shaped like a triangle.       Other times, archeologists dig to find out how people lived a long time ago. Many archeologists wanted to find out more about George Washington. So, they decided to figure out where he lived, and dig up some things from his past.       On Ferry Farm, people have been living there for over 12,000 years. It's a perfect place to build a home. It's not surprising that George Washington's father moved his family there, when George was only 6 years old. George's house was long gone, so no one knew where his actual house was loacated. But archeologists belived that the stone base under the house was still there. In 2003 they started digging. They finally found it, but it took over a year. The kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses, were the first things they found. A few years later, they found the main farmhouse. On the Ferry Farm land, at least 4 other houses, have been built. They needed to find proof that this was George Washington's farmhouse. Records show that in George Washington's house, there was a fire. Burnt pottery was found by the diggers. That probably means that a fire occured there. A clay pipe was also found there. George Washington smoked clay pipes, so there was more proof.       For archeologists to find all of that stuff, they need the right tools. Here are some of the tools that archeolgists use.       Pick and Shovel: They are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.       Whisk and Dustpan: They are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts, and clear away dirt from the excavation site.       Knife: It is used for careful digging, and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.       Wheelbarrow: It is used to move items form one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.       Skim Shovel: It is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.       Trowel: It is probaby the most common tool used in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.       Now you know more about the job of an archeologist. It is much more than just digging in the dirt. They uncover articfacts so we can learn about history.

Such as Fort James, and George Washington. Archeologists use tools such as pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.       They discover artifacts everyday. Some belonged to famous artists, and some belonged to average people. Some common artifacts archeologists find are coins, bullets, old toys, or even pieces of jewelry. Some artifacts might be worth millions, others might be worth nothing, but they are all connected to ancient history.       The tools that the archeologists use are very helpful because if they didn't have the tools, and they would have to do it by hand then it would take them double the time it took them with the tools. Using some of the tools isn't always easy and fast to do, but it certainly is cautious. Perhaps the land is unstable and it is an ancient burial site, they would want to disturb them. Though some tools do work fast and is worth digging. The pick and shovel would probably need upper body strength, but it would get the job done. The whisk and dustpan would maybe take a long time to accomplish a find, but once again it would get the job done safely. The knife would get the dirt off around the artifact. The wheelbarrow might be unnecessary to use unless the artifact was to be big for someone to be unable to carry it. They skim shovel would be cautious not to hit something that was not supposed to be hit, because the shovel would be too thin, it can take a thin layer of soil. The trowel would be the most useful tool that the archeologists could use for most parts of their dig.       Artifacts that are buried in most occasions are either rare, valuable or even a collectable. Archeologists usually find more than one item in one dig session, so the more items they find the more valuable or collectable. Usually people who are more elder have more artifacts, they will usually keep them from their childhood. There are two shows called Pawn Stars, and another on called American Pickers. Both shows buy artifacts from the past, when they buy something they look for things that are rare, valuable, collectable, and even rusty! That's what archeologists usually look for the same thing. They need something that looks like it comes from the past.

The group finds nearly 1million objects each year and people have started the American colonies.The object s include pottery ,tool, coins, and even metal  toys for  children.The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in the James fort  lived. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. The job help everly body that was on the job get help like. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section.This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.

The information is recorded so people know what it looked like before they started digging.Then their is another team that starts the digging the place where they dig at is called a dig.Those archeologists start digging with what are called skim shovels these shovels are flat, small, and sharp so they can remove thin layers of soil one at a time.That soil is placed in a box with a half screen at the bottom that let's the artifacts stay in.       Tools used by Archeologists    Archeologists use many tools during their work time.One the most common tools they use is the trowel it is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.The pick and the shovel is used to start most digs and to dig into the earth close to artifacts.The whisk and the dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.Then their is the knife it is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.The other type of shovel is called the skim shovel mentioned earlier. The skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Last but not least is the wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another or to carry away dirt away from the excavation site.        Archeologists have a important job that comes with pros and cons one of the pros is finding a new artifact one of the cons is that all the digging can be very tiresome and time consuming.Many objects that archeologists find are sometimes put in museums.The job of an archeologists is easy and sometimes can be hard.With all the tools that archeologists use they are most likely to find at least one artifact each day of their time with a new excavation site.

When you are a archeologist i think it is fun for them. 	VBG DT NN VBZ RB DT JJ NN , TO VB DT NN PRP VBZ RB WRB .

There will be information you will need to answer the question and write an information report to start the test. There was a state that was in 1994 and there was a group of people that where interested about the past of studying of the Jamestown Rediscovery Arhelogical project was dessigned to discover the secrets of the James fort  in James?town, Virginia.They will over 200 year because they will fight people over the yeares of there age because they need to learn  thought that the fort had the discover of the area of the hinted that it is still might be arout the earth for days.       There will be a built in 1607 because some of the other ones are brok down because they need to work on it to be good at and not play in it for they can be much beter at it. They settlers came from the england to star a new life to the most of the belived that james fort was a bulit near the river will itbe easier to be working hard on it to be beter peoson on it. However the people that does ti will be much better at it and will be a great person in thsi text they are telling me about it and the first person who was the objects were found in the 1861 of the thing of the archeologidit of the name of the scientists who were study the objects of the who were thegroup effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.       Archeologist are people who take there time when the find a artifact and are partient it takes days, weeks, mounth, and years for 1 artifact to be found. The group finds 1 million objects each year the objects include pottery, tools, coins and even metal toys for the chlidren in the 1600s, people who uses to throw thrie trash down An unused well or into a big pit thing for are trash can place. People who have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for the over 12,000 years and it will be a location that will George Washington's father, Augusine Washington, moved his family there because of George was just six years old at the time of being the age we was then. At the least four othewr houses have been bulilt on the Frry Farm land, so the diggers needes to find proof that this was George Washington's farmhouse.

Jamestowns Rediscovery project. This project was created to discover the secrets of Jamestown. Over 200 years people think there had been a river that flooded Jamestown. Some areas have been discovered that might still be around. Most settlers think that jamestown was built near by a river. Suggested the fort was located further away. The new land gave more protection from enemy ships. In conclusion , they were inspired into learning the past.            The very first object found in 1861. These Archeologists found armor and weapons . They discovered floors of building left of Jamestown . In 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort began at . The National Park Service leaded a five-year study on the area , on how they used there land.                    They knew that this would help them decide where to look for this random                  proof of the fort. They used a computer mapping software to make a image   of the land. In conclusion , they found there first object.           They found James Fort finally . They found marks on the ground of James Fort. The walls showed where walls used to be. All stories Archeologists knew what the fort looked like. These people made forts that strech all the way to the river. They realized there were alot of stone ledges built over river. The ledges are desinged to hold canons. Archeloogists found eleven cellers , twelve burial sites and ten buildings . In conclusion , these Archeologists found James Fort.                                                                                                            In conclusion , it was exciting for these Archeologists to discover these regularly things people ate and used 100 years ago . It gives us a piece of our past and ties us with the American Colonies .                                                George Washintons Past           The Digging at the Ferry Farm. Each year a team works on a site . There is up to 35 people on each team! The first team maps are using 3D computers that can track what is under the surface . In conclusion , The Digging Ferry Farm sounds like a good digging company.            This information contains recorded people started digging . Another digging team focuses on actual digging called a dig . Those Archeologists starts a dig of with a skim shovel. These shovels are used for small flat and sharp . In conclusion , that this hole thing contains recoreded people that started digging.           In conclusion , this ferry farm has alot of technoilgy to do stuff like 3D computers and what can track down things underground . Acrchologists uses a skim shovel always to start off.

They have found George   Washington's past and Fort James. This paragraph is going to be talking about two of those. The first one I will be talking about is George Washington's past. The second one is going to be Fort James. Two paragraphs are going to be about them. Here are the paragraphs about them.   Archeologists have found artifacts about George Washington and his past. They   started digging in 2003, after a year, they have found it. The first buildings they found was the kitchen, the slave's quarters, and the storage houses, a few years later, they found the main farm house. Archeologists found burnt pottery and a clay pipe. They needed proof that there were four houses built on the Ferry Farm. They also believed that the stone base was under the house, so they went over there to find proof. The Archeologists found many things.   It is important that they find George Washington's house.The reason is that, it gives    the citizens of the United States a better understandment of who George Washington was before he became famous. Also, to know why he made the decisions he had made. It helps historians learn about the type of life the Colonial Amercians lived like. It helps people know how he lived. Also, it helps them prove that his house was burnt down. Finding George Washington's house is important for many reasons.   Archeologists found artifacts about Fort James. They found armor, weapons, and the   floors of the buildings. After studying the computer mapping software of the image of the area, they found it. The first things they found were the set of marks on the ground, the marks showed the fort's walls. They also found, eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, ten buildings, pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys children played with. The last thing they found was, trash in an unused well or a big pit in the 1600's because that is ow they lived in Fort James. Archeologists have found things about Fort James in Jamestown, Virgina.   It is important that they find artifacts about Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia.   It gives us a piece of our past, it ties us to the people who first started the Amercian colonies. Also, Discovering objects that were used reguarly by people who lived hundreds of years ago. The Archeologists know how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe by finding artifacts. Also, we know what the settlers did to survivewhen they had a little bit of food. The Archeologists dug up animal bones that the settlers had ate.   Archeologists are important. They helped us find artifacts and helped us   discover new things. The artifacts Archeologists found are helpful for history. They can show you different kinds of dinosaur bones. They found artifacts to tell about. Archeologists can find many things hidden underground. Archeologists are important because they can help you and others learn about the past.

Archeologists found plenty of things in Fort James.They found armor,weapons,buildings,pottery,tools,coins,bones and even metal toy for the children.Archeologists only dug threw the stuff so they can see how the settlers lived.I think the Archeologists would of used a wheelbarrow to carry all the stuff they found and the things that were heavy.That's what happened at Fort James.            There were interesting facts about George Washington's past.It helps us understands George's life.For example he smoked clay pots.Also,it said he had a fire in his house.It took 35 people to find all these things.It also took them two weeks to find these things.This what they found in GGeorge Washington's past.            This is what the Archeologists do.I think they have cool jobs.

We maybe know that George Washington from his time as president and a soldier. But they do not have have alot of biographs about his childhood.Discoveries that are recent is hiatorians know more about Geoge Washington when he was a boy.George Washington's dad moved his family to a ferry farm and thought it was a perfect place to build a home Washington was six years old when they moved.             Lots of people lived on a land known as Ferry farm for 12,000 YEARS! Nobody knew where George Washington lived until the house was fully gone.The archeologists found a clay pipe and knew that Washington smoked so they were sure it was his his house.Washingtons house was burried under the ground it took them a year to dig it up.             Washingtons home was important discovery for so many reasons.Just to get to the house they had to take layers of soil off.Some of the people would be in the lab studying at things they found at the house. There was 4 other houses that have been built there too.

This may be a tricky job,? but some things you might need to know before if you want to an archeologist if you have to have the patience to work and examine little art fossils or valuable thing that are very rare; you might also need to know a lot about fossils, another thing you will need to know or be if you would like to be an archeologist is you cant be afraid of dirt and mud or dislike it because you will be working with it a lot. Archeologist also have to work with all different types of tools which include picks and shovels, whisks and dust pans, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.               The reason you will be working with dirt and mud a lot is when you find fossils you mainly find them in mud or dirt or dust right? They aren't always clean, so when your assignment is to find a fossil your not just gonna walk around and find a fossil you actually have to the work; that involves you have to get you fingers into mud and start digging and trying to find fossils or objects.               The tools that you are going to need if your an archeologist are a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel are used for digging far in to find the fossil because they are so sharp. The whisk and dustpan is used for if the artifact or fossil has dust or mud on it the whisk and dustpan takes it all off so the fossil/artifact is not dirty anymore. The knife is used for cutting around the artifact and getting all the excess mud/dirt off of the artifact. The wheelbarrow is used to carry the fossils from place to place, or to carry the dirt that the archeologists dug through. Because the skim shovel is so thin it is used to take layer by layer off without breaking the mud/dirt so if there is a fossil it doesn't break because the archeologists don't know what layer it can we on.  Lastly, the trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of mud/soil to check if they have any fossils or objects in them.

Their job could seem fun and easy at first, but it takes a lot of effort to discover an ar?tifact. They find what is underground on a 3D computer, digg underground carefully on the spot, and than they spend time in the lab to examine it to see if it is real and learn from it.          The first team may plan out where there might be a chance to find an artifact on a 3D computer.  This way the digging group knows what they are looking for.  They could dig on the exact spot an artifect might be located.  Once they know where it is they record it down and their job is done.  After they know all this information, the digging group is ready to dig.          The next group focuse on diggings, that is why they are the diggig group.  They use shovels that are small, flat, and sharp, so they could remove each layer of soil on the ground.  Than they put these layer of soil in a box with a screen that is half inch.  This let the dirt fall off, so the artifect remains.           Then it is work for the next group.  They spends days studying the artifects in their lab.  Their work is basicly studying the artifect to see if they are real for fake.  If it is real they will study it, and connect it to another object or a person's life.           As you can see, the work of an archeologists could be very tiring.  They have to do research, record, dig, and examine. 	WRB VBP PRP VB IN WP VBN IN DT JJ .

The job of an archeologist is not an easy one, but it sure is exciting.  There are different kinds of archeologists.  There are some who dig out artifacts and other items.  There are some that study the artifacts.  The people who dig use shovels, picks, whisks and trowewls to help them find and clean items.        Archeologists work to fink things from the past, find out what they are, and figure out important facts from that time or about the person that had the artifact.  Sometimes, it might be very exciting to be an arceologist, but other times it is just hard work and disapointment.  Most of the time, you would have to dig with out the help of machines, and who knows if the items that you find are even real or important?        Over all, archeologists are very important.  They help us understant the events that happened in our past and what it would be like to live many years ago.  Their discoveries tell us about important people and places.  	DT NN .

When you are in a search team you are split up in to separate groups that work together. One group does the the digging, they use many tools to accomplish this task without breaking anything. Another group classify the objects.  The last group maps the excavation site.  Being an archeologist takes lots of team work.                    To begin a search for answers from the past, researchers must use evidence from today to find a reasonable place to dig.  They do this by taking what they know and putting the knowledge together and getting the approximate location where the artifact is.  For example if you are trying to find your favorite toy because you lost it, you would use the information you know to find it.  Lets say you know the your little brother really likes your toy, but you never let him play with it, so based on this information you could see if your little brother has it.  archeologists also use 3D computers to map what is under them.  This is how archeologists find the approximate location of where the artifact they are trying to find is.                                                                                                                                                                              Digging for the artifact is hard work because you can not use a big excavator to dig the hole because it might break what you are looking for.  Instead you must use tools like the pick and shovel to start your dig, a knife to scrap dirt away from your artifact, a wheelbarrow to carry items and dirt away from the excavation site, you will also use a whisk and dust pan to clean artifacts, a skim shovel is also very handy for removing thin layers of dirt, and finally the trowel which is very important because it can scrape and cut different layers of soil.  This process can take weeks, months or even years to find an object that is not fake, and is valuable.                      Being an archeologist takes much perseverance, because if you do not find any thing important in your career, you will become very frustrated and you may rage quit.  All in all if you are an archeologist it is very rewarding, if you find something important, and it is a great job if you like exploring history.  This is what an archeologist does.

What they do is that they go to an old place that has been old for thousands and thousands of years like George Washington's old home. They dig up the valuable things today that have been in Georges life. That's why when it comes to an archeologist, all of us count on him/her to do a very important job.There are also people who research the old place and tell the workers where the stuff is.       When the archeologist comes to an old place, the people that are back at the place have to tell the workers what they are digging for and where the things are. The workers want to show proof of where the things are so they can show them that they aren't making this up. So, they use all kinds of different tools like a pick and shovel, a whisk, etc. But, even sometimes the workers give up because they can't find anything. That's why sometimes there are the same things at a museum or nothings there at times. So, when they don't find anything they move onto another spot where something hasn't been discovered or its abandoned. A job of an archeologist is really hard.           The job of an archeologist also needs to have lots and lots of tools to get what they need. Some of the tools are called a whisk, a shovel, a pick, a wheelbarrow, knife, etc. They need these things because they need to dig or to clean the things to show them that they have discovered it. First, you need a whisk because it will help you pick up tiny things or help you clean things off. Second, you need a shovel to dig for the stuff that your looking for. Then, you need a pick for really hard substances like rock or metal. Next, you need a wheelbarrow for collecting all the things an archeologist needed. Lastly, you need a knife to cut off very hard and tiny substances stuck to a valuable thing.The job of an archeologist needs a lot of tools to help get the things they want.       Lastly, an archeologist needs to find a location to find where the valuable source is. That job isn't really for an archeologists. Its other workers that stay at the building to find things that are below or in a building or ground. That is when the workers go and dig up the substance so they can either destroy it, or bring it back to their building. An archeologist really relies on the workers at the building because without them, then they wouldn't ever find the substance. So, they always need a worker back at the building to research the place and whats in it.       In conslusion, a job of an archeologist is very hard to do and very hard to cooperate with, but with the right kind of tools and people, a job of an archeologist is very fun sometimes.

Archeologists study histories as they dig up the past centuries. Their jobs are tough, but they discover many treasures as they use their tools as a friend.            First of all, archeologists use their computer software to map the contents of the ground. These are very helpful by helping archeologists find where to make the site for digging. It's very important because then they know where to start and where the historical things are hidden and how it will look like.            Next, the archeologists start digging the ground with their flat skim shovel, which can move layers of soil at a time. The removed soils are placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom, which lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.            Lastly, archeologists use a process called troweling, which is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifacts. Plus, it can take up two whole weeks to dig a 25-square-foot-section! Anyways, while this team is working, the another group archeologists can study found objects.            In conclusion, a job of archeologists might be tiring and slow, the history treasure they find is worth the hard work.            	NNP PRP VBZ NN IN NNS NNS CC JJ NNS .

Well then, keep listening, because this report will tell you all about the job of an archeologist. I will tell you the different jobs of an archeologist and the tools that archeologist use.       To start off, there are two different jobs of an archeologist. The first job is the digging job. In this phase, you take small amounts of dirt and place it onto a &frac12;' screen that separates dirt from artifacts. If there are any artifacts, you would take it over t??o the second job, the computer job. In this job, you would scan the artifact and also look at the &frac12;' screen and see if any small artifacts fall with the dirt. You would see the screen on your computer. The artifacts that you scan will appear on your computer and then you can find out what it is.       Another important thing to know as an archeologist is what tools you use. There are six tools that they use. The first one is the pick and shovel. Most digging places start with these tools. They can help take away dirt around the artifact that they are currently looking at. The next tool is the whisk and dustpan. These two tools help to clean artifacts that archeologist find. Next, there is a knife. This tool is used to scrape dirt off artifacts. After that, there is the wheelbarrow. This helps archeologist move artifacts and move dirt away from the area. Also, there is the skim shovel. This strange shovel has a flat edge and is used to remove a thin layer of soil. Finally, there is the trowel. This is used to scrape ant cut to view different layers of soil.       I hope you have learned about what an archeologist does. Do you want to become an archeologist?

Exciting, would it be? That's exactly what an archeologist does as a job. Archaeologists find new and unique artifact in different places, send them to the study labs,  and research more about that object. If you want to know more about these amazing world-traveled artifact hunters, read on!  Archeologists are very detailed and specific in whatever they do. They can sometimes use objects as big as wheelbarrows to dig soil to tiny wood picks for chipping of soil of very fragile objects. There are a lot of steps in digging up fossils and artifacts of the past. They first have to get together and entire team, which can take up to thirty-five people!         First of all, the first team maps the area using 3D that can track what is underground. The information is recorded on a piece of paper so everyone one can get a visual look about how the place was before they started to dig up the ground. Archeologists find many artifacts and materials that will show the past of the specific place. In this year, we have learned about a famous historical person named George Washington. There wasn't much information about where he lived and things about it. We wondered about what stuff and information was lying behind this historical man's childhood home. Coincidentally, we figured out that archeologists also had the same exact question! Some archeologists were digging at the dig to see if anything that was left behind was still right underneath the soil. One archeologist was digging and met a clay tube in the way. He thought about George Washington and remembered that he used clay tubes to smoke. This evidence proves that he was searching the correct place!         Furthermore, archaeologists have gone all around the world studying about its history and artifacts. They gone to Egypt to study tombs, pharaohs, and much more. They go into tobs and try to find as much as they can. They sometimes will also remove the tombs and study the precious wealth the body has been kept with. If lucky, they are allowed to unwrap the body to get a more detailed view of what the past was like when they were alive. They have also visited King's Valley to discover the dinosaur fossils. Using fine and detailed marterial, they easily find the truth and information of the life before us.         Being an archeologist can be hard work, but worth it. Now after learning about them, we should be thankful to them for helping us humans study the world and its past more clearly and thoughtfully. What are you waiting for, get out and start digging!

But at the same time it could be fun because you could have a lucky day and find alot of things. An archeologist is a very important job for several reasons like, if we didn't have a archeologist history wouldn't be as powerful than today.                   Archeologists need a lot of tools specially pick and shovel the most important tool = used to dig to find artifacts, whisk and dustpan = they need these tools to brush the dirt off artifacts to make it more visible, knife = used for scrape dirt of the artifacts basicallly a whisk and dust pan, wheelbarrow is also a big use for diggers= helps remove heavy artifacts to a office to study, skim shovel = a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt, and finally a trowel the trowel is the most common tool in archeology = used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.               As you read more about an archeologist it is a very hard, fun job to do. The biggest part is the history all the ceturies ago things of famous prople lie beneath us, DIRT. I hope you've seen in your perspective of what it's like being an archeologist. You could start helping out too and find an amazing discovery. WHAT WILL YOU FIND!!!!!!

First off, life being an archeologist is not ever easy and with artifacts you must handle them very carfully. Any time your holding a artifact you may be holding a million dollars. Second you must work in any weather, from hail to heat you still keep working. So that is why you use presise tools to dig them up.   Tools are very important archeologists don't use huge vehicles to dig. That would ruin every artifact in the ground! So instead people use miny brooms and shovels big and small. These let us find  artifacts in good conditions so we can reaserch them. Now not all archeologists work in the field.   Some archeologists work with computers and with teams. These teams try and reasearch artifacts and what they were. Some teams have alot of people working together, sometimes up to 35. All of this takes a long time, in the fields it would take 14 days to dig 25 square foot holes. The job of an archeologist is complicated, long and time consuming sometimes you don't find anything. For some reason though many people enjoy working as an archeologist.

The Washington house was started to be uncovered in 2003 and took several more years to uncover all the houses in the Ferry Farm land. Archeologist's get to discover all the lost artifacts of famous people. I thing being a archeologist would be very interesting.

They get to use cool equipment to find things underground. To be an archeologist is a very hard but fun job. Your in charge of finding the history of so many magnificent things , which can be a big responsibility at sometimes. Archeologists will travel to places around the world to figure out its history. To get history you usually spit up in groups one for digging and the other one for actual digging. Archeologists have an important jobs.                  In 1994 a group of people interested in history started an archaeological project called the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was made to find out the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. Over 200 years ago people assumed that it had been flooded or washed away by a river, but some discovery's made proof it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when the settler came from England to have a better life. It was a good hide out from enemy and the boats are so close, so they docked them right there.                In 1861 the first object was found, they were armor, weapons and the floor of buildings. 100 years later they were on a mission to find the spot where the fort was built started. A National Park lead a study to figure out how the land was used. They started the computer to map out everything. That's when they finally found James Fort. From mark to mark the secret unraveled. So it turned out that after a couple hundred years it is possible to find interesting artifacts from way back.                George Washington is so interesting, but facts we know about him now are mostly about his time as the president and as a soldier. So some Archaeologists have set out to find more information on George Washington and about his childhood. When George Washington was six his father moved their family to Ferry Farm. It took the Archeologists over a year but they found the main base of the house. The Archeologists found some burnt pottery and part of a clay pipe the Archeologists knew that George Washington smoked clay pipes. So they had proof it was his house.           Archeologists have very hard jobs, but it also must be very interesting to be an Archeologist. They get to explore things no one has explored before and find out secrets about people and landmarks. Even though it takes a little while to find out those secrets and discoveries, it must be really worth it  It really must be amazing to be an Archeologist.

Kaboom! say they hit something while diging they will use a skim shove to then  see if they can get it out and if they cant then they will use a knife to feel the object,but if they dont find anything they will use wheelbarrow to take loads of dirt out , but if they did find somethng and they are able to bring out of the ground they will then use a wisk and dustpand to clean of the object and then bring it to an examane to see what it is and if it is wroth saving.

These job is very important.First you have to know what your doing.Then you have to know what your expected to see.I am in fifth grade ACTS at Woodfeilds Elementary School.I am eleven years old.I am telling you about a serious job.          In this job you have to be patient and try to find hidden objects.These job takes lots of practice and perfection.It is time consuming also.You have to take your time.First they have to use a skim shovel and dig a layer out of the ground.Then they have to put it in a box with a screen on half of the box.After that most of dirt falls through the holes.Then they use a whisk and dustpan to find the artifacts.Other Archeologists work in labs to do this business/job.           This is my conclusion that I am ending my assignment on.I had fun reading this story and doing this assignment.Someday I would like to do this job.This is a hard job.Not everybody can do this job.You have to have patience for this job because it takes a while to find artifacts.I hope to read more interesting story's like this.

A pick and a shovel are the first two tools they use to dig.It is used to get closer to the artifacts in the ground.Like the trowel[a tool to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil]the pick and shovel are the most common tools in archaeology.        A wisk is like a mini broom t cleans the surface of a artifact.A dustpan is the sidekick for the whisk they both clear the area.You may see them in movies cleaning up dinosaur bones.Archaeologist also use knives but only to get dirt out of creveses.A wheelbarrow it moves dirt from the digging site.Skim shovels are different from normal shovels skim shovels have a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of soil.        That is my report on archaeologist tools.And if ypou want more information their are many books in your local library.

It will tell what they do to find the artifcts.It will tell what they use to find the artifacts.It tell shows how they carefull they try to be while working in the site.It will tell how they have to know how to use the tools at the site. It will tell  how they find out how they find out whats in the ground before they dig,and it will tell how they get the artifact out of the dirt to get it so they can look at it.     They use picks,shovels,whisks,dustpans,knifes,wheelbarrows,skim shovels,and trowels.when they use the tools they use them to dust something off or to get it out of something.When they use it they have to carefully use the tool.They also need to know how to use the tool.If they did not know how to use the tools,then they could hurt themselves or other people around them.They would need to use the tool or they could not be there because that person could hurt or kill the people around that person with it.      In the group of archeologist there are 35 people there. Before they start to dig they get into a team and that team maps the area using 3D computers.Then when they are done another them starts digging in the ground.When they find a artifact in the ground they use a box with a halh-inch screen at the bottom.That way the dirt will fall out and the artifact or artifacts will stay in the box.Then they will study the artifact or artifacts in the box.     Well, i leared that they have a tough job to do at the site.Since they have to make sure that they know how to use the tools.If they did not they would hurt people around them and  hurt themself.They also have to map the area out first so they know what is in the ground.And after they see what is in the ground they can start digging.So when they find what they are looking they can study it, and find out what it is and find out what it does.

What an  archeologist does is that they look for things from the past, like acient tools and dinosaur bones.The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery. They suggested that a fire occured.They also found part of a clay pipe, Washington smoked a clay pipe.Archeologist can have up to 35 people on thier team.The first team mps out the area using a 3D computer, that can track what is underground. The next teamjust focuses on the digging.Those archeologist start the dig with what is called a skim shovel. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, at one time. The dirt is placed in a box with a half-inch screem at the bottom.This lets the dirt fall out, but the artifacts to stay in.Also, the diggers use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, pait brushes, and wooded picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studing the objects that are found. Ferry Farms offers many opportunities for kids to get involved. Kids can expore the site, experience colonial life, and becaome aa junior archeologist.Digging around in dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at Ferry Farms are bringing to life the county's first president in ways we have never seen. This is what an archeologist does.

It would be fun to be the first one to discover koreysaurus.  but then it would also be a pain in the butt to be away from my family.  Keep reading, if you want to.       Finding new thing would be very inspiring to find another new thing.  I love being the first at things.  Like races games and finding things.  I'm starting to thing archeology would be the right job for me.           The thing that would suck is that you would be away from your family which is only good sometimes.  You would also be in places your not used to all the time for your job.  You could also be in a place that is freezing and get lost and get hypothermia.  You could also get lost in a desert and have a heat stroke.

These archeologists find artifacts that can explain the life of people who lived long ago and can reveal secrets that none of us heard about.                                                                                                The archeologists find artifacts with the help of their tools.  Two of the tools are a pick and a shovel.  They are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.  Two more tools are a whisk and a dustpan, which are used to brush off dirt from the artifacts and clear dirt away from the excavation site.  The knife is used for careful digging and for scraping dirt around the artifacts.  Another tool is a trowel, which is probably the most common tool.  Archeologists use it to scrape and cut to veiw the different layers of the soil.  The skim shovel is also an important tool, and is made to remove thin layers of soil with each scoop.  The last tool is a wheelbarrow which is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away.           The work of an archeologist is not that easy.  One job might take a very long time to acomplish.  The archeologists have to take their time if they want  to do everything the right way.  They divide the jobs into groups.  For example: one group maps an area, while another group, called a dig, starts digging.  The whole, thing can be slow and tiresome, but at least its worth it.           Sometimes, people have different opinions about what  happened to old things.  People might say that the object does not exist anymore.  Archeologists have found many things that people beleived did not exist.  Once, archeologists were searching for Fort James.  For over 200 years, people beleived that the river washed the fort away.  But later, archeologists found it. Archeologiosts do have to be careful and try to find something, not listening to what all people say.           The work of archeologists is important.  The archeologists have uncovered secrets and found many things.  Thanks to the work of arceologists, we now havelearned many new things from the past.

When an archeologist is working in the hot sun where it kind of is a desert, they get really tired and don't finish the job when they want to, so sometimes it can be the cause of the weather.  The main mission the archeologists have is to discover ancient objects. Kinda like Indiana Jones how he goes into temples and finds cases and just ancient symbols and objects like that.       The tools they use are a whisk and dustpan for cleaning up the remaining dirt or soil from the remaining areas, shovel for digging up the objects, wheelbarrow for removing rocks, dirt or soil out of the way and carrying to places for transportation, and the pick is used for digging up heavy dirt and rocks.       The places where archeologists usually go is in places where dinosaur bones can be found, maybe a temple where an ancient person ruled or symbols.  They also took Abraham lincoln's hat and George Washington's wig and famous people's belongings that have now passed away. Some archeologists could even find human bones from earth quakes or tornadoes and other disasters.

Those groups of archeologists were also very inerested in history and the past.  When you become an archeologist, you form a group of usually about 35 people.  While being an archeologist, you use tools such as a knife, skim shovel, trowel, wheelbarrow, whisk and dustpan, and the pick and shovel.  The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.  Another tool called the skim shovel is used carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.  Also, the trowel is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil, and is also the most common tool in archeology.  The wheelbarrow is ued to move items from one place to another or carry dirt away from the excavation site.  One of the other tools called the whisk and dustpan, are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.  Finally, the pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, which is close to the artifcts.  Archeologists use those tools for the meanings above.  To discover historical places, like the Ferry Farm and James Fort, archeologists must search around an area for a long time.  That may take from 1-5 years.  Once they find the place, they call it an excavation site.  After they discover the area, they search for historicaal remains or leftover things.  Each time archeologists find a item, they put it in a 3D computer, where it shows what the place might hve looked like when it was built new.  If you would like to be an archeologist, why not?  It is an amazing job that brings back the past!  Also, it's like an adventure........an adventure of excitement!

They help us understand more about someone or something. They dig up artifacts from the past. For example, archeologists that dug up George Washington's past found many artifacts. They also helped me understand a lot more about him.         Archeologistsits use tools such as, 3D computers to map the areas. When archeologists dug up George Washington's past, they found that the Washington's had a fire. they also found out that he smoked wooden pipes.         First, the importance for understanding a lot more of a famous person, are jobs an  archeologist does. There's many  reasons. Whatever an archeologist discovers, are things that are the key parts of our past. Many archeologists dig, map areas,and more.         Since the discovery of George Washington's past, it gives us better understandings of who he was before he became famous. Also, the discoveries of archeologists finding Fort James, gives us better information about what happened there. What do you think the job of an archeologist is?

An Archaeological is some one who digs up things from the past and put it in a museum. Let me show you what I mean.      Like Fort James. They fought the most unbelievable thing like pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Now they find up to nearly 1 million things each year. Now they know how they survive the cold winters and when they are low on food.    They did the same thing to George Washington's House. It took them one whole year to find his house ( they had to dig it up.). They have people to visit the place and they find different things in the house.     It's not easy to be a Archaeological, but to some people it cool as the breeze.(or the dirt breeze) 	NNP RB NNS MD VB TO VB JJR IN DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNP NNP VBZ WRB PRP VBP NNP NNP NNP VBZ DT CD WP NNS VBP NNS IN DT JJ CC VBD PRP IN DT NNP NNP PRP VBP PRP WP PRP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD DT JJS JJ NN IN NN , NNS , NNS , CC RB JJ NNS IN NNP NNP PRP VBP RP TO RB CD CD NNS DT NNP NNP PRP VBP WRB PRP VBP DT NN NNS CC WRB PRP VBP JJ IN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN TO NNP NNP POS NNP NNP VBD PRP CD JJ NN TO VB PRP$ NN : PRP VBD TO VB PRP NNP : .

Second paragraph.Archeologists travel all over the world discovering items like weapons,buildings,pottery,and last but not least well-known famous people who lived long ago.I also know that archeologists study objects from the past.They are trying to  find that well-knowns certain home or family.           Third paragraph.One of the things that was interesting was tool Pick and Shovel tool that is used by archeologists.The Pick and Shovel mean to dig into earth,close to the artifacts.Another interestting thing was the Trowel,Skim Shovel,Wheelbarow,Knife,and Whisk and Dustpan.           Fourth paragraph.I also learned that Archeologists dig for artifacts.They also study animals from the past also.They study animals like Birds,Tigers,Cheetah's,Rabbits,Deer,Snakes,Bears,and alot of different types of animals who live in the wild.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers from England came to start a new life.Most believed James Fort was by a river.It was easier to dock ships there,so it made sense that the settlers would choose  that spot.The first object were found in 1861 by Arecheologists. they found there armor and weapons and the floors of the building.Over 100 years later,a group had effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built.                           The National Park Service led a five-year study of th area to figure out how the land was used.they knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.That's when they finally found James Fort!The first thing they found  was a set of marks on the ground .The marks showed where the fort's  wall used to be.Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made,the archeologists knew that the fort be the shape of a tiangle.They made maps They made maps and found out the fort stretched all the way out to the river.                                  Today,the groups finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.In the 1600s, people used to throw  their  trash down an unused well or into a pit.While digging in the the area,the archeologists found trash the settlers threw away,including the bones of animals they ate.The information learned from the objects helps us understand how the people in the James Fort lived.

It will tell you what they dig up,how they dig up artifacts and the tools they use to dig up these artifacts .This report will explain every thing on how archeologists work hard to find amazing things for historians to know more about a person or a place.       Archeologists are people who dig up artifacts from past to study.   They take these artifacts to a lab to study them. Once they study them they find out thing about them. Sometimes these artifacts can be very valuble. There are 35 on a team on a siteor area to dig up artifacts. The first team maps the site or area with 3D computers that can track underground , this means they take the 3D computer underground so they can see maybe if there is any artifacts under the ground. The information is wrote down, so people know what it looks like before they start digging.       Another team does the digging and the place the team is digging is called a dig.   Archeologists start their dig with a skim shovel , this is one of many tools they use to dig. It removes layrs of soil. this soil is put into a half-inch screen at the bottom.This lets the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in. Troweling is another tool they use to dig with. It can take weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section. This is a long process.           Another Team spends days in the lab studying the things that are found.   This is a long, slow, and tiresome process. But when when it is done it is all worth it.       Digging in dirt just to play and get dirty is one one thing, but when u dig for   artifacts that can be studied and can maybe be found very valuable, and just amazing to find and learn more about it. So get involved and dig , to find things about someone or thing that no one has ever seen. So get digging.

This paper will have information about archaeological and what the do for their jobs. What archaeological do is they dig up stuff about famous people that who are died. They dig-ed up stuff about Fort James and George Washington.       Fort James was very famous for over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people think that James Fort was built near a river. The archaeological dig-ed up bones from the animals they ate and the trash they threw away. The archaeological found eleven cellars , dozens of burial sites , and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.       George Washington was super famous because he was the predestine they started digging up stuff about him in 2003. They reseached a lot about him. 	PRP$ JJ VBZ IN PRP$ NNS IN JJ .

This paper will explore what they do,what teams are, and the tools they use and how they use the tools. There are many other things that an acheologists do, but these are main ones this paper is about. Lets get started!      Archeologists study things that happened in the past. Archeologists are scientists.   They work many hours a day to dicover things that happen the past. They have to work as a team.     Archeologists are in a team and each team does something else. One team takes a 3D picture under ground so the other team isn't just digging. Another team digs and takes it to the team in a lab. That team studies the artifacts. There can be up to 35 people in a team!            Archeologits many tools like a pick and a shovel. A pick and a shovel helps them dig into Earth. There is also the whisk and the dust pan. They use them to dust of the artifacts. They also use a knife which is used to carefully for digging and to scrape the arifacts. There is a wheelborrow that is used for transportating the artifacts, a skim shovel that is used for carefully remove a thin layer of dirt, and trowel that is used to scrape and cut a view the the different layers of soil.      That is what an archeolegists does. Rember this paper explored what they do, what is a team, and what tools they use and how they use them. I learned that that an archeologists that an acheologist used a wheelborrow and that they used a knife. That is all.

First of all, archeologist use many things to find artifacts. An artifact is a object like a pottery, bones, armor, and many more, so an artifact is simplely an object from the past. Some of the things they use are picks, shovels, whisk, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Most archeologist use picks and shovels to dig deep into the ground because most artifacts are deep in the ground. Next, they use a whisk and a dustpan to dust off dirt on the artifacts. Also, they will use knifes to also get dirt off mort fagile things. Another tool is the wheelbarrow to move heavy loads of dirt and artifacts from one place to another. One other thing is that they use skim shovels to remove thin layers of soil because it has a flat egde. Lastly, they use the trowel to cut different layers of soil. these are all the tools archeologist use.                    The second thing I will talk about are what the jobs of an archeologist are. On a full team they have to have at least 35 people. The first team of people work on computers in 3D so they can see what is under the ground. Then this team sends the maps to the digging team. The 2nd team works on the digging. They first use the skim shovels to get the first layers. 	NNP NNP PRP VBP VBG NNS IN DT JJ NN RB IN JJ CC JJ NNS .

An archeologist will work with a group of other people and this group can be up to 35 people! Computers can see what is underground. A way the archeologists dig up stuff is trowling. Trowling is when you use shovels, picks or paint brushes to remove dirt.            Archeologists use interesting tools to dig. One tool an archeologist uses is called a pick. the pick is used to break up soil. A tool that goes with the pick is the shovel. The shovel can pick up the dirt the pick breaks up. The knife is another tool that is used to scrape dirt form the object.             One other process is that they use the shovel to pour dirt into a half inch sceen so the dirt slips through screen while the objects stay behind on the screen. The archeologists record the information that they find. It ca take up to 2 weeks to dig up a 25 square-foot section! the process is slow but it's worth it.

It would be a great job   for people who love history. An archeologist is someone who finds items from long ago. These items are called artifacts. As an archeologist you get to uncover items from the past. I think that it would be fun because you're just digging.               Archeologists are very smart people. They have to really know their history.Archeologists have 3-D computers so they can find items without digging so much.The computers also tell archeologists what the object looks like so they know they have the right thing.              I'd imagine that doing this would be very time consuming also. You wouln't  have much time to spend with your families. Most archeologist are gone for weeks.       Archeologists probably have a lot of time on their hands because they are gone for a long time.              Archeologist are also very unselfish people because they could take the artifacts and pocket them for themselves. Then they could sell them for hundreds of thousands of dollars.            If you've ever wondered what happens with the artifacts.Well the archeologists take them and get them cleaned.Then most of the time they get put in museums for the public to see and study.            All of the tools are very important. The whisk is a broom like item that sweeps all of the dirt off an artifact. The skim shovel is a flat shovel that can shovel and dig layers af dirt at a time so that they don't miss anything.             Being an archeologist would be an adventure I think. You are going to new places and finding things from the past. You are also solving a mystery for those who don't know about yet.                           I would love to be an archeologist!

There is a simple answerer to that they do it so you can learn about people from the past. Archeologists use serten tools like       a pick and shovel a whisk and a dustpan a knife a wheelbarrow a skim shovel a trowel   They use those six tools to help them find interesting objects like       toys from long ago pottery picuters bones/fossils old coins   We have many questions that we want answers, and we get them answered by finding those things. Archeologists find fossils so we can learn about the past and so we can learn about people from the past. One key thing to digging is that you have to be pastiont with that. You may not find something in every hole but you need to keep digging and you will find something. Discoveries are what helps us find out thing from the past. You can find even where houses use to be.               People need to know  things about the past and archeologists can help us do that. If you really love to find things and have an adventure doing it then archeolige if for you. he best thing about being an archeologist is you get to be the first person to touch or see something that has be barred for hondred of years.                Archeologists have a hard but fun job and if that is something you like then you should try it. maybe someday you will be one.

If they dig too far or too fast, they could miss something important.  Also, an archeoligist has to be skillful.  They have to have all the little gadgets that help them with their digging.  They will need dusting whisks to dust off the artifacts.  Also they will some sort of a gadget to tell the where an artifact is underground.  Not only do archeoligists have to be skillful, they have to be smart.  They will have to be  able to guess ho old the artifact is.  That is the job of a archeoligist.

James fort was found in 1607, for over 200 years ( in the resent past PROBABLY about 2004 ) people have thought that Fort James was washed up by river.         The archeologists found their first artifact in 1861, it was armor and weapons. 100 years later they found where the fort was built. A national park service did a five year study of the area. BUT THEY FOUND JAMES FORT!!!                  First they found a few markings on the ground, that's how they knew where the walls used to be. the archeologists knew that the fort was shaped like a triangle, then they realized that the fort stretched all the way out to the river, and there was stone ledges built over the the river and they were meant to hold cannons.         Today, the same archeologists have found almost 1 million objects every year!! ( coins, pottery, tools and metal toys for children ) It is exciting to discover things from a long period of time in the past.          So now we have gotten to learn about what Archeologists actually do, and what amazing things they can find, so now lets talk about George Washington.              George Washington was the commander and chief of the continental soldiers in the Revolutionary War in the 17 hundreds. After the war George Washington refused to be crowned king so they made him the 1st president of the United States Of America, But does anyone know his real childhood?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In a place called Ferry Farm people have been living there for over 12,000 years! It is a perfect place to build a home so, of cores George's father Augustine moved there as well. George Washington was only six years old. The house was gone of cores but archeologists believe that the stone base under the house was still around. It took over one year to find the house. First they found the kitchen, slave quarters and storage houses. They found the farmhouse a few years later though. At least four other houses were built on Ferry Farm so they have to prove that this was George Washington's house/farm. They found part of a clay pipe, because we would smoke clay pipes.        For the diggers it took about two weeks to make a twenty five square foot section! The discoveries of Washington's home is important in many ways, like it give the people A better understanding of his past.         So we just looked at two major things including George Washington and James Fort but you actually know what tools archeologists use? first they will usually use a pick and shovel to dig into the earth. They will also use a whisk and a dustpan to clean off the artifacts, or a knife to dig carefully around the artifact. The leftover dirt is placed in a wheelbarrow and is taken away from the excavation site. To also dig they use a skim shovel or a trowel one removes a thin layer of dirt and another scrapes and cuts the dirt to view the different layers of soil.             So now you know about what archeologists do and how they do it. 	NNS VBP NNS WP JJ IN NNS : CC RB JJ NNS RB .

To begin with, archeologists are people who mine and find stuff about different people who lived in the past. the tools they use include: pick &amp; shovel, whisk &amp; dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. I bet archeologists love there job just going out somewhere every day and finding something that most people would never of even thought of trying to find that one thing you have been waiting for your whole life.           It would be so interesting finding stuff from people that lived in the past. I know for sure i would love to go somewhere and find stuff from those different people. it would be a dream come true to find the toilet Elvis Presley died on or, Abraham Lincoln black top hat that would be AWESOME.            Archeologists are so lucky they can do that stuff i bet they are lucky too. archeologists also go to where the famous people lived back then like in valley forge where George Washington lived it would be so fun.

(JRAP)  The project was used to uncover the secretes of the James Fort in Jamestown.VI.  For many years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river.  Some discoveries gave them hints that it might be around!          The first objects found were 1861. the Archeologist uncovered armor and weapons.  Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.                Today the groups find one million objects a year! The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.  In the 1600s, people used  to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit.

It takes alot of patients. You need patients because it might take months to find an item. If you get frustrated you have to let it pass by because you have to focus on your  task.           Some of the tools you would use is a pick and shovel. You will need a pick and shovel for digging, and you have to dig sometimes to find an item. Also you might use a whisk and dustpan, you need a whisk and dutpan for brushing off dust or soil off of the item that you found. A dustpan is used for maybe having a tiny particle and you can look at it closely.           To be an archeologist it does take some skill. such as using the tools properly, also researching what you have found. I think being an archeologist would be a very cool job. Why do I say that? Well you get to find and also research really cool and old items. Sometimes the item might of been owned by a very famous person once before. That is why I think being an archeologist would be a very cool job.

Every thing in the history books came from discovery of  a famous person discovered by an archeologist. Take George Washington for instance, we knew a lot about his adulthood, but not much of his childhood.       The Ferry Farms have been a very popular site. It has been there for 12,000 years, so it made since to move there. We know there was a fire and archeologists found burnt pottery and clay pipes.       With James Fort they knew that it was formed in a triangle. They originally thought that a giant wave washed away the fort. But then archeologists found stone ledges over the water. Those hold the canons that protected the fort. I hope you learned a lot today. 	NNP PRP VB TO VB IN NNS .

In the year 1607, some people wanted to learn more about the past, so they started the James town re discovery archeology project. The project was made to find the secrets of Fort James.                  2. The location of Fort James.                                                                                                                 For more than 20 decades, people thought that Fort James was washed away by a river. but was it really? Some items found by archeolgists subgests that Fort James was built futher away the new spot might of gave the Fort more protection from opposing ships. more than 100 years later. a group attempt to find were the fort was built began. A national park led a five year examantion of the area to figure out how the land was used. Next a group of people doing the study used computer mapping to create an image of the land.                  3. The size of Fort James.       Thats's when they found it! the first thing that they found was a group of markings on the ground showed were the walls were and it showed that the walls of Fort James went all the way to the river!!! with the reacearch the arceologists did subgests the fort was shaped like a triangle.                 4. a chain of decoveries!!!!!!!       Some more arceologists decovered 11 cellars, dozens of grave yards and ten buildings all within the what would be the walls of the fort they also gested that rock ledges were built over the river and that the ledges were designed to hold cannons.Today arceologists decover over 1 million items every year!                5. the end.       it's so exciting to learn more about the past american colonies I'm sorry but it is time for me to go so have a nice day bye!

You will need to use a 3D computer that can see stuff that's under ground. Then you will need to use the right equipment, like a trowel which is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. A wheelbarrow is used to carry things from place to place. Like soil, dirt, rocks, artifacts, and much more! There are many other tools used for digging up artifacts. You also want to make sure that you are digging in the right temperature. If it's too hot you might get very tired working in the heat. If it's too cold the ground might be too hard to dig through. If you do find something then you can learn more about that person.

First of all if we didn't have archeoloists we would know nothing about the past at all i mean we would have never knew about dinosaors. Most archeoloists dig up places where there are no people because no one has done any thing to the land so if any treasures are there no one has found the treasures yet. I think you should be and archeoloists because you would learn alot about history and youwould get paid alot of money. Thats why i think you should be and archeoloist.

Archeologists like to find out more about people in the past like George Washington they found alot of his history that they didn't know about and they was suprise by his history.   Some archeologists just want  to find out about peoples childhood and what they did when they were little kids and how they learned to read and write.   Acheologists are people that like to learn more about people childhood, or what they use to do when they were young  and why they liked to do it or why did they have to do it.   So that is why arheologists like to find out more about people  childhood, and more about there history.

They have to be really careful about the things you are using such as tools to find clues in objects.Their job realates to the past and the future.Archeologist take time to find objects from the past to give us imformation about our nation's past and present.They have to search dirty places and go to far places to find clues so that it can unlock a mystery that wonders in our minds.Archologist take a lot of time searching for clues on computers nd mapping for their trip.   Archologist use tools like spaulas and kitchen tools to dust off the dirt.They also use tweasers and hammers to get the ''yuck''  out of the fossils and the artifacts.   They might not have discovered what caused our world to be but they still they find out about history. Sometimes history can unlock science,which archeologist are a part of.   As you can see archeologist are a big part of our past and present.

Well if you're not up for tedious work, it might not be the job for you.       Many teams can work on a site, and there can be up to 35 people on a single team. That means if there were only three teams, there could already be more than a hundred people! However, before the digging even starts, the first team has to map out the area with 3D computers so that people after them will know what the site looked like before the digging started.        The actual process of digging is long and back-breaking. The dig is started with small shovels that are called skim shovels. Skim shovels are extremely sharp and flat, so they are able to remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then screened - the soil is put in a box with a screen so that the dirt falls out and the artifacts stay in .        Another process that diggers use is troweling. Troweling archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to get rid of dirt. Troweling is extremely slow, however. It can take up to two weeks to dig a small 25-square-foot area!        A final team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts that are found to find out what they mean and how they are important to our history.

Archeologist have to carry all of there supplies such as: picks, shovels, whisks,dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels.An Archeologist has to carry all of there things in there wheelbarrow. Archeologist need to make it look/be fun so kids would be an archeologist.It is important that they make some children into an archeologist.        A typical day of an archeologist is that your usually are just digging and removing thin layers of dirt and dust, or looking at artifacts just studying them from places like James fort or George Washington's house.'An archeologist is a smart person.'

Some of the reasons the job of an archeologist is a hard job, is because archeologist have to observe and study artifacts about history. An archeologist is a scientist who observes and studies artifact from the past.       The job of an archeologist helps the community by collecting artifacts from past. There are many tools used by an archeologist. Those tools used by an archeologist are important, because those tools help the archeologist develop and move on with the job.       Archeologist study and observe many artifacts, such as fossils, bones, and most of all extincted dinosaurs. Clearly, these examples of archeologist and the study, tell the job and more important examples of an archeologist.

It usually takes several months just to find out about one person's life. Although it doesn't seem like a lot of hard work, it is plentiful for the history diggers.         But why do they do it? The archeologists do it because they want to know more about how the old legends lived, like George Washington.They also do it so the world can know. The history searchers find many interesting tools, clothes, and almost anything that can tell them how they lived.          Archeologists work in many groups and each group has a special purpose. On each team, there can be as many as 35 people!One team maps out an area using a 3D computer so they can track what is underground. The other team digs on the selected area which is called the dig.The archeologists start digging with skim shovels that remove thin layers of dirt. the soil is placed in a box with a thin screen on the bottom. that lets the dirt fall out and allows the artifacts appear. The diggers also use a process called troweling, which is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It almost takes two weeks to dig a 25-square foot area. After all that, another team studies the artifacts in a lab.         The archeologist's job is very tiresome but releases a lot of information. Because of the archeologists, we know all the history that we know today.

Your going to learn who are archeologists, what they use, and where and when they do it.                 An archeologist is a person who looks or finds a artifact from the past. Some archeologists have different jobs. there are three groups  the lab, digging, and mapping.                   Archeologists  use special tools for help. Some of these tools include a trowel, a wheelbarrow, and a skim shovel. Those tools make the jobs more easy.              A archeologist can appear out of no where, but they usually come if they want to know more about history. An archeologist can come in to look and come out usually with artifacts.             Archeologists are hard working people, for who they are, what the use, and when and where they go, and in the end they are amazing people. 	WP VBP NNS .

I bet if you go to the places the were at you find there bones and many other things of there's in the area around and maybe the guns they maybe have in a museum.

Archeologists, the name for sciencetists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of  buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a five- year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping softwere to make an image of the area. That's when they finally found james fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read , and drawings they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort was stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons.

You know a lot of people want to be archaeologist because you get to discover or explore new things that you have never ever knew before. People would like to be an archaeologist because they think it would be cool to find the historical life of a person long ago and how life was when they were alive.                   Archaeologist are very lucky people because they get to be the first people to find and touch the things that were there long ago. They get to find out what went on in there lives before they were even born or while they were babies. Some people think that being an archaeologist would be gross and hard work but it really isn't all you have to do is go to work go to the place where the boss tells you to go and dig up the body or the things that were put in the ground like historical life like the decloration of Independence or some names put on a piece of paper or if there was a gun put in the ground from a World War or the Cold War.                     Archaeologist really don't done a hard job all they have to do is go dig what they need to dig up and get payed for it. Its just like being a doctor or a teacher or a police officer it is easy but it is easier than all three of those things. Archaeologist get payed all most like any other job does but some people think that it is a weird job to do because your digging in the dirt or in the ground.                              So there you go maybe one day you might want to be an archaeologist one day it really sounds like a lots of fun so think about it if you want to get messy or dirty ormaybe even getting a good pay this job might be the one for you. Archaeology would probably be the best fit for you it really might if you want a lot of money or be rich. 	NNP NNP PRP VB IN NN VBZ DT NN WP NNS DT NN IN DT NN WP VBD RB RB .

Think of it!!!                    In these to sources you will learn about what and why archeologists dig and what you can learn about from them. In Digging Up George Washington's Past you will learn about what tools they used for digging in that place. In Finding Fort James it talks about what they found and what information there is about it. Archeologists are people that dig up artifacts from the past.                                                                                     Archeologists used a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife and many other things. It takes a team of archeologists just to find pieces of an artifact!!! Archeologists use a pick and shovel to dig deep down into the earth where you can dig very close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan is used to brush of dirt from the artifacts that archeologists find. There are many other tools used and they all have a very important role in digging up artifacts.               To be a archeologist you must have a lot of patience! Imagine just digging up a small piece of clay in 6 months!!! That could be REALLY annoying. An archeologist has to be a hard working person. Think of sitting in the hot blazing sun for hours and hours, digging and digging.                                     I would never even think of becoming an archeologist!!!

There are many tools that archeologists use in their work to get the job done, and archeologists find more artifacts each day.          The tools that an archeologist uses are very important. One of the most common tools used is a trowel. Trowels are used to scrape, cut, and view the layers of soil. Another tool used is a knife. Knives are used to cut dirt from around an artifact. A pick and shovel is also a tool that archeologists use. Most archeologists start digging with these.         There are more tools archeologists use, also. For instance, they use whisks and dustpans. Whisks and dustpans are to brush off dirt from artifacts and excavation sites. Archeologists use wheelbarrows, too. Wheelbarrowsare used to carry off items or dirt to one place to another. Another tool used is a skim shovel. They have very flat edges that can carefully scope away dirt. These tools are not the only tools that archeologists use, there are still many, many more!          There are many duties an archeologist must do, aswell. At an excavation site called Ferry Farms, groups of archeologists have been finding artifacts from George Washington's house! At Ferry Farms, there is at least thirty- five archeologists in one group. That's a lot of people! One group of archeologists will scope out an area by using 3D computers to see what's underground. Then they record the information so people will know what to expect when they start digging in that area. Another team focuses on digging, they call the place where they do the digging a dig.         The teams at Ferry Farms have found kitchens, slave quarters, and storage houses in 2004. Later, they found the main farmhouse. They also found pieces of burnt pottery and parts of clay pipes. Still today Ferry Farms is finding more and more artifacts from long ago.          In 1994, a group of archeologists that called themselves the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was made to find James Fort. People said that the fort had been washed away, but the project found clues that the fort was still around.          The National Park Service studied the area that was the exact place the fort had been built for five years. they tried to find out how the land was used. This helped them decide where to look for the fort. Soon after, James Fort was found! Marks on the ground showed where the walls had been, and there were also stone ledges that were built to hold cannons. Cellars, burial sites, and buildings were all found by the archeologists. Today, the group finds about one million artifacts a year!         Being an archeologist sounds like an amazing job! The tools seem fun to use. You can find great things if you just look hard enough and thats what archeologists do! This discovers more history than ever before!

Some things they look for have been there for decades, or maybe even centeries! Their job is hard becuse when they find what the're looking for they have to send it to a lab, make sure it does't get broke, and a lot of other things that are hard to do for a person. The things they dig for are called artifacts and if old and valuable can be very important.              Archeoligists can look for some artifacts for years. Sometimes there is know guarentee they will find it. There are many different tools a archeoligist can use. Eight of them are the pick, a shovel, a whisk, a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skimshovel, and a trowel. These tools are very important to the archeoligists.             There are some organizations for other kids or people that want to get involved with digging up artifacts. Ferry Farms for example helps get kids involved. The steps an archeoligist has to take when he discovers something is, be careful with the object he or she has found, take it back to the lab, leave it there for the workers to study, and then go and find more stuff. archeoligists can be called to many different places. Some places are far from where they live and they can be gone for a long time.              Archeoligists have a hard job, but it could be fun, finding new things that people used long ago. If you want even you can be an archeoligist. Archeoligists are good for the community because they help us find out more about people from the past. If we find out about people from the past it could make us smarter. Archeoligists are brave and Should be respected for what they do to help us find out about other people from long ago.

It was built in 1607 when the settlers came hear from England so they could practice their own religion.           The first object found was found in 1861. Archeologist found armor and weapons.

Some go to labs and help figure out was it is and why is is there. Archeologist  usually look for marks of what building was there and why it is not there now.Archeologist uses tools to help do these jobs like pics and shovels whisk dustpans a knife wheelbarrow skim shovel and a trowel. Archeologist find lots of interesting thing like George Washington's house that burned downn or fort James.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Archeologist usually find a lot of neat stuff dinosaur bones or houses that was here hundreds of years ago.  They often find some cool stuff like civil war stuff or old cloths or houses.They use tools in many ways like the pick and shovel for start dinging whisk and dustpan to sweep the dust off of the object they find and knife to scrape dirt around the objects and wheelbarrow for caring from the evacuation sites and the skim shovel for carefully removing a thin layer of soil from the ground and last the trowel is the most common tool in history and it is used for to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The discovery of Washington's house was good in many ways. First, it gives the people of the U.S.a better way to understand him before he became famous. We also know why he made the choice he made. And other thing is it helps people who love history help people who want to know about him better helps people.And it helps people learn about the Colonial life he lived.

Whisk and Dustpan used to brush off dirt from artifacts and to clear away dirt from a excavation site.Knifes used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from artifacts.Wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another and to carry dirt.Skim Shovel a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil.The Trowel the most common tool in archeology used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.Archeologist will also look into places like deserts,caves,and mountains and many more!           This job seems hard but is really worth it in the end.But if you try hard enough you could discover something new.But if you don't like being outside then you could search old houses like in the article of Digging up George Washington's Past.A archeologist can find many things and unclog the past and we could learn more about that era. If you couldn't find any thing you would have to search somewhere else.This has been my report on archeologist if you want to learn more click the link below                   http:www.nps.gov       or       http://diganthro.wordpress.com       Thank you for reading my report         	NNP NNP NNP NN IN DT NN VBZ PRP MD VB DT NN IN JJ PRP MD RB VB VBZ JJ CC JJ CC NN TO VB JJ DT NN NNS VBN IN NNP PRP VBZ DT NNS PRP VBP VBP NNS CC NNP RBS NNS MD VB IN DT CD NNP NNP CC NNP VBD TO VB RP NN IN NNS CC TO VB RP NN IN DT NN VBZ VBN IN JJ NN CC TO VB NN IN JJ VBN TO VB NNS IN CD NN TO DT CC TO VB JJ NNP DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBN TO RB VB DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP DT RBS JJ NN IN NN VBN TO NN CC VBD TO VB DT JJ NNS IN JJ NN RB VBP IN NNS IN NNS , NNS , CC NNS CC JJ RBR .

When they look for artifacts there are teams that do a special job. First one crew maps out the area using 3D computers so they can track things underground. After they find a spot to dig another group starts to dig.       The diggers use tools to help them. One is a shovel and pick, most digs start with these tools until they get far enough to the artifacts. They use the wheelbarrow to carry dirt or other things to a different place. They use also use a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of soil. They use the whisk dustpan and knife to carefully remove soil or brush dirt off an artifact.       Archeologist does this to discover the past and find cool things from back then.They have to have an idea where something might be before they start the steps. Depending where and what your digging for is what you get, if you dig where Benjamin Franklin lived as a child then you might find books of that time or maybe even something he wrote.       Being an archeologist would be fun if only because you discover the past but you get to go place famous people were. But it would be very tiring digging it up and having to stare at a computer all day is tiring. Also it is an all day job it is not only for an hour or two. Also that would be bad if all day you did nothing but dig and you found nothing but dirt, dirt, and more dirt. But it is fun to find what you want to find and more.       Archeologists could find anything with today's tech. They can find things from Indians from conditional time and prehistoric times.They get to use the highest tech, if i were a archeologist I would be using the computer.As I see it being an Archeologist is fun but also very tiring.

As well they also discover the remians of the dinousars and other cool stuff. They used matirals like a pick and sonel for digging it  out of the rocks an digging in the dirt to find bones and o ther stuff. They used whisk and dustpan  to brush away the sand or dirt to see the artifact better. They used a knife for  scraping around the artifact. And Etc. These people go into famous nonalive people and look for really cool artifacts like jewlery and clothes and matirals that are something meaningful to them.                          And they also go out in the forest and look for dead animal remains or sometimes even music  clothes and other stuff like that. And also old barns for clothes animal remains and that thing you find in a barn. And maybe at  mountians to dig in the mountians maybe find a moumths remains. And in  the river for other reamins and stuss . There is many places you can find remains. And really cool stuff about people of the past and our history of this country to us.These peole also put stuff in the muesem so peple can see what is it all about and were it came from. And also about the era that thing had or person lived and experinaced. And what the peole were doing it and why they did it.

But its not as easy as you think it is.  Alot of archeologist have to work in labs and look up facts and write tons of reports on that artifact.             They are pretty tough workers and they have to be able to enjoy what they do in order to make profit and to keep that job.  But thankfully most archeologists enjoy their job and what they do.             If i were an archeologist i would probobbly dig for fossils from dinosaurs and or bones from extinct animals.  Now would you be an archeologist?              	MD PRP VB TO VB DT NN .

So to find artifacts you must have the following tools used by archeologists: A pick and a shovel which most digs start with these two tools and there used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Some other tools archeologists use would be a whisk and dustpan which is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Also a knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts, A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Also a skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Now this tool would be probably the most common tool an archeologist would use which is a trowel and it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. These are the tools archeologists used while finding artifacts.          Here is a quick story of some archeologists working at George Washington's house to find artifacts about him. When they go out to find artifacts about him they go to his house from a long time ago, and they found burnt pottery, then this suggests a fire occured there. They also found a clay pipe, they found a clay pipe because Washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house. So thats what archeologists do, they discover artifacts of people long ago. They want to know about there history.

It also gives us a better understanding of who the person was before he or she was famous. Also they could find out some great artifact that no one has ever found before. It is very interesting to learn about things in the past.           The job of an archeologist is tiresome it's hard work because archeologists have to do a lot of thinking on the thing that they're working on. There are 2 teams with about 35 people in the group. Each team has there own job one group is called a dig and there the ones that will dig up the artifact with skim shovels some of the diggers use a process called Toweling and that's when the archeologists would use wooden pickaxes, small shovels, and paint brushes. Another team would first use a 3D computer to track what would be underground. Sometimes when archeologists would go out digging they could find out something they've never known.            Lots of times archeologists don't really know where the person's house was so the archeologists would have to gather up all of there information and find out where the house used to be. Most of the time archeologists have to use there knowledge. Also archeologists sometimes have to do sketches of the building if they were doing one to see where the building or fort could have been. Lots of times archeologists have to read books to see where the building could have been located they were putting more information on the thing they were researching about. Some people thought that the James Fort was washed away by a river but they found out that it still might be there.            That was my informational report about archeologist and there job. An archeologists is and awesome job and one day I hope to be one. Also it would be very fun to go out and dig up artifacts from long ago. It also teaches you something. Plus archeologists get to use awesome tools and get to dig up things from the past.

Archeologists have a pretty complicated job, like they have many teams.  Sometimes the teams can have up to 35 people.  Being an archeologist is hard because you have many jobs to do and it will be very confusing with all the people running around.  These next few paragraphs will about the tools they use.            This first paragraph will be about a pick and a shovel and what their job is.  A pick is a very sharp tool that is used for to make a better hole to dig up.  A shovel is kinda the same but it is more round and it makes a deeper hole so its easier to find the artifact.  These are two tools that are useful to archeologists in team 1.             This second paragraph is about a whisk and a dustpan and what their job is.  A whisk is a metal brush that brushes dirt off the artifact to make the artifact easier to see.  A dustpan is a metal pan with a handle on one side and dirt can go into it so the dust doesn't go back onto the artifact.  These two tools are very important to team 2 because if dirt is still on the artifact then the scanning wont be correct.              This third paragraph is about a knife and a wheelbarrow and what their job is.  A knife is a very sharp tool that is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt away from around the artifacts.  A wheelbarrow is like a big bucket on wheels and is used to move items from one place to anther or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. These tools are very important tools.               This fourth paragraph is about a skim shovel and a trowel and what they do.  A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.  A trowel is a sharp hand held shovel that is probably the most common tool in archeology. It's used for scraping and cutting to view the different layers of soil. These to tools are most common and most used while an archeologist is working.                 There are many jobs in order to be an archeologist so that's why there are so many tools to help dig up artifacts so that people who want to know about people they can. This was my report on what an archeologists job is for and what is does and how they do it.

Then they have to graft and then they have to dig ya that is allot of work. The tools they use are like the size of a tooth pick. That is what they have to do to find out mysteries.

You have to have a lot  of  perseverance to be a archeologist you can never give up. Also you have to have steady hands because if you break something it's ruined forever. Also I think an archeologist takes a lot of time in college to learn how to be an archeologist.  You can't just be an archeologist, you have to know how to be an archeologist.                             Archeologist are really important. Them digging artifacts up are important too. They are important because they find important things. They let us know more information about past famous people and city, like, Christopher Columbus or Fort James. That also help little kids know more things and learn knew things about the past, they learn things they didn't know.                        That is what a archeologist job is, and how there job helps us learn more about the past. learning more about archeologist makes me think of when I was a kid. I would play in the dirt or soil and find interesting things. like I  was saying learning more about archeologist make me want to be a archeologist. they sound so intelligent and confident.

I want to wonder what is it hard for everybody or for some peaple. peaple have really good money doing that you would get to get cool stuff it would be hard for me to be an archeologests. peaple do hard stuff to get that job but iwould like it because you can learn about it in school to. archeologests get to look at expensve stuff and have to discover what they are witch is neat. Today archeologests descover like brock obomas stuff would be expenseve like his watch and his white house would be amazing as a archeologests you do very hard work and do lots of fun stuff like if you found linkings hat would be awsome but yo don't now if is his or not. you would want to find at least somthing from a preasdent that would be neat but it would be very old probuly cause his family could of took it. archeologests woule never be easy searching all the time would it maybe maybe not it is still worth it. you mite find somthing like an animal that we never knew lived or find somthing from a long time ago from a cowboy if they go in the desert.

And they also find out stuff that is really old and that could  part of history and they could do finger prints to tell what used it and they could do stuff like a knife because they could find something that is like fabiricand they could cut it plus it might have been used for clothing.

The fort was bilt in Virgina in 1607 when alot of settilers come over from england they came to start a new life in Aremica. So they came to the Jamestown fort to strt a new life.The first objects were found in 1861 100 years later some more people found more thing in the same the fort was bilt on.Today workers are still looking in that spot to find special things.         For more than 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away down the river to another place down the river.The National Park Service had to do a five year study on the james fort.The fort was made so that it could keep the enimy sips out of where the setilars lived and that is why they built the and they are stiil looking for it today.

These are the tools used by the people.

One of these toools is a pick and the other is a shovel these are tools to dig up the Earth.                                                                                                                                   2.One is a dustpan and a whisk used to brush dirt off the surface                                                                     3.

Well a Archeologist is someone who studies objects from the past.  Archeologist finds a lot about the past. Archeologist sometimes takes weeks to find something. They have to use devices to put tiny pieces of information together.They use a lot of tools too, such as :   pick and shovel- used to dig into the earth for artifacts whisk and dustpan- to brush off the artifacts and clear away the dirt knife- used to carefully dig wheelbarrow- used to move items to one place to the other skim shovel-used to carefully scrap thin layers of dirt and a trowel- to scrap or cut different layers of soil      Archeologist have even found Fort James. People thought that Fort James was washed away by a river but discoveries show that it might still be there.  Archeologist even learned about George Washington past. Even as a boy!           One thing Archeologist found was Fort James.  Fort James was in Jamestown, Virginia. For 200 years people thought that Fort James was washes away by a river. Archeologist found out that in 1607 England settlers came to start a new life. Most people believed that the settlers made the fort by a river but later they discovered that objects from Fort James was farther away.  Some of the objects were found in 1861. Archeologist discovered armor and weapons. More then 100 year later a group of archeologist found the exact spot where Fort James was built. They did a 5 year study to make sure that it was Fort James.To today archeologist are finding 1 million objects a year!          Another thing Archeologist discovered was George Washington's home as a boy and older.  Nobody exactly knew where George Washington lived since the building was gone.  Archeologist have discovered that the stone based of the house should still be there.  In the year of 2003 archeologist started to dig in the land known as Ferry Farm. It took over a year, but they found it and it was totally worth!  Records they found showed that  there was a fire.  Some of the diggers found burnt pottery. They also found clay pipes. And George Washington liked to smoke clay pipes.         Each year a group of 35 people on a team work at the site. The first team of maps used the 3D computers that track what is under ground. Then they used that information to know where to dig.  Archeologist did a lot of tiresome work, but as i said before it was wroth it!  This discovery gave a lot of information about George Washington's child hood.         As you can see Archeologist do a lot of stuff that can help us learn about history.  They study a lot of stuff no matter how long it takes! I think it was most amazing how they found George Washington's place! 	DT NNP NNP CC WP PRP VBP NNP PRP VB WP DT NNP VBZ .

One thing I know is what they study. In 1994 a group was doing this Archaeolgical project.              The project was to discover the secrets of the james Fort in jamstown, It was a big project they had to do. Now I am going to tell you what it is like being a Archeologist. One thing A Archeologist does is they find a lot of things that were in Washington's house.              Each year many teams will work on a site. There could be up to 35 people on a team! The team tried to find James Fort. The national park service had a fiver year old study of the area to figure out how land was used. They throught that it would help them decide where to look for proof. They used a type of thing on a computer to make an image of the area.             That's when they finally found James Fort! The first they found was a set  marks on the ground . Those marks  showed where the fort's walls used to be. The archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They also made maps and stuff to even help them find James Fort. The archeologists used tools to. But this is not part of the big job that is over.            I am going to tell some of the tools they used. Knife used for digging and scraping. Trowel also used for scraping and cutting. Wheelbarrow is used for moving items one place to another and carrying. Pick used for digging into hard objects close to the artifacts. That is all the tools there is more but this is all im going to tell thanks for listening.

An archeologist has to be very careful about where they dig.Archiologists have recently found George Washington and they have to know about the things that might have happend a long time ago.They have also recently ound Fort James.They must use presition and hope not to hit or break any thing usefull or in value of there job.       They ushaly will dig out very big parts of the earth to find things. Archologests uhshaly use shovels and wooden pickaxes to get rid of layers of dirt.All of the axes dirt will be put into a wellbarow.sence the founding of Gorges childhood home we have leard  alot about his chiled hood and what happend whene he was even younger.The founding of Fort James would show what happend whene the spanish came in the 1600's they built it then hundreds of years later arciologists found armor and the trash that they would throw away they always thought that before any one found it that it was washed away by a river and was long gone.       They look at the atifacts they find in 3D computers to judge what it is. Most arciologists are very smart but you have to be because if you sont know anythig about the artifacts you might think it is just a peice of tras and throw it off the mountain your on or something.If you didn't know what to do you would allways look at it for 20min. and then put back a 100,000,000 year old Dinosoaur bone.

They also have to find artifacts or old pieces of history to help us understand what really happened in history. An archeologist also has to be very careful and patient. It could take months just to find out a toy that George Washington played with.             Archeologist also have to be ready to get down and dirty. They get very dirty when they are in the dirt all day long. Also they have to be careful. If they are not careful they might break the artifacts. Archaeologist also have to be very smart and know where things came from. They also have to be interested in history or they probably wont like their job. If you don't like dirt you wont like you job either. An archeologist also has to study what they have found.             They also have to like to learn about history or else they might find their job to be very boring. It is very important that they are careful and they can't just dig in the ground super fast because it might break one of the objects. They also would need many years of practice to be able to find objects over one hundreds years old and not break them.

Archeologists help use know what the past use to be and how show things that came from that past. They use have programs on there computers that can help them find that on maps that aren't shown on other maps. This helps the archeologists find where that spot can be. Finding these place can be hard and very tricky to some archeologists out there. Archeologists have to take notes and find pictures to help them find it and then finally they go to that spot and find them with knifes and shovels. Some of the places can be in very small places that nobody found in a long time.        When they get there they search for shovels to find things that must have to have been left from the ground. There are teams found so they can found all of those things and there are up to 35 people in one group. Without archeologists, we could could not find things from the past and what happened to them. An archeologists is someone who finds artifacts from the past. They are the very first people to find something that is old and that has never been discovered before. As soon as the archeologists find the right materials, they go back to and see anything that could have happened to them. The maps they use are much different then the way people use them today and they better at finding things than we are. Some inportant things for an archeologists are fossils that have things carved on them from ages ago.          Archeologists need as much things as possible to be able to find bones, teeth, and fossils. Archeologists use wheelbarrows to find to carry a lot of dirt out of the way for finding these bones that are deep in the ground. As they find these artifacts they bring to people at museums and they get paid a lot for all the hard work that they have done. A knife is used to scrap dirt off of the the artifact or fossil that has been found so the archeologists can see it more clearly. A trowl is inportant for fro archeology because you have to scrap and cut different layers of the soil. Most importantly you need a whisk and a dustpan is to clear the site and brush off dirt from the artifacts. This is an archeologists job.

Ships were able to dock there easier to. The reason they put it there was because it made more protection from enemy ships. The first objects were found in 1861 were uncovered armor and weapons.The National Park Service lead a five -year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.They realized that there were stone edges built over the river.Today the group finds over 1 million objects each year.The objects are pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.It's exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago, and it gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.Now we know that if we work hard enough we can find things that have never been seen or heard of because of the technalegy that we have.People back then that were looking for things or objects at the fort really tried to work as hard as they could to find these things and I think doing this changed their lives.

Well anyways they find things everywere like they dig and search in places were famouse people have been like Geoge Washington. Archeologists used alot of tools that they did alot with.

An archeologist uses special tools to help them find the artifacts. Archeologists work is very hard but its worth it.              Some of the tools an archeologist uses is a pick and a shovel. The pick and the shovel are used to dig into the earth to get to the artifacts. A whisk and a dustpan  are other tools used to get the dirt off  the artifacts. A knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel are also some other tools an archeologist needs or uses to find artifacts.                             To find out about a persons past or childhood an archeologist has to find the place where that person lived or where they spent their childhood. Then the archeologists start their digging and start looking around to look for more clues. When they find the artifacts they use the whisk to dust off the dirt. The archeologists then keep looking until they find enough artifacts to find out about the past or the childhood of the person.                    In conclusion a person who studies artifacts an archeologist. The tools the archeologists use to find the artifacts are special. It  takes the archeologist a very long time and hard work to find the artifacts but in the end they succeed and find out about the person they are studying.

Well heres your chance to see how an archeologist works.              First an archeologist groups with other archeeologists. They have many tools to help them dig up the past. The acheologists divide into seven different groups to research the peoples past. The process is slow and tireing, but its worth it.                To end with, archeologists jobs can be intresting, but not alot of peole want to be an archeologists. Archeologists work har dto help us figure out our past long ago.

At Ferry Farm, Archeologist went to find out more about George Washington's childhood. There they found George W.'s house. To comfirm that the house was where George had lived as a child, they examied for any signs of burnt things because records show that the Washingtons had their house on fire.They finally found pieces of burnt pottery,but that was still not enough for the archeologist. They know that George smoked clay pipes.Later they found some clay pipes that were smoked. The archeologist were later digging for artfacts.They used methods such as Troweling and used tools like a whisk and a dutst pan,a skim shovel,Trowels, and pickaxes.      In conclustion, Archeology helps people understand about America's past and things that were used by different  people.Expditions such as Ferry Farm and Fort James are great examples of what archeologist do and the artfacts they find that were once used by well-known people and groups like George Washington or Fort James.Artfacts tells us what that happened thousands of years ago that we dont know about.

Sometimes they might be looking for specific things.  Like in the story Finding Fort James they want to find where the fort was, so they had to find facts that the fort was really there.  In Digging up George Washington's Past they needed to find artifacts to know that he lived in a certain place.        They needed the right tools for digging so they wouldn't break the object once they found it.  A pick and shovel was used to dig in the dirt, close to artifacts.  The whisk and dustpan was used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.  They used a trowel to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil and they used a knife to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.  A wheelbarrow was used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.  There are many more tools but they come in handy sometime.       I think archeologists are cool they uncover stuff from a long time ago!  It is exciting to discover objects that were used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.  It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.

Archeologists have helped us learn many things about humanity's past. Like in Finding Fort James, archeologists discovered that Fort James really was still there and they were able to find it. Also in Digging up George Washington's Past, archeologists were able to discover George Washington's home that he had as a boy. Archeologists do a lot of reaserch. They help us know what happened before our time.                       Archeologist's tools                   Archeologists use many tools. They have to use special tools and work carefully so they do not damage the artifact. One tool they use is called a Skim Shovel. This is a shovel with a flat edge. Archeologists use this tool to remove thin layers of soil with every scoop. The next tool is a trowel. It is said to be the most used tool in archeology. Archeologists use it to scrape the soil to view it differently. Archeologists also use a knife a lot. They can it for more careful digging. It is also useful to scrape dirt from artifacts. Those tools are not the only ones an archeologist would use. There are still many more.

The back nan we did not know much this can help us learn about more about the past more nan we know we make new decover and do new things and get stuuf from the past and get it more about the  past if your the archeologist is hard work and get thing done.That why I think a archeologist is hard to do.

You see, it is not a easy job for them they need to now every detail about thire life.Like George Washington he was a solider then became a presidnt.He also helped us win the war from England.Now let me talk more about an archeologist. So when someone died then a archeologist burres something important so when someone comes and burres the groung the might remember something in the past.        My other thing that I need to tell you is that you need to be careful because if you are finding out what is the problem and someone sees you they might think you are spying on them or something.In Fortan James the archaeological was desigened to discover the secrets.They discoverd the floors of the buildings.They also worked hard to find something important. The National Park led five-year to study of the area to figure out how the land was used. Then they found James Fort. They also found was a set of marks on the ground.I think it would be intresting to be a arecheologist beause you would now about people life story.

You probily know that they dig and find artifacts, but i will tell you more about an archeologist.       Archelogist use several tools for there job.  pick and shovel: Most digs start with theses two tools.  Used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts.  The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt form the excavation site.  the knife is used for careful gigging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.  The wheelbarrow is used tio move items from one place to the other or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.  The skim shovel is a shovel used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scup.  And finaly the trowel, it is probily the most common tool in archeology.  It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.       Now i will tell you about archeologist in Fort James.  In Fort James they found. when they found Fort James, the first thing that they found was a set of marks of the ground.  The archeologist knew that Fort James would be the shape of a triangle.  Today archeologist find nearly i million objects each year.       Now I will tell you about archeologist finding Geoge Washington's childhood.  People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years.  no one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was gone.  The archeologist started digging in 2003. they finaly found it.  Four houses have been built on the Fary Farm land, so the diggers needed proof that this was George Washington.  the diggers found a peice of pottery This suggests a fire happend.  they also found part of a clay pipe. We know that George washington smoked clay pipes.  That gives proof that this might be George Washingtons house.       i have told you abput the job of a archeologist.  I hope you learned a lot about archeologist.

Also, you can't dig up an artifact overnight. It takes a lot of work. Archeologists have to map out the area that they want to dig and use 3D computers to track what's underground. Being an archeologist is no piece of cake, but you can benefit in many ways.       Once on the digging site, archeologists use many different kinds of tools to find what they are looking for. Skim shovels are used to take off a very small layer of dirt with each dig. Picks and shovels are used to dig deep to find artifacts. Knives are used to scrape dirt off artifacts and to do careful digging.Trowels are used to view the different layers of soil at a digging site. Whisks are used to brush away extra dirt, and wheelbarrows are used to move artifacts from one place to another.       Archeology isn't a walk in the park, but without it we would not know a lot about the past and the hardships that people went through. Not much would be known about anything! Without archeology, we would know nothing about our ancestors, so get out there and start digging!

If you have dug up something from the ground before the proses in which you do this is called Archeology. Archeology is the study of objects from the past. If you study the objects you are called a archeologist. For many people Archeology is a treasured perfection.             In 1994 a bunch of people who find studying the past entertaining formed a group called the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. The project was started to recover  the secrets of the Jamestown Fort in Virginia at the small historical town of Jamestown. For a little while longer than 200 years, many people believed that the Jamestown fort got dragged away by a very large stream. Some searches in the area lead to the beleif that the fort might still be around.             The Jamestown fort was built in 1607 after the new, early settlers came from England. Many people believe that the Jamestown Fort was constructed on a river bank, as it was easier to access the water and fort. Some however debate that the fort was further inland due to objects found near the digging site. Being further away from the river would be a better spot because it allowed more protection to the sellers from enemy ships. James fort is not the only dig site that archaeologist search at they search at many different places all over the planet from Egypt to Ferry Farm where Gorge Washington lived. I sure do hope you learned a lot from my paper and enjoyed it.    	NNP PRP RB VBP RP NN IN DT NN .

Thats when they finally found james fort! the first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground .The marks showed were the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read ,and drawings they made , the archeoligist knew that the fort would  be shaped like a triangle .They made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way  to the river . Then they  realized there were stone leges built over the river.        The leges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellars,dozen of burial sites , and ten buildings all within the border or the fort . the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year . The objects include pottery ,tools,coins, and even metal toys for children to play. In the 1600's people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit .    While digging in the area , the archoelogist's found the trash the settlers threw away, in -cluding  the bones of animals they ate . The information learned from these objects help us understand how the people in the james fort lived .We now know how the settlers did to survive  the difficult years when they had little food.It is exciting to discover objects that were regulary used by people who lived hundreds of years ago . It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the american colonies.

Some archeologist go to a place called Ferry Farm were you have to be careful were you dig.Digging can be alot of work for example, some might take up to two weeks to try to dig a 25-square foot.Also they use a computer so they look up the image of the area.                                      For example,archeologist had to go look for James fort aprantly they found it . It was shape lie a triangle and found eleven cellars.In the first paragraph it said that some people thought that James fort was washed of by the river.                                                           When  Archeologist  look for building they sometimes get lucky enough theyb find metal materials.Archeologist also have to look for information about old time . They even find farm houses.                                   When archeologist find the material they need theu find the right spot and proof.Some of the tools they use are so thin and sharp that they go through layers of soil.Some of thearcheologist get very tiresome but its worth it.                                                           The  archeologist searched where gorge washington lived but it was all long gone.When they were looking for Gorge Washington house they discovered a burned pipe.they also found the base of the house.                                                                              See its not easy trying to be one of those people. It takes a lot of hard work and sometimes you get tired.you also have to use alot of tools.

Then,when an archeologist is ready they pack their things and leave.An archeologist uses these things:Pick and shovel,whisk and dustpan,kinfe,wheelbarrow,skim shovel, and trowel.These things are very important for a archeologis.An archeologist is a very intresting person.           Last,an archeologist may not use all of the tools but some tools are very important when there digging!Archeologists dig for may years until they find what they needed to find or until they have may important stuff that support what they were looking for.As you can see an archeologist has a cool job but at the samt time it's difficult beacouse it could take up to several years to find the things they need to find.

In biographies they do not talk,  niether have much information about George Washingtons childhood. Also Georges father, Augustine Washington moved his family to a place called Ferry Farm when George was only six years old. Then no one knew where George Washington and his family lived.The archeologists wanted to know about Georges life. Next,the archeologists gathered a team and the teams were of 35 people. One of the teams were using 3D computers to find out what was underground. The other group was focusing on the digging .They would be  digging with shovels called skim they were so small ,flat, and sharp.The archeologists would also use trowling tools wich are  small paint brushes ,small shovels ,and wooden picks. It would take them up to two weeks to dig a 25-square foot section! One of the other teams were working in labs trying to figure out what was undergroud.The whole project took forever but it was actualy worth it . This discovery of George Washingtons house really was important for persons because they get a better  understanding of who George Washington was before he became famouse and our President.

They found his home, and is clothes.They started digging in 2003 when they there found the kitchen that was in the building. They found slaves houses and slave quarters. A few years later they found the main farmerhouse.       Finding Fort James is when these people go out and they try to find Fort James for 200 years everyone thought that he got washed away in the river but he didn't.In 1861 objects was found. scientists say that they found millions of things of him. They found that he was at The National Park Service they was so glad they found him. They started telling everyone know the story is everywhere.

Archeologist work very hard  to dig and build a lot of things they use tools but not tools like for the car they use archeologist tools to dig.Archeologist work in the very hot sun and they suet a lot cause when you move a lot you start getting hot and then you start sweating.When you start digging up something you will need a lot of tools so they could help you move the things and that will be so much faster to do.Archeologist work on building  houses or apartments they also fix streets and they dig .Archeologist do a lot of different kinds of things.Also archeologist learn about the past by digging up old buildings and objects and examining them carefully.              First of all,archeologist find a good spot to build the house or restaurants then they start digging and they start building the restaurant but it takes few weeks to finish building it .So when they are hungry or thirsty they could take a break and if they brought some food they could enjoy eating it but then when they are finished eating the food they still have to work more.Then when they are finished building they clean up if it has some dust and they will clean it up.Then an architect comes and checks the building or restaurant if they build it good.We need archeologist so people could live in houses and to have jobs, restaurants markets and they will be happy having a job so they could work and a house where they could live.                 Afterwards,archeologist help people make homes so they could live there.People are very happy having  a great home and a market were they could buy some food to eat at home.Some people dig stuff in the dirt then the archeologist digs and then finds the stuff that were inside there. Archeologist finds those stuff there because they dig there and build new things like restaurants houses apartments or other different kind of stuff.Some times the rocks go under the dirt and some people take it out because they think its fun to do that but it is actually not because then you get yourself dirty.When people remove out the dirt they have to use the wheelbarrow.The archeologist   tools are called pick shovel whisk dustpan knife wheelbarrow skim shovel and the trowel.                    Finally,the archeologist could have a break and they could sleep but first you have to take a shower cause then the blankets could get dirty.Archeologist re very nice because they build stuff that we need like if we need a restaurant they will build one but we don't have to tell them what to do that will put it right away because they know something has to be there so then they will  build it and then hey will have to use the wheelbarrow o they could take out the dirt and put it aide and they will be able to build it.Then when they are building it people will go to the restaurant and eat and they will enjoy there food.                             Archeologist are very hard workers  and some people when they grow up they might want to be an archeologist.They will like it because they build new things for us.Some people like seeing the archeologist work because I think they like how they are building it.Some people walk threw there when they are building a restaurant and then they look at them and see how they drive the cars.Some time when the kids grow up they are going to like there job.

They were trying to find the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown Virginia. Over 200 years people thought that the fort was washed away by a river           The fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from there home town of England for a new life. They thought that Jamestown was by a river so it would be easier to dock ships. They found objects nearby suggesting that the fort was farther away. It was probably for protection from enemy ships.          The first object they found were in 1861. Archeologists found armor and weapons.  they also discover floors of buildings. 100 years later they were trying to find the exact spot were the fort was built. The National park service led 5 years of studying the area to figure out how they used the land. The people used computer mapping software to make the image of the area.         Then they found James Fort. The first thing they found were a set of marks on the ground. They made maps and found out that reached all the way to a river. The ledges were soposed to hold canons. The archeologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten huge buildings all within the fort.         Today the find almost 1 million objects a year. The objects are pottery, tools,coins,and even metal toys for the kids. In 1600's people throw their trash down an unused well or pit. While digging in the area the archaeologists found trash that the settlers threw away including bones of animals that they ate. They uderstand how the people at the fort lived. They know how they fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. also how they survived the difficult years when they had little food.

The project was to uncover secrets of James Fort located in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 year, people thought that the fort had been washed away by river. Some discoveries hinted that it might still exist.                  The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how and when the land was used. The people studying used computer mapping software to make an image of the historical area, so they could picture where this all happened.                      That's when they finally found James Fort! It was amazing! First, they found a set of marks on the ground.those marks showed were the fort's walls used to be. Archeologists knew that the fort would be a triangle due to all the stories they heard, all the drawings they had seen, all the paintings and many more.                  Today, groups find nearly 1 million objects every year! Those objects include pottery, tools, coins and even toys made of metal for children. In the 1600's people used to throw their trash in a unused well or a big pit.                  It is so exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. It gives us a piece of the past, how our ancestors lived and how America started as a very young country.

Like when the archeologists surched for the idems of  George Washington or at Jamestown .        When they look for were they were looking for jamestown they advetouly found it  more too . The acheologists found their first odjects in 1861 . The National Park Service study the area for 5 years to some how find a way how they used the land .The acheolosists found james fort but you can only see where they used to have the walls . Now they had found about 1 million odjects a year .           George Washingtion's surch for odjects that came from his own home the acheologists also had to be very careful to . No one really knew were Washingtion really lived since the bilding was gone .Washington 's house was not their because their had bin a fier their .

Archeologist use all types of tools like:a shovel,pick,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and a trowel.All of these tools are very important to a archeologist, and very useful.                                                                      The shovel is to dig and the pick is to mine deep into the Earths surface and core.The wheelbarrow is to move one artifact to a another,the whisk is to dust or clean off the artifact so the archeologist can make it easier to read or see the artifact.   The skim shovel has a flat edge so it can scrape thin lyres of the soil or Earth to find artifacts close to the Earths surface.   The trowel is the most common tool in archeology it is Also used to scrape,cut,or slice into the Earth or soil, but in different lyres of the Earth.   The knife is used for carful digging around the artifact.

The fort was place were people could start a NEW LIFE AND TO GET OUT OF THE KINGS HARSH WAYS..........TO BE FREE.        The fort was built in 1607 it was built near a river, meany archaeological thought because it was easier to dock ships, they had a big ditch to put there garbage in, the site had lots of burial sites.

First, they use special machines to scan the ground and it will beep when it senses something below it. Then, they use 3-D maps to see what is there. THen, they dig it up,clean it and then study it. They take notes about it and infer whose it is and how it got there. That is the job of  what archeologist do on there job.

In Ferry town archeologists discovered about how george washington lived.     They learned about how he lived and found artifacts about him. For example, the archialigists went to ferry town and dug for stuff, they found a clay pipe because george liked smoking clay pipes,a kitchen,slave quarters, and storage houses.      These are some of the  things they used to dig stuff up with:Trowel, skim shovel, wheelbarrow,a knife,whisk and Duspan,and a pick and shovel.

Thats why we have people called archeoligists. It is there job to dig up things from the past and study and analize it to make sure it is an artifact.        James Fort was created over 100 years ago and archeoligists dug it up already. James Fort was made near a river so when ships came in it would be easier to take supplie to and from the fort.        George Washington was the first president of the united states. A long time ago George lived on something called a ferry farm. Ferry farms have been around for 12,000 years. Long time right, and still they dug up the base of George Washingtons house. Thats why archeoligists are so important they dig up things from a long long time ago.

First you have to find an interseting topic to dig up. You have to have an idea of were the stuff is. You need tools like shovels for digging, a dust pan for brushing dirt off artifacts, a knife for scraping of dirt, a wheelbarrow to move artifacts, and a trowel to cut to see the layers of soil.           You should have at least 3 people make it easy. Once you have that start looking for the place or artifacts. Use a computer to map it out. Once you found the place start to dig. Use the write tools. Be very careful with the artifacts found. Make notes on what you find and tell people. Then put them in a safe place.           This is a job of an archaelogist. You should be one!

The Archeologists found armor and weapons.       The workers wanted to find more things and they also wanted to learn more about  the things. The workers didn't find anything for years. After a couple of years they found more weapons.The Archeologists also thought that digging more was going to make them find more fossils.           People wanted to find fossils so they got their shovels and started working but they didn't find anything they were complaining that they didn't find any fossils one of the mans got mad because they never told them to look for the fossils.

When people think of archeologists, they think of history. But there's a lot more to archeology than history. There's math, science, and manual labor. So be grateful that not only do we have archeology, but also that we have todays modern technology, because without it, we wouldn't have computers, archeology, science, or anything else.   Archeologists have found some famous places like the house of George Washington and the James Fort. They have found lots of artifacts, like George Washnigton's clay pipe, broken pottery, even trash from what people ate! Now I think what would really surprise you is that some stuff that archeologists are hundreds of years old! So archeologists have to be really careful with their artifacts because they are very fragile.   I would like to be an archeologist when I grow up so I can find famous artifacts too! So I sugest that if you want to be a archeologist that you shoul get good grades. If you want to learn more archeology, surf the web and you should see lots about archeology! And that's is my report on archeology and archeologists hopefully you'll be an archeologist when you grow up too!

First of all they get to find a lot of different artifacts and they can also find parts of important history like they did with: Digging Up George Washington, they found his house that he lived in when he was a kid and they found his clay pipe that he used to smoke.       They also found James Mort a place where colonists used to live. They found toys,weapons,armour,and even the colonists old trash which included old animal bones.           I think it would be a super cool job to be an archeoligist.

You may ask way is it hard,well your in luck because I will tell you all about a archeologists. First, you have to have a subject about what you are going to find that has not yet be found. Then you and your team have to set out to were it is located. You start searching to fine objects and dig. You study the objects and then try to relate them to anything that has to do with the subject. And you keep finding instring things. It takes along time to find and dig and study the objects. Sometimes it takes five years to study the area to know how the people back then used it.And you keep doing the samething.       Then you find it! All that hard works pays off. First you find this object then that object,it is pretty hard to be a archeologists,but it is worth all the time and efort to spend on something like that because it is history,and that is how hard it is to be a archeologists.

They have to be extremely careful with ancient relics. Archeologist also use special  tools to use with delicate objects. They use the Whisk and Dustpan for things of that sort. The Knife is not what you might think it used for instead of a weapon its a tool to scrap off the dirt on artifacts.        Now on to the more non-delicate tools. The Pick and Shovel are the tools that start the diging in the site. What ever you get out of the site from the pick and shovel the Wheelbarrow  will come to hand. The Wheelbarrow will help carry dirt and stone to the surface. The skim shovel is use to carefuly take out thin layers of soil. the Trowel is the most common tool of archeology. It is use to srape and cut layers of soil.             With the tools I told you about they have dicoved many things about the world's past whitch i will tell you about. First, They found the fort of the island of death,Jamestown. The fort being 406 years old the archeologist have discovred many things. When finding the fort they found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites, told you the island of death, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. when digging they found bone of animals that the settlers ate and metal toys. then the archeologists found the items the need to so the went on to an other adventure to the wasington residents.        Finding Washington's house was an fantisic find. the frist things they found was the kitchen, slave quarters,  and the storage houses. Years later they found the main Farmhouse. they had to make sure it was George Washington's farm house because there were other people were he lived. finding a clay pipe  gave proof that this is his house because he smoked clay pipes. The archeologist kept digin for mounths and are still finding George Whashington's past.        Thats what I learned on histrey day.

And you have to do certain things like look for the spot it/they were at the time. You will also have to prepare your things  like tools and food finally you leave to your destination.       when you get there you have to use your pick and shovel to hit through rock and shovel it in to the wheelbarrow.be careful when you do this so you don't hit what your digging for.Then you use your trowel to dig through the thinner soil, use your knife to dig around the relics. Finally use the whisk and dustpan to brush off the relics.

Being an archeologist does sound fun though.You could find some pretty cool stuff like dinosaur bones or something like that, and you also use some pretty cool tools.You also get to study them which I think is pretty cool, and when you are out finding and digging stuff up I hope Mother Nature is nice to you.I am sure a little rain would not hurt though.It could even help.           I am sure that with a couple of groups and about 30 people in a group at one spot all at once that could probably get a little tricky.It could probably get a little noisy to.All though the more people there is the more stuff you may find and maybe it would go faster, but maybe something could go wrong with that many people,like you could be holding something valuable and you could bump into someone else holding something and you could both drop the items and they could break and that could really put the pressure on you.            But digging up cool stuff and using cool tools is not just about having fun it is also about learning.Like in the story by the stuff that they dug up at George Washington's house they learned about how they lived in the past and their ways of life.They also learned about what they ate and some of the stuff they did to stay alive.

It can reveal many hidden things. for example everyone thought that Fort James was washed away by a river. But with lots of work archeologists found it! and that just shows how much work they put in. Another thing archeologists found where George Washington lived as a kid. It took them forever buy they never gave up. the first thing they found was the kitchen and then the rest of the house. One thing that helps archeologists is their tools. They use many tools like a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and a trowel. Being a archeologist takes a lot of your time away but you will get to discover many things. overall being a archeologist is a tough job but a great one as well.

Like what different types of things they do in there job.     Archeologist find and research artifacts from the past. Archeologist have to be very careful with artifacts they find because some of the artifacts can be 100's of years old and could be very fragile,or breakable. Archeologist also dig up very big things such as when they digged up the stone base on which they believed was George Washington's home when he was young. Archeologist also use many tools such as the whisk and dustpan which they use to wipe off dirt or dust on a artifact. they would also use a wheelbarrow to carry loads of something, like dirt.     As you can see Archeologist have a pretty cool job, and important job. Without Archeologist this world  would not be as knowledgable as it is today.

Most persons knew George when he was a soldier and a president. George's  father Augustine Washington, wanted to build their house in a land. So people wanted to find out were they used to live. So archeologists belived that the stone base under the house was still there. Acheologists started digging in 2003. It took them a year,but they found it. The first thing tey found was a kitchen,slave quarters and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later.       How do archeologists find all of these things that were in George Washington's house all those yeears ago??           Teams work on a site. The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what's underground.  So the persons know what's actually underground. Another team works on what's really in the underground. Archeologists use skim shovels to remove thin layers of soil. It can take 2 weeks to dig a 25-square-foot. Another group spends timein the lab studiyng objects that are found.       What It Means                   First it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous. 2. It helps historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived.

This is a imformational text we are going to teach you how to find and do when you are an archeoligist.       There are many different tools when you are an archeologist.(here is most of them.)pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and trowel are the most command tools an archeologygist would use when they go and find things.       Many people work together in a group and do different things. Up to 35 people!!!!.The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. Amazing right!!!!. The information is tracked on  a record so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging.Those archeologist start their dig with skim shovels these shovel can cut through small,flat areas they can remove thin layers.         If I where to be ancheologist my favorite tool would be the wisk and dustpan beause I would feel like Velma on one of the episodes of  scooby doo. and it is very light and easy to carry around. It is also very gentle so it doesn't brake anything when you are trying to discovering something.       Many things where discovered like when a group of people found fort James, digging up George washington's past, finding the spot, what it means to dig,and who's involved they are all important.now you know what to do when you are an archeoligist.

In 1994 a group started a dig, a place where archeologist dig, and found thae base of James Fort which was thought to been taken up by a river. Then thay digged even more and found trash pits, floors of houses, eleven cellars, and a storage for cannons. This was an important find you can visit James Fort replica to day.          In 2003 another dig started at Ferry Farm the home of famous General George Washington thay wanted to find if their replica of the farmhouse was correct and it was they also found slave quarters, a kitchen, and other small rooms and that a fire happened at Ferry Farm. Now you can go there and do arts and crafts, get dirty, learn about colonial life and alot of other interesting facts.          These digs have given us a better understanding of how people have lived, eaten, acted, destroyed, saved, and many other elements. Archeologists have helped us understand all of this if it weren't for them life would be different.

Archeologist have a special job. What they do can be difficult they dig up they past. In order to do this job you must always be focused. They have to be focused because if they're not they might miss what they're looking for.                              Archeologist have to study hard to know what they're looking for. If they are looking for   Fort James, they have to do lot of research in order to find it. Find out what it looked like the state or city it was in things like that. This is not a one man job you need some help from other archeologists. it will probably take more than  day maybe a couple months so be prepared.                               Archeologists have a pretty special job you just have to know what your doing.   I'm not that focused but the archeologists are. The research they do help hem find thing and help other people.   If someone asked an archeologist to find something they do research and they go and find it. Or if they want to find something they do the same.                                Archeologist special to their team and other people. I can never stay focused so i cant be an archeologist but maybe you can be one some day. And i hope if you do you have u and be focused and prepared.

The job of an archeologist is an extremely hardworking job.  For example some people, all day long, dig, and dig, and dig using tools like a pickaxe, shovel, and a trowel, but it must be very exciting when you find something like a letter from the signers of the declaraition of independence to the King George III.       The job seems just hardwork but it can b extremely interesting as well.  You can use tools you dont use on an average day, like a skim shovel, a wheelbarrow, a knife, and a pickaxe! If you are a lucky archeologist you may find interesting items. For example Colubus's map when he landed in America, or a piece of Indian pottery.       Sometimes, the really hardwork pays off when something interseting you find goes into a musiem and people can learn from the artifacts you dug up from the dirt.  If you find something like Leonardo da Vinci's plans for a submarine it could benifit mankind for years to come.       The job of an archeologist can be interseting and hardworking, but just like any other job it pays off with education and money too.

They work all day but they find all sorts of great stuff. They could seach in many different  places and find lots of cool stuff.                                       In addtion to them finding cool nicknacks it's also very hard for them to work. It could be very hot and they would be working in such heat. They could get hurt and they would also be in pain.                                     The archogloists would find many amazing things if they work hard and take their time. They know there is alot of stuff out there and they want to find it. An                     archologists will study the things that they found.

Archeologist also have a cool job because I learned that the archeologists use 3d computers that help them track whats underground.

Some archeologists dig up artifacts to learn about people from th past. Some archeologists study what others have dug.       They use computer mapping software to make an image of the area. Each year many teams work on a site. There can be up to 35 people on a site. The first team maps the area using 3D computers. The seond team focuses on the actual digging. They dig using a skim shovels. They can remove thin layers of dirt at a time.        The thin layers of dirt are put in a box with a screen at the bottom so the dirt goes out and the artifacts stay in. Finnaly, they use troveling to brush off dirt from the artifacts.

We get to learn about old stuff that lived thousands of years ago. Archeologists have tools and dig in the ground to find old things that are A biotic or Biotic. They found dinasor bones and they learn about these things so they can tell us about old artifacts.               We read books about old artifacts that authors publish and Archeologists give   them information so they can publish the books we read now. Archeologists find these things so we can know what was going on in the earth before life or humans or even i was born. they give us information so we know what to look out for and know what is going on in the world we live in now.                       people can grow up to be an Archeologist but they need the right supplies to dig. They cant just use a shovel they also need a pic and a shovel of course to dig into the ground and and pic is to soften up the ground or break roots, and they need whisk and dustpan to clean of the artifacts they find, and a knife to carefully dig and scrape dirt from around the artifact, and a wheelbarrow to take things from one place to another, and two more things you need is a kim shovel and a trowel the kim shovel. The trowel is probable the most common tool in archeology. it is used ton scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                          now i told you the supplies you need and what archeologists do there are archeologists all over the world and they are very good at what they do. Someday  archeologists are going to find out that flying monkeys and pigs were living thousands of years ago.

Also archeologist are very helpful by digging up artifacts.             Archeologists use various tools like pick and shovel to dig up artifacts, whisk and dustpan to brush off any dirt from the artifacts. There is also a knife to scrape off dirt from the artifacts and careful digging. there is a wheelbarrow for taking artifacts and dirt. A skim shovel is used for removing thin layers of dirt. And finally a trowel to layers of soil.             Archeologist are very helpful in modern days to let us know what the 1800's were like (and other years ).

Most people thought James Fort was built near the water.But it was really built farther away.It was easier to dock ships that way.The first object was found by a archeologist.Over 100 years later a gruop decided to rebuild James Fort.All because of  archeologist.                      See if it was not for the people we know today as archeologist we would have not found the ship know as James Fort.See all these things they find is apart of  history.With out them no native American things would have been found.With out them dinosaur bones would have not been discovered.

I never did, but when I read about it I thought it was very interesting, and I bet you would think that to.First, lets talk about what are archeologist. Archeologist are people who travel around the world and look for unknown artifacts.When archeologist find something, it can change the past, or tell us more about history. For example, some archeologist found objects where George Washington's(our first general, and president of the United States) family lived. They taught us more about George Washington's past, and found many stuff that George Washington, him self, held. Another example, is about finding Fort James. Unlike the George Washington's story, Fort James actually toke longer. Soon many Archeologist found many valuable things at Fort James.                                               There are many types of tools you would need to be an archeologist. I'm going to tell you what the tools are by saying them in a list that will show the 6 common tools.       Pick and shovel Whisk and Dustpan Knife Wheelbarrow Skim Shovel  Towel                                  A Pick and Shovel are usually the most common   thing anyone can use. If you were an archeologist, you would use   these first if you found a spot to dig. these two tools dig into the earth to find the artifacts. If you get lucky and find an object, you'll notice that it's all dirty and dusty. This is where the whisk and dustpan come to the rescue. They are used to brush the artifact and clean away the sand and dirt. A knife isn't that important, so I'm not going to say a lot about it. The knife is only used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifact. If you have al lot of stuff, then a wheelbarrow is the perfect thing. A wheelbarrow is used for carrying stuff and taking the left over dirt to a different location. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. Although, I said a pick and shovel are the most common thing, its actually the trowel which is the most common tool. it's used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Now that I told you everything I could, I hope you will want learn more about being an archeologist                                   	NNP VBP PRP RB JJR WRB PRP MD VB IN VBG DT NN .

Jamestown was built by a river.For over 200 years people did not know that they were acuely standing on Jamestown.                                 GOERGE WASHINGTON'S PAST          Most of what we know comes from Goerge Washington's life as a soldier and a president.Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped over 90,000 historians know a lot more about Washington's life as a boy.         Washingtonsmoked clay pipes so that was proof that he lived in the house that they found.

Second, sometimes if you even touch the object you can break it. Third, if there is dirt on it, if they touch it to hard they can destroy the artifact. Last, they can drop it and break the artifact. That is what I learned about how hard a archeoligsts work is hard.

The first part was finding James Fort.In 1944 a group of People were interested in studying the past.Starting from Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologist project.They found his things and that belonged to him it was interesting for the people.           This second article is about George Washington's past.We all know George Washington a brave man but this is his past.Digging up the past is about how do archaeologists find all of the things about George Washington's past life.There where 35 people on a team the first team is in a area where they used special computers to that can track what is underground.Archaeologists are close to finding about George Washington's past. When well they find out no one knows they have a lot of evidence about George Washington they wont stop until they find out what happened.           In conclusion there are a lot of archaeologists that found about James Fort and George Washington. But they found about James Fort and the archaeologists are close to George Washington's past. They how done so much work to figure out George Washington's past there tired but the archaeologists well never give up.Until they find George Washington's past they well succeed. they are so close they most have found it and that's what real archaeologists do never give up.

The other tools you'll need are:                                        (1) A pick and a shovel                                         You'll need to dig in to find artifacts.                                          It wont just be lying on the ground.                                             (2) A whisk and dustpan.                                          Some of the most important parts of                                          the artifact may be covered with dirt or sand.                                          Use these to get the dirt and sand off.                                              (3) A knife                                           Usually used for digging a little bit of dirt or sand                                            off of an artifact.                                               (4) Wheelbarrow                                           Can be used for carrying the artifact if can't be carried                                            by hand.                                                (5) Skim Shovel                                             A shovel hat can scoop up a thin layer of dirt, sand, or soil.                                                (6) Trowel                                            This tool can scrap and cut different kind of layers of soil,                                            This tool is the most used tool by archeologists.                     Now that you have you're tools, it's time to find artifacts.But you need to make sure that you are in the right place to find the correct artifact.You'll also need a compass to help you find you're way around the area you're in.Make sure to dug deep enough if it's underground.But just be careful not to dig too deep or you'll reach the Earth's Core.                     Also, you'll need to make sure if you can get back above ground or you'll be in trouble indeed.Now you know you'll have to be prepared for the trip,what tools you need, and what to watch out for.Now if you are ready to find an artifact, just make sure you double check if you have everything you need.

Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes,and woodenpicks to remove dirt.It can take up to two weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section. Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. The discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George was before he became famous. We also began to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.  Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soilder and president. Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood. Thats changing however,discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.

Also you have to work hard to find things. Like when they where finding George Washington's it took a long time to find something. Also when trying to find fort James it took a long time from finding the first artifact to finding the real thing.                          Using the right tool for the job is important because if you're digging something up you and you use a trowel then it's going to take a long time the using a shovel. Also if you're trying to find something but you run into stone then it's harder to break when using a kinfe then a pickaxe.             So being an archeologistis hard. there are a lot of thing you need to do.

Like for example Fort James when a team would find any objects an archeologist would study the item to figure out the lifestyle back then. It is fun to learn about our ancestors that lived long ago. It tells us about a piece of our past about people who lived long ago.          When they first found fort James they found marks where the walls used to be an archeologist would study the marks to learn more about fort James. With the archeologists hard work they figured out the building was shaped like a triangle. Archeologists also found stone ledges over the river to hold canons. The archeologists found many more things at fort James like cellars and buildings.            Today the archeologist group finds about 1 million objects every year. They find things like pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys. While digging they found where they threw their garbage including bones from a animal that they ate. thanks to archeologists we know how the people in fort James lived.              Most of what we know about George Washington's childhood comes from archeologists. They found out that in Georges childhood he lived on the land known as the Ferry Farm George was only six when they moved their.               At the time know one knew exactly where Georges house really was. But archeologists believed that the houses stone base was stile there underground. They started to dig in 2003 and found it in about 2004. The first buildings they found was the kitchens, slave quarters, and storage houses. They also found the main farm house a few years later.                Their were more than one house on the Ferry Farm at the time so they had to find proof that this was George Washington's house. They looked at records of George Washingtons past. They found that he had a fire in his house so they searched for burnt items. they found burnt pottery. They also found part of a clay pipe and records show that George smoked clay pipes. This discovery gives us proof that George Washington did live there.                If all these discoveries weren't made we wouldn't know as much about the past as we know today. Archeologists are very important they take their time to teach us more about are world.

People wanted to start a new life so they built the fort in 1607.People belived that thr fort of james was built by a river but it wasn't.It was easier for sailors to dock there ships there.But the people built a new place that was safer so the enemy ships won't get them.           Then finaly, in 1861archeologists came.They are the people who study objects from the past.Discovering armor and weapons.Also the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later a group found the exact spot where the fort was built in the beging.           They let the  National park sevice led 5 years studing of the area.The people studing used all kind of tenalge.They discovered more and more.       Finally James Fort the frist thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.What would they be lets find out?Its showed wear the old,old walll.Between the stories heard and read.Even maps,drawing. They found stone ledgen.           Today the group finds nearly 1 milllion objects from James Fort.They found tools,pottery,coins,and even metal toys for childern.

I know what your thinking, 'What is an Archeologists?' an Archeologists is a scientist that studies artifacts from the past. An archeologist can discover things you never even knew existed. The first artifacts to be discovered  by an Archeologists were found in 1861. Those artifacts were armor and weapons from a fort called 'Fort James' which was built in 1607.       So far, I learned that archeology groups discover up to 1 million artifacts each year.   In source #3, I found some of the tools that Archeologists use. For example, they used a trowel in 'Digging up George Washington's Past'. A trowel is a tool Archeologists used to scrape and cut to see the diverse layers of soil. Archeologists used trowels in their study of the discovering the past of George Washington. Which was an interesting discovery, in my opinion.       Now, do you think you understand the job of an Archeologist?   If not as a reminder,an Archeologist is someone who discovers things from the early days. In my opinion, archeologists are pretty cool. Aside from finding dinosaur fossils, archeologist can discover cooler things like past president childhoods. I hope you enjoyed the report on the job of an archeologist.                                 	NN PRP MD VB VBG TO PRP DT NN IN DT NNP PRP VBP WP PRP$ NN , JJ VBZ DT NNPS .

I like history and I would like to do the history day at school for the fifth years. Also I think alot of other kids would like to have a history day at our school.           I think the fifth years could learn alot from the history day and they would have fun doing it. I love the idea of a history day for the fifth years because they can get excited for when we present our study. The history day for the fifth years can help them learn about archeologist if they don't know what they are, and if they do know what they are the fifth years can learn more stuff about them.           The reason that I think we should have a history day at our school is because it will keep us busy. Also we can learn alot more than we already know about history and archeologist. I also think the history day would be a good oppertunity for the fifth years.            I think the history day would be fun for the people who enjoy history and archeologist. For the history day I would like to do the project with a partner instad of doing the project on your own. The reason I would like to do it with a partner is because it would be more fun then doing it alone.            I think the fifth years would have alot of fun doing the history day because we can go and see other peoples projects and studys and have alot of fun with it. I think it would be a good experience for the people who like and love history. I would love the oppertunity of doing the history day because i enjoy doing project and history projects.

Archeoligists also have made a 3D computer that can track things that are underground like trains moving people maybe getting by another person our bombs that have been put underground that might explode and other things that might be dangerouse  to a humon.        They also found reaserch about Fort James and how they had to throw away there trash in a well and how they found all the bones of the animals they ate and all of the food they ate all laying there make the well smell bad. They have also found the huts they have slept in and how all of the huts have fell down and weren't standing. The forts were also built in 1607 when settlers came frome England to start a new life a lot of people believed that his fort was built near a river. They thought that because it might have been easier to dock ships there and it made a lot of sense why settlers would have chose there.            They've found out that most people have lived on a place called Ferry Farm for 12,000 years its location makes a perfecr place to build a house.

They discover history for us to enjoy and even study sometimes. Three reasons archeologists jobs are important are, they uncover artifacts, they study history, and they teach us history.              Archeologists jobs are important because they uncover artifacts. Uncovering artifacts is important because, then we know what they used at the time, know what century/year they used it in, and what it is so we can improve today's technology or improve today's modern things.              Archeologists are important because they study history. History is important because, it tells about the past, it tells them about the tragities and the happiness people faced, and history can help us with today's tragities and happiness.              Archeologists jobs are important because they teach us history. Learning history is important because, modern people know about the past, people can teach others about the past, and it can make us smarter people.              Those are three reasons archeologists are important. but archeologists are not the only smart people out there. Archeologists learn more about science and social studies then the advarage person. People should be thankful for archeologists.

They also learn about the past because they could find places where they use live that might learn how they made their houses out of or they might find tools and also learn what its made of.Also they could look around the area and can observe the enviorment.       Another thing what they can do is look for journals or paintings to see how the enviorment has changed over time.Also the archeologists could've used the journals they found for more info.In conclusion,archeologist look for objects that tells us about the past.

They uncover things from our past and are a big part of finding out more about history. They have helped us learn about the Jamestown Colony and George Washington's life. Here are some examples of what archeologists do.        Archeologists go to areas such as the location of Jamestown to find information about the colony. Such as in Source #1, archeologists must first predict where James Fort was located to find proof it still exsisted. Once they used the appropriate software, they eventually found the fort and set off to work.       They learned the fort stretched to the river, found burial sites, cellars, and a few buildings, and also found objects the colony used. Archeologists discovered things such as pottery, tools, and metal toys for the childen. Archeologists found out that colonists threw their trash in a well or pit; they found things such as bones of animals they had eaten. They found many discoveries in the fort.       Another example of how archeologists are important is the discovery of where George Washington lived. As it says in Source #2,it took over a year to find proof of where he lived. Archeologists found the kitchen, slave quarters, storage houses, and eventually the main farmhouse. There was one problem though, about 4 other houses were on Ferry Farm land and the archeologists needed proof that this was Washington's farmhouse. It was said there had been a fire in the house, so archeologists looked in the farmhouse and found part of a clay pipe. Archeologists knew that Washington smoked clay pipes, so they knew had more proof this was the right house.       These are 2 reasons archeologists are important, they discover many things are past and find locations for them to study and find more information about. They help us learn about the past and they deserve a thumbs up.

While they are looking for things they have to use diffrent tools like the pick,shovel, whisk,dustpan.knife.wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and the trowel. One of the artifacts found by archeolagists is a plate that is thought to be from his house.artifacts are inportant cause without them it would be harder to know what life was like back then.               In my opinion Ithink that an archolagists job is hard cause it takes so much time just to dig up a little bit of land. In one of the paragraphs it states that it takes two weeks just to dig up twenty-five feet of land. Wow!archeolagist are an inportant part of helping history uncover.archeolagist are smart ,and hard working people.             Do you ever wonder why archeolagist discover things?They do this cause it helps uncover facts about the pastarcheolagist are important in our schools cause they are some of the reasons we have the information in our books. Thank thearcheolagist for all there hard work. 	NNS VBP VBG NNS , IN NNS PRP VBP TO JJR JJ CC JJ NN RB VB TO VB IN DT NN .

Archeologist are people who study things from the past, they might dig holes and look for valuable objects, for example a dinosaur bone.        Some of the archeologist that I researched were studying James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia.  The fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from England to start a new life in the new Americas.  Some people thought that the fort was built near the river but the archeologist found weapons and armour farther away.        Finally the archeologist found the fort.  The fort had triangle walls that stretched all the way to the river.  There were ten different buildings, lots of burial sites, and cellars.        Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects are pottery tools, metal tools. Because of the archeologist we know that the settlers attacked the Powhatan Indians.  It was exciting for the archeologist to find all the things that the Indians and the settlers used.       Another group of archeologist that I studied researched George Washington's house and looked for valuable things that George Washington used.  They knew it was George's house because the house had a clay pipe in it and he smoked clay pipes.        The different tools that the archeologist use to find objects in George Washington's house are a skim shovel, a throwel, 3D computer, and a half inch screen box. The skim shovel is used for the actual digging.  A throwel is used for digging 25 square foot holes, which can take up to two weeks to finish.  The 3D computer is used for tracking whats underground.  The half inch screen box is used to hold the soil.       Archeologist are important to find important things from our past.

That is part of my report read on if you want to find out about the Washington house and what the archeaogloical found out there.       The archaeologicals have also stuided about are first presedent Gorge Washington,the studies were about his house.No one knew were the house was exactly,but the sciencest thought that there was still some stone base left.In 2003 they started to digg where they thought the house was.They did find some parts of the other houses like the slave quareters, kitchen,and the storage house.The sciencistest had to find more prof that this was their house.They did know that there was a fire in the hous, so the archaeologicsts started to digg around.As they dugg they started to pind pieces of broken pottery.The pottery did give them a little proof that the house was theirs.But the big proof was that they found pieces of an old pipe.The Washingtons did smoke pipe so that gave alot of proof that the house was theirs.That is my two part report on some of the things the archaeologicests studied.

It would all be stuck in the ground if they hadn't dug it up. If you have ever been to a museum you have see all the artifacts that are in the display cases or behind the rope like dinosaur bones. All those artifacts were dug up by a team of archeologists.           The job archeologists do is very important to the history of mankind. If there are no artifacts to show the age of the dinosaurs, Battle of Gettysburg, World War II, World War I, and other important events that happened in history. So in conclution I believe that all archeologists have an amazing job and i would like to be an archeologist when I grow up to be an adult.

'Everyone get your writing books?' she said cherrfully.   Mrs. Callery was always a happy teacher.   I got my book out.   'Use information from your sciences books if you want to?' said Mrs Callery.   I wrote the date my name and chapter down on my paper then started to work...       A archeleogists jobs:       A Archeloegists job is to find objects from the past, that they dont even know about! to prove that dinasoars even lived or proof aliens are real! Anything you want to find out about is pretty much what im saying? I think it would be fun to be a Archeoleogist it would be cool to prove dinasours once lived on our planet today! Or to say 'Hey im going to proove that aliens are real!' To tell everyone about the past of dead presidents and to proove big-foot is real and to find stuff out that people don t know about or maybe dont even have a clue about it. Thats what a Archeoleogist jobs are for they are like scientist we could say we could also call them maybe even 'The proovers!' Sometimes Archeoleogist even find out that the things they have been studing for a couple years are not real. It takes a REALLY long time to get proof that those things were or still are even real. Thats what a   Archeleogist jobs.           I handed in my work and Mrs. Callery looked at me with her blue eyes and smiled.   'Fast writer? haha you were just like me you know?' she saidas she played with her shiny silver bracelet.   I smiled back and walked away.       When I got my paper back it said A+, I smiled and looked at her and it took her about as half a second to realize I was looking at her she smiled and said 'keep up the good work' and she winked.

They dig up the ground to see if there has been signs of human life. Archeologist use certain tools for their job, tools such as a pick and shovel. They use a pick and shovel to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. Another tool they use is whisk and dustpan, which they use to brush dirt off the artifact and to clear away dirt from the excavation site. The other tools are knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and trowel. All those tools have one very important job, they have to carefully clean the dirt off the artifacts with out damaging them. Archeologist get to go to where they suppose some famous place is and start digging to see if they can find anything related to the human life style back then.

I think that because you would have to go to many different places and you would have to carry all of those tools with you. Some of those tools are a Pick and Shovel, a Whisk and Dustpan, a Knife, a Wheelbarrow, a Skim Shovel, and a Trowel. There is also a good side of being archeologist. You can go on adventures,and find new facts about the history. You can also get pain alot of money for discovering new things. If you are a archologist you could be rich and famus around the world. Being would be full of adventure, discoveres, and hard work. To me i think being a archologist will be fun.

Well, those movies are about a college professor who also happens to be an archeologist. He goes on crazy missions looking for lost riches. But no, an archeologist is not someone who goes to exotic places and find secret rooms and burial chambers.          The definition of an archeologist a scientist who studies the past. It's kind of like a historian, except historians read the books about life in the past. As for archeologists, they are there to get dirty. All they want is information about the past. And, to make a difference, people don't sit down. No sir, they get up and make a difference. They do travel to interesting places, but not to relax. Oh no, they are there to discover the past, comparing life now and then.          Some of the things they want to figure out is how people lived back in time, what were some of the daily materials and items they used, their techniques for building, farming, cooking, and other stuff like that. The first step in archeology is not to know who the people they are studying are, but where they lived. For example, the archeologists who wanted to study Jamestown, thought that the area where the colonists from Jamestown lived, had been washed away by a river. But that rumor didn't stop them from investigating. Only a true archeologist would prove it to themselves.          And lucky they decided to prove it to themselves, or archeologists wouldn't have found all the amazing artifacts in the area where people believed Jamestown had once stood. Some of the things they  dug out of the ground include uncovered armor, weapons, floors of buildings, eleven cellars, tons of burial grounds, ten crumbled buildings, pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children! As for George Washington's land where he lived, it did take some time to do, but they did find the Washington's land. They found the kitchen, slave quarters, storage houses, and later on the main farmhouse. Archeologists also have to do research, like when they needed to know if the buildings they found on Washingtons land was their house. So, they found records that showed that the Washingtons had a fire in the house, which mached the burnt pottery they found, and that was proof enough.         Archeologists have to use may different tools to do their job, like a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarow, skim shovel and trowels. It is a slow process, and you must have patience, but in the end of a discovery, you are a hero to be an american, by knowing so much about our countries past. And that, my friend, is the life of a true archeologist.                      	NNP PRP RB VBN DT NNS IN NNP NNP .

Archeologists are people who study objects they have found from the past. Archeologists use a series of tools, such as a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. I hope you enjoy learning all about archeologists!                Archeologists don't only study anchent artifacts, they search for them, too. It takes a pick to dig past stone, it takes a shovel to dig past dirt, it takes a seires of tools just to find one artifact. It could take them 25 weeks to find an artifact. The most common tool used is a trowel. Anchent artifacts could be like Washington's house, or dinosaur bones.              Being an archeologist can be hard work, because more than half the time they have to study. They rarely get to dig for things. If you want to find something cool underground, bring a metal detector to the beach, you're sure to find something there! That would make being an archeologist a little harder, considering they don't use metal detectors.This is what I learned about arceologists.

There was a team looking for George Washington house that he live in when he was kid. The team as 35 people in the team. Archeologists believed that the stone is under the house that was still there. They finally started digging in 2003. Each year they find one  million objects in one year! They finally found it, it took over a year!                                                                                                                                 People  were interested in studying the past started Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project in 1994. The settlers came on 1607 to make new homes.The thing that the Archeologists do is that they find thing about the past! The first Archeologist found a object in 1861!                  They did discovered a floors of building. Over 100 years   later, a big group effort to find the exact spot where the  fort was built began. National Park Service led the five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used in the past!                      The people in the past study the computer mapping software to make an image of the area. They finally found James Fort! The thing that they found is a set of marks on the ground. There are stories about James Fort! The Archeologists knew that the fort  would be shaped like a triangle.                           The Archaeologists made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. Archeologists realized that the stone ledges were built over a river. Now days they find over a million a year.               They find like tools, money, toys. In the 1600s, they use to throw their trash in a well or in a pit. Do you know how the settlers came to american? Well the thing that the settler came to american is the freedom, good food. 	NNP NNP VBP IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD NN VBZ NNP NNP .

An archeologist is a person that loves to study history They look at things that are very old.  Say they are searching about George Washington they want to learn about the things he liked and the things he did not like.  They also have many great tools that they use like a whisk.  They use a whisk for whipping really dirty things.  For example if they found George's brush that he use under the ground it would be really dirty they would whip it of with the whisk.  They use shovels for many things.  They also use a trowel to scrape and cut to view the different layers of the soil.

The fort was built in 1607 when setteler made life.Alot of people belive that james Fort was along river. About 100 years ago people of effort found the exact spot where James fort was.                           The natinal service people had a five year study for the area about how the land was used. The studies of computers softwere making of imagies of areas.Computers do alot for us like seeing were places are and stuff.                    Today we have so many stuff I wouldn't servive in 16's. Back then the toys they had was alway getting broken and now we have electronecs an stuff like that . They had to kill the animal to eat but, we got restrants now. it's crazy how the world changed. It would be cool to see 1600 man come and see how it is now.

They started to dig in 2003.It took almost a year to find the house. First they found the kitchen and storage houses. To prove that it was George's house,they found burnt pottery. Now they know it is Georges house,they can find out more.                                                 Some things they found were smoked clay pipes,and some of the toys George had as a boy.

He or she gets the artifacts and studies them for a long time until they know everything about them.Once they know everything about them, they put them away in a safe place. Then, over the years, more and more archeologist's know more about them.        If an archeologist finds something interesting and they like it, they try to learn as much as they can about it. They search it up and ask other archeologist labs about it. They also work with other archeologists to see if they know anything about it. The others also bring something and share it.         Over the years, many others get to see the wonderful things they have in the lab. Then the whole cycle starts again. 	NNP PRP VB NN DT NN VBZ .

Another reason is because they can teach us more and maybe in the future we can take that evidence and some how connect it to others and find out what the big secret was. The last reason I think that archeologists are important is because they are our number one fact source.        With the exception of, the first reason why I state that archeologists are important is because they will or might work on something that we do not know where it is and is a mystery. The reason archeologists do that is to have a clearer image in their head and also because they might be curious about the evidence that leads to the conclusion. Also archeologists figure out if something is true or not.        In addition to, the second reason that I think that archeologists are very important is because they can help us connect to new evidence by old evidence. That is true because if they have a hard time with some mystery then they usually find other mysteries and somehow connect them. That helps archeologists because they might solve both mysteries in just one problem and figure out what was the main purpose.        The last reason that I think archeologists are important is because they are our number one fact source. Without archeologists we would have fight about everything on social studies because the evidence is always switching around. Also, if there weren't no archeologists to solve the mystery it will always remain that way. Also archeologists find rare items that we might see in drawings or a famous person might talk about.        In conclusion, I state that archeologists are really important because they solve our mysteries and leave us blank. They study things and come up with answers to solve our problems tell us more about a specific subject. And that is how archeologists are really important to this world.

They dig up things and find out important things as well. If we did not have archeologists we would not be able to find out things like history and important things like that that we know today. Recently archeologists found out where Fort James lies. This must have been a great discovery for them! Archeologists found out most of our history. I think that it is great that we them in our world. Some tools that the archeologists use are  the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheel barrow, skim shovel, and the trowel.

In 1994 a group of people started studying the past and they made a project about it. The fort was make in 1607 most settles came from Enland for a new start. James knew that if  he built the fort near a river it would be easyer to dock the ships.       So many people came to Jan fort because they wanted protection and  a great life. Today one million things had been found each year like old potteryand tools and mental toys for childeren,coins. Things are still exciting at the fort and you can go visted it some day you will learn some new things.

When they did there research on the jemes they would put it on a microscope. Then they will look at it and they would get closer and closer until they see something really interesting about it.Then they would do research about the interesting thing until they do not need any more  research on it.Then they would do more research on the jemes.That is what you will do if you become an archeologists.                                 If you want to be an archeologists then you might like it.You get payed alot of money for doing  research.You get to go to alot of places and explore different mimes. I think it sounds fun. You should try it it might be fun.So you should be an archeologists it will be fun.                               This is why you should be an archeologists.First,because you can go to mimes.Next,you get to go to diferent places.Also, because you get to have tools.Last, because you get to drive a company car.                                  This is  why you should have money.First, because you could get food with money. Next, you can get clothes with money.Also,you can get  a house with money.Last, you can buy your dream car.                                             This is why you should have a company car.Firts, because you do want to walk every where you go.Next,because you don't want to drive your on car.Also,because you need it to drive places when you are out of town.Last, because you don't want to get your car dirty.

They use special tools that can help them dig up the treasures berried within the surface of the earth. They use 3D computers to help them find out what is underneath. When they find something they start to dig.        The kind of tools they use are very interesting. One of the tools they use re the knife. The knife is for when they find something that is small but has something sticking to it they use it to scrape or separate the two objects. Also they use a skim shovel to take out little amounts of dirt at a time.         The whole thing overall is a slow process but it is worth the wait. Also you get to learn new things everyday. That is the kind of job I would want. The best thing is is that they have a program that lets you explore with the real professionals. You also become a junior archeologist. That is the job of an archeologest.

We are NOT talking about Indiana Jones. Archeologists do not run from boulders and stop death. Archeologists lives are way more boring then that! But once in a while, people do end up making amazing discovories!       Some archeologists tools are picks and shovels, a pocketknife, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, trowels, and the whisk and dustpan 	NNP IN DT NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN WP NNS VBZ IN DT NNP NNP VBP RB VBG IN NNP NNP NNP VBP RB VBN IN NNS CC VB NNP NNPS VBZ VBP NN RBR VBG RB IN .

I do they are people who study old things that are about 100 years or more.       Archeologists have to be very careful with most of the stuff that they find because it could be antique or very old, others things like old toys and bones from animals that were eaten can be sent to a laboratory so they can see how old they really are.        Archeologists dig around in old abandon towns and places to look for really old things like vases, old pottery, coins, tools, and old toys.       Archeologists sometimes find nearly one million objects a year.              	NNS VBP PRP VB WP DT NN VBZ .

Archeologist (the name for scientists who study objects from the past) found uncovered armor and weapons. Everything that they tell you came in 1994, a long time ago.              Over 100 years later, archeologist (which is scientist) found the fort of James that was built. This sources were found in the 1900 hundreds. Using my thinking skill, I'll think that you can find it in the computer for more information about the country of Jamestown. I think that all the about Jamestown.               The story about 'Digging Up George Washington's Past' tell you about how George Washington's became as a soldier and a president. It all started when Washington was a little kid. He didn't know what to do. People lived there for over 12,000 years.               Using my thinking skill, I'll say that you can find in a book or in the computer. The discovery of Washington is important for many reasons. It gives citizens of the United State of America a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became a president.

They have a very hard job. They can take weeks to discovery very little stuff. There job could get very time consuming or boring. But in the end it is worth it. So let me tell you about it and there job.            First I will talk about how hard there job is. They have a very hard job and they have to go very slowly. It can take weeks so it can get extremely boring because in one whole day you could have only took away some dirt. It also takes a lot of tools like a wheelbarrow,knife,pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,skim shovel,trowel,etc. so it it will also cost a lot of money to do the project and to pay the workers. But in the end it is very interesting to see what you found you pay for everybody because it goes into history and everybody knows more.             You can see how hard the job of an archeologist might be but you can also see how interesting it also might be.

The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.           the first object were found in 1861 Archeologists,the name for scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discoverd the floor of buildings. Over 100 years later, a grope of effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built.

They help out people.  Say like they want to find let say a fossil, yeah they want to find a fossil, so what they do is they bring all their equipment,  and they start digging a whole to find fossils. They would use a whisk and dustpan. to get thin layers of soil off of the fossil.       They would also use a 3D computer to see what is underground or to see if their are still more fossils or any more fossils they have mist to. &lt;- digging up the past. They also have to be very gentle with the fossil or what ever they are looking for. They would use a wheelbarrow to carry the soil or dirt out of the way to. it would tack them month or days just to find one fossil or more their are usually 23 people on the job or more.       After they are all done with the jobs they would look at the fossils or what ever they are trying to find they would dust it off , see how old it is. Tack it to the lab do all kinds of research on it.then after they are all done with what ever they are looking at. They would probably go looking for more.

For 200 years people thought he was washed away in a river but he mite still be around.They tought that because Fort James house was supposly by the river.It made sense why they though that. They found out that his house was further away. The spot were it was really at was safer.

They started to find piceces of the fort .It took over a hunder years to find it .One day they finally found it they found meltl toys  and bones of there food .Some people do not really know about George washington   child hood .Some people lived  on  farm  called ferry farm for over 12,000 years ago.  Did you know GEORGE WASHINGTON  fathers name was AUGUSTINE?No one really knowed were george washington lived maybe it was in WASHINGTON D.C.THEY STARTED in        2003 it almost took over a year but soon after they found it!They found a farm house  a few years later.  Some houses were build on FerryFarm.Some diggers found some potter and guest a FIRE broke out.THE WASHINGTON family had a FIRE in there house    sad isn`t it .Each year workers would take turns  diging on FERRYFARM carefully.ONLY up to 35teams  work each year.  The teams had to use 3D computers that would track whats under ground.INFOR MATION is tracked so the diggers can recroded so they can know were to look before they can start diging.Archeologists dig with a skim shovle . THE soil fills a box half -inch a   screen at the bottom.THEN the dirt falls  while  the artifacts keep inside.THE diggers also use a machien called a troweling.  A  troweling  anarcheologists small  shovle,paint brushes and  wooden picks move dirt from the object . Some times it can take 2 week  to finsh digging  to  dig a  25 -Square foot  section!The other team spends there days in the LAB studying other objects that were found.It takes a long time to finsh but they stell have to do it.  The discovery washingtoning family home is very IMPORTANT  for many reasons.IT gives the citizens of the UNITED STATES it gives them an unstanding chance  of  knowing about GEORGE WASHINGTON History.We ALSO found out why he made decisions he did.IT alos helps historians find out diffrent types of COLONIAL  AMERICANS .THIS is a key to our beloved past.

You will also learn about things they do . Im going to tell you about there teams , How they do things , and the tools they use so if you want to learn about archeologist just keep reading .            First , Im going to tell you about there teams . There can be up to 35 people on a team . The first team maps using 3D computurs that track whats under ground .The information is recored so that people so people will know what it loook like .Another team focuses on the actual digging , the place the team does the digging is called a dig.             Next,Thoses archeologist start there dig with what they call skim shovels. These shovles are so small , flat , and sharp that the can remove thin layers of soil , one at a time . That soil is placed in a box with a high inch screen at the bottom .            Last but not least , Im going to tell you about the tools they use .  Pick and a shovel most digs start with thees to tools . Used to dig into the earth , closes to the artifacts . Whisk and a dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear dir away from the excavation site. Knife used to careful digging and to scrape dirt away from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Trowel peobably the most common tool in archelogy .Used to scpare and cut to veiw the differnt layers of soil.            In conclusion, I think a job as a archeologist is a very hard job to have. But one day i might consider a job as one just to see whats its llike . I have told you there teams , how they do things, and the tools they use and thats it i think . So would you ever consider a job as a archeologist ?? 	NNP VBG TO VB PRP IN DT NNP , VBZ NN PRP VBZ TO NN IN NNS IN DT JJ . PRP MD RB VB IN NNS PRP VBP .

Some archeologists studies they usely study things and try to find them and like if they find someyhing that had belonged to a famous person it could be valuable and they could put it in a museum. And archeologists use many diffrent tools to help them they use a pick and shovel for most digging. They use them to dig  into the earth close to artifacts. Being a archeologists is a hard job to do archeologists use whisk and dustpan to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site.They use a knife to digging and scrape dirt around the artifacts. They use a wheelbarrow to move items back and forth. They a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Archeologists use a trowel to scrape and cut to veiw  different layers of soil a trowel is  the most common tool to archeologists.

Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you a little bit about working as an archeologist. First things first. What is an archeologist?         An archeologist is a person who tries to find artifacts that famous people from the past, like George Washington, used. Then, they study the artifacts to find more information about that person and their life as a child. Archeologists don't work by themselves, they work in groups.These groups are called teams. There are many teams working on one site and can be up to 35 people on a team. Each team works on something different. One team uses 3D computers that can track things underground to map out the area. This way, people know where to start digging. The second group does the actual digging. They use special tools to help them. For example, the skim shovel is a small, flat, sharp shovel which they use to remove thin layers of soil. After, the soil is put in a box with a screen at the bottom so the soil will fall through and the artifacts will stay in. The last team studies the artifacts in a lab for days. It takes a long time to complete the process of digging and studing the objects but helps us understand more about well-known people!         Overall, a job as an archeologist would be tiring but you would also find some cool artifacts from history and learn more about famous people from the past!

For example: A pick is a tool used for digging. You could even use a tool called a whisk. A whisk is like a small brome.there is also somthing called a trowel. A trowel is a common tool they use . It is like a shovel but smaller. The last tool you might not know is called a skim shovel. It is used to scoop out little layers of dirt. Some tools you may know is the shovel, dust pan, knife and the wheelbarrow.   There is two main jobs they can do.......   1. they can go out and dig up history, find ancient artifacts and use cool tools!   2. they can stay in the lab and find out more about the artifacts they find outside underground.   they can do many things that will help use under stand our past.

If so you might want to consider a job as an archeologist. This job presents an opportunity to learn all sorts of things about famous people who came before you.              An archeologist's job is very important. They devote their time to finding out more about the lives and families of famous people that we don't know much about. For example, we knew little about where Gorge Washington grew up, until archeologists excavated the Ferry Farm site. While we knew much about his time as a soldier and president, as well as his life at his family home at Mount Vernon archeologists made it possible to know what he experienced as a child. this is important because his child life influenced many of the important decisions he made.               Another example is the dig site at Fort James. a lot of people thought that it was swept away by the river, but recent discoveries suggest otherwise. A group of devoted archeologists spent many weeks excavating a huge amount of land that led to recent discoveries at the site of Fort James.                     While many people thought that the inner buildings of the fort were close to the river, so it would be easier to dock ships archeologists have discovered that they were located further away for protection from enemy ships. they have also discovered what remains of a stone wall that would have held cannons to ward off intruders.                 These discoveries have made it possible to learn many things about the Fort and the people who lived in it. They couldn't have done it without their tools, though. To give you a better idea of what the archeologists would have used to ,make these important discoveries here is a run down of the tools for you.                  They would start with a skim shovel to take off the thin levels of to soil, and to locate the artifacts that were left close to the surface. Then they would use regular shovels to pick up dirt to drop into a half inch screen, that let the dirt fall out, but left the artifacts in. Next they would load the dirt into a wheelbarrow to be moved to a different site to be examined for any small artifacts that slipped through holes in the screen.  someone will then bring the artifacts to a lab where groups of scientists will spend weeks looking over them, and figuring out what they mean. They then use trowels to cut soil samples to be examined by soil scientists. There are many other tools, but these are the main ones. They have to be so careful digging that it can take over two weeks to clear a twenty-five foot section!                  Now that you know about the many trials and rewards that make up the job of an archeologist, think about it. We should really be thankful that there are people out there that are devoted enough to take time away from their families to make the important discoveries that they do. Do you think that you have the diligence to become one? 	NNS VBP NNP PRP RB VBN WP PRP VBD IN TO VB JJ RB .

The life of an archeologist is hard and interesting too! Long hours, lots of digging and searching for where these places are.  Sometimes it takes more than a year or two to find the place, such as Fort James. They had to dig underground to find where it was! Usually, it is totally worth it. Finding new things about different people and places. Like their childhood, history, lives, learn how they became famous, what decisions they made, what type of life they had, and much, much more.            One of there projects was Finding Fort James. For more than 200 years, everyone thought that it had been washed away by some river near by. Some say, there are some discoveries in the area said it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607. That was when English settlers came to start a new life. The first objects that were found was in 1861. They uncovered armor and weapons. Then, they found what they were looking for.......the floors of the buildings. Over about 100 years later, a group was trying to find the exact spot where the fort was first built and where it began!                The National Park Service helped construct a five year study of the area to find how all of the land was used and what could be built on it. They did this because they wanted proof that the fort was still here. People who helped with the study used special computer mapping software to make images of the area, maybe sort of like an X-ray. They finally found it! They found cellars to burial sites to buildings and much, much, more! Today, the group has found and dug up more than 1 million objects each year! They found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for kids!            One of the other projects they did was the past on Ferry Farm. Ferry Farm has been known for over 12,000 years. People have lived on Ferry Farm but do you know the most famous person that lived there?  Well, it was George Washington himself. He moved there with his family when he was six years old. No one knows exactly where they lived because the house is long gone. Archeologists think it is still there. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year , but of course they found it. They first found kitchens, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then, they finally found the main farmhouse a couple years later.            There were at least four other houses that were built on that land, so they needed to find the proof that this was George Washington's House for sure. The records showed that they had a fire in that house. What did they find? Burnt pottery! They also found a part of a clay pipe! Washington smoked clay pipes. After that, they knew that this was their house and there was a fire in the house.            How do you think the archeologists find this stuff in Washington's house? Well, it was a careful one. you could tell they were a pretty rich family from all the pottery and expensive stuff. They had several groups. The groups consists of 35 people at least on every team. One team maps the area using 3D computers that tracks what is underground. This is helpful so that the diggers know where to dig for the object and what it looks like.            Another team does the digging part. They are called the dig. They use a lot of tools. Let me describe them for you.   Pick and Shovel-Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Whisk and Dustpan-Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knife-Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow-Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel-A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Trowel-Probable the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Citation: Information from passage Tools Used by Archeologists                This helps us learn about our founding fathers and just pain old famous people and things. These are all part of Americas Past. We learn more about our history as a nation.            I would like and not like to be an archeologist.       Yes-I would like to because it would be fun to learn about our past and how it came to be the United States of America. To learn more about the people who helped the America be America, to be one Union not two. It would help to teach and learn more about our past, America's Past. No-I wouldn't like to be an archeologist because I can't stand to be somewhere at one time the whole time I need to move around. I like to be active and have that would be fun but it is too long to be there everday. It would also be a huge commitment, long hours, lots of digging, and searching. I guess just too much for me.            My conclusion is that an archeologists work is hard work, lots of digging, long hours, and searching too. All hard work but still it is fun and usually worth it! You find amazing things to learn about. Childhoods, family members, how wealthy they were, where they lived, history and much, much more. You will also find more artifacts, life, and history than you would in a book! Everything you find tells a story a house, pottery, clay pipes, are all artifacts that will tell a story about that person or place. It is an amazing job to have! You can also see more artifacts in museums because most artifacts are in cultural museums or history museums. You can find them anywhere!

They will be interested in it because they will think its interesting to find things from the past. Finding stuff of George Washington can be exiting. You can find things of his of when he was a soldier or president. His house was burned down and you can find any old picures of his family.             I think of George Washington from long ago. He was a solier and presidant when he was younger. He has alot of stuff archeologist could find at his house. Archeologist use lots of tools for searching for artifacts. They use a pick and shovel because they start of the earth, close to the artifacts.                 I think that a archeologists job must be hard. They have to cary alot of tools to find 1 million artifacts a year. They ues whisk and dustpan, they use it to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the exavation site. Also, they use a knike for digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. A wheelbarrow is for moving iteams from one place to another or to cary dirt away from the exacavation.                  There are plenty more tools. I would someday try to be an archeologist and find stuff of George Washington from his house. I will have a collection of his stuff.

The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came.They tough that James fort was built next to the river. The first objects were found in 1861.Later archeologist the  name for scientists who study objects from the past.Archeologist also discover the floors of the buildings.Over 100 years later, a group found the exact spot where the fort was built.                      That's when they finally  found James Fort.The things they found was a set of marks on the ground.The archeologists knew that the fort would be shape like a triangle.They made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to a river.

They use Picks, Shovels, Whisks, dustpans, Knives, Wheelbarrows, Skim Shovels, and a Trowel. There can be up to thirty-five people on a team.                The first team can map the area by using 3D computers that people can track whats under ground. The information is recorded so that people will know what the item looks like before the archeologists start digging.               Another team has to focus on the actual digging, and the place were the team does the digging is called a Dig. The archeologists start to dig with a skim shovel. Skim shovels are so flat, small, and sharp that they can only remove thin layers of soil. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the soil fall out while the the artifacts stay in.                 The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove soil. It can take up to, two weeks to dig a twenty-five square foot section! The next team spends days and days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome.                     And that's the job of an Archeologist.

An archeologiest is a person who's job is an archeology. When you are an archologiest you try to find objects in the ground and see what they mean and what they are. There are teams in archology, each team has at least 35 people in it. One group you have to walk around with a detecer and try to find metal objects and other objects underground. An other group digs down in the ground and that team is called 'A Dig'. And the last group stays in the lab and cleans the objects off. It takes at least 2 weeks to make a 25square foot hole. When some archeoloiests found James Fort and they found 1 million objects a year. When they dig they dif with a small shovel and it digs a layer of sand they are very sharp. And thats Archeology.

People like to go find history like artifacts like clay pots and other stuff all archeoligist do is dig they use spusific tools .like pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skimshovel and a trowel so my dream is to be an archeoligist and hope some day that dream will come true to me and other people.                                Archeoligist are so cool and if you want to find a job as aarcheoligist go online and type jobs to be archeoligist.but you have to do good in school and colledge so you could be stuff like that .                                    You have to do really good in school so  you could get trained to be an archeoligist remember you have to use alot of tools.                                My conclusion is that people should be archeoligist and should do good in college  so you could get a job like that. 	DT NN IN DT NN CC WRB NNS VBN IN NN IN JJR IN CD NNS .

I shall explain what the job of an archeologist is like.  This will include how they find an area and what they find in the area that they plan to dig up.  It will also explain how they dig up an area and tools that they use.           Before the archeologists start excavating, they need to plan out and map the area they plan to dig up.  Using 3D computers, they can track what is underground.  This helps them see what the area was like before they started digging.  They try to make sure what they're going to excavate is still there by researching the area, but they still may not find what they wanted to find.  After this is done, they have to fly, drive, or sail to that area to begin the excavating process.           Once they are at the site, they begin to remove dirt by the process of troweling or using skim shovels to remove small pieces of dirt.  The work is very slow.  Once some objects are found they  brush dirt off them by using a whisk and dustbin.  Then, workers place them in a wheelbarrow to move them to another place. When the objects arrive, they are carefully studied for days.           Some things archeologists find may not mean much, such as a pair of broken scissors.  Some objects could help us learn more about someone or something.  If the object is a dinosaur bone it could help us discover a new species of dinosaur.   If they uncovered a brick in the desert, it could have been the brick from a pyramid.  Objects found from a famous person could change they way we look at him/her.           The job of an archeologist is a job in which you will sometimes not find what you are looking for.  You cannot let your hopes get too high, or you may be disappointed when you do not find want you wanted to.  It is also a rewarding job, considering what you find is an important object in history.  It is a job that can go either way, and can be disappointing and rewarding.  Overall, the job requires lots of patience, accuracy, and skill.

Archeologist use a pick and a shovel. Most digs start with these two tools. These are used to dig into the Earth to find things. They also use whisk and dustpan. This is used for brushing dirt off of artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.Third we have the knife this is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts. forth we have the wheelbarrow. This is used by moving items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Fifth we have the skim shovel. This is shovel has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last we have the towel. This is probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                    To find things from George Washington past you need to have courage in what you want to do. They also find and sell to get money to either buy new equipment or spend it on other things. Who knows maybe you have something in your house that archeologists found. archeologists are more then just finding thing but they find out about peoples past,how they lived,and where they lived. There are many things that archeologists do.                    You need to have a lot of energy if you want to be a archeologist because you work for a long time. It won't be easy either because your boss will make you work really hard. It will be fun though because when you find something you are going to be happy. You also need good grades because you do a lot of math. You also cant be bad when you were young because they can go on any of your accounts and see what you have said.  So don't be bad and you will probably will get the job.                     If I were a archeologist I would want to look at the artifacts to make sure they are good to sell and not bad. Also I would want to find the artifacts and keep some of them. That is what I want to do when I grow up and what archeologist do. 	WP VBP NNS NNP .

An archeologist has many tools to help on finding the artifacts. Some tools include pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. These tools help an archeologist to find a special artifact and each one has a job of its own. An archeologist is a person who study's the past while finding evidence and artifacts from history. How does an archeologist does all of this work in the sun and still do the work nice and carefully? An archeologist is a person who loves to study the past and would do ANYTHING to discover something new story(from the history of course). An archeologist travels to different places and to new different things and study's about them. Any place that has history to search has an archeologist. An archeologist has a exciting, dirty, and fun job. They have an exclusive job at what they do. I would really like to be an archeologist someday because an archeologist has a job very important to the history.             Days Of Work       Everything an archeologist does, takes about 2 weeks straight without stopping! How fun is it to stay out in the sun and do work?  Not really! But to an archeologist, it is! Many archeologist study's Native Americans and how they lived then. Some archeologist study's people who was famous and died. Then, there is more archeologists who study's more than 1,000 years ago!!! An archeologist has a job that most smart kids wish they were them. Studying the past covers things like a misunderstanding of the past. So if whom shall say that a captain sunk his ship and hit a hard rock because he misread his compass just to get home to his gal Jesse Bell and marry her, but instead some one took an iron nail and put it in the back of the compass to be able for someone to misread it. So an archeologist study's all of those things just to clear up the past which some people is perplexed about.       Days of  Work         A job of an archeologist is finding artifacts about the history and proving his/her point. In the article of Digging Up George Washington's History , they have to find the spot that they will find the artifacts and they start digging. They have to make sure that the spot is the correct spot to dig up the artifacts or they will get everything in a mixed up order and won't get the information that they need. So when the archeologist finds the right place and then they start getting their group of people and they start digging . That is why the job of an archeologist is very important to the history. See, an archeologist finds the artifacts for a reason not just for fun.  They do it for a  cause of the history's misunderstandings or a new story in the history. Like, Finding Fort James, They do the research and they have to be interested in finding the fort James not just they because they do it for money.   ~ Tiffany Dang       Vocabulary   Perplexed- it means to be really confused about something   Archeologist- Someone who digs up facts from the past   Artifacts- Any evidence to prove to an archeologist that it is the real thing from the past   Research- To find information about something   Misread- something that is not been read clearly or read too fast to read clearly understand it.   Important- Something Special to something or someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP NNP POS NNP NNP NN VBZ DT RB JJ NN TO RB VB DT NNP NNP NN VBZ JJ NNS TO VB IN NN DT NNP NNP NNS VBP NN CC NN , NN CC NN , NN , NN , NN NN , CC NNP NNP NNS VB DT NN TO VB DT JJ NN CC DT CD VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN WP NN POS DT JJ NN NN NN CC NNS IN NNP NNP VBZ DT NN VBZ DT IN DT NN IN DT NN CC RB VBP DT NN NN CC RB .

These sources are and will be talking about history and how and what Archaeologists work. One thing Archaeologist are studying is George Washington like they went to George  Washington house and find stuff that George as a child and adult might have used or did use and they study it. Another way is they might find books and magazines to say what they say then studies what they found and what the magazines and books said. And last they might have studied what might have happened in the house and what they know happened there like if it said something different on a T.V and they studied the house but they studied something different then they would use like an instrument it is called.   People would be interested to finding artifacts because if you like social studies you will learn and know more about who you are studying which is better because you will be able to learn more and will be more apt to want to learn a lot about them. If I had to think of a famous person that lived long long long time ago i would chose King Tut and an artifact i would want to learn more about is one his tomb Two his lightweight char-tic and lastly his crown he wore and actually one more thing the pyramid he was in and who else was in the pyramid with him.   I think being an archeologist  would be kind of interesting but not at the same time. It would be interesting because you learn history you may have not known before and you learn history from the past like how they grew up what they did when they grew up and how they grew up. Using these tools to find out what happened during the times of  famous people It would be hard but not but with the technology we have today i think we could  make some kind of technology that would make it much easier to make archeologists be quicker at it. These are my gigantic, glistening, enormous, awesome, Ideas.

It was designed to discover secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed  away   by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England   to start anew life.   Most believed that James Fort was built near a river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would   choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers   more protection from enemy ships. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeoligists, the name for scientist who study objects   frome the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort   to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.       The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would   help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.The people doingthe study used computer mapping software to make   an image of the area.Thats when they finally found James Fort!

Archeologist use many tools.Another team focuses on the actual digging,and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.Those archheologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels.These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom.This lets the  dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in The diggers also use a process called troweling.Teoweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, anh wooden picks to remove dirt.

Also I think it would be cool to see where he lived as he grew up in and what house he grew up in too. Also to find all this stuff about historical people you need to have the prpoer tools, so you dont  brake smoething or scarder stuff around and then becomes a complete puzzle to figure out and that would be very hard or could make it possibly harder.       You should use these six things at lease:       pick and shovel Whisk and dustpand Knife Wheelbarrow Skim Shovel Towel   These are all very important stuff to use when your digging up history such as Goerge Washington.           If I was an arecheologists would be very hard but you could make a lot of money doing it becuase if you found something you could do two things with it that I know for sure, you can sell it and make a lot of money doing it, or you can give it to the museum and put your name on it so people know that you found . I do think it woud be pretty cool to do that kind of stuff and see how things were like back a long time ago about 100 years ago at lease. And not to just find things about Gorege Washington but other things and people. For example finding dinosaur bones or other famous people that lived long ago.       This is what i learned about arecheologisits that find things so we can learn about all this new stuff that we didn't know before!!!!!!!!!!!

No one really knows about Georges childhood but George lived on land with many other people the name of the land he and the other people were living on was called Ferry Farm over 12,000 years people have live on .It makes a perfect place to put a house on  so Georges father moved his family there when he was only 6 years old.There were at least 4 other houses on Ferry Farm land so archeologists  had to have proof  that it was his farm house .Their clues were burnt pottery and a clay pipe the only reason  those were clues because the Washington house burned down  and George smoked clay pipes.

They job is a little hard because of all the diging its worth it when they find treasure.        The first thing a archologist has to is find out where it actually is. Then once they find where they might think it is they start digging. But they cant dig witha bulldozerthey have dig with a little shovle so they don't crack the pieces.        Then once they get the dirt they have to put in a stainer to get all the dirt out and make sure they didn't miss nothing.         After they do that then get the whisk and start getting the dirt,rust,mold,and other stuff then they have to figure out what it is then they move it then wash and there done.

Next, they put everthing into a box. Finally they carry it to their house and study it.

Today I   going to tell you how an archeologist work or study. First I only know somethings about archeologist.  I hope you enjoy and learn some facts and their main job.       Did you ever wanted to be a archeologist? Well you have to know the basics to able to be an archeolo-   gist. One thing archeologist does is first they learn what their guy or women their learning about like Leonardo da Vinci or George Washington and so on so. You can even learned about dinosaurs but that will be called a Meteorologist. After you learned whoever you learned for a while you have to figure what artifacts that were buried for ages, years, decades, or century's.                             After you study about that thing or person you to go to the internet to search to know what artifacts are buried. If you look at source 1 it will tell you how the group of people finding the secrets of Fort James, meaning it tells you how they found the artifacts. If you keep studying you will probably be ready for the next step of being an archeologist. If you are ready for the next step it is about location where to dig and getting the artifacts.       Looking for the artifacts is a bit hard because you need some people to help you dig the artifacts. If you   look in the source 3 it will tell you how to dig, teaching you what materials or things to use to help you dig the artifacts or unburied the artifacts. These materials are picks and shovels, whisk, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrows, and others. After you found your artifacts you have to be careful and use a toothpick to take off the dirt in or on the artifacts.       Congratulation if you find a artifact, and if you didn't still congratulation it takes years to master to be   an archeologist. I hope you learned somethings about a job of an archeologist. I hope who ever reads this has hopes of being an archeologist and if they do I wish you good luck in your future. Thank You!!

They didn't know James Fort was there at this point.But, they new that it would help them desiced were to look on the land  for information . The workers used lots of equment to make a picture of the land.                  When they fainlly found the fort, they were happy as could be.  The first they found in that area was special marks ib the dirt.Today groups are still looking in this area for things ythat are now worth some money . Eatch year people find a total of around one million things. People have found coins, toys ,animals they ate back then, trash, and more.                       some things people use to do this stuff is pick, shovle, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shouvle, and a few more things. Finding history like that would be so much fun . You would be able to see a lot of things you would never think of seeing. All the information that sientest get helps us learn more about famous people and things that left valuabe stuff behind.                                                                What did they do with the trash ?????????           All the nasty garbage went into a huge well or pin in the ground. How nasty is that ? Not at all to them they were use to the smell and sight . So how would you like to see that every day and live back then ? I know i would hate it and i think you would to .So be happy we have garbages to day. There was a unlucky person who fuond that trash pit .

They also discovered where people would dump their trash ( In the well ).                  Archeologists don't just find artifacts, if their lucky they can also find gold, diamonds, riches. From people like Egypt's dead Pharohs or Black Beard. Archeologists use lots of tools to find different things and artifacts, but in the passage it says that the most common tool is the trowel. It is used to scrape and cut, to view the different layers of soil.                  Archeologists give people the gift of a better understanding more things from more people. They also give us the understanding of why people made these choices. Or why people stand as our leaders, helpers, or our heros. they help us while we learn about them.

Argeologist is very interesting because you can find something the world doesn't know. They use many tools to do this job. In this report there are details about finding Fort James and digging up George Washington's past.                           In 1964, many people wanted to find Fort James in Virginia. Some people thought it was washed away by a river. The fort was built by a England settler in 1607. THe first object found was uncovered armor in 1861. The people who study for Fort James used a computer mapping softwar to make a image of the area. Finaly they found it.                        Most people know George Washington when he was the  president and as a soldier. Many people wanted to know about George Washington's past. Argeologist found out that George Washington's father moved his family to Ferry Farm. George was six years old at the time. No one knew exactly where George's house was. Archeologist believed that they could find. They started digging in 2003. The next year they found it.                         During the time arceologists use a pickaxe and a shovel to dig down. They also used a wheelbarrow to move items to carry dirt to excavation.                         It takes time for an arceologist to find something, but if they work together they can succeed. They used many objects and elctronics to find Fort James and digging up George's past.

The life of an archologist is hard, there is alot of hard work and detication. If you wnat to be an archeologist you would need to know alot about history to know what you want to find.                  Archeologists need to study hard. When you dig up holes in the ground you need to be strong and healthy, beacause if you are not strong and healthy you wont be able to dig at least a 25-foot hole. Eating healthy and working out is a good way to say in shape for the life of an archeologist.                 When you dig up hole you will find all sorts of different things like gold, diamonds, treasure, and many other different things, but first you have to us a 3D computers that track what is udergroud and what you want to find. Then you start the hard work, digging  to dig you need special tools like a pick axe, a shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. When you find the place you want to dig acheologists call it the 'dig'. The whole dig can take up to two weeks. After you find everything that seems interesting things that you found you take it to the lab where another team studies it and try to find the history about it.                  If you find the life of an archeologist intersting then I think you should try  it, and remember the life of an archeologist can be exciting!

Next,the people that dig come and do the aactual.The place that they are aactually digging is called a dig.The archaeologists then start digging with a shovel called a skim shovel.The shovels dig slowly but surely.The shovels are so small,flat and sharp they can move a thin layer of soil.Then they place it on a box that lets the dirt fall out and lets the artifacts stay in.       After that they get the artifact and trowel it.Troweling is when you get a small shovel ,a wooden pick and a paint brush to dust of the dirt.The other teams spend a lot of time in the lab.They study the artifacts that come to them from the other team.I think studying artifacts and digging them up would be a good adventure and it would be fun.digging up old and lost things would be very awsome!

Archeologist have many steps to do when they dig to find artifacts.         Archeologists don't just dig at any random place.  They look for a place that a famous person or an old place that used to have people lived on.          First, one them of archeologists use a 3D computer that lets you see what is underground so they do not break anything with the shovel.          Then another team focuses on digging. they first start there dig with a thin shovel.  Then they put the dirt on an object that takes the dirt out and keeps the artifacts behind.           Finally another team is in a lab studing the artifacts that were found in the ground. They can also try to find and fix the old artifacts if they find all the pieces.          This process takes hard work and energy. This can take up to more that two weeks! The process is slow but at least they find many items.

James was a good man.I think he is a great man because i have heard of him that he was kind and helpful.Were the archeologists study about him it was like if he had a great childhood.They even named a town after him wich is called Jamestown.james fort was build in 1607.The archeologists found some objects nearby James fort was located.So then they found James fort and first there were marks to endicite were the walls just to be before it got buried.The scientist know that the fort was shape as a triangle.They made stuff and found stuff to help them what happen and were was James fort.Thats all i have to say about James.             Everybody knows how George Washington is but if you don't know who he is then i think you should read my passege.He was a president,a realy kind men, and some other things but I know that he will help his people.Im going to be talking about his past and how he was.George Washington had a good time in his childhood.The scientists diged up some stuff the belong to George Washington and they unburied Washington's house and their were some pipes and they know that washington used pipes so the scientitsit know that the was Washingtons house.Will thats all I have to say about Washington.

Do you know the main reason why i want  to do all this and like all this well it s because i can get to learn a huge amount of stuff  like for example i might have a question about martin Luther king Jr like what was his child hood like and like since his house got burned  i can go to were his house was at and start searching for stuff about his childhood .                 So what do you think about this  would you like to be an archeologist to me i would but i really don't know about you so you decide if you do or you don't even though it sounds fun it might be a lot of work but still fun                ive learned what kind of tools archeoligists use a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dust pan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and last but not least a trowel wouldnt you like to use these tools to try to looke for stuff that you may want to find i would if i were you but i still do learnig envestigating and etc wouldnt that be fun for you.

In 1861 arceologists discovered the floors and buildings and weapons and fort and that was over a 1000 years ago.but people were the ones that made colonies and had war because they came to are land. so we had war a lot of people died in the first war but more people wanted to fight for are land but the more wars we have the more people died then we will not have peoplein the hole world.

To begin with is jamesfort the archoligst took a very long time to james fort because.People thought that it was washed away by a river but it wasnt.   The archoligst thout that the fort was triangle shaped and it was then in 1861 the first archoligst found.Armor and weapons 100 years later more items were found.They actually found the spot were the fort was and that the fort was close to a river o they could dock ships.                                   They also found cannons and cellars and dozens of  burial sites and ten buidings  within the border nearly every year they find 1million things.Now there are knew discoveries like the metal toys children played with.In 1600 they would throw away there trash usally i a well or a big pit.                                                   last they found there techniks in doing when they had little food and they found out powhatan tribe attaked them very often.                           In conclusion here that was a archoligst job and to what they did and how they found artifacts from a very long time ago.                                                                                     Now we move to george washington our beloved president.                                      To begin with is the archoligst again whe all know he was a soldier and a president.There has recent discoveris at his childhood home.So it has helped them learn an know more about george.              People had lived on a land known as ferry farm for 12,000 years and it wasnt suprising why georges father Augustine washingtonmoved there and george was only 6 at the time.                               No one really new where he lived however archoligst belived that that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging 2003 it took a year but they finally found it.T he first buildings they found were the kitchens and the slaves quarters and the main farm house a year few years later.At least four other house were built on the ferry land so the diggers needed more proof that this was georges house.                                                        The records show that there was a fire in the house because they found burned pottery they also found is clay pipe that he smoked out of.How did they find this things all those years ago. they would have teams most would be 35people in one team.they would use a shovel called a skim shovel witch wouldnt take alot of dirt out.They would put dirt ina box and keep the artifacts in it. they would use shovels brushes and wooden picks to remove dirt.          It would take two weeks two dig 25 square foot section another team would be in the lab to study the artifacts.the discovery of his home is very important to us first it gives another thing is that its helps historians learn about the life of colonial people like george washington.Allthese things are key parts to unlock the mysteries of george washington.So if yuo want to got there is a camp to sighn up for.       in conclusion that was the life of george washington and how they found artifacts about him.

Look for the minerals that hasn't been found. Look for rusty dinosaur fossils.                      Archeologists always need tools. Grab a pickaxe/shovel to hit the hard things.Use a whisk and a dustpan to shake the dust off. Use a wheelbarrow to carry hard and heavy stuff! Use a trowel to scrape the views of the layers.         Archeologists always look for old stuff for kids little and above. That's why they put old stuff in museums. Archeologists must know where to search. Archeologists that search in the desert for fossils can search anywhere! Mining is anywhere as well too.        Archeologists can find fossils using a whisks and a dustpan.

They also travel around the world to searching for artifacts from people who live long ago. They also uncoverd armor and weapons   from the people who lived long ago. The people who study int he computers they use computer mapping to make an image of the area.   Thats when they finally found James Fort. The first thing they found was markers the markers showed where the forts wall use to be.   Today the group finds at least 1millon objects each year the objects   include pottery tools and even metal toys for children. The first building they found was a kitchen filled with slave quarters and   storage. They found the main farm house a few year later from   when the found the kitchen. At least four other houses have been built   on the Ferry Farm land so the diggers need to find proof to show that this was George Washingtons farm house.

You ues one of these things to dig into the earth, also gets close to the    artifact. Next is the whisk and dustpan you used to bruch dirt off the artifactand clear away dirt from the excavation site.Another is a knife you used for careful digging.And to scrape dirt from around the artifact. Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one placeto another or to carry dirt way from the excavation site.            Skim Shovel a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.   Trowel probably the most common tool in archlogy .Used to scrape and cut to view the different layer of soil       that is the life of an archeologist.

Archeologists are people who help us discover about the past and how people in colonial America lived. Archeologists find all this information by digging in places where former presidents have lived etc. What is exactly an archeologists? Archeologists are people who spend time digging and finding old pottery, armor, weapons, tools they used to make things. Archeologists, for me are very important people because they give us a chance of seeing are world's history and culture. Being an archeologist is very painful but it is worth it because you have to spend a lot of time digging and digging until you finally find something. Then you have to clean it until all the dirt is off, if the artifact is broken you have to spend time gluing the pieces down.              First, an archeologist gigs up the artifacts and when they find the artifact they have to clean it with a tool called a whisk. You have to be a patient person to be an archeologist because it can take years to find one thing. If you are not a patient person you would want to get a different job.              I am going to list all of the tools an archeologist uses to do their job, archeologists use a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel are used to dig into the Earth, close to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the exavation site. The knife is used fo careful digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt from the excavation site. The skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology, it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.               If I were to be an archeologist i would like to find artifacts of King Tut because long, long, long time ago he once rulled Egypt and back then in Egypt kings were not called kings they were called Pharoes. I would to find all his jewery, his crown from when he was pharoh, pottery that he made, and some clothing that he wore.               I think people would like to be interested in being an archeologist because you will have the chance to dig up the life of a well-known person or you could find some things of what they made.               I think the job of an archeologist is exciting and not exciting at the same time. I think that it is exciting because you get to dig up the past and be one of the first ones to see the artifact. I think it is not exciting because sometimes you end up with nothing and you are digging in the hot sun you you get tired really fast.               I just talked about the job of an archeologist and how they work, but I also added my opinion about archeology. Archeologists are very important people because they dig up artifacts that no one has ever seen in their entire life. For example: people dug up artifacts of George Washington and some archeologists found some artifacts of James Fort. 	NNP PRP VB WP NNS VBP .

What exactly is an archeologist? Well an archeologist is a person who spends there time in search of digging up artifacts from the past whether it is old pottery pieces, armor, weapons, tools, coins, or metal toys for children.                                                                                                                 You can't expect pottery from thousands of years ago to be in one whole piece, so if an archeologist is lucky enough to find all the pieces from pottery they most likely will spend their time gluing all the pieces together to discover more of what type of pottery people in the past made. Being an archeologist requires a lot of time and patience because you might not always find what you are looking for right away.                 How do archeologists find artifacts from the past? Well, each year many teams will work on a site where they're trying to find information. There can be up to 35 people on a team! One of the teams maps out the site using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The team that is digging can use the map that the 3D computers show so that they can know what it looks like underground before they start digging. The area the digging team does the digging is called a dig. The archeologists in this group start their dig by using Skim Shovels. That soil that they scoop up is then placed in a box with a half screen at the bottom. The half screen lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling which is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. Another team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts that were found. It takes a lot of people working together to discover our worlds past.                Archeologists use many tools to discover all these artifacts. As I mentioned earlier the group that does the digging uses a skim shovel. A skim shovel has a flat edge that is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soilwith each scoop. Another tool that the archeologists use is a pick and shovel which is a tool that most digs start with. The pick and shovel is used to dig into the earth, close to the objects. There are many tools that are used to brush away the dirt off of an artifact. One of those tools is a whisk and a dustpan. A whisk and a dustpan can also be used to clear away dirt from the excavation center. A knife also can be used to scrape away the dirt around an artifact. A knife can also be used for careful digging. A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another, but can also be used like the whisk and dustpan to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The most common tool and archeologist uses is a trowel. A trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of the soil. Archeologists use many tools to make their job a whole lot easier and accurate.                  Archeologists jobs are long, tiresome, and hard. It can take up to 2 weeks to dig a 25 square foot section. All those weeks add up when you are digging up a large space. It's definitely true that it takes time to actual dig up and discover the objects but to add on top of that, the time that it will take to study the objects, find out what they mean, and use other bits of information to tie in to the object that they had found. Archeologists must take their time and have patience to truly discover, enjoy, and appreciate what they have found.                 It is important, meaningful, and exciting for us to discover about our worlds past, and it's hard to do that without any kind of proof. These artifacts that our archeologists find show us the objects that were regularly used by people many years ago. All the artifacts in museums had to be discovered one way or another and they were dug up by archeologists! These artifacts give us a piece of our past and ties us to the the people who lived back then. These artifacts give us a better understanding of the United States past. The job of an archeologist is super important! We get to learn why a certain person made a certain decision from the objects they left behind. Without archeologists we wouldn't know any of this information and would be clueless. I hope you now understand why an archeologist's job is so significant! What would we do without our archeologists?

I'm going to tell you   about good things and not so good things of being an Archeologists.                       Being an Archeologist can be so much fun!! Archeologists can learn new things of humans that lived long ago. They use lots of tools to find artifacts to predict things that might happen that nobody didn't  know about. An Archeologist found lots of things about George Washington's childhood such as burnt potteries, part of a clay pipe and other things. It would be so interesting to be an Archeologist because you can explore new things that occur in the world.                   Being an Archeologist sometimes wont be easy. Archeologists might have so much stress and anxiety. Archeologists can hurt your self for putting so much pressure of finding things. Ssome of the tools they use wont be that much help because it can take a month to find just 3 things. If  I had to choose one thing to not like of being an Archeologist is having stress of finding something.        In conclusion, being an Archeologist is hard and fun at the same time. If you want to be an Archeologist follow your dreams don't let the bad things come in your way. For me i think its so fun and so interesting to learn about famous humans.

For over 200 years, people thought the he had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that he might be still around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life . Most people thought James fort was built near the river. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They discovered floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group of effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.   The National Park Service led 5yrs stjudy of the area to figure out how land was used. The people doing the study used computer mmapping software to make an image of the area. Thats when they finally found James fort. The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. the marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Today, the group  finds nearly 1million objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.

The first objects found were in 1861 near where they thought fort James was.the archeologists found armor, weapons and the floors to buildings. the national park service led a 5 year study of the area and that is how they finally found fort James.the first thing found was markings on the ground.then they found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites and ten buildings within the border of fort James.              No one ever really knew where George Washington's house was but archeologists started digging in 2003.it took over a year but they finally found it.they found a burnt piece of pottery and a clay pipe.studies show that the Washington's had a fire in their house and George used to smoke clay pipes.                        The discovery of Washington's home is very important for many reasons.first,it gives people of the u.s. a better understanding of what Washington's life was like when he was a child.it also lets us know why he made the choices he did and what decisions he made in his life.                    The archeology of fort James and Washington's house is very important and tells us Americans how the man who helped get us freedom did that and what his childhood was like.we now know much more about the brave and strong, George Washington.

An archeoligist is someone who wants to find stuff from someone popular or famous although they have to be dead if not then  that would be considerd stealling. And the person has to of been gone for a while like Benjamin franklin or George whashington not someone like michale jackson.  archeoligists dont just take there stuff and put in their house the get the stuff and reasearch it and do work on it. a big thing about archeoligists they only find stuff in the ground the cant just go to elvis presleys house and take his toilet.       an archeoligist also are interested in finding things such as dionasour bones and much more.               An archeoligist use wheel barrels because they probaly have a lot of artifacts like bones and animals and who knows what ells they find.       moving on archeoligists worked on fort mason a lot they discoverd where the walls used to be and found out a lot about fort james.       today the group finds nearly one million objects every year some objects are potery, tools,coins, even metal toys that children play with. archeoligists also find a lot of trash because sometimes the trash will go into the ground and form a big pit.           the archeologists think its exiting to find objects that were regulary used by the people that lived hundreds of years ago. they say it gives them a piece of that persons past and that is really cool.                   so in conclusion an archeologist is a really cool person who finds other peoples stuff under ground that lived a long time ago.

An archeologist has to take their time working or they could mess up and ruin the fossils or the items they dig up it is not always fossils like they found part of George Washington past house. There a lot of steps an archeologist has to do.         First thing an archeologist has to do is look for the fossil. They way they find the fossils is by looking into the history of what they are trying to find so when they find where the information is. Once they find that information of where they parts may be they start to track the area with a 3D computer that helps them see underground so the can look for the parts of a historical area or fossils. They record the information so they know how big or small, and how they part or fossils will look like before they they start digging. If the part or fossils is really big they will have more than one archeologists digging for it so it does not take a long time. The the part or fossils is very small there only needs to be one archeologist looking for it because it wont take a long time to dig it up. The archeologist has to be very careful and take their time digging or they might miss the part or hit it and break it.         Once the archeologist know where the part or fossils is and know its size he/she will start digging. They have to use many materials to dig up the parts or fossils. They first material they will use is the skim shovels. The skim shovels are very small, flat, and sharp that they can only remove thin layers of soil one layer at a time. Once they remove all the soil with they skim shovels they put the soil in in a box that has an half-inch screen at the bottom, this screen allows the dirt to fall out while the artifacts stay in. They could also use another process of digging called troweling. Troweling is when the archeologists use small shoves, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove the dirt of the artifacts.         Since the archaeologist have found they artifacts and the labs have studied they could put them on display at museums for everybody to look at. They could make a building where kids could dig up their own artifacts while the archeologists teach them how like they with they Ferry Farm. They could do many thing to get everybody involved  in the artifacts.         In conclusion, they job of an archeologists is hard and takes a long time but when they find the artifact in the end it is all worth it. I think many people should get involved in digging up our history's past.

Well archeologists do mostly history. Archeologists started in 1944. Archeologists have three jobs they track the items the miners are going to get, then they mine, and they study the objects the miners find.             First, the team of archeologists tracks down what the miners are looking for. They do this on a 3D computer. They keep it on what they are looking for so the miners get an idea where the item there looking for is. To conclude, this team of archeologists starts the work by showing the miners where the piece of american history is..             Next, comes the second team of archeologists the miners. They do the mining by looking at the 3D computer to find out what they are searching and where it is. Then, they go looking for it and when they find it the just mine it out. They start mining by using a skim shovel. The skim shovels are small, flat, and sharp so they can remove the thin layers of soil one at a time. Then the archeologists use a process called trowling where they they will use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the last layer of dirt. To conclude, these archeologists minewith different tools and find the american history pieces.              Last, the third or last team comes in to see what the miners found. They study the objects and try to find out what the miners have found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. These type of miners must be patient for it's a long process.To conclude, these miners must have studied lots of hisory to find what the miners could have found.              Those are the three hardworking and tiresome archeologists job. To conclude, all teams of archeologists work really hard to discover new american history for us to learn about.

We have been asked to give information on different jobs for people that are interested in history.       There are lots of jobs for people that are interested in history like archeologists, historians and much more. I think it would be fun to be one of these because I could uncover stuff like bones, bodies, and secrets. But even though it sounds fun it is still dangerous because there could be traps from back then.       Archeologists use many tools like a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel all these tools are used to uncover artifacts that go in museums and other places that store these items.even though there is more they use I can't tell yuo all of them because I dont know them all.       That is why being and archeologist is very hard and takes a little skill but not allot. It would be fun, dangerous and maybe scary for some people but it just sound fun to me which is why I might become an archeologist when I am older!

Archeologists find some objects from the ground, and study about them. They need to be careful and take a time while they are working. They use a lot of equipments, too. Since they study about old things, they can know many things about past.        Archeologists dig the ground to discover objects. The process of digging requires hard working because it is really a difficult work. They even needed more than a year to find Washington home. They have found many things from the ground. For example, they've found a part of building, and pieces of pottery.        Archeologists use a lot of equipments to discover objects. They use 3D computers that can track what is underground, and they record the information so that people sill know what it looked like before. And, they remove thin layers of soil with small, flat and sharp skim shovels. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen, and this lets the dirt fallout while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling, and it is when archeologists use some tools to remove dirt. Also, archeologists study the objects that are found.        The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it is worth it because we can know about past. For example, the trash that settlers threw away help us understand how the people lived. We can know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. Discovering objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago is exciting. And, it gives us a piece of our past, too.        In conclusion, archeologists find objects from the ground by digging it with many equipments, study about them, and learn a lot about past. Archeologists are really helpful in our life, and they are necessary for us. 	VBG IN NNP NNP PRP RB VBN IN WP VBZ DT NN .

Or you can also research about archeologist on the internet or you can study more than you need to. and by that i mean study alot than you want to its always good to study evrytime you have a test beacause more  knowledge is good  for your education before college you can also read or get a book about archeologist. And thats my advice to study and to learn for a test or a history day exam.

I think that   archeologists have a cool job even though it must be tiring and impatient. They dig up lots of cool and ancient artifacts such as fossils, rocks, ?????????????and many other things that are helpful to find out what happened a long time go.       To be a successful archeologist,  you must be very patient. you need to patient because it will probably   take a long time for archeologists to find any artifacts. If an archeologist was not patient that person would most likely give up when they wouldn't be able to find any artifacts. Even though archeologists must be very patient, they are able to find many artifacts.       Archeologists also uses many tools to help them find items. Usually, archeologists start with a pic and   a shovel. Then, when they find an artifact, they then use a whisk and dustpan to brush off dirt and dust off artifacts. Then when they are done they get a wheel barrow so they can move the items to another place. Also, the most common item is a trowel. Trowels are used so archeologists can scrape can see different layers of soil.       As you can see, archeologists are interesting jobs and even though you must be patient, you are always   rewarded by finding artifacts.

An archeologist is a person that digs up the past and finds different, old artifacts.              Did you know that the first object found by an archeologist was in 1861? The word archeologist means scientists who study objects from the past.             Archeologists find many things in the past. Some things that archeologists find are armor, weapons, floors and buildings from old famous houses, and many more. We want to know about archeologists because it is very interesting.             Archeologists do their job in a unique way. Usually you are in an office or working for someone at their house or something else, but archeologists work outside and spend their whole entire work time digging or finding out things about the past and sometimes on an adventure to see why an artifact is still there or solving a mystery like that.              All in all, Archeologists have a very fun job and i hope your desire is to be and archeologist!                     	NNS VBP PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NN .

They go out and dig for hours a day to find new discoveries of how life was a ling time ago. From colonial times to dinosaurs.     Have you ever asked yourself, how do archeologists do their job? Well archeologist have to do many things to discover anything. There are different teams that do different things in the process of finding artifacts. on team digs around in the dirt to fin the artifacts. Another team scans the area with 3-D computers to see if there is anything under the surface . There is also a team that stays at the lab and studies these artifacts. It is a lot of hard work to do a job like this, archeologist need all the help they can get. THere can even  be 35 people on one team.      Argeoligist have to use specific tools to do their job. The tools that they use are; picks, shovels, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Archeologists use a shovel and a pick to dig some of the dirt to get closer to the artifact. Archeologists use a whisk and a dust pan to brush of some dirt covering the artifact or to see the artifact more clearly. They use a knife by carefully scraping the dirt from around the artifact. To use a wheelbarrow in a excavate you put the artifacts or excess dirt inside of it. Skim shovels are used to carefully remove a very thin layer of dirt with every scoop. Finally a trowel, probably the most frequently used tool, is used to  scrape/cut different layers of soil than the argeoligist studies the soil.     As you can see the process of digging up artifacts is a long and tiresome process. And it also takes a lot of carefulness. This  report was about the amazing process of archeology.

For instance, what does an archeologist usally do. You should also research about the history of archeologists. Some tools they use are picks and shovels, those are used to dig in the dirt. There are also other tools to use like whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skimshovels, and trowels. There are also a lot of things to do when you are an archeologist.

A wheelbarrow is used to move one item from one place to another or to carry the dirt away so it won't get in your way. A skim shovel is used by the flat edge used to remove the thin layer of soil. A trowel is the most common tool it is used to scrape and cut different layers of soil.

One group used 3D computers to look under ground.        The second group did the digging with skim shovels. That was called trowling. The site was called a dig. Then they place the dirt in a box with a half-inch screen. That way the dirt can fall out out, but the artifacts stay in.        The third group spends days in the lab studing the objects that are found.   Also, Archeologists use tools like a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.

Paleontologists use this two tools to dig up fossils of extinct dinosaurs. People like construction workers use those tools to break something or to dig into something.       The whisk and the dustpan are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts and to clear dirt from them.Housemaids use those tools to clean or to do some dusting around the house. More people use these two tools often around everywhere.       The knife is used to digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The knife is also used around the house to cut food or to cut ropes to make them even. Hitchhikers use the knife to cut rope or to cut something for them to eat.       The wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Construction workers us the wheelbarrow to move something for support or for heavy stuff to they can't lifted up. Most of us use it to carry stuff around to move something to a place.

After this you will know this job is harder than it looks.    An archeologists job is hard because, to be an archeologist you have to active. You have to be active because, you have to dig and clean artifacts. Also this job is hard because, you have to go different places. You have to go to different places because you have to be at certain places to have certain artifacts.    When you are a child you think that be an archeologist is just finding old 'stuff' well, it's not. Finding artifacts is finding pieces of the past putting the past puzzle pieces together. It is also finding out about what happened in the past we haven't already known.    As you can see, being an archeologist is hard work. So please give archeologist more credit for doing this for us.

So they made a project called Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was formed to find the secerts of James Fort in Jamestown Virginia. For over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area had hinted that it might still be around.            The Fort was built in 1607. The settelers came to England to start a new life. Some people thought that James Fort was built near a river. The first oblects were found in 1861. Archaeologists the name for sciancetists who study objects from the past, undiscovered armor, weapons, and the floor of buildings. Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a 5 year study to find out how the land was used.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.             Thats when they finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of markes on the ground the marks showed where the walls used to be they knew that the fort was shaped like a tringal. Altoget her the group has found nearly 1 million objects from the fort.

Most people think history is boring, but I like it its my favorite subject.  Archeologists study things like dinosaurs, plants, bones, and pottery. This is a great way to learn about history. Some study our presidents past and colonial life back from the 1800's.           You can learn about your ancestors. They use special tools like pickaxe, skim shovel, and a whisk.  Archeologists, mostly study bones from animals and humans from the past. Sometimes it takes two weeks or more to dig a twenty five square foot area that's long! They've dug up some of Fort James and Washington's child hood home!             Archeologist's have to take many history classes just to be who they are. It may take a year just to dig up twenty artifacts or less. I wouldn't choose this path if you don't like history, but I do. It took three years to dig up artifacts from Washington's home. Finding Washington's home was important for many reasons.              They also led a five year expedition trying to find James Fort. No one Knew where Washington's home was. The first buildings found was the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage room. They also found burnt pottery and piece of a clay pipe. On a archeologist team there can be up to thirty five people!

Like George Washington's house because what we know about Washington is about his life when he was a solider and a president.He lived on a Ferry Farm witch is a good place to have a house on.No one new exactly where he lived because their was four other people who lived around there.        They started digging in 2003. It took over one year to find house things. the first thing they found was the kitchen, slave court, and storage houses.When they were digging they used these tools, pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel.

I have recently learned that much of what we know about people and cultures from long ago is brought to us through archeologists.  An archeologist is a person who studies artifacts from the past.        An archeologist must first recover the artifacts before deciding the artifacts intended use.  The archeologists go to a place they believe is of historical significance and begin what they call a 'dig.'  This process of bringing artifacts to the surface is a long, labor some job, but must be done slowly to preserve as many artifacts as possible.        During a dig, archeologists us various tools, which help them discover these artifacts.  I thought it was rather interesting that archeologists are the ones responsible for bringing us information on people and places of our past.  One person who I remember archeologists talking about is George Washington.           I think that archeologists are very important people when it comes to 'digging up' our past.

I had a sleep over and all my friends came over. we went outside and played we did all kinds of fun things.             We went camping and swam. For my birthday I got really cool things and i got to see my family.              I went up to saint louis to see my niese, sister, and step brother.

Many people will work in the site. They map out the area using computers that find things in the ground. They use that information before they start digging.        The other people dig. They dig at an area called a dig. They use skim shovels that are so sharp they can remove layers of dirt at a time.        The people use a process called troweling. This is when they use equipment to remove dirt from the artifacts. It can take two weeks to do a 25 square foot area. This whole thing is tiresome.        The discovery Washington's home is important. It helps understand things about George Washington. It also helps understand the decisions he made.        Kids can get involved in this. They run classroom and outside activities. Kids can sign up for games, crafts, and classes.        Digging in the dirt can give you more that dirty jeans. The people at Ferry Farm are bringing the country's first president in ways we have never seen.               	WRB VBP JJ NN NNS WDT VBN TO VB IN NNP POS NN NNS IN .

They started Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was created to find the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. Many investigations in that place hinted that it can still be around. Over 200 years, people were thinking that the fort was washed away by a river.               The fort was constructed in 1607 when people went from England to here. They did that so they can launch a new life. Many people believed that James Fort was built by the river. It was more simple to put ships there. So it had made sense that they would want to pick that spot. Things that  were found close by suggested that the fort was more far away. The new place probably went to give the people several more protection from bad ships.                                                                                                                                                 The objects that were found first were discovered in 1861. Archeologists found out about the floors of constructing. Past 100 years, a team effort to discover the same place where the fort  constructed had began. They were the Archeologists.                 They had finally found James when people were doing the study used computer searching software to make an image of the area. The object that they found first was a bunch of marks on the floor. The marks had showed where the fort's walls had been before. During all the stories that had been heard and read, and pictures they they had constructed, the archeologists found out that  the fort would look like a triangle. They constructed maps and discovered that the fort expanded all the way to the lake. Then the learned there were rock ledges constructed  past the lake. The ledges were created to hold things. The archeologists had also discovered eleven cellars, 12 of burial sites, and ten buildings within all the borden of the fort.                I have learned many things about archeologists. Archeologists are wonderful scientists. They are very smart and intellagent. I am very glad that I learned many things about them. I had realized that they can do many things. In concluson, I am so happy that I learned about them.

I'm also talking about people who dig in the ground. It may sound like a boring job but just wait until you her what they do.            They search for artifacts that could help them know more about the person. Like for example they are searching for anything that can help them find out more about George Washington right now. Something could be a piece pottery. That might help them find out something more about George Washington.            For tools they use pick axes , shovels , wheelbarrows , knifes , and a whisk and dustpan. Shovels and pick axes are used to get into the ground , so to start in that site. They also use a whisk and dustpan to get the dirt off of items. They also have a wheelbarrow to move dirt out of the site , or a heavy item. The last item they talk about is a knife. They use it for careful digging and to scrap dirt from around an artifact.            So I hope you learned alot from my report on archeologists and maybe want to be an archeologist when you grow up.             	NNS VBP PRP RB VBN IN DT NN CC WP PRP VBP .

They go out into dangerous places dig up artifacts and then they study them. Some tools archeologists use are pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. These tools help them in a lot of ways for example a whisk and dustpan clear dirt off the artifact so they can study it study it.                   A archeologists job is more than just digging things up they have to map the place, find the dig site, discover artifacts, and then share it with the world. When do their job their job it is not take a couple of minutes unlike digging in your backyard it takes weeks sometimes months that is how hard they work.           Archeologist has to be to careful when they work because if one artifact breaks that could be it for the whole thing. that is why they have a lot of patience and take their time. This is not a job where you rush to finish your job.                These archeologists do alot of great things and we should thank them because without them we would not know a lot of good stuff.

You would never get board with this job. You get to dig all day long. Also you get to discover things from famous peoples life.Last you get to work with really cool tools.          First, of all you have to dig , dig, and dig.With this job you either stay outside and dig or you stay outstide and study some things. I am here to talk about the diging part. These are the steps:first you find the perfect spot to dig. second you use a shovel thats really thin and sharp to just get up thin layers of dirt so you don't mess up any artifacts. third you carefully carry the extra dirt off the site with a wheelbarrow.fourth you bring the artifacts back to the lab for the other workers to study them.          Second, you get to discover things from famous peoples lifes. Some of those people might be like George Washington or other presidents! Archeologists recently did a search for things from George Washingtons childhood. They knew were to look because his house had burned down when he was a kid and the found some burnt pottery.After they knew they had found the right spot they started digging for the underground part of the house. It took over a year but they finaly found it! Turns out that they found a kitchen,slave quarters,and some storage houses!          Last,you get to work with some cool tools.Some of those cool tools are a wheelbarrow,knife,trowel, and a pick.The wheelbarrow is used to carry extra dirt off the site.The knife is used for careful digging and to remove some of the dried dirt of the artifacts.The trowel is the most common tool it is used to scrape or cut to see the different layers of soil.Last the pick is used to dig in close to artifacts in the earth.          As you can see being a Archeologist is a pretty amazing job. You get to dig all day long. Discover artifacts from famous peoples life.Last you get to work with really cool tools.So go be a Archeologist when you grow up!

There is three things that are most important of  being an archeologist these are the dig, the tools, and the job.                       The dig is very important because it's basically everything. First the archeologist has to find a place and why he's going to dig there once it took a group archeologist one year to find what they where looking for! Archeologist then dig and work for years to uncover whatever they're digging for. They also have to remove the dirt from the object by using a knife or a whisk.               The tools that a archeologist are awesome! They use a shovel to dig up the area it would be very hard for an archeologist not to have a shovel. They use a whisk and dustpan or a knife to remove all the dirt from the object the object would be very dirty if they didn't do this. Also they use a wheelbarrow to carry the objects and to carry dirt from the site.            The job of an archeologist is hard and boring but fun at the same time. An archeologist usually have to wait a few years to find an object. At the same time when they do find an object it's awesome to learn more about the history of it! An archeologist has to dig a lot but that's not all they have to do they have map out the area using a 3D computer and take the objects to a lab to study.             Now that you have read about arechologist maybe youll want to be one. I s ure do! I have tought you about the long dig, the tools they use, and the job.

Fort James was a Rediscovery Archaeological. For over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settler came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near a river. They found lots of marks on the ground. They had found Fort James.           George Washington       People have lived on land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefor it's not a surprising that George Washington father Augustine Washington moved his family there. George was only six. No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone. At least four other houseshave been built.           That is why you need to now what to look for and if you don't dig in the right spot that they tell you. You would just be looking for nothing  about it so that is why you need to be trained.

They have to find things from a long time ago...usually in the ground or above ground, like in famous history like George Washington, or Abarham Lincoln's house.           They also find bone like from dinosourses or ancient creatures that once were on the earth.  Archeoligists help us learn new stuff or that was on the earth.  They have already found many things. Like if someone where to travel to a museum, you would probally see some things that Archeoligists have found.         Archeoligist are just like scienctist.  They Both find amazing things on the earth.  Some Archeoligist believe that there once was dinosours and creactures we never seen before on earth.         Archeologist need tools to find these amazing creatures.  Some of them use a Pick and Shovel they use these to dig into the earth to find artifacts.  Another one is knife its used for careful digging and to scrap dirt from the artifact. They also use a 'skim shovel.'  Thats a flat edged shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt with each scoope.  And last a 'Trowel' porbably the most ocmmon tool in archeology.  Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.         George Washing the first presedent of the United States.  He was a wise and civil man.  He lead us through the mighty battles with the British, but no one knew exactly where he lived.  However, archeoligist believed that the stone base under the house was still there.  They started digging in 2003.  It took over a year, but they finally found it!           Washington's home was acually very important for many reasons.  First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understading of who George Washington was                                         	NNS VBP DT RB JJ NNP NNP VBP TO VB NNS IN DT JJ NN RB : RB IN DT NN CC IN NN , IN IN JJ NN IN NNP NNP , CC NNP NNP POS NNP NNP RB VBP NN IN IN NNS CC JJ NNS WDT RB VBD IN DT NNP NNP NN PRP VB JJ NN CC IN VBD IN DT NNP NNP VBP RB VBN JJ NNP NNP IN NN WRB TO VB TO DT NN , PRP MD RB VB DT NNS WDT VBZ VBP NNP NNP VBP RB IN NNP NNP NNP VBP VBG NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNP VBP IN EX RB VBD NNS CC NNS PRP RB VBN IN IN NNP NNP VBP NNS TO VB DT VBG NNP NNP IN PRP VBP DT NNP CC NNP PRP VBP DT TO VB IN DT JJ TO VB NNP NNP CD VBZ NN PRP$ VBN IN JJ NN CC TO VB NN IN DT NNP NNP RB VBP DT JJ NNP '' NNPS DT JJ JJ NN TO RB VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NNP CC JJ DT JJ '' RB DT RBS JJ NN IN NNP NNP TO VB CC VB TO VB DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNP NNP DT JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN CC NN NNP NNP NN PRP IN DT NN NNS IN DT JJ , CC DT NN VBD RB WRB PRP NNP NNP , NN VBD IN DT NN NN IN DT NN VBD RB NNP NNP VBD VBG IN CD PRP VBD RP DT NN , CC PRP RB VBD PRP .

They also donate the artifacts to famous museums.                   There other job is to survive.  Since the area could have indian traps. That area could also have deadly animals or old trap that haven't went off or disabled.  there also could be deadly diseses in the area. There could be posinis spiders,musqutoes, and animals with rabies.                          Finally, the have to be couses with the artifacts. They could be poisend.  they aslo could be cursed.  also they could be so brittle that when the second you touch it it will break.  they also could have a gardian that protecs it.

Sometimes they find cool things and sometimes they don't.                    Archeologist use a lot of cool tools like:      Pick and Shovel    Whisk and Dustpan     Knife     Wheelbarrow     Skim Shovel      Trowel                 Archeologists find things in the past because we won't to now more about them. And so we can find things out and what it would be like back then so me can image things back also like putting our shoes in there shoes.                 I think it would be fun to be an Archeologist because you can find things and you would all the created for finding it. But it might not because it would take a long time to get what ever you digging out and you would be just sitting there all day plus it could get really cold or hot so, you have to be ready for the weather!But you would find cool things at the same time and you would get a very exciting moment every time you find something!                 Sometimes they find very old things!It give the state better understanding of this people too.   I think they a very fun job!But it might get boring it still is fun!                In the sources I learned about Finding Fort James and Digging up George Washington's Past.   They were very interesting to learn about. They found George Washington's house and what they used as a kid. I learned that there house was burned down and they thought they knew how. In the other one they found the fort and were it was.

The job of an archeologist is a very important job that helps the whole world learn about important people and helps people understand them more.People can find important landmarks that hold noble history,Or history that's horrible like where the Boston Massacre happened.But people have found places with important history such as Fort James or one of Washington's old houses                    Archeologists are like hero's helping the world understand the past and very important historical places.Archeologists are very special people that devote their lives to helping us understand and to learn the magical world of knowledge of history.I don't want to be a archeologist but I would be proud to be one if i did.So the past is great and I will tell you about it when they found Fort James they found out stuff hat they never knew about that nobody knew about actually well this is why the job of an Archeologist is important.

Most people beleived that the James Fort was near the river and it was easier to dock the ships there so it made the settlers choose that spot. Also the new spot protected the settlers from enemy ships and it was founded in 1861. That is when they finally founded James Fort and they found it by sets of marks.        People had lived on a land that is Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years and the  location makes it a good spot to build a home. Also no one knows exactly where George washington's housewas located. Then the Archeologists believes that the stone base that was under the house was still there. They started digging and searching for the stone base in 2003 it took over a year but they finally founded it.       They also found the main farmhouse a few years later and the scientest need to find proof if it is George Washington's farmhouse. The diggers also found the pieces of burnt potterys so they think that the Washington's had a fire place. The diggers also found parts ofa clay pipe while they were digging for proof. They also knew that George smoked clay so their discovery gives more proof  that this was the right house.

Archeologists was finding out things a long time ago.The archeologists found things that was in washington house.The archeologists use tools and knifes,wheelbarrow,skim shovel,trowel,pick,and shovels to find things. They use that to dig up things and find things.              When the archeologists was finding out about James Fort the first things the archeologists found was uncover armor and weapons.The archeologists also discovered the flooors of building.They used computers mapping software to make an image of the area. Thats when they finally found James fort. They found a set of markers on the ground.  The markers showed where the forts walls used to be.             The archeologists made maps and found where out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. The archeologists had saw that  there were stone ledges built over the river. The saw that the ledges were made to hold the canons. The archeologists found eleven cellers , dozen of burial site, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. Today they nearly found 1million objects each year.               The objects they included pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for the children. 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While the archeologists was digging in the area they found the trash the settlers threw away including the bones of animals they ate. The information learned from these objects helpes us understand how the people in the James Fort lived. They know how the settlers fought the powhatan tribe that often attacked them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The past of George Washingtons the archeologists  found all the things they found was in Washingtons house.  The archeologists was digging up things at the ferry farm. The 3d group was the group that track things underground. The information was recorded so that people will know what it look like befor people start digging. The other team focused on the actual digging and the place the team does teh digging is called a dig.

They use many different tools such as,Pick and shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, A knife, Wheelbarrows, Skim shovels, And Trowels. But to get to work an arheologist needs to know what their looking for. Like, facts about Abraham Lincoln, Elvis Presley's guitar, or anything else that can tell us about the past.                First,(after they know what they want to find)they have to find a place to look for the item.To do this they use computer mapping software to make an image of the area. From that image archeologists can find clues such as marks,debris etc. After they find the area, they send in teams of 10-35 people. to use computers to find artifacts underground, and to dig out the area to find the mapped items. Finally, they use the artifact to tell them more about history.

The group was called the Jamestown Rediscovery Arcaeological Project. The fort was built in 1607 when the English settlers arrived in North America to start a new life. The fort was originally built near the river. They decided to move to a new spot where they'd have more protection from enemies and their ships. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists (the name for scientists who study objects from the past) found all kinds of things.

You have to try and try as i'm guessing i don't think archeologists ever give up until they find what they want, if i were to be an archeologists i will never give up until i find what i am looking for. As a little girl i will still try my hardest to find what i am looking for.                   An archeologists job is very important and very intresting because they get to learn about things from the past like dinosaurs and other types of animals. If i were to be an archeologists i would love to learn about the past, my favorite subject is american history it may be hard and boring but i love it. The only reason i love it is because you get to learn about presidents and other people like louis and clark i also love to learn about presidents lifes when they were in their childhood. An archeologists job is great they will get a lot of money for discovering things from the past like dinosaur bones and all that kind of stuff, they will also get to learn a olt about world history and they will get the chance to touch bones and other types of stuff. I am not trying to lie but maybe one day i would love to be an archeologists, maybe someday you would too, you may not like to learn things about the past, but when you actually get the chance to learn about it i will geranty you that you will love it.                 A person who is an archeologists must be greatful of being an archeologists because they get to learn alot about the past. I may not be an archeoogists but i say that it is a great job to earn money and to get to learn alot about the world, they also get to look at things that they have never seen before, they also get to touch things they have never got to touch before. For all the people who are archeologists i wish you guys good luck and hope you guys have a wonderful life with what you guys are doing to help alot of people figure out what the meaning of archeologists, it may help a lot of people to know that learning in school is not just a joke it is very serious because if you don't take it serious than you will not get no where in life well hope you liked my report and hope you actually learned something from my report.

While archeologist dig up artifacts there are other people that study the artifacts that the archeologist have found while digging.What the archeologists study in the artifacts that were found is how the people used them.And how it helped them through life when there was tough times but good times as well.Also why they made them in the first place.It also helps us understand why things happened and how things worked back then.Also to help us understand why they made some decisions.           Archeologist also have to do while they are doing their job is that they have to be care full.The reason they have to be careful is because some of the artifacts can be so old that they could brake easily.They also have to use special tools such as a wheel barrow now how that helps an archeologist is that it moves items or dirt away from where they are working.Another tool they use is a knife the knife helps to scrape dirt around the artifacts.They also use a dust pan and whisk to brush dirt from artifacts so you can see it clearly.The tool they mostly use is a trowel its is used to see all the types of soil.They also use a pick and shovel to dig closer to the artifacts.Some archeologist use 3D computers to find things easily.These are just some of the jobs archaeologist have to do.

You guys might think its easy now but believe me just let me tell a little about what an archeologist really does.After i tell you guys this you might still think its easy or hard or you might think that it is to hard and you wont want to think of doing that job ever again.           An  archeologist is areally hard job they have to dust of objrcts that are long befor any of us were born.They have to study about hoe long ago these things were made they also have to study peoples houses that might of been made in like the 1600's. The job for anyone is going to be hard. People that are archeologist have to study George Washingtons house that he lived in when he was a little boy.they have to study almost everthing that was done in the past. They might find any thing such as coins,bowls,broken down things they can find almost anything basically that was from the past a long time ago.  They could even find George Washington's clothes if they still   exist.           So what im trying to say is that archeologist to me i would love to dig up things that famouse people used from the past . I would love to do every thing that archeologist do now like dig up things  from the past or discover how people treated anchient things but it would be tiering doing all of that every day and i would have to learn everthing about being an archeologist. But it would also be one of the best jobs in the world.                         	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP . . .

Have your eyes looking. Give me your attention. Because im going to tell you.   In 1994 a group of people stated the Jamestown  Rediscovery Arcaeological project. They thought the fort was washed away. But 200 years later they found it. You see, Arcaeological look for old objects like pottry or metel. And they found just that!   The national parks led the 5 year dig. A dig is like a tresrure hunt. But in one place, and with no map, so they have to check everyware.They found cellers ware they cept there food, burial sites or grave yards, and leftover buildings.   If your looking for a good job, or just want to have something fun to do, visit a dig. Its lots of fun.  	NNP PRP VB TO VB IN NNP . NNP PRP VB TO NNP WP PRP VBP .

It takes 35 people to be team.And you need high teak stuff  to find what is under ground.Then you put it in a museum an you make money doing it.           So many people come to visits these places each and every year.And there are stuff you cant believe ,so thats why this is interesting.

Archeologists find information about people in the past who are not living now. Some people might think their job is easy and some people think it is hard. It is just your opinion but i think their job is hard because sometimes it takes you a long time to really find any artifacts. In these paragraphs you will learn about what tools they use, how they use them, and what they do.        The tools that archeologists use are picks and shovels, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and a trowel. Most digs start with picks and shovels. They are used to dig into the ground and find the artifacts they are looking for. A whisk and a dustpan are used to brush the dirt off of artifacts. A knife is used to dig carefully and scrape dirt off of the artifacts. A wheelbarrow is used to move artifacts from one place to another. Skim shovels are shovels with a flat edge used to remove a very thin layer of dirt carefully. The last tool that an archeologist uses is a trowel. Trowels are used to scrape and cut the dirt to view the different layers of dirt.        Archeologists find artifacts by digging for long periods of time. They have to plan how to and where to dig before they start digging for real. Sometimes they use a 3D computer to track and map what is underground. Some archeologists just start digging in the first place and see what they find. If they use a 3D computer to map the area out they have to record the information of where to dig so they know what the artifact looks like before they start digging. If they are focusing on the actual digging, they start with skim shovels. Archeologist then put the little layers of soil dug up in boxes with half-inched screens on the bottoms. This lets soil go through the screen and leaves back artifacts.        This report was about the job of an archeologist. Now you know what type of tools they use and how they use them. It takes a few years sometimes to finish an area.If I wrote this report again I would write it about how archeologists earn their job. Since I learned more about being an archeologists I believe it would be fun to have this job.

I'm in the ACTS program. I'm happy to be writing to you about Archeologists and what they do in there jobs. In this report you will find out what they do for a job and what they find.           Being an Archeologists would very fun I would think because you get to find cool pieces of history. Once you find a piece of history you have to do a lot of research on what ever you find. An Archeologists can be hard because you can be sick if you find something that is possession, so if you are one be careful. In this you have to be patient to find hidden clues.

So there are good and bad things about being an archeologists.      If I do become an archeologists I will need tools to help me dig. Those tools include a shovel and pick axe, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. These tools will help me dig for dinorsore boons, or ancinte artifacts.      When they where digging for Fort James they used computer analising to find where Fort James. The fort had rooms with nothing but gun bowder barrils. They also found slots in the wall where cannons where placed. They knew that the fort was in a triangle shape so it was easy to find the fort. In the Washington project they had fond a celler and started to dig for artifacts.

My main idea is about the     tools that archeologist use when they work. The 3 things that will be focused on is the wheelbarrow, the pick and shovel, and the whisk and dustpan. Lets begin!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The wheelbarrow is a tool used to move items from one place to another. So if     the item is too big then archeologist will use the wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow is       usually used to carry dirt. If the dirt is in the way it would be harder to get to the          artifact. This is why and how archeologist use wheelbarrows.                                                                                                                                                                                                    The pick and shovel is to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. Most digs start        with these tools. If the archeologist are looking for something but cant get through it  then they use these tools to get them started. The pick and the shovel are two different things. 1 is use to pound the dirt to make is softer. The shovel is used to dig. This is     why and how archeologist  use  a pick and a shovel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The whisk and the dustpan is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. A whisk is like a broom but isn't used like one. The       dustpan is used to pick up the dirt. hen using a whisk do not brush the artifact hard. The artifact is sometimes very fragile. This is why and how archeologist use a whisk and dustpan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The 3 things i have focused on is the wheelbarrow, the pick and shovel, and the   whisk and dustpan. My main idea was about the tools that archeologist use. I only      used 3 of the tools that they use. There are more tools than those three.

When you find an object they are called artifacts. The people who work to find these objects from the past are called archeologist. Many old places where cool things took place are searched for artifacts. Like one of the places is Fort James. Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia for a long time people thought it had all been just washed away by a river. Some things they found made people feel like there was something still there.   This fort was built in 1607 when England settlers came to start a new life. Everybody thinks it was built somewhere near or beside a river. It would be easier to park ships there.      The first objects were found there in 1861. They found undercovered armor and weapons. They also got to find floors of differnt buildings. Over 100 years later they tried to find the exact spot where it was built began. The people doing this study used a computer mapping software to make an image of this area. Thats when they finally found James Fort. So thats one of the places they found very old items.      They also tried to find information on George Washingtons past. Recent discoveries have been recorded to let historans know more about Washingtons childhood. His father moved his family to Ferry Farms. George was only six. They started diging in 2003. It took over a year. But they finally found it.     Archeologist use many tools haer are a few pick,shovel,knife,and,many more. Remember they dont always find stuff.

You must have patience because you may not find something in area that you have been searching for years. See because when went to search for Washingtons house were he had grew up their were five house on the property were Washington grew up. The archeologist had to do a lot of research to figure out which house was Washington's. The way they figuured out was that they found out that Washington's house had caught on fire, and in one of the houses they found pieces of burnt poetry. They also found a clay pipe and they new that Washington smoked clay pipes. So archeologist dont have a simole job. They have to very patient and careWhen your an archeologist you have to be carefull. You have to be carefull  because if they were to find something very valuable and they were to drop it would brake and then be useless. Archeologist have many tools to help keep them safe and whatever they find safe.              How do Archeologist find all of this stuff including the stuff in and around Washington's house? Archeologist that were on the Washington case split up on to teams and each team checks a diferent area. They also have 3-d computers that can track whats under ground. these computers help them alot so that they can find whatevers under the ground a lot faster. One team focuses on the diging part. Those archeologist start their dig with a skim shovel.Another archeologist team spends the day in the lab. The information gathered from the 3D computers is recorded.              Archeologist have meany tools and each one has their on thing. They have a pick and shovel. They have a whisk and dustpan. They have knife. They have a wheelbarrow. They have a skim shovel. They have trowel.

They dusted it off teen halled it off to a meuseum.That is how the artifacts got there today.           The job of an archaeolagist is brutal.They dig up most everything in are meuseams.The hard part is that they have to dig whithout breaking anything.Everything they discovor is very fradgal,and you cant break anything for the meausem.Thats why they use specal tools. if they damage any of the artifacts than they might not even get paid money.           The archeoligistthat worked on the Fort James progect first found armor.Next they found weapons that were over 100 or a century old.Some of the artifacts were even found in ice or glaciers.Artifacts are a big part of are life,without them we would never know what or how the people that lived bact then.           Finding artifacts are not so easy.You have to somtimes even cut huge chunks out of glaciers.Then heat or unfreeze them so you can start dusting off the artifact.As the earth and the people on it progress,we will find more artifacts and knolage afout the people that lived a long time before we were born...

By:Rebecca Karel        My name is Rebecca Karel. I am 11 years old. I go to Woodfeilds Elementry. In this report I will teach you about the job of an archeologist. I decided to pick ( I did not really pick it.) this topic because I did not know much about them. In the report you will learn about how archeologists found Fort James, how archeologists learned more about George Washington's child hood, and about the tools used by archeologists. I hope you enjoy my report.        First in 1994 a group of people got together so they could study the past of  James Fort in Jamestown. They wanted to set up an archaeological project. For over two huundred years people thought the town had been detroyed, but some discoveries were found that revealed that it might still be there.When the archeologists finnally found the area where the fort was they started digging.The first objects were found in 1861, when   archeologists found weapons, and armor.One hundred years after that they found some more. Now we have found over 1 millon things, including pots, coins, toys, and tools.        Now that we have talked about Fort James, let us discuss how archeologists helped us find more about George Washington. Archeologists found where Washington lived as a child, it took them a couple years but they did it. A few houses had been discovered so they looked for more. They found burnt pottery and a clay pipe so they confirmed that that location was were Washington lived. Archeologists work on a team to find artifacts, so thirty-five people can be on a team.It takes sevearl  teams to find an artifact.For example it can take up to two weeks or more to dig an twenty-five square foot area.thats why it is a big deal if, say you found one tiny bit of burnt pottery, scientists cound scan that pottery and find out a lot about where that pottery has been. That is how we found out about George Washington's childhood.        Archeologists have to have tools when they find artifacts. One of their tools are the pick and shovel. Archeologists use the pick and shovel to dig into the the Earth to find artifacts.Archeologists also use the Wisk and dustpan. They use these items to brush of dirt  from the artifacts. Archeologists use the knife as one of their tools too. The knife helps them scrape dirt away from the artifact. A lot of archeologists use the wheelbarow to help them carry dirt away from where they are digging, it also helps them carry the artifacts away from the excavation site. Most archeologists use the Skim shovel to dig into the soil to take a slim layer of soil off, they are able to do this bacause the skim shovel has a flat edge. The most common tool that archeologists use is the Trowel. The Trowel is used to cut the different layers of soil off so you can see them. Those are some of the tools that archeologists use.        This report was about the job of an archeologist. In this report I told you about how archeologists woked on Fort James, how archeologists learned more about George Washington's child hood, and about the tools used by archeologists. I learned some things too, when I was writing this report. I learned that archeologists use Trowels and Skim shovels. I also learned that archeologists found a trash pile in Fort James.

This essay will be about how important the job of an archeoligist's is. They have a lot of specail tools that the use. Archeoligists have a very big role in this world. They have changed history many times.              First, I am going to talk about the different tools that archeoligists use. They use such things as a pick and shovel, a whisk and dust pan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel and a trowel. These tools are very important in the process of archeology. It takes a long time to use these tools properly; because they need to be really carefull not to break the artifacts.               Now, I am going to tell you about how archeoligists affect the world. An archeoligist's job is to discover historical figures (artifacts) that are not yet discovered. For example: Archeoligists wnt to Ferry Farm, knowing that George Washington lived there as a boy. They used the appropriate tools and found out that it was George Washington's home, with the proof of pieces of burned pottery and part of a clay pipe.               Archeoligists find millions of artifacts, changing history every day. They work very hard and focus carefully. I learned that archeoligists have such a big role on the Earth. I am glad that we have archeoligists today!

So you see it is very difficult but if you do find something interesting that difficulty pays off.       you get some fame,fortune, and possibly a lot of money.

An archeologist is a person who discovers and digs up artifacts, items of the past, and fossils. Archeologists can use special tools to help them discover artifacts and fossils. They also have a procedure and they can dig up certain items.         Some tools that archeologists use are picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. The pick and shovel are used to dig up the soil above where something might be. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush off dust and dirt. Wheelbarrows were used to move dirt or items to another place. A skim shovel is used to remove very thin layers of soil. The trowel scrapes and cuts layers of soil.         To dig up artifacts in a certain area, a team of archeologists first map out a place to find out what is underground. Then, another group of archeologists do the actual digging for items in the area that is mapped out. They use the skim shovel to remove layers of soil to find items. Archeolgists use another method called troweling too. troweling uses shovels, brushes, and picks to remove dirt. After the artifacts are found, another team of archeologists studies the objects that the second team found.         Most things archeologists will find are artifacts and the fossilized bones of animals. Archeologists can find ancient pottery, paintings, metal items, tombs, and toys. If archeologists are searching for fossils, they can find the remains of dinosaurs and long-ago plants and animals. There are some places that are good sources of fossils and artifacts, such as the La Brea Tar Pits in Southern California, or the Egyptian pyramids.         Being an archeologist can be fun, but it can also be dull and tiring, especially if you can not find anything. But if an archeologist finds something fascinating, like King Tut's coffin, he/she could become world renowned. Archeology is an interesting subject.

Archeologists use shovels, picks, whisk and dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. Shovels and picks, which is like a pickaxe, are used for digging, they're the main digging tools. Whisks and dustpans are like little brushes and dustpans, they are used for brush dirt off of artifacts and to clear dirt away. Knives as an archeology tool aren't used the same way as normal knives. They're used to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrows   move dirt from one place to another. Skim shovels are a type of shovel that have a flat edge. Can be used to carfully remove a thin layer of soil. Trowels are one of the most used tools, they are used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.

They could help us learn about one person, and that discovery could help us learn about other people as well.     Archeologists will often find an artifact that can tell us about several things, like what life was like then, or what a person might have done.     Things that they find may inspire some people or lead to ideas for new inventions.  Things that they find could help someone be creative.     Archeologists help us learn new things about a time or person, or inspire a person to create an invention.

Well,   archeologists have to be very careful about their work and must take their time.  However, the life of an archeologist can be rewarding.  For example, when people found George Washington's house artifacts, archeologists had to work hard to find them, but were greatly rewarded when they did.  Archeologists must be careful, take their time, and eventually, they will be greatly rewarded.     	NNS VBP PRP RB VBN WP PRP MD VB IN TO VB DT NN .

They use many tools like a trowel or a knife to uncoer mysteries.  Some times, it takes days to dig up a clay pot, or just five minutes to find a whole dinosaur skeleton.  There are many important things that haven't been discovered yet like the 'Nessie' or the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle.  Archelogists are important, because they could discover the solution of problems, or an invetion that never been known.

What an archeologist does is that they look for ancient tools and dinosaur bones.  They dug up James Fort  and found eleven cellars, dozen of burial sites, and ten buldings all within the border of the fort.  First they marked the spots on the ground to dig up the wall , they knew that the fort was going to look like a triangle. If i were an archeologist i would like to dig to the core of earth.  It takes about 2 weeks to dig up a 25 feet long dinosaur.  In an archeologist life is hard they hav to work for weeks to dig up bones and take years for building.  It would be fun if all my friends would work with me in this job.  When there is sommething huge underground the archeologist have to make a plan to how to dig it.  The process of digging at Ferry Farm is a careful one for the archeologist.  Each year, many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 people on a team.  The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.  This is what an archeologist does hope you liked this report i typed out .

Archeologists have to make sure that everything they find (artifacts) will not be destroyed.  Being an archeologist also a great thing to do because you get to learn new things and find things that were part of history.       An archeologist is someone who studies things from the past.  They look for things that have to do with history.       The tools archeologists use are apick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and trowel.  The most common tool is the trowel. The trowel is a tool used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.       In 2003, archeologists started digging on a new site on George Washington's home.  They were looking for artifacts from George Washington. They found pieces of burnt pottery, which meant that there was a fire there.  They also found clay pipes that were used by President Washington.       This is what archeologists do, nice right?

More than 200 years,people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river.Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.             The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort near the river.It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. the new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.

Theres some stuff we don't know about in history stuff we need to find out.Archioligist are technally treasure hunters and they need to know what there looking for .So archioligist need to know their history, archioligist also need tools  to help dig.       For example a pick and shovel now being a archioligist sounds easy. Now sometimes it takes years to find anything.It could also be very dagerous you don't know if the thing is sucure.Or not so they have to be careful some great archioligist have crews to help them.For example finding fort james it took lots of time but the group found the james fort.        In conclusion archioligist use history stratedgy and tools most times.Some people say archioligist are advendturers,treasure hunters.Archioligi is about testing  history and facts at the same time.So in both sorces tell you that archioligist are searching for are past.So thats the meaning of archoligi american history and that is why archioligist are important?

Being an archeologist if fun, but hard because mining and digging is a lot of hard work. Also there are many tools to use to excavate an artifact. You need to know which tool is which.          Wheelbarrows are used to move items from one place to another. That helps archeologist   to move artifacts in one place and dirt in another. Those tools help the archeologist remove anything dirty on the priceless artifact. If they dig around for what was a ruin, they might find some unknown text or find treasure that was lost. They are important to have. Without archeologist, treasures wouldn't be discovered, ancient languages and people wouldn't be discover, and nothing from the past would be brought from the past to the present.

Archeologist dig to find artfacts about the past like when Gorge Washington was alive. They studied how old they were and what they did or were used for.Archeologist found pieces of burnt pottery and a clay pipe.They also found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.       Archeolegist are divided up in to two teams. The first team maps the area using 3D computers and the other team is focused on digging.they start digging with a skim shovel. The skim shovel is are small ,flat ,and sharp so that they can remove thin layer of soil.

This fort was buit in 1607 and said that it was built near a river and washed away, until archeologisit were intrested and started to wonder until curiosty hit them. In 1861 Archeologist found old armor and weapons also some of the buildings floor. This was a huge impact for everyone that at least they got a clue about James fort. 100 years past and a group of archeologisit  started to dig where James fort was built, The national park helped them and gave them a five year study so they could have an idea how the land was used at that time. Alot of the archeologist used technology to find James fort and eventually they found what they were looking for James fort, they found very intersting things that they could've never learned  like the fort was shaped like a triangle etc etc etc. Today they find even more stuff and still learn alot about the fort.                           George Washington the first president. George Washington life before the american hero was unknown like where was his house, did he own land etc etc etc. Over 12,000 years peole haved lived on a place called Ferry Farm  this place was perfect for people who were a normal family back in the olden days, Augustine Washington father of George Washington  had the same idea like everyone did. No one knew where he lived because it wasnt there anymore. 2003, Archeologist  had an idea to dig up the past and find were George lived before he was famous. It took a year of hard work and alot of dirt to find George Washingtons home,eventually they werent sure if they found the right place untill they found a clay pipe, this pipe gave a huge clue because George Washington smoked clay pipes. They didnt just find clues they found 3 buildings there was the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses. This people used advanced technolgy to help dig up the past and also they used Archeologist tools like pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and of course a trowel.                     Archeologist play a huge part in history. This week i've been really intrested into the past and how it's found by Archeologist,I learned about what they use what they want to see and many more. Archeologist have founded may diffrent things we can learn about and see it, they reasearch what they need to find,most important what the need to see.this Whole test had made me thing beyond the box like Archeologist do, I hope the Archeologist soon find a new adventure and share it with others.

Also you need to be good at digging stuff up, because that is what fifty percent of your job. You would have to reaserch many many things that is already known and then you have to prove it by finding the artifacts and showing it to who ever owns the company or someone who ordered you company to find the artifact to prove it. Its a lot of work, but for some people, its a chance to meet someone who has the same interests as you.   One thing you would have to do is to get a assignment and look uop stuff about it. So say if you need to prove that Ben franklin made the glasses, you would have to look where ever his workshop or home was. Then you would have to dig around until you find some blue prints or tests and ideas. Thats one thing you would have to do.   Another thing you would have to do is to write up a report on the stuff you have found in the area that you have dug in. You would have to take every single  thing that you have found in the digging area and say what it shows to a regular person. Because if you write in your perspective, people who have found the information may not understand it. Thats pretty much the last thing you would really need to do.   But the last thing you really need to do is post your report onto the internet VIA skype to one website owner like wikipedia or give your report to a publisher. Then you would have to wait until you are givin another assignment.     	WP VBZ DT NN IN NNP NNP .

I am goinh to tell about all the tools and how they use them to find artifacts.       A pick and shovel are two tools archeologists use. Usually, a pickand shovel start off the digging. A pick can be picked at a hard part of the earth. It will help archeologists find what they are looking for such as, old fossils or bones.  A whisk and dustpan can be used to brush off the dirt and dust the objects or artifacts have on top of them. Archeologists can use these tools to find pottery or old plates and cups. A knife can be used to dust off the dust, dirt, or any other dusty particle around the item or artifact.       An archeologist can do many things like dig up history, old stories, old objects and artifacts. The job of an archeologist casn be very exciting but you never know what you may or may not find.

To find artafacts archeologist have to use different tools like a pick and shovel ,knife and wheelbarrow they use this stuff incase they need to move this stuff around that is what you use a wheel barrow for. You use the knife incase you need to cut things. You use the pick and shovel to dig up the artafacts.       Archeologist also study things from the past just besides digging up things from the ground.Archeologist have to mark the ground so they know where to dig and don't dig in the wrong spot.In a paragraph it talks about archeologist finding eleven cellers , dozen of burial sites ,and ten bulidings withen the border of the fort.Today archeologist find nearly  1 million artafacts a year. Some things  that they find are old tools,metal toys, coins,and pottery, uncorvered armor and weaponss.      Some of the things they find are things that belonged to people hundreds  years ago and it gives us some of our histery from along time ago . Some of the they find probably asre dated to the when they started the thirteen colonies . That a long time ago .Archeologist can dig up things from the 1600's. It can take two weeks for an archeologist  to dig a  25-squar foot section. archeologist have to use a thing called troweling .troweling is when you take a small shovels,paint brushes and a wooden pick to remove the dirt.this is how a archeologist starts their dig they use a skim shovel.A skim shovel is a small flat and sharp to remove layers of soil.   Waht Does The Name Archeologist Mean?     The name archeologist is anether word for a scientists  who study objects from the past. 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NN IN DT NN VBZ TO VBZ TO VB NNS .

Also   they can study how to make new projects. To come to owe school so they can tell us how animals were in the past.

The second reason will be to find bones and they can put it to the measure and lot will be fun to go look at.  My last reason will be that they can come to the schools and we can learn lot more. Cause from the teacher and from the one who come to the school.

Archeologists are people who dig and research things to find out more about our past.        There are many parts archeologist do.  1 group of the archeologists maps the area that they are researching in and use 3D computers to track what is underground. Another group of archeologists focus on digging. These archeologists dig in a dig. They begin by using skim shovels. When they are done with these they put their dirt in a box that separates actual artifacts from dirt. The diggers also trowel. troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifacts.           Now you see what an archeologist does, and how they work.

So you might also be asking, what are artifacts?  Well, artifacts are old, or historic items, used or cherished a long time ago.  It doesn't nessasarly have to be from someone who passed away, but artifacts, is similar to the word, 'ancient.' So archeologists are usually sent to homes or old buildings but to be honest, you could find them anywhere trying to dig up useful artifacts.  So when they arrive at the location, they bring in the equipment they need such as, a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knives, a wheelbarrow, and a trowel.  These are all tools they use to dig up the artifacts.  Digging meaning, 'recovering, or surfacing.'  So of course you need to dig up dirt, or gravel to get the the artifact.  So, they would use the Pick, shovel, and skim shovel to start their process.  The knife comes in handy for careful digging.  Because remember, knives cut, and you don't want to damage the artifact, and all the tools are slowly used in the process.  Im sure being and archeologist is fun.  I mean, think about it!  You get to touch, see, feel things thats historic.

Archeologists are people who discover things. I think these are the tools yo find or discover or buid or breakdown, and those tools are Pickovel, Whiskustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel,and a Trowel. It semms like alot doesn't it , but it   really isn't that much.       There are many Sources like Source#1, Source#2, and Source#3. But back to those tools im going give definitions. OK so umm.... Pick &amp; Shovel: Most digs start  with these two tools.Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Whisk &amp; Dustpan: Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away form the dirt from the excavation site. Knife: Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow: Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel: A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer soil with each scoop. Trowel: Probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.       Source#1       This article about how archeologists find artifacts at Jamestown Island is a based on information.

In 1994 a group were studying  the jamestown discoveryThe jamestown fort was buil in 1607 when the english came to the america's for a new life.People beleave that he fort was build by the river and was washed up by the river waves?           The first object found from the jamestown fort was found in 1861.The National Park Service led a 5-year expidition.They used stuff like metal detectars but it shows enything under ground in a 3D pictureToday archeoligist have found over 1 million artfacts! When they found the fort and dug out all he dirt they found a pit were they would throw away all their stuff in.They had ideas on what the inians and settelers did in the 16 and 17 hundreds.                                                       Digging up George Washington's past                           We all know of George Washington as a soldier and our first president. Most of the settelers lived on what is called Ferry Farm and people still live on Ferry Farm.For over 12,000 years people have been liveing on Ferry Farm.           People say that george washington lived on Ferry Farm and he did they say his house cought on fire and burned down.Archeoligist started digging in 2003 they found the main farmhouse.A couple months later they found were his house was located his house was really burnt down because the find burnt wood in the stone base under were the house was.       They also found burnt pottery and other stuff his whouse was really their in Ferry Farm they doug up his past.they worked in teams each team held 35 people.           They have camps at Ferry Farm and ids can dig up stuff that was still in the ground they have games you can play. The kids can sign up for classes and pay games make new freinds and learn more about more about Geroge Washington.       The archeoligist used picks and shovels to dig up lots of dirt at once and they used picks to break off stone and other hard objects.They also used a whisk for dusting of dirt to see the artifact clearly and wheelbarrows for get large amounts of dirt to dig fpr the artifacts.

Spending weeks on end digging. But, it can also be a fun job. Like when you find ancient burrial grouds or maybe a tomb with an egytian phero in it. That's always exciting. Well, here are some other amazing digs that made the job worth-while.           In 1994, some people interested in the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. They wanted to find the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For 200 years, everyone thought the fort had been taken by the river. But some things found in the area hinted that it might still be there. The fort was made in 1607, at the same time the English Settlers came. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists discovered armor and weapons. They also found the floors of buildings.          About 100 years later, a group set out to find the exact spot where the fort had been built. The people diong the study used computer mapping to create a picture of the area. And that's when they found James Fort! The first thing they found were marks on the ground. They showed where the walls used to be. From everything they had researched, they knew the fort would be triangle shaped. They also found that it streched to the river. Today the archeologists find about 1 million objects every year!          Now you can see why being an archeologist is so fun. I mean, they found a whole forrt! Well, I hope you enjoyed.

They get to see all the artifacts that they get,but its a lot of work to find the artifacts,too. Let me explain what I mean.      First of all,they have to get all the research and then get the tools. They have to get things from 3D computers to dust pans. They also have teams to make it easier. The teams can be up to thirty five people! They also have to find out about other things that were found in the area to see if what their trying to find is still there. Then they start the hunt.              They find the spot where they need to start first. They use those 3D computers to try and find things under the ground. They may only dig 25 square feet in 2 weeks! The whole thing is very slow, but in the end its worth it. Once they find the artifact,it has to be cleaned. It is a great job, but it is very important. In the end it all comes together,the artifact goes where it belongs,and they wait for their next trip.

They had to find information and try to dig stuff up. Some were isinded to try to dig jornals up and find information from the past.       People thought a fort was washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from england to start a new life. Jamestown was near a river. it was easier to dock ships there. it made sence why they settled there.       The first object was found in 1861. Archeologists who studied objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the axact spot where the fort built began.       the National Park Service led five-year study of tue area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where the proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. Thats when they finally found James Fort.

They have to go to different places to try to find undiscovered   artifacts about one person. Say they're trying to find artifacts of Cleopatra, they'd go to were she came from ( Egypt ) and try to find artifacts. That's were the name artifacts came from ( Archeologists ). Although there job sounds easy, it's very dangerous and hard! When they're in caves trying to find artifacts, the cave could cave-in.           Archeologists can have the hardest jobs on earth! Going to find artifacts about just ONE person is super hard! Man, sometimes I can't even find facts about people in books, let alone finding their past?! I think not. First off, you have to go to where their old house was and search it. Second off, you need to find a lot of their pictures to tell who they were. Third off, you have to know a lot about that person! You also have to know a lot about how they lived, who they lived with, how many family members they had, and what they did for a living.            If you want to be an archeologist when you're older, I suggest you start studying some people right now! Finding artifacts is like finding something when it's lost, lost history! When you lose something, it's very hard to find right? If you answered yes, then imagine trying to find something that's been lost for hundreds even sometimes thousands of years! If you answered no, then man you're crazy! People who live in the same place for their whole life make it easier to find artifacts, but people who have moved around the world a lot, make it VERY hard!           As you can see finding artifacts is not all so easy. You must go through a lot of steps before you start looking for artifacts. You have to have all the right tools, the right gear, and especially the right type of people to help you!   If you want to be an archeologists when you're, just remember I warned you! I warned you that it is a very hard job!                                                                     	NNS NNS VBP RB RB NNP NNP RB VBP RB JJ NNS .

Also, they need the right tools for the job.  plus they need to find clues in side or on what they find to tell the past.  What would we know without archeologist.       In  Digging up George Washington's Past, they knew the area to dig and eventually they found it, George Washington's house!  Also they found more houses by it.  Then in Finding Fort James, They studied the past to find the area it was in.  After that they used a computer system to map out the area and find the exact spot the fort was built. I think it is cool that they can study the area an then dig up the past.       Now for all of the tools they use. They use a pick for breaking stone and a shovel to dig up the dirt.  Now they use a wheelbarrow to carry items or move the dirt away from the excavation site.  Then they use a knife to scrape the dirt off of the artifacts.  Also they use a whisk and dustpan to also take dirt off of an artifact.  Now for the skim shovel, it is flat to remove one layer of dirt at a time.  Then,  last but not least, the trowel.  It lets an archeologist look at one layer of dirt at a time.       You cant just dig up a house and say it belongs to a famous person in history,  you need to find clews that it is theirs.  Like in Digging up George Washington's Past.  They found different clews it was his.  One was that they found one of his clay pipes.  Also it gives more information about their childhood, their adulthood,  when they where born, and much more probably.           Without archeologists we would know almost nothing about the past.  Maybe not even basic maps.  Luckily we have them to tell us the mysterys of the past.

These are some of them: digging and finding the artifacts, brushing dust off, working at the  research center scanning the artifacts, and finding the location of the artifact.         When you dig and find the artifacts, you need to make sure it is a artifact not a rock. Also, make sure you don't BREAK the artifact. You need to make sure you go to the right location not 100 miles of or 1yd. off. Also, when you find the artifact you need to contact the general. When you brush the dust off you need to collect everything around it. While you brush it off you need to give it to the general.

A archeoligsts wrote that 'Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and presidant. Biographies dont have very much information about his childhood.

When the weather is not the best they still have to go to work in the snow, rain, hail, or fog. They have to have many tools with them like pickaxe, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow if they need it, skim shovel, trowel.The dirt will give you dusty jeans. I bet the will have to were goggles  to keep the dust form gitting in thier eyes.

First if they are discovering something they have to have a team that can have 35 people on a team First they have to get 3D computers to scan underground and the see what is under there to see how deep they should dig.       The second team the 'diggers' have to dig with a skim shovel and and trowel until they find something it might take a couple years and they use a whisk and dustpan to dust off objects so they don't break. they use the knife to get the objects out and to make it loose.       Finally they have to take it to the lab and learn about it and do experiments on it.       The life of an archeologist is very hard.

They have been discovering the secrets of James Fort in             Jamestown, Virginia. People thought that the fort had been             washed away by a river. Some discoveries found in the area               hinted that it might still be around there.                                         James Fort was built  in 1607, that's when the settlers                      came from England. It was easier for people to dock ships                  there. The settlers found objects that meant the fort was                        further away from where they were. So they moved away,                   and the new spot gave more protection to the settlers from                   enemy ships.                             The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists                       uncovered armor and weapons from the past. They found                     other objects, such as, floors of buildings. Over 100 years                   later, a group of archeologists, found the exact spot where the             fort was built.                                         The National Park Service led a 5-year study of the area                to figure out how the area was used. They decided that this                 solution would help them look for evidence of the fort. Some               of the group did the computer mapping software of the area to              make an image of the  area.                             They finally found James Fort! They found a set of marks                on the ground, they showed where the walls used to be. They              heared different stories, read books, and made drawings, the             archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a                       triangle. They found different objects such as:11 cellars,                     ledges, burial sites, and ten buildings.                          So, do you want to be an archeologist?

There job is to find artifacts from inportant times in history. Things from George Washingtons childhood and finding Fort James. Archeoligists are our link to the past.             One of the vary inprtant jobs that they had to do was find George Washingtons home. They needed to find his familys house because we did not know much about his childhood. The Archeolgists task was to find were his home was lokated on Ferry Farms. Using 3.D maps and tools they were abel to find it.            Another inportant dig they dug was finding Fort James in James town from one of the first colenies. Some peopole thought that it had been washed away by the river. But the archeolgists pruved them rong. They aculy found the exact spot were it had been built.Its pretty cool to know what archeologists can find.            Archeologists have lots of special tools for on the dig sites. (1) They have a pick and a shovel, they use these tools to start the dig by clearing away the top layer(s) of dirt. (2) they have something called a whisk and a dustpan, the whisk is used to brush dirt off of artifacts or off the exevation site, they use the dust pan with the whisk. (3) They use a knife for careful digging and to scrape hard dirt off of the artifacts.(4) They use a wheelbarrow for obviuse reasons(like caring dirt away from the dig site). (5) They use a specail tool called a skim shovel, that has flat edges, to remove a thin layer of soil with every scoop. (6) The last tool they use is a trowel, this is probebly the most comen tool, and they use it to scrape, and cut to veiw the soil from different angels. Now you know all the tools that they need, and how they use them.            Archeologists are like detectives with with tools and an inportat job to solve the mysterys past.

A archeologist is a person that uses many tools to dig up different artifacts from many different locations. Those artifacts help us learn more about history. It is exiting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.              The process of digging is a careful one. It takes patience, and many hard workers. The many people who dig are on a 'team.' There can be up to thirty-five people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.All the information is used to show where the workers need to start and what to use.             Another type of team works on the actual digging. Where they dig, is called a 'dig.' they start with a tool called a 'Skim shovel.' The skim shovel is used to get the first few layers of dirt off. It can do this because of its shape. The skim shovel is is small, flat, and sharp.               A technique called troweling is also a way to dig up artifacts. They archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove the dirt off of the artifacts. Sometimes, it takes up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five square foot section. A different team from the two you have already learned about, spends a whole day examining artifacts in a lab.                  So, do you think your going to be a archeologist? Your going to have to be a patient and hard worker! 	WP VBZ PRP IN TO VB DT NN .

It wasnt what we thought. It was just a dog. We went to go find my sister running around in the wheat field. She was gone.      We searched all around the big field looking for her. We went to go find my parents who were at the gift shop.We finally found her playing in the corn field. 'OHHHH she was in the corn field, not the wheat field'.      We all saw all the sights so decided to leave. We had a pretty fun time. My parents were still shaky but then calmed down. I told them we were kidding and we knew where she was. We got grownded.

He was in a ship working he had to load woods to the ships and he had to do a lot more work. In source #2 it is about George Washington these people wanted to dig up his house so they had to do a lot of work it took one year for them to do it but they found it but they wanted to make sure that was his house and it was. On source #3 is how the archeologists use there tools to do stuff and it tells you that you need to be careful to use them but some it says that how they were used in the story and it gives you some pitures of the tools how they look like and for you could see them too.

Then after that you take clues thta you have found and put them together and to get an idea of what you are doing. The thing after that is to go looking for the object you need to find.After you find the object and mark were it is so thta you can find it again. Then you get your tools and go digging with help from other people. You will then either take the object if it is a bone or if it is a house witch you would leave for people to see it with permisstion. That is what a archeologist does.

The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia.  For over 200 years people thought the fort was washed away.  The fort was built in 1607 when English settlers came to start a new life.  ?????            The first objects were found in 1861.  They uncovered armor and weapons.  Over 100 years later, a group tried to find the exact spot where the fort began.  They led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.  They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort.            That is where they finally found James Fort!  The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.  The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be.  between all the stories they heard, read, and drawings they made , the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.             Today, the group finds nearly 1,000,000,000 objects each year.  The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children.  In the 1600's, people used to throw there trash down an unused well or into a big pit.              It is exiting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago!  In my opinion archeologists are pretty cool people!

The next day John said',my book is gone'.At recess they told John who it might be and he said',lets check at lunch'.So at lunch the three went to the class room and again the cage was open,but this time John's book was on th floor.So John left and said', I will look with you tomorrow'.   The next day John got sick and Jill and Henry went in the class room at lunch again to find Fred's cage open and there was fredy chewing Henry's pencil sitting on Jill's ruler.They told the teacher about it and he said' I will get you a new pencil and ruler'.Then peace went to the class room until Fredy tookRachel's markers.

In different places they can find different artifacts.       They find coins, and things from the past like pottery pipes.The firt president used pottery pipes.   They use many important tools like trowels and shovels for digging up old artifacts in the ground.   They also need a whisk to brush off dirt and dust so that they can study it properly. Archeoligist sure find cool stuff ,but for a price. It is hard work.

Archiology is also what helps scientists, historians, kids, and adults about the history of our great country, including some of our great people, and places.            Some of our archiologists great finds have been: Georg Washington's house, and Fort Jamestown.            George Washington's farm is been under I guess you could say reconstrudtion since 2003. This is a long, and hard process. It took the archiologists over a year to find evidense, but they finally found some. There was about 5 settlements on Ferry Farm, the land in which George Washington, our first president, lived on. This house was extreamly hard to find sinse the land was so big, and the archiologists weren't exactly shure which house was George Washington's at first. The evidence that one find was George's house was; clay cigars, and burnt pottery. This was an important find.             The find of George Washington's house as a young boy growing up was important for our country. This is because the dig helps is understand what George was like as a child/ brfore he became famous. This was also important because the find gives us information on what decisions George made, and how people in these colonial times lived.             This is only one of the many reasons that archilogists are important.

Archeologists use a lot of tools, and I will tell what they use in a minute.        Tools archeologists use are pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. All of them are used for digging up or cleaning artifacts        Pick and shovel are probably the first tool archeologits use. The pick and shovel are use to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.        The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, excavation means to get rid of something or someone.        Knife is used also for digging, but carefully, and is also used to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.        Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another ot to carry dirt away from the excavation site.        Skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.        Trowel is the final tool I'm talking about and its probably the most common too for acheologists to use. The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.        I hope you enjoy knowing what archeologists' job is and what tool do they use.            	NNP PRP RB JJR WP DT NNS VBP .

Pick and Shovel- Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth,close to the close to the artifacts. Whisk and Dustpan- Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knife-Used for care full digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow-Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel-A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.   Trowel-Probably the most common tool in archeology.Used to scrape and cut to veiw the differentlayers of soil.                                         Finding Fort James       In 1994, a group of people interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown Virginia.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.Most believed that that James Fort was built by a river.It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.

The fort was called james fort.Most people believed that james fort was built by a river.            However, objects was founed nerby so they thought the fort was further away.the archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burials sites,and tenbuildings all within the border of the fort.       The natonal park service led five years of study.Today people find millons of stuff each year. The object include is pottery, tools, coins, and even meatal toys.

This essay tells you how they work on digging sites, why they must be careful and patient while digging, and what benefits their digging. Remember there is more to archeologists then you think.       Archeologists are split up into teams. The first one of these teams map the area with three-dimensional computers. Those computers track what is underground so that the archeologists will know what the site looks like before they start digging. The second team does the actual digging. They start digging with a special shovel called a skim shovel which can remove a thin layer of dirt with each single scoop. Then the soil is put in a special container that has a 1/2 inch screen at the bottom that lets all of the dirt out at the bottom while the artifacts stay in. Then the archeologists use paint brushes, small shovels, and wooden toothpicks to remove dirt in a process called troweling. The final team studies the objects that were found on the site in a lab.       This whole process takes a long time, and you might want it to be over with. But you must be patient with your work! The people who dug up the site and found George Washington's house said that it took a year to find the slave quarters, kitchen, and storage houses. It took even longer to find the farmhouse. Plus, if you were not careful, you would dig right past the thing or place that you were trying to find.       But, something benefits all this hard work. When you do find what you were looking for it will teach you a little about world history. There is that and the fact that you discovered something that was lost in history for so many years. On top of that there is the joy of doing all that labor and it really pays off.

In 1994,a group of people interested in studying the past started in Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia.For over 200 years.people thought that the fort had been washed away by   a river.Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.

The first objects were found in 1861.Archeologist,the name for scientist who study objects from the past ,uncovered armor and weapons.They also discovered the floors of buildings.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.                                                                                                                                                     The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help then decide where to look for proof of the fort.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.                           Thats when they finally found James Fort!The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the forts walls used to be.Between all the stories they heard and read,and drawings they made,the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.They  made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.The ledges were designed to hold canons.The archeologists also found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites ,and 10 buildings all within the border of the fort.                                                                Today,the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.In the 1600s,people used to throw their trash down n unused well or into a big pit.While digging in the area,the archaeologists found the trash the settlers threw away,including the bones of animals they ate.The imformation learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in James Fort lived.We now know how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.We also know what the settler did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.                                                       It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to people who fist started the American colonies.                                                                                                                                                     Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president.Biographies dont have very much imformation about hs childhood.Thats changing,however.Recent discoveries at Washingtons childhood home had helped historians know more about Goerge Washington as a boy.                                                                                       People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years.Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home.There for,its not surprising that George Washingtons father,Augustine Washington,moved his family there.Goerge Washington was just 6 years old at the time.                                                                                                                                                 No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone.Howevr,archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there.They started digging in 2003.It took over a year,but they finally found it.The first buildings they found were the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.They found the main farmhouse a few yeats later.                                                                                                                   At least four other houses have been built on the Ferry Farm land,so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washingtons farmhouse.Records show that the Washingtons had a fire in their house.The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery.The suggests a fire occurred there.They also found part of a clay pipe.We know that Washington smoked clay pipes,so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house.              The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one.Each year,many teams will work on the site.The can be up to 35 people on a team!The first team maps the area using 3d computers that can track what is underground.The imformation is recorded so that the people will know what it looked like before people started digging.Another team focuses on the actual digging,and the place the team does the digging is called a dig.Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels.These shovels are so small,flat,and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil,one at a time.That soil is then placed in a box with a half inch screen at the bottom.This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.The diggers also use a process called troweling.Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes,and wooden picks to remove dirt.It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section!Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found.The whole process is slow and tiresome,but its worth it.               The discovery of Washingtons home is important for many reasons.First,it give the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famouse.We also begin to know why he made the decisions he did.Another thing it does is help historians learn the type of life Colonial Americans lived.All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.                                                                                   Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved.The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both clasroom and outdoor activities.Kids can explore the site,experience colonial life,and become junior archeologists.Kids can sign up for classes,games,and crafts.The is even an interactive website!It challenges kids to solve puzzles about the work being done at the Ferry Farm.                                                                      Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans.The folks at Ferry Farm are bringing to life the countrys first president in ways we have never seen.

Archeologists find artifacts that are important to history. I read a article that talked about Archeologists finding pottery and clay pipes from  the Washington's house. They found each of the washington's buildings one by one. It took them a few years just to find the main farmhouse of the Washingtons.            Another one of the articles I've read talked about archeologists finding Fort James, a fort built in 1607 believed to been washed away by the river for over 200 years. In 1861 they found the first artifacts like weapons and armor. They also discovered the floors of the building. Over 100 years later, a group effort  to find the exact location of the fort.                   The last article I looked at had pictures of tools archeologists use and described them. I learned about tools like the knife which is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.             This is my report of what I have learned about being a archeologist.

They found artifacts from the fort but still couldn't find it. All hope was lost.             They were exhasted and they thought they would never going to find it. When one day they found it they were so happy. Then they just keep on finding stuff. They found where the settelers through their trash away.

They have to find the right information about it, and the germs that are on it to see if its really what they think it is. They have to use tools to get into it. They use tools to clean it, dust it off, and a wheelbarrow to bring it back if its heavy. If you ever want to be a Archeologist, you have to be very smart. Some Archeologists look for stuff in the 13 colones, because its where the Revolutionary war was, and people left some stuff behind. Others just stay in the united states and look for dinosaur bones, and other stuff. A trowel is probably the most important tool of all, it helps to scrape and cut layers of soil. They started digging the base of Washington home in 2003,  it took over a year. It took a lot of work to find out if it was really George Washington house. Also, in 1994, a group of people started studying Jamestown, they were trying to discover James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia, for over 200 years, people thought James fort was gone. See, being an archeologist is a lot of work!

The tools they use are a pick and shovel most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. Another tool is the whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.                                                  Some other tools are the knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt form around the artifacts. Another tool is the wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.               Another tool is the skim shovel it is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt with each scoop.The last tool is the trowel probably the most common tool archeology. Used to scrape and to view the different layers of scrape.Those are the tools that archeologists use                                  	PRP$ NN MD VB IN NNS PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN WP NNS PRP NNP NNP NNS PRP VBP VBP DT NN CC NN RBS NNS VB IN DT CD NNP NNP TO VB IN DT JJ NN TO DT NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN CC NN VBP VBN TO VB NN IN DT NNS CC JJ NN NN IN DT NN NNP NNP JJ NNS VBP DT NN VBZ VBN IN JJ NN CC TO VB NN NN IN DT NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN VBZ VBN TO VB NNS IN CD NN TO DT CC TO VB NN RB IN DT NN NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN NN PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBN TO RB VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NNP JJ NN VBZ DT NN RB DT RBS JJ NN NNP NNP TO VB CC TO VB DT JJ NNS IN JJ VBP DT NNS WDT VBZ VBP	N		20131022110251	223	2		20131022131431	927		T	20131023094821	533		N

They're called archeologists. Archeologists find things like pottery, pieces of tile, armor, weapons, and etc.To find these things it depends on where the excavation site is.                  When you're an archeologists you have to use many tools, so they can excavate the artifacts carefully. The tools they use are picks, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. They start excavating by using the two tools a pick and a shovel. They use them by digging into the Earth near the artifacts. Another one of the tools they use are a whisk and dustpan they are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts and to clear away dirt from the excavation site. The other tools they use are knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovel, and trowel. They use knives by carefully digging around the artifact and to scrape dirt off of the artifact. Wheelbarrows are used to move artifacts or dirt away from the excavation site. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last, but not least the trowel. The trowel is used to scape and cut to view different layers of soil.                    In 1994 a group of archeologists were interested in studying the past of Fort James. The project was called 'The Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project' ; it was designed for archeologists to find the secrets of Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. When the fort was built near a river they decided to start at a river, but when they found objects somewhere else near the river the spot they found was probably safer than the place they were looking at first. They uncovered armor, weapons, and some pieces of tile floor that might have been used for the flooring of the fort.                     Now thats what I know about what projects and tools archeologists do and use.

Archeologists do this by digging.       This may sound silly but it is a very serious, time consuming and well thought out task.       Usually archeologists work as a group. They first split into three separate teams. When they split into teams this does not mean finding the first treasure is a competition, it is still teamwork. Once the teams are decided the they begin their work.       The first team uses computer-software to find something that might look like something that might be worth looking at. They tell team two and team two starts their job.       When team two knows what they are looking for they get out their tools and start digging. They use tools such as a skim shovel which take small layers of dirt off the ground at a time to check for artifacts. An artifact is something that is old and rare. team two also use other tools like a pick which also helps dig through stone if you get that deep and a wheelbarrow that transfers the artifacts found in team two's area to team three's area.       Team three works in a lab what they do is study the artifacts. When the entire oporation is over the artifacts are ready to be sent to a mueseum!

Though some people might not realize it, but a lot of our history comes from an archeologists job. They find out things from the past. Now lets get into more detail about an archeologists job.               An archeologists job is to study things from he past. Archeologists do also need things to help them do their job properly and successfully. Some of these tools include,   technology such as computers and other special technology. pick and shovel whisk and dust pan knife wheelbarrow skim shovel trowel  and so much more! Of course all these tools are used at least one time in an archeologists job. Lets find out what the purposes of these tools are. Technology is used for lots of things, such as researching the mystery they want to get more background information about, and lots of other things to. Archeologists usually start off digs with these two tools, a pick and shovel. These are used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. A knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Archeologists also us a wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. A skim shovel has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Finally, a trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Those are just some of  the tools archeologists use in their investigations.                                                                                                                                 Did you know that it takes lots of time to uncover things that archeologists are out to find. Have you ever thought about this? Well actually archeologists have to be so careful with each tiny tiny or big big artifact, it actually doesn't even have to be an artifact, it could be information you found that could be key to solving what your looking for. They can't just guess or suppose, they have to do a lot of research even before they set out to find what their looking for. they really have to be precise or accurate. They have to get background information. Like if it was a building and it wasn't there anymore, than where was it when it was still standing. Also even after they have found artifacts it might not be the whole thing so if they do find another piece they would have to find the exact spot and glue and mold,etc. All in all it's like a puzzle, ( but a one million piece puzzle!) Now you see why it takes so long for an archeologist to complete their mission.             Archeologists don't only discover the things their looking for, but sometimes they discover other things to.                                                                                                  An archeologists job isn't as easy as you think, it requires lots of things. An archeologist has a major impact on our history. Thanks to archeologists we know so much more of our history than we would have if their weren't any archeologists.

To begin with,archeologists have been finding items from the past to share it with the world so we can learn about it.Archeologists use items for digging up things like a skim shovel,a pick and shovel,whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,and a trowel.       Also,archeologists once uncovered weapons and armor at James Fort,while discovering that they found out that the fort was in the shape of a triangle.The fort's edges even stretched to a river.                                                                                               However,archeologists use their skim shovels so when they're digging they take off layers one at a time carefully. So if they find something important they can get it easier.                                                                                                In fact,one time archeologists dug where George Washington's house was and they could tell that there was a fire because they found a burnt piece of pottery from a pot. They found smoked clay pipes so they thought that it was part of the house on the roof so infered that it got struck by lightning and then burned down the house.Wow, just a little piece of smoked clay pipe can tell a lot!                                                                                          In conclusion,archeologists find all of these important things because they go to spots in the world. Most of the places that are now history they dig there.                                                                 To wrap this up,archeologists are very important to the world because they find important pieces of the past.Since you read this I bet you want to be an archeologist.

Archeologist find artefacts and many more. But sadly I can not write much about archeologist. So I am going to tell some storys about the history of archeologist. Then I am going to talk about the tools that they use.         Back in 1994, a group of archeologist were interested in studing Jamestown, as a project. The project was for secrets of the fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The fort was built in 1607 when people came from England to start a hole new life. Lots of people belive that the fort was built by the river. So they could dock ships. The archeologist looked for objects. The first objects were found in 1861, they found armor and weapons. The National Park spent years on study of how the land was used. Then they finally found James Fort.The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. Today the groups find around 1 million objects each year.         People have lived in the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It was the perfect location to build a home. So Augustine Washington, George Washintons father moved his family there when George was just six. Archeologist belived that the stone base under the house is still there. So archeologist stated diging in 2003. First they found the kichen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then finally they found what they were loking for the stone base under the house.         Archeologist used several tools to find artefacts. They use Pick axes and shovels are used to dig into the dirt to find artefacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush of the dirt over the artifact, once the artifact is found. A knife is used to carefuly dig/ scrape the dirt around the artifact. A wheelbarrow is used to carry the dirt away and out of here. A skim shovel is used on its flat edge to carefuly remove a thin layer or dirt. A trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the diferent layers of the dirt or soil.         I talked about the tools that archeologist use. And I also talked about storys of archeologist. Now my report is done, I hope you learned something. And enjoide my report.

Those are the tools you need to have a Archeologists dig you need to brake the first lair of dirt. Then you put the dirt in the wheelbarrow.                Know you use the whisk and dustpan to go though the dirt in the wheelbarrow.You need to look for any thing because even a button could be worth some thing.Some people even get famous.You fill the hole with the skim shovel and pat it down with the trowel.                       Then you do it all over again. By the end of the day you may have a lot of stuff worth a lot of money. You may became famous your self. So keep on digging.

The secrets of James Fort Jamestown, Virginia for over 200 years some people had though that he been washed away by a river. Fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to restart a new life most people believed that Fort was built by a river. The first objects were found in 1861 the archeologist, the name of scientist where how study from the past.            Uncovered armor and the weapons, they also had discovered that the floors. Over 100 years later groups effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built. A five year study of the area to figure out how the land was already used. This is when they had finally found James Fort it was the first thing that they had found was set of a marking on the ground. They had showed where the fort walls used to be at between the stories they heard about and read about and the drawing were made. The archeologists knew that Fort was would be shape as a triangle. In the 1600s, people would throw their trash in a unused well also in a big pit.           Digging up George Washington`s Past                  People that haved lived on this land do know the Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years ago. it has been location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefore, its not surprising that George father, Augustine Washington had moved his family over there. Little Washington was six years old at that time. No one knew exactly knew where Washington gone. Archeologist belived that the stone was base under the house it is still there.                 The discovery of Washington`s home is important for many reasons. First it gives the citizens the United States a better home.              Digging around in the dirt can give you alot more than just dusty jeains the folks at the Ferry Fram.

James Fort was built by settlers who came from England to start a new life.People believe that it was built by a river because it would be easier to ship out ships for supplies.Some people say that over 200 years ago it got washed away but the archeologist say's that it might be around because they are finding clues.Their are objects found like pottery,tools,coins,metal toys, and undercover armor and weapons.The archeologist studied it for 5 long years with maps,land, and the area .They finally found the fort by the marks on the floor where the walls use to be they knew it was the fort because they know that it is shaped like a triangle.They realized that there were stone ledges in the river and that ledge was designed to hold cannons.The archeologist found eleven cellars with dozens of burial sites.In the 1600's they use to throw there trash away in an unused well or into a big ditch.While the archeologist was digging they found trash in wells or ditches with also bones from animals.The Powhatan Indians often attacked them and stole their food so know they know that they had little food to eat.It was very exciting for the archeologist to find pieces of our history.                George Washington moved into this house with his family when he was about 6 years old.No one knew where Washington's house was really located since the home was burned down.The archeologist believe that there is a stone base still under the house.They started digging in 2003 it took over a year but they found it.The first building they found were the kitchen,slave quarters,and the storage houses.There is a land called the ''FerryFarm Land''.On the land their were at least 4 other houses,he diggers needed to find evidence if the farmhouse was Washington.The records of Washington say that his house burned down of a fire.The diggers found burnt pieces of clay so there wondering if the fire is true.There was also a piece of a clay pipe,we know that Washington smoked clay pipes.So know we know it is true about what happened at Washington's house.                 How do the Archeologist do this job?Well they do it by working together as a group which is 35 people.They have cool tools like 3D computers that can track underground things so they know were to dig and give them information.They start there dig with a skim shovel then use a wheelbarrow to take the dirt somewhere else.They use small shovel,paint brushes,and wooden picks to remove dirt.It can take 2 weeks for using those tools a 25-square-foot section!Everything goes slow but it is really worth it for finding things in the past.                       Those are things archeologist found interesting but their are many more to go.

The project was a designed to discover the secrets of the james fort in Jamestown, virginia. The fort was built 1607 when settlers cam from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would chose the spot.       The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists the name for the scienist wh study objects from the past, uncover armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built again. The National Park Service led a five- star study of the area to figure out how was the land was used.        Thats when they finally found James Fort the first thing found was a set of marks on the ground. the marks showed the forts walls used to be. they made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way to the river. today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. the objects include  pottery tools coins and even metal toys for childeren.

If you find a bone you have to dust them off and  pull them out of the dirt and you have to beacreful not to break them they are very fragile you must not pull hard on them If you find any other bones that are not dinousoures then you must find out what is it sometimes it can be a fish bone it can be a human bone there is all kinds ofbones all over the world the great thing i like   about  wanting to be one is that you can learn alot of stuff about them it seems so fun you get to travel around the world you  discover new things you can put the bones together you find all sorts of new bones and you work in a lab with cool things to do .                        This sounds like lots of fun but yet this is hard you are constitlany you are hot you have to digg alot it may sound boring to you but it is not boring after a while you get used to it but it sounds hard you might not like it but i am sure i will like it it may have a different job but i am sure you will like it when you are older.                       This is a high class job you get lots if money and you have fun and that is what people wanti know i want to have fun while working i know lots of people have hard jobs some people really want this job but some people cant afford this job some people can afford it but they dont want it so they spend their money on less paying jobs people   need  money and they cant do that with out goodpaying jobs .                       What you need to do is get a less paying job and stay at it untill you have enough money to get a good paying job and then switch to the good one and get enough money to buy a house that is how my family got enought money for food   so listen to people with advice and take that advice.                   Some people needto get  enough money for their clothes and such  but they need to get a good paying job  for food  clothes  houses anything you jusy need to find a good job.                   I would love to be one of theese i just need to find a good paying jobs and be one some people would love to  be one  they just dont know how  and i think i need to find a good paying job i would love to be one and that is why ilove this job.

Archeologists have special tools to help them dig up artifacts like picks, shovels, and wheelbarrows. It takes awhile before archeologists can do anything because they have to do a lot of research on the artifact they are looking for or something related to it.      Archeologists discover these artifacts for people to better understand the history of the artifacts. It also helps historians learn more about how people lived.      Archeologists sometimes start looking for an artifact and find tiny parts of it, but then they stop sometimes. Somebody else will sometimes lead a group and hopefully be more successful. It helps when archeologists find little bits and pieces around the area because then it gives them an idea where the site is they are looking for. Archeologists also work in teams. Each team works on a certain things like computers, where they are actually going to dig, and another team works in the labs studying the objects they found.      Archeologists use a bunch of different tools whether it's people, technology, or stuff they use to dig, archeologists have big jobs.

Well that is what I am her to tell you! Now I know what some of you guys are thinking ''why do I wnat to know about this''? Well I promise you that you are actually going to enjoy this roller coster ride while we are going in loops frome time to time.           Well it all started a very long time ago. When we had world war l, world war ll the civil war, the french and indian war and so forth. Then when all of this was over and we finally had peace treatys started coming and acts. But then we kicked all of those British butts. We had peace again but also little by little everything is becoming older and older.When we started wondering a becoming curous we had what I call the science decade.       When we started getting supplies and getting to work we started learning more and more about the history. That was when all the new science,math and history books started coming becuase we are finding new things bout he history. So just remember when you get new science, math,or history books it means that you are getting more information and details about everything.          Now our achioligists are working really hard on this to makes us happy and more informed. They use many different cool types of tools such as the pick and shovel,the whisk and dustpan, the knife the wheel barrow, the skim shovel and the trowel. Now of course these arn't the only tools they use there are many more but I just thought I'd give you a idea.         Do you folks ever wonder how the archioligists get there names or study or ven how long it takes them to achomplish this? Well Imma tell you I dont know the exact time but I do have a idea. A really,really, long time. These people have to go to a university to get a degree or diploma just to get accepted in a job like this,but if your ever think about it it can be very fun and cool. Please remember though that you will not get accepted in a job like this if you dont study first! Now it even takes more time just find all these types of cool stuff becuase you need to find the stop, get the tool, start searching, and clean.          Well now you have finished this roller coster ride and I hope you enjoyed it.Well at least you took a time back in history,that is something many people dont get to do,but you did today. Please remember you can be what ever you want. Also if you have a question about something that is still not solve dont worry it will soon. I promise!

I have learned about how they dig, how they gather the information, and what tools they used for it all.            The biggest thing I learned about was archeologist and what they did. After reading it all I learned that archeologist where tho ones who find all of our historical information and use it to iether find out how life was, or how a certian person lived, they even had hard enough tasks where they have to find out where a place where something big happened.              Also by reading I learned how they did all there work. Mostly there are three teams. One of the teams maps the area using a 3D computer, they do that because they want to know how it looked before they start digging there. Another team does the actual digging, they do all the finding. The last team spends days in the lab studying the objects finding out what they are.               The last thing that I learned is what tools they used. Here is what the archeologist used to do there job, they used a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knive, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. Those are the tools the archeologist used to do their job.                There are the several paragraphs I wrote on what I learned in Finding Fort James and Digging up George Washington's past.

Another team focuses on the actual digging,and the place the team does the digging is called  a dig.They dig with something caled skim shovels.These shovels are so small,flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at at a time.The discovery of Washington's home is for many reasons.First,it gives the citizens of the united states a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous.

They have to pick a a topic, locate it and then dig it up. It's very hard to be an achiologist. We wouldn't have anything to learn about in school. Achiologists are a big help to everyone every day.                                      First, they have to pick a topic. In order to pick a topic they have to find something interesting that people want to learn about. There are many things that they could pick but some of those things are hard to find. So they have to pick something that is easy to find but very interesting.             Next, they have to locate it. It's very hard to locate things. You have to look it up on the internet. If you cant find it you cant stop. You have to keep looking know matter what. If you cant find it know matter what you do you have to pick a new topic!             Last, you have to dig it up. This is the hardest part of all. When you go you have to make sure you have all the right equimpment. If you forgot something you have to go all the way back and get it. If you hit an important part of the research and break it you cant really do that topic anymore.             In conclusion, it is very hard to be an archiologist. You have to do way more stuff than you think, and it costs a lot of money. You have to pick a topic, locate it, and dig it up. It's hard work but it sounds fun.

Well, I will teach you! Archeologists are very facinating.Let me take you back and lets learn about acheologists!            An acheologist is someone who digs up artifacts. Some are newer, some are older. For example they dug up George Washingtons house. It was the one when he was 6 years old. They were amazed on what they found. Another project they did was the Fort James project. The fort was built in 1607 , which meant that if they found everything, it would be super old. Ever wonder what tools you should have to be an archeologist? Let me tell you.   Pick and Shovel: Used to dig far and find artifacts   Whish and Dustpan: Used to clean artifacts   Knife: Used for scraping dirt off on the artifact   Wheelbarrow: Used to move items    Skim Shovel: Used to remove a thin layer of soil with wach scoop   Trowel: Used scape off different layers            Archeologists have a super important job. If its from diging up dinos to collecting artifacts, archeologists have a very important job. 	NN DT JJ NNP NNP NNP NNP NN WP DT NN VBZ . NNP , PRP MD VB PRP .

Let me tell you about some tools that have been used to find George Washington's house, Fort James, and so much more, including priceless artifacts!              The Pick and Shovel are used to dig into the earth near artifacts.The Whisk and dust pan clear dirt away from an evacuation site. The Knife is used to carefully dig around and scrape off dirt from artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to move dirt or other heavy items away from an evacuation site. The Skim Shovel is used to remove a thin layer of soil. A Trowel, probably the most commonly used tool in archeology, is used to scrape and cut different layers of soil.              Those are some of the amazing tools used by archeologists. Some of those tools were used to discover some of the most amazing things in history. Those tools have dug up the past and helped us advance that much more. We have discovered and learned so much about history and will soon discover more. Thanks to those tools so many artifacts have been found in the earth.

Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.                                                  The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to startanew life .Most believed that james fort was built near the river. it was easierto dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.However,objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.the new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.

If you go to a museam, you would expect to see a dinosaur skeleton there. Well, when they find a fossil archeologists would clean the bones many times then very carefully dry them and try to put together the skeleton and see what type of dinosaur it would be. If it stood on four legs and had a very long neck and flat teeth, that would be a bracheosarus. If it was huge and stood on two back legs, had a huge skull, and had very tiny front arms that would be know as a Tyrannosaurus-Rex. Archeologists help people with every day life. They give constellations a name,Dinosaurs a name, And animals a name.     	NNS VBP NNS WP RB VBZ .

You get to find cool objects. And you get knew equipment. Another is that your kind of like the boss telling people what to do.                                                                                                                                                         To be a archaeologist you have to have patience to wait for when the projects done you know you have accomplished something.Also you have be right and specific on were the artifact is. If you are wrong then the people will get mad at you because they wasted all there time digging at nothing.A archaeologist job is a very important job, because the help find objects to make the whole wide world know about it.                 A main reason a archaeologist became one is probably because when the human saw what the man/woman did he probably went to school to become to inspire kids to become one and find new objects. To inspire kids about learning is a opportunity to actually teach them to become one some day and to set goals for some of them.           Second of all you can find out all the history of how Indians lived back in the day. If you wanted to reconstruct what a Indian village looked like. You could dig up artifacts make houses and in the huts put the artifacts and make a museum. That would be a great lesson to teach kids of natives.           Third of all when archaeologist found James Fort they found cellars for captives. Also they found burial sites for the deceased or perished.When they dug they found ten building probably for the family's to live in.After they dug they put all the artifact they found  and gave it to the museum to show kids.T o actually get to handle into a museum is very cool so when you go to the museum you get to say hey that is my great work.            Last of all our greatest president Gorge Washington  our archaeologist  found were gorge  lived when he was moved at the age of six.They found a building with the severvant's quarter's . Also a kitchen and a storage house to keep food in. Later they found proof that Gogre Washington lived there by records of a deed.           That is why I  think it is important to  become a archaeologist so that you can change the world. You can find new artifacts that have never been heard of. You can make a muesuem too! Also find history. Last but not least you can search up on your greatest hero's!

The word archeologist means 'scientist who studys objects from the past'. Archeology is a major part in the    United States of America. Archeologists have been a part of the finding James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia and the learning of George Washington's childhood.These were very interseting escavations.           James Fort was a fort built in 1607 by English settlers. Settlers left the fort and it is said did not tell anyone of the whereabouts of the fort beacause many people believed it was built next to the river, yet the first objects found in 1861 were found farther from the river. Litte did the archeologists know that it wou take over 100 years to find the fort. The National Park Service led a five-year study in the late 1980s-early 1990s era. The people did a mapping scan of the area. They used it to make an image of the area and found the fort.           Not alot was known about George Washington's childhood because there was no known information about him. Archeologists led an escavation at Ferry Farm where it is known to be George Washington's childhood home. Of course there was no house because it was destroyed. They dug underground trying to find a room. One year later they found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farm house a year later.

These are the items they use and information the tools archeologists use.Pick and shovels are the starters of the mission to find artifacts.Whisk and dustpan are used to brush off the dirt and germs off the artifacts.Knives are used to scrape off the dirt off the edges.Wheelbarrows is a transportation item to carry objects place to place.Skim shovels are used to remove small layers of dirt that is why it is called skim shovel.Last but certainly not least the trowel,trowels are the mostly used tool in archeology.

Long ago, in 1994, a group of people were interested in long lost artifacts, buildings, among many others. This 'studying of the past' began the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was designed to discover the secrets of Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia (one of the thirteen colonies). For over 200 years, people thought that Fort James had been washed away by a torrent. Some say that it might be around if archeologist discovered the area. Now, about a hundred years later, a group of archeologists teamed up to find the long lost artifacts of the now-old-and-historical Fort James. To help find the area of the fort, they rely on the National Park Service (which led a five-year-study of the area). The group of archeologists knew this would help them decide where to look for definite proof.   When they reached Fort James, the first thing they saw where footprints on the ground. These marks showed where the fort's location used to be. But, that's the first thing they found, because today the group of archeologists had found one million of these artifacts now to be shown at a museum. These include pottery, tools, coins, and metal tools.   One other unique find is the long lost tale of George Washington, his home, and the many artifacts that he had.   A group of archeologists (different from the ones that discovered Fort James) teamed up to 'dig up' George Washington's past. The archeologists made a trip to Ferry Farm to CAREFULLY dig up the artifacts George Washington had when he was six. First, information is collected before the dig. Meanwhile, another team of archeologists focused on the dig of Washington's past.  This team started with small, flat, and sharp shovels called skim shovels. These shovels can only remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. Then, it's placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom, which lets dirt fall out while artifacts stay in. Archeologists also use troweling, another digging process. Troweling is when archeologists use wooden picks, small shovels, and paint brushes. Meanwhile, another team studies the artifacts. The dig is tiresome and torturous, but it's definitely worth the dig.   Kids can also get involved with being an archeologist. In example, Ferry Farm can offer many kids to get involved, so they open the George Washington society, which runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activites. Kids can explore the site, learn about the life of a colonist, and become junior archeologists. Kids can also visit an interactive website.   How to become an archeologist is simple. You just start with a pick or a skim shovel, scoop up the earth with a dustpan, then scrape off dirt with a knife, carry it away with a wheelbarrow, and then the troweling starts. It may not be a clean and short job, but it's worth the try. Just keep digging until you will find the long lost artifacts of a historical person!

But it's your job to find and discover what the question had asked you. Some people that are interested in what hasn't been discovered yet become Archeologistses. Others just learn from books, the internet, or the news.                                If you are an Archeologists you have to travel all around the world. Most Archeoloists like to dig up fossils, dinisor bones, or find any thing that used to be when the dinisors were alive ,others like to find famous peoples past such as their childhood. Some Archeologists go to China just to complete history.                                     Most Archeologists get dirty, wet, or even sunburned just to dig up history. Others try their best not to. Some don't even care. When they dig they use a pick and a shovel. When they hit something, they use a whisk and a dustpan. When they are done with that they use a knife to clear dirt around the artifact. As soon as there done with everything they use a wheelbarrow to take all the dirt away. Then they take it to the lab to be tested on. Maybe later they might see that artifact in the meusem.

The national park service led a five-year study objects of the area to figure out how the land was used. they knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. the people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area .beetwee all the stories they heard and read, and drawings they made , the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. they made maps and found  out that the fort streched all the way to the river.           In the 1600s, people used to throgh their trash down and unused  well or into a big pit.while digging in the area, the archeologists found  the trash the settlers through away, including the bones of animals they ate.the information learnd from these objects helps us understand how people in the james fort live . we also know what  the settlers did to survive the dificult years when they had little food.           It is exciting to discover objects that were regulary used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. it gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the american colonies.

They also discovered the floors of  buildings.Over 100 years later a group effort  to find  the exact spot  where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.They knew  that  this  would help them decide  where to look for proof of the fort.the people doing the study used computer mapping software to make  an image of the area .       Thats when they finally found James Fort!the first thing they found was marks on the ground.the marks showed where forts wall use to be.Between all the stories they heard and read and saw drawings they made the archeologist knew that fort would be shaped like a triangle. they made maps and found out that the fort stretched all  the  way to the river. then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. the ledges were designed to hold canyons. the archeologist  also found eleven cellers ,dozens of burial sites and ten buildings  all withen the boarder of the fort.           Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. the objects include pottery, tools, coins, and  even  metal  toys  for children. in the 1600s  people use to throw their trash down  an unuse well or big pit. While digging in the area the  archeologist found the trash,settlers threw away, including the bones of  animals they ate.

James Fort ,They found him by making maps and they found him on 1861,there groups found him on the river, and James Fort first found the object of the history he made.                        when they build Fort it was in 1607,when the settlers came from england to start a new life that they had made.Fort was built near the river that they lost him, and it was located far of his counrty.                                   The concluesion is they lost him by the river and built him there and he made new houses for the people that had no houses and he got lost and they found him on 1861 .

You find a lot of different things.It is like a trip back in time   Archeologist have the ability to go to many different places.You may go to the   dessert and find some Hopi things.You do not always stay in one place.You go off into the world with things and stuff!So it's like I'm going on an adventure.   In your quest to be an archeologist you may encounter many different things   like:Golden pottery,Gold and Historical things.With a golden piece of pottery you could be like,' I have a golden piece of pottery and you don't.'You may also get gold.Then you can give it to a museum for real money.Then you may buy more things.Every thing you'll find will be something historical.Then you can be rich and famous for finding that.   Archeology is  like a trip back in time.You get to learn things about history based   on the things you find.Let's say your in England and you stubble upon a staff engraved King Henry III.Now you would know England had a  king named Henry.The old things you might find are part of the story of history.An old village might be fun to discover.You can go inside the house and find out how they lived.   Archeologist have a great job.They get to travel.They find many,many,things.   They will also learn more about history.

Its hard work for archeologist because they spend all their time diging for fossels.The items they use is hard for diging and they spend most of their time using their items they use.They find fossel and collect them or return them to the musium and they earn money for finding them.                 Archeoligist have to have water just in case they get tired and a rag because when they sweat they can wipe tha sweat.Archeoligist have to becareful because if they  fall they can get hurt.Archeoligist need to have medicine and bandades so when they dont feel good they take meaicin and if they get a cut they can put a bandades.           Wheelbarrows help them move items from one place to another.Its important because they need to move things to places.              The knife helps them dig and to scrape dirt around the artifact.It also helps by cutting food they eat.           The pick and shovel can help them by digging to.The pick helps by hitting the dirt to make holes.The shovel helps by taking the dirt away.           There are many other items that help archeoligist.Thing that help them are good because you can find thing you never found before.Water and food are the most things that can keep archeoligist alive.          A wisk and a dustpan  can help archeoligist by sweeping the dirt out of the way and to clean things that you cant see or thing that are yours.          Archeoligist need weapons to because something can come and hurt you so you need weapons.Archeoligist travel the world finding fossel.They spend all there time digging for fossels.

They find stuff about the people in the past that we don't know about. When they find something new they make a history book and put it in there. Thats how we know about George Washington and his life story.          George Washington has a very interesting life story. Most biogrophies don't really have information about his childhood. Or when he wasn't famous. When George Washington was six years old. When George got older he was in the military. Then when he got a little bit older and retired people nominated him to be the President Of The United States.         When George Washington died 12,000 years later  in 2003 archeolegist started digging where George Washington used to live. It took them more then a year but they finally found what they were looking for that whole time. They found the main farm houses a few years later and many other things baried.          No one knew exactly where George Washington lived. He lived in a building when he was younger than six. Archeolegist belived that the stone base under the house was still there.          A few other houses were built when George lived there. And they knew one of them were George Washingtons. So they digged and digged and records show that there was a fire at the house. The people that dig found pieces of burnt pottery. They also found clay pipes. Now we know that George Washington smoked clay pipes.          There was 35 total people that found the evidence about George Washington. They found a lot of stuff that was George Washingtons. Now there are more people living where George Washington used to live. I think that is pretty cool.          That was how George Washingtons lifetime was. He was a very successful and rich man. He had a very good life and I hope Everybody else has a good life.

Or they could look for a famous persons skeleton if it hasn't been found. The tools used by a Archeologists are Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow,Skim Shovel,and a Trowel! The Pick and Shovel are used to dig farther in the earth to find facts.The Whisk and Dustpan are used to brush dirt off the facts. The Knife is used to scape dirt off of the facts. The Wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt from one place to another. The Skim Shovel is used to remove thick layers of dirt. The Trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil!

A long long time ago there were people who were famous that had died and there is still some mysteries behind them that people do not know of.So people called archeologists go and look for artifacts and clues that help them figure out either how their childhood was or even how they lived as an older person.       I'm going to start off with George Washington.George Washington was the first president of the United States,and a lot of people knew how his life was when he was older and the president,what a lot of people did not know was how lived,where he lived and what he did.So archeologists went and looked for artifacts and clues about his younger life.       When the people went to go look for artifacts and clues about his younger life they had to bring a lot of things with them.Some stuff was technology and some stuff were tools made out of metal and wood.       Some of the things they used to find artifacts and clues were pick axes,shovels,whisk and dustpan,knives wheelbarrows,skim shovels,and trowels.       when the archeologists used these tools they found burnt pottery clay pipe.It shows that this was George's home because there are records on the home that says that the house set on fire and there was records that he lived there and now they just proved it for real.       So this is what they do in cases of trying to find were they grew up or what home they lived in.               I am going to be starting my next topic.My next topic is on finding Fort James.           Fort James was built in 1607,when the settlers came from England to start a new life.For over 200 years people thought that Fort James was washed away by the river it was by because the could not find it.Well it took a lot of hard work out of all of the archeologists.So I am going to tell you what they did to find it and what they found inside of it.       When Fort James was built most believed that it was built near the river,which is was but it was a little farther away from the river.When they found the first objects of it in 1861.       What the first objects they found were armor and weapons.These artifacts were maybe used by some of the settlers.        But they still did not find Fort James. So The National Park Service led a five year study and how the land was used.All of them knew that it would help them figure out where to look for proof of Fort James.All of the people doing the studying used computer mapping software to make a good image of where the fort might be.       That is when they found the fort.The first thing that they all found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks ment that is where the walls of the fort used to be.Between all of the stories that they heard and read,and the drawings that they made they just knew that it had to be in the shape of a triangle.They made maps and found out that the fort streached all the way to the river.Then all of them realized that there were stone ledges built on the side of the river.The ledges were made to hold canons.The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens and dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.       And now today the group finds about one million artifacts each year!The objects they find are tools,pottery,coins, and even toys made out of metal.And now that Fort James is found the world is changed!               And the last thing is that you should always be getting involved with cool and fun activities for yourself and to learn more every single day!!!!!!!!!!

They take for ever jest to get started in the area because you will need a big space in order to get what they are looking for. It may take a week or longer to get started on the field or yard. The tools Archeologists use are a Pick,Shovel,Whisk,Dustpan,Knife,Wheelbarrow,Skim Shovel,Trowel.           The Archeology started over 20-30 years ago and it is still going today. I know someone who dug up a dog one time. It is hard work to dig underground because there can be gas lines,lava,high levels of carbon dioxide. The risen why I think it's fun is because you can fine remains of someone or something.

They started digging there in 2003. the first buildings they found were the Kitchen, slave quarters, and storage house. at least four other houses have been built on the ferry farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof that it was George Washington's farmhouse. Records show that Washington's had a fire in their house. The digger's found peises of burnt pottery, they also found part of clay pipe.We know that Washington smokeed clay pipes,so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house.

To find artifacts in an area, the archeologist will need many teams, each team needs at least 35 archeologist. Each team will have their own part in their area. Each person will also use a set of tools. Let's take a look at the first team of archeologist.           The first team uses 3D computers to map out the area and track whats underground. Information has to be recorded for people to know how it looked before they started to dig in the area. That is what the first team will do to search for artifacts.           Another team comes in to work on digging.The team will dig in an area called a dig.Archeologist use small, flat and sharp shovels used to dig thin layers of soil called skim shovels. The soil is put into a box with a half inch screen at the bottom for the dirt to fall out and also use a technique called troweling, which is when they use mini shovels, paint brushes, and picks made out of wood to get dirt of the artifacts. Then the third and final team will work on the rest.           The next team will soon take the artifacts to the lab. They will be taken to the lab to be studied and researched on. It will take days to study the artifacts. They also use different computers to research on the artifact. They will also tell what time period the artifact is from is due to what the artifact could be used for. This is was what the third team will do with the artifacts.           There are many reasons why it's important to find artifacts.One reason why it is important to find artifacts to have proof of what happened in history. Another reason why is it tells us more about other famous people in history. One last reason is it could also tell more about other time periods. Those were a few reasons why archeologist search for artifacts.           Here are a few tools archeologist use that people commonly know. One tool is the trowel, the most known tool which is used to cut and scrape different layers of dirt or soil. Another tool is the skim shovel, its used to carefully remove thin layers of dirt. Other tools are the pick and shovel, they are mostly the first tool used in a dig. These were the most known tools used by archeologist.           These tools are also used by archeologist, but are not known by most people. The first tool is the knife, which is used to scrape the dirt off of artifacts. A few other tools are the whisk and dustpan, it is used for to brush dirt away from the evacuation site. The last tool is the wheelbarrow, it can be used to carry dirt to certain areas. These were a few of the tools used by archeologist.           This passage told you about archeologist and what they do at their job. Such as what tools were used to find and research about artifacts. Another thing we learned is what role or part each archeologist have. We also learned why finding artifacts are helpful. Archeologist help us find out more about Earth's history.

The archeologists sometimes have a hard time, they have a hard time from all the work they do and how much time they spend getting the job done. The job takes  a long time because they need the area to be perfect. They also need to find artifacts to find out about the person or the thing that lived long ago. And they need a lot of tools to do that.            Why do they need that many tools?            Why do they need that many tools? Good question, they need all those tools to do their work like shoveling.   They use the tools pickaxe and shoveling and mining. They also use the whisk and dustpan to dust off dirt and dust from the old artifacts like vases from famous people's houses like George Washington. They also use the whisk and dustpan for cleaning the floor of the houses.            Why do they need that many tools? (part 2)           Did you know that they even use a knife? They use a knife for Careful digging. They sometimes need the hole to be perfect. They also use the knife for scraping dirt and other things off  the artifact. They also use it for cutting artifacts in half like some clay. Did you also know that the archeologists use wheelbarrows? Well they do, they use the wheelbarrow for carrying artifacts without breaking them. They break the artifacts by accidentally dropping them.            Why do they need that many tools? (part 3)            I know this is getting boring but lets get on with it. They also use a skim shovel. A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge so it can scoop more equally and less at a time. They use it for digging a perfect hole and to smooth out the dirt and other stuff. The archeologists also use a trowel it is probably the most common tool in archeology. They use to scrape and cut things off of the artifacts and they also use the trowel to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. And there is many more tools that they use.            How Important are archeologists?            The archeologists are very important. They are important because they help us discover new things every day. They are also important because, If we didn't have them in our lives then they would be no discoveries about the past. They are important by helping people get new information. And they are important in many other ways.

Archeologist also use a whisk and dust pan. It is used to brush dirt off artifacts and to clear dirt away from the artifacts. Archeologist dig up artifacts from animals and other things.       Archeologist jobs takes a lot of work but its cool. They use 3-d computers to locate fossils. They dig up fossils or remains of things or people. They use tools like knife for careful digging or scraping dirt around the artifact. Archeologists is a fun job because you maybe can find dead peoples stuff and learn about them or maybe you can keep it and become rich.

If you want to be an Archeoligist, you need to know these things about the archeoligist's life.       The job of a archeoligist is about research, finding atifacts of the american people who once lived here in the USA. They dig up dirt and rocks under our feet and they go to computer and look underground where is the artifacts is. After all, it's not all about digging and going on the computers, sometimes it looking around in the place where the artifacts is. For example, archeoligists found in Washingting's  house were picture on the walls and vases. Some people are often enjoying archeoligist so much, but people often hates archeoligist. Archeoligist search for the 1600s-1800s artifacts.        Archeoligist goes to states to states to find these artifacts that they research in the computer. They also use some other tools that some people had never seen or use in there lifes. Like a skim shovel, exact knife, a trowel, whisk and dustpan, and a wheelbarrow for digging up artifacts. These tools are perfect digging artifacts just to let you know. Arceoligist maybe a adult or grandpas, I think.        People study really hard to go to this job as a archeoligist. Archeoligist use alot of tech to do this digging expectation, they go outside and walk to the artifacts they found under ground. People in the past like the 1800s or the 1900s go to these places with less tech! Archeoligist are proud of this job about digging, walking, using strange tools, and researching of all these things that they built in there brains.

I bet that's what your thinking. Well Archeologists are people that studys people or things from the past or you can call it history. but i am going to teach you about finding fort James. the fort was bulit in 1607 when settelers came from england to start a new life. Most belvied that it was bulit near a river  the freist object was found in 1861. Archeologists was the name for the people who study people from the past.over 100 years later a grop effort to find the exact spot where the frot was bulit began. The people doing the study used computers mapping software to make an image of the area. that's when they found James Fort!!!!! they found a mark on the ground was the frist thing they found. while they where diging in the trash and the bone of the animal  that they ate. they say that it is exciting to find things about history.                this pragh I will stell you a little bit about George washington's past.                                    people use to live on the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000 year's. George washinton's father moved his family to the ferry when George was only six year's old at the time. It is 35 people on the team the frist team maps out with 3D computer under ground. Ti is a lot of work in being an archeologists. You have to coraperate with the team to get things done. even if you are not there friend. Thing's are really hard for them but it will be even harder if you are not very intersted in it then I will only have to words for you good luck. what it means to discovery of washington's home is importan for many reasons.I will give you two reason 1 it give citizen a better understanding of who he his. 2 you get to know whay he did what he did.

So Archeologists are people who find things from back then from people who were famous. Who lived back then. Like George Washington the house he lived in. Someone had to thing that he didn't think he live there so that is why a Archeologists when in there a looked and find out he did live there and that is why today it is a musitum. A Archeologists has got a lot of information in the musitum about how George Washington and his family's house burned down and all those things.    Here areso things about a Archeologists works and how it finds thing and all the things that a Archeologists can do like finding things and working on things.     I wrote three paragraph about how A Archeologists do to work and how there find things.

The archeologists discovered armor and weapons. They also discovered floors and buildings.                                            They are very nice and kind. They are so nice and kind because they take their precious time to do that for people like me.

Archeologists are important people because if the world didn't have them we would be doomed. We wouldn't have awesome people in our lives to find artifacts and stuff from amazing people that died.                                                                                                                 They also did another thing that was very important. They dug up George Washington's Past. Not litterally, but they found amazing artifacts and stuff from George Washington's childhood.

The first thing they do is dig to find objectes. They skim the groud first then they dig .Sometimes they find something sometimes they dont.   Then they study the item to see if it belonged to the person and if it held important informateion.   After they were done studying it and if it was worth something it was sent to a musem were it is showen.

First when a group of scientist called archeologist find something to look at and investigate, they have to have the right technology. Like they use computers to determine where they should start looking. Once they find that spot, they have to find there tools.     As I just said, they need their tools. These include; a pick and shovel, a brush and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, (which if you were wondering, only picks up a small amount of dirt at a time) and a trowel. These tools are all important to an archeologists job.     So there you have it, what an archeologist does and how they do it. And that cocludes my story.

It about they have talk about the history in the past like when they have to talk about finding fort james like a group of people were interested in studing the past started the jamestown Rediscoverery Archaeological Project. So they learned about about finding the fort James                                                                 It also talks about when some people are digging up George Washinton's past (the first president).Like finding the spot, like when people have live on the land called Ferry Farm for 12,000 years . the location makes it a perfect place. And also people knew where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone.It also talks about digging up the past, like how the archeogists fing the things in Washington home from years ago. like digging at the ferry farm is a careful place. Some groups of people team up almost like 35 people team up. The first group use 3d competers to track what is under ground. The other group focuses on the actual digging. I also talks about where the author gets the information from.Like some ideas were from http://www.socialsudiesforkids.com and http://wwwlibary.thinkquest.org and http://www.ehow.com and http://www.uwlax.edu.edu and http://www.kenmore.org and http://diganthro.wordpress.com and http://wwwnps.gov and http://historicaljamestowne.org and last but not least httpl://apva.org.

The natinoal park service led a 5 year study of the area to figure the area out of how the land was used. They  knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort . The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.  Thats where they foung james port  the first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. the marks showed the forts walls used to be . between all the stories they heard and read and drawings they made  the archeoligists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.

Archeologists are people who study objects from the past. They help people discover objects from the past and what they meant. Archeologists use many sources that help them like the internet, the internet helps them discover more information about the object. There are many reasons why does the job of archeologists are important and you are going to know.        Many times archologists work in fossils and when they do they learn many intrusting things just like us, so that means we have something in common with them. Fossils are dead things that were in the past, as time past their shape began going to form a shape on a object. Archeologists wanted to know what happen to the thing and how did it die. Archeologists were smart but sometimes they had trouble discovering the informationn of the thing that was dead, they can even lasted months or years searching about what happen to that thing.        Archeologists also use many stageties to study the object from the past. Finding Fort James was difficult, for 200 years people thought that the fort had washed away but the archeologists were going to prove them wrong. Most people believed that James Fort was built near the river, the firt object they found was in 1861 it was uncovered armor, weapons, floors, and buildings. Archeologists used mapping software to make an image of the area because they wanted to figure out how the land was used. In that time they found James Fort, the first thing they saw was a set of marks on the ground, the marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between the stories the heard and read they knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle with all kinds of things.        Acheologists use many hints, tools, and sources. One of the tools are the skim shovels, they used this in digging up a spot that was known as Ferry Farm, people had lived on this land over 12,000 years. Augustine Washington lived there when George Washington was just six years old. No one knew where was the Washington home wqas located since the actual building was long gone. Archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there, they started digging in 2003, it took over a year but they finally found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses, they found the main farmhouse a few days later. Records show that the Washington had a fire in their house.        As you know, archeologists use many tools for many things. Pick and shovel are one of those tools, most digs start with these tools, they used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. The whisk and duskpan used to brush dirt off the asrtifact and clear away dirt fro m the excavation site. A knife is used for careful digging and to scape dirt from around the artifact. The wheelbarrow used to move items big or small from one p[lace to another. Finally a trowel is a common tool of acheology, it used to scrape and cut to view the diffrent layers of soil.        Now you know a few reasons about why the job of the acheologists is important. Archeologists do a lot of important discoveries and I thank them for helping us discover items that are from the past. Doing this report about acheologists job was important to me and I hope you like it. Acheologists are the best and smart for discoveries.

Usually arceoligists go to places that are hidden or abandon.  Places were peopled or you can say mankind hasened been to in years.  This is what arceoligy is this is what arceoyligy means and this is also what it displays and I will try to explane that in my paragraghs.  When people talk about dinosours and ancent times no one really takes those things serously.  Like how the history chanles sometimes just add aliens to big discoverys.  Well I guess im just exagerating.             I find it interesting when the sorce two says most of what we know about George Washinton is his time as a   soldier.  I find that interesting because when we think about bio's we think of the hole life story.  The childhood the teenage years the adult hood and the later life.  Also from article two it thrills me to learn that know one actualy new were his house was located.  It makes me wonder, did the revolution really happen like this or is there somthing else we don't know.  Like historys little secret.  One thing I always will understand about the revelutionary war is that the colonists only fought for themseleves.  Native americans were getting their land taken away because of the colonies.           When It comes to history arceoligists need to do a better job of finding proof.  It took them yeors to find proof that George washington lived there.  It made sence to me though that George Washington lived on a frarm the Ferry farm because at  this time 1780-1800 lots of people such as George Washington himself lived on a plantation farm.  Going back to arceoligists they said they said a fire occured at his house or farm.  The source also said they found some clay pipe, considering that Washington smoked pipe this can be easy to believe.   This concludes my small report on arceoligists, thank you.

You get to look at wonderful things, see thing that you have never seen before and use things that you've never used before. You get to see the remains of a very famous person that lived long ago. You also get to see what they ate and what they lived in and also where they lived.        You can get involved with Ferry Farm. The George Washington club runs summer workshops and outdoor activities. Kids can explore the site and discover what its like to be in the Colonial Life. You can become a junior archeologist. Kids can sign up for day classes, games and crafts.       In 1994 a group of people interested in the study of the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.   The project was designed to descover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 yrs., people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around there.       The fort was built in 1607 when some settlers came from England to start a new life upon them. Most belived that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock the ships there. So it made sense that the settlers would have chosen that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was built further up river.  The new spot probably gave thee settlers more cover from the enemy ships.        Today a group has found about 1 million items a year. Like pottery tools, old coins, and even metal toys they used for children.  In the 1600's people used a well or a big pit that was unused to throw away their trash. While digging in the area, an archeologist found the trash the settlers threw away like, bones of animals they ate. The information learned about these objects help us know how the Jamestown people lived.

First a archeologist uses a pick and shovel to dig or open the ground a little bit, so the rest of the team can get into it to find something. Then they use the wisk and dust pan to move the dirt out of surrten spots. After all of that, they can finally start using the knife. Ok to get this straight they'll use the knife to pick away at the bone or anything they find really.                                          Now we can move on to something a little differen't. The team usually has someone to carry a wheelbarrow to move all the that they don't need away. Next they use they skim shovel to dig a little deeper into the ground, but, here's the cool thing, the skim shovel doesn't just dig it also skims they very top of the mud, dirt, or anything the archeologist don't need that's in theirv way. Last but not least is the trowel. They use the trowel to just nearly skim the top of the soil.                       Archeologist do alot of differen't things to help us find out more about our history.

Before no body knew about George Wshington. Past  recorded so that people will know what it looked like   before people started digging.

Many archaeologist don't find a lot of thing but sometimes they do.They don't find valuable things but they do it so they find artifacts.            Some archaeologist get very famous some don't. Some find dinosaur bones some don't. Some archaeologist can be in the lab researching the bones and taking DNA samples off of it.They found Jamestown in 1966.                         The tools that they use are special too.They use screens to find artifacts. George Washington house burn down and they didn't have any trace of it. Jamestown Fort was near a river.                                    They built it right there so it would be easier to get shipments in. Jamestown Fort also had a trash hole. The trash hole has many artifacts in it.George Washington moved to a farm when he was six years old.                                                   The shovels that they use were flat and wide.That shovel Diggs up a thin layer of dirt.Archaeologist also use whisk to brush the dirt off the artifact.European People settled in Jamestown Fort.      George Washington live on Ferry Farm. He lived with his mom and dad when he was a boy.It was four other houses on that farm.It takes two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot hole.They used paint brushes too.       I think that Archaeologist are very important people to this world.If it wasn't for Archaeologist we wouldn't have historical sites and museums.like Jamestown archaeologist are still working on it.Also George Washington home is now a summer camp.That is why i think that archaeologist are very important people.

Most  of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president.Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood.That's changing,however.Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more  about Washington as a boy                                                                                                                                                   	VBG NNP NNP NNP CD , DT NN IN NNS JJ IN NN DT NNP NNS WP VBD TO VB DT NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD TO VB DT NNS IN NNP NNP IN NNP , NNP IN CD NNS , NNS VBD IN DT NN VBD VBN VBN RB IN DT JJ NNS IN DT NN VBD IN PRP MD RB VB NNP NNP IN WP PRP VBP IN NNP NNP VBZ IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN CC NNS VBP RB VB RB RB NN IN PRP$ JJ POS NN , JJ NNS IN NNP POS NN NN VBP VBN NNS VB RBR IN NNP IN DT NN	N		20131021093321	925		N	20131021201838	551		N

When the archeologists went to ferry farm where George use to live they found burnt pottery they also found part of a clay pipe. they also discovered that the house where George use to live got burned.               The archeologists also went and explore Fort James and they found many different things.They found covered armor weapons,they also found floors of buildings this objects were found by the archeologists in 1861.Then years later another group went and just found marks on the floor of where the walls use to be.They also found pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.

I will tell you all about it.        First of all, life isn't easy at all, especially archeologists because they have to work hard.they always have goals to accomplish because they are scholars. Yes, scholars and its because the dont snivel or whine about the heat their sore spots or anything.        Second of all, her a piece from the passage:the people study everything. That inspired me to be a scholar. See what   I mean about being scholarly.

Its a guy/girl who digs to find history. Here's what it does.                    First, the tools they work with is really cool. A pick and a shovel is mainly used for digging up stuff. A whisk and a dustpan is used to brush dirt off. A knife is used for careful digging. Then, a wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil. Last, a trowel is used for scraping thin layers of soil.                 Second, one house they worked on was George Washington's house! we couldn't find much of George as a kid, but thanks to archeologists we found more about George's childhood. Archeologists found the house in 2003 where George was living in. The first places we found was the kitchen, slave quarters and storage houses.                 Last, the artifacts about Jamestown Island. In 1994, a group of people were interested in studying the past about Jamestown. For over 200 years, people thought that James Fort was washed away by a river. Discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.                         From tools, George Washington, and James Fort, this is all about archeologists. Archeologists helped us in history. For that we like archeologists. 	VBG IN NNP NNP PRP RB JJR WP DT NNS VBZ .

Archeologists work really hard with there research and information.There job is really hard researching all day and finding artifacts.   If you were a archeologists you had to work really hard and get your information right and discover and you need to be careful because if your not the artifact will fall and break and it would be a waste of time.   Archeologist are really interesting they discover things from long ago.And things that are part of history.They also help us learn about history and from people that lived long ago.

They are hard workers. How they find items are with these supplies like a pick, shovel, whisk,dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel all os these supplies help archeologists.

An archeologists job is more than just digging. It is the fun of finding new things, it is the credit of a discovered lost artifact, and it is of course, the joy of, digging. An archeologist is a person who digs up and discovers old artifacts from the past. Of course, they cant do it all alone. The Archeologists takes in a team of up to about 35. Together, they use a variety of tools to dig up the 'past'.          Some of the tools they use are, the pick and shovel, the classic tool to break away rock and dirt, a whisk and dustpan, used to brush off dust from artifacts, a knife, used to carefully dig and remove dirt, a wheelbarrow, used to move items away or into the excavation pit, a skim shovel, used toremove soil, amd of course, the trovel, a common tool used to clear away different layers of soil. Using these tools alows archeologists to dig for artifacts.           Just being a good worker with tools and artifacts doesn't mean that you can be a good archeologist yet, you must have lots and lots of patience. A full excavation may take many many months to many years. An archeologist must also be good with artifacts all the same. To become an archeologist, you must have these traits and more.          Don't worry if you think being an archeologist might be boring. There are many interesting parts to being an archeologists that may be exciting. Discovering a rare atifact might be very interesting. 'I found George Washington's old kitchen pot!' Things like that could happen to you. Also, the fame of discovering something is an exciting part to.          Being an archeologist may be very hard work but it will pay off in the end!

Have you ever wanted to become an archeologist? An archeologist is someone who tries to discover artifacts to help us understand more about history. An archeologist has to have a craving for finding something new, but also has to be patient and go through all the steps you have to do to clean the artifact. Well, I am going to tell you the pleasures and the frustrations of being an archeologist.           The pleasures of being an archeologist is that you get to be breathing fresh air outdoors. This job would be great for people who love the outdoors. You must have a feeling inside of you that you need to find something new, to discover. You also get the chance to find something nobody has ever found before. Also if you found something people have been searching for years you can become earn a lot of money, or even be famous! You also have to have patience. So if you are a person who takes there time and does not like being rushed this is the job for you because you can take your time brushing dirt off and making everything look not dirty, then you will fine. If you have all these qualities ad are enthusiastic about this job you can sign up now!           The frustrations about being an archeologist is that sometimes searching for artifacts can take years. Also if you try to hurry the artifact can break and you can get upset with themselves. Another reason is that if you have no patience this is not a good job for you. There are very few reasons that archeologists are bad jobs.       As archeologists you have an important job of informing the public and discovering new thing. Over all in my opinion archeologists are important jobs.

But for some people, this job will not fit them well, like me. What if you are spending 5 hours searching for artifacts about Abraham Lincon, and you don't find anything. I don't have any of that patience.            Some people may be wondering what an archeologist is. Well, I'll tell you. An archeologist is a scientist that searches and digs up to find information about a persons past. Archeologists dig up as many things as they can. If they don't find anything the first day, they'll continue the next day either in a new spot, or a little farther away from the old spot they started on.            There are several different teams to dig up these artifacts. The first team maps the area using 3D computers so they can track what is underground before they dig, so they know what they are digging for. another team focuses on the actual digging. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skin shovels. These shovels are meant to remove thin layers of dirt at once. Then, the dirt is placed in a box with a screen at the bottom so the dirt falls and the artifacts stay in the box. The archeologists then use paint brushes and pick to remove all the dirt from the artifact. Another team spends days and days studying what these artifacts are, what they mean, and what they are used for.            Archeologists can find so many things even if they were from last week, or 1 million years ago. But what are the tools that they use to dig up these items from 1 million years ago? well, do not worry, i will tell you. Archeologists use many items to help them find these items. They use picks and shovels to dig into the rocks or soil. The whisk and the dustpan are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts. They also use the knife to carefully scrape off the dirt around the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to transport items from one place to another. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The trowel is probably the most popular tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut soil to view different layers.            Do you know what archeologists usually look for? They usually look for ancient artifacts from the past. If an archeologist is looking for information about Abraham Lincon's childhood, he would most likely start at his house to look for toys he played with, what his mom or dad used to cook him food, and other items like that. Then, they would move on to where he was starting to become a grown man. There, they would look for things he used for his job. Finally, the archeologist would probably look at his home at the time when he was married.            As you van see, being an archeologist has its ups and downs, but I think being an archeologist would be out of my reach. This is just my opinion at age 11, mabye at age 16, I might change my mind. Would you want to be an archeologist?

They do many things such as, find artifacts that fill in gaps and questions in history. They also discover things from the past they nobody did know. The artifacts archeologists find are very important, we too can also learn from the artifacts they can find. We can learn something from each artifact they find, we can about things like, where James Fort was or what weapons Indians used in the pasts. Those are very important things we can learn from artifacts.       Archeologists use many tools to dig up artifacts too. They use important tools like a trowel, skim shovel, a wheel barrow and much much more. These tools are very important, they each do an important job to the artifact. For example a whisk and dustpan, the whisk and dustpan sweep off dirt off the artifact and the dustpan collects the dirt and they also clear away dirt from an excavation site. Even though they are very small tools they are very important.       Even though archeologists wait a long time to find an artifact it is worth it. These steps to find an artifact seem pretty simple but they take a lot of time and its harder than you think. These steps are what I believe they do.The First step is to find the spot where you think the artifact is, But you have to find clues to know you are in the exact spot. The next step is a team of people maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. That information is recorded so the ones finding the artifact can know what it looks like before they start digging. After that step They start digging, they dig carefully so when they are digging they won't break the artifact. Then once they find the artifact they carefully grab it and clean it off with specific tools. Once they are done they report back to the team. These steps take a long time but it is worth the wait.       In my opinion I think that the job of an archeologists is really interesting. I think the job of an archeologist's interesting because digging up artifacts seems very fun. And there's a lot of suspense whether you found or not. But personally I wouldn't want to become an archeologist because I am not very patient and I just want to find things immediately. Even though it seems really fun digging up artifacts and things I wouldn't want to do it myself. I can't believe the archeologists have enough patience to wait and wait till they find something. Their job is very amazing.       Overall archeologists work is very amazing. They work very hard just to find one artifact or more. They have very important jobs. I'm glad we have archeologists in the world because without them we wouldn't know anything in history or back then.  I am very glad we have archeologists in this world.

The whisk and dustpan are used to sweep off extra dirt. The knife is usually used for careful digging or for scraping dirt around artifacts. A wheelbarrow is used to move items or to carry dirt somewhere else. A Skim Shovel is a shovel with a flat edge that is used to remove a thin layer of soil.

So today, I will talk about archeologist.When you are archeologist, you need to have a team. For digging and founding. For example, 35 people. And you need to know where you need to digging. Then, you need to use 3D computer, why?       Because you need to know where the object you are trying to find it. If you knew where it is, you can start digging, but there's two way to digging, first, you can just digging with skim shovels. Skim shovels are sharp, flat, and small.   Second, this way called 'Troweling'. When you're troweling, you need to have small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square foot section.       So this way is better to do when the object is small or it's not so strong. Archeologist is usually digging for find more history. For example: They found the James fort and found canons and armors. Also they know the ledges were designed to hold canons. Also in 2003, the archeologist found the our first president, George Washington's home. First they found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then they found the main farmhouse a few years later.       You see, job of archeologist are very important, because we can know how George Washington lived when he was a boy. And we can know how he became famous. So I think the archeologists are cool and important in USA.

Not everyone knows what an archeologist is or what they do, but they are still very significant. Archeologists are people who study history. They are significant in many different, but similar in some ways . For example, we need scientists to discover earths history and teach it to todays people so no one is confused on what happened and why it happened.       Archeologists have been known for their important studies, because of history happening since the first day of earth archeologists have been at it for decades maybe even centuries. They're known for discovering non-living things to living things and exinct things to fossels. In the past life time, scientists didn't have the technology that we have today so they couldn't find that much evidence on what happened before. However, todays technology is more advanced in many ways which provides acheologists to go deeper into their thoughts and reasons. Although, its still hard to be an archeologist because history is told through man to man and some stories are told differently which could lead to false imformation.       Archeologists have used technology and hand tools to dig up the finest and fairest information. The tools they use depand on the history they are trying to descover. For example, you would have to use a trowel to scrape and cut to veiw different layers of soil, a smim shovel which has a flat edge used to carefully remover a thin layer of soil which each scoop, a wheelnbarrow to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt or heavy objects away from an excavation site, a knife used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts, a whivl and dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, and finally a pck and shavel because most digs start with these two tools they're used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. Those tools are some of the tools you would use if your trying to find history from when exinct or dead living things or to find the history and information from a fossel.       In conclusion, archeologists are scientists that discover earths history and pass it down to people, they use many technology and tools to dig up the evidence of what happened, why it happened, and how it happened. They are very significant scientists and they help provide information to teach others of the past. Archeologists have been around for centuries telling man to man about recent and past times. Todays archeologists are more fortunate because they have more advanced technology to study more and more about the past. Therefore, archeologist will continue gathering information and facts about history and pass stories down, there will probably be no ending to this. 	NNS : NNP PRP RB VBN WP DT NN VBZ CC WP PRP VBP .

It helps us understand more about the past by providing us with artifacts of the DNA of someone such as a piece of hair. Archeologists provide us with some of the most important items ever like dinosaur bones and Abraham Lincoln's hat.         The first step to an archeologists job is to map out the area of where they are digging with a 3-D computer. The computer will show them how the land looked before they started digging and it will also show them what is in the ground that they can excavate. Since you need a lot of people to dig there are 35 people to a team of archeologists. Team one is the most important because they map out the area.         The second step is to start digging where you think the artifacts are if your lucky you'll find some. this is a very important step because it lets you get the artifacts. Artifacts can range in all different sizes and different rarities.                      The third step is 2 trowel the dirt, you trowel by saking it in a pan with little holes in it. Throweling lets you find the small artifacts that you might have not seen. Troweling also takes skill because if you shake to fast an artifact could break or fall out of it.           Without archeologists we would have trouble finding about the past.

A lot of there discovery's includes finding body's of extinct animal's.

It is also cool because they can find stuff by digging and looking very hard to find suff in the ground like dinosor bones and look up the dinosor they found.  Then they see what they have to do.  Then they start to build the dinosor that they have found.  They also look stuff up so they can see if they are right about there observation and know thier anser to all thier questions if they need to know somthing.               Also in 1994, a group of people interesed in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.  The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed awey by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.

Archaeologists often find armor,pottery,money and tools. Like in Finding Fort James'' they found armor and weapons. Probably including swords and guns. But sometimes they find things a lot allot bigger than armor,pottery,money and tools. In both reading sections they had to dig up the buildings and houses.They found a kitchen,slave quarters, and storage houses in Digging up George Washington's past''.            What did they use to find all this stuff ? Well some stuff they used was simple like a wheelbarrow, whisk and dust pan, and a shovel. But some things wer more complicated like a skim shovel, and trowel. A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil at a time with each scoop. A trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Most of thees tools wer used in both sections.

That is what I'm going to talk to you about. So here I go. Archeologists used a pick and shovel to dig dirt from the ground. They used a whist and dustpan to pick up dirt from the ground but from the inside. The knife was used for scraping dirt from around. they used a wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another but mostly dirt is moved. Now the skim shovel its a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last but not least the trowel it is a common tool they use. It scrapes and cuts to see the many different layers of soil. That is what Archeologists use to do many things.

Many people thought that it had been washed down the river it was made close by too, or destroyed and too broken to try and find. Around 200 years later there were signs that those theories were wrong and that James Fort was still there. The Jamestown Archaeological Project groups were determined to find more about this fort and prove the theories wrong.          One reason why they are so determined is in 1861 the first objects were found, armor and weapons to protect the fort, they also found they also found the floor of the fort. They didn't stop and around 100 years later, they found the exact spot where James Fort stood and stayed strong enough to find now. A 5 year study was worth it! It took computer mapping software and hard work to find the wall marks and stone ledges over the river it was built by. This showed that canons used to be there and also found cellars, burial sites, and ten buildings. They found even more things and each year even more.          Clearly this shows that the Jamestown Archaeological Project proved the theories about Fort James destroyed and washed down the river wrong! They had found the cellars, buildings, artifacts, and marks where the fort had been. Team-work and determination really helps. It took years and years to have this project come through very successful and now we all can know much more about James Fort than we did.          In conclusion, determination and believing that you are right pays through. The Jamestown Archaeological Project groups should be proud of them selves for believing and being determined in what they believe and what they have done for their country. We today know much more about the James Fort than what we did a couple hundred years ago, just because of one group determined and believing in them self ready to discover what they want.

Archeologists have a difficult, but rewarding job in   which they find ancient artifacts. They use many different tools, and use them to find different things. They have to go through different steps in order to find what they are searching for. These are the ways archeologists dig up history.       Archeologists first map the ground where they will dig. They use 3D computers to track things in the   ground. The image that comes out is the map of the area. They then record all that information, so the diggers know what it is like in that area. The mappers have an easier job than the diggers, though.        The archeologists that dig do it in the place called the dig. They use tools such as a knife, pick, shovel,   trowel, skim shovel, whisk, dustpan, and wheelbarrow. The tools are each used for different reasons. The diggers first start digging with their skim shovels, which remove thin layers of soil at a time. The dirt scooped is put in a box with a small screen at the bottom, letting dirt fall, but keeping artifacts in. Archeologists also use their trowels in a process called troweling. That is when they use small shovels, picks, and brushes to take away soil and dirt. The digging part of archeology is undoubtedly the hardest.       The final step in archeology is studying them. Another team of archeologists spend days studying the   artifacts found. The people who study the artifacts find information about the past. They can find out how people lived, or use the artifacts to find a specific place. Studying the objects is probably fun, since you can find information about history.       As you see, archeology is a hard job that many people rely on to find historic things. The artifacts   archeologists find are useful in finding information about history. Without archeology, what would we know about history?

The Long Job of an Archeologist                    What is an archeologist? An archeologist is a person who goes to find some thing that is very old using all kinds of resources. For instance, if you are trying to find something that belonged to the vikings, then you would have to go to where the vikings lived Archeologists go through difficulty, hard thinking, and pride while working. Archeologists go through a lot to find these wonderful things and without them, we wouldn't know much of our history.                  To start, an archeologist's job is difficult because a lot of things that they are looking for are very fragile. They need to use special tools and be very careful because of these fragile pieces. It is also difficult because if they mess up one thing, then all the blame would be on them because they just ruined history. Lastly, it is difficult because most of the time it takes a very long time to find out what they are searching for.                 Initially, being an archeologist takes a lot of thinking because before you even start searching for what you want to find. For instance, if you wanted to find something that belonged to the vikings you would have to do a lot of research and studying before you start looking. They also have to do a lot of thinking because they need to know what they are doing. If they do the wrong thing and they mess up, then everything will get ruined.                  Most importantly, one of the most exhilarating part in an archeologist's job is feeling pride. They probably get this feeling when they finally discovered what they were searching for. For example, if you finally found where George washington lives, then you would feel it because you finally found your discovery. They would also feel pride because most of the time, it takes them a long time to find there discovery and usually, when you've been working on something for a long time and you finally finish it, you feel pride.                  To conclude, archeologists are very important to us. they put a lot of time and effort just to find history for us. Archeologists have very stressful jobs, but they always manage to get their jobs done. They are also fantastic role models on us and are a big part of our education.                                                                                  	. DT NNP NNP IN DT NNP NNP VBZ DT NN .

Archeologists are people who 'dig up the past'. There are many archeologists all over the world, and they all do different things. For example, some dig up fossils of dinosaurs to discover about when they lived and etc. while others study artifacts that date back to 1300 B.C. The phrase 'digging up the past' was made because archeologists had been digging for facts about the past through artifacts and other. Many of the pottery pieces, statues, and pieces of statues in museums came from the work of archeologists across the globe. Archeologist's jobs are to find clues about the past.                      Now a days, some of the tools used by the archeologists are picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. Even though we are in the 21 century, they still use these basic tools. Along with this, current day archeologists use 3 dimensional computers to scan the ground for remains and they use other technology too. We are lucky to have modern day technology to help us in many things. Archeologists can take less time, energy, and money using these tools because then they don't dig up the wrong areas. Some of the tools archeologists use have special jobs. For example, a pick and a shovel: used to dig into the earth, can cart away dirt. A whisk and dustpan can be used to: brush away dirt and uncover artifacts/ clear away dirt from search site. Knives are useful to do careful digging around artifacts and to scrape dirt away. A skim shovel is useful because you can take thin layers of dirt off. One of the more common tools throughout the world is the trowel: used to scrape and cut into the soil. There are many tools, modern and classic, used in the study of archeology.                      Throughout the years, archeologists have discovered many interesting things. For instance, some archeologists are currently on a search for an ancient Mongolian king's, Ganges Kan, tomb. Others searched for George Washington's house. All studies took at least 2 years. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be an archeologist. Years if work may result to nothing. Many, though, believe it is a good job because you get discover the past. One article I read was called Finding Fort James. Fort James was part of the Revolutionary War and settlement of America. Early settlers lived there so after 200 years, in which people believed it was washed away by the river, the National Park Service asked some archeologists to go looking for traces of Fort James. It took 5 years, but finally they found the triangular structure stretching from the river, back into the mainland property. Many other searches have been issued to find facts about people of the past, how they lived, and etc.                       Overall, many studies have taken place throughout the years to find facts about the past and there have been many archeologists. I think that being an archeologist would be fun, but not my dream. it's just not me. Through and through, archeology is a hard job. 	VBG NNP DT NNP : NNS NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WP DT NN VBZ .

In 1607, when settlers came from England to start a new life, most believed that James Fort was built near the river. The first objects were found in 1861 by scientists who study objects form the past.                    Also, archeologists tried to dig up George Washington's past. Since no one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long ago, the archeologists decided to try find the house. They started digging for the Washington house in 2003. Though it took over a year, they finally managed to find it. The first buildings found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They actually fond the main house a few years later.                      Finally, the tools that they used were a pick and shovel that start the digging and close to the artifacts. Secondly, archeologists also use a knife which is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. To continue, these scientists use tool called a trowel which is the most common tool for a acrheologist to use. They are used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Fourth, archeologists use a wheelbarow to move items form one place to the next or to carry dirt away from the area. Fifth, they use a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Finally, archeolgists use a whisk and a dustpan to brush off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.                   These are the tools that most archeologists mainly use to dig an find the valuables of fomous people and places that know one knowa anythein about.

Archeologists are people that dig and find all the things you see in museums. I bet you don't believe me but it is true. They also find a ton of cool things! For example; some archeologists find bones, jewelry, gems, and other cool things. Some archaeologists even find hidden cites, old Indian camps that haven't been used for years, even George Washington's own house! Some even find dinisor bones, tracks they made, old nests, petrified eggs that never got to hatch, and more! I wish I were an archeologist because of all the cool tools they use  and amazing things they find.                                Some of the tools they use they use are, a pick and a shovel to start digging away to get rid of the harder dirt, and a wheelbarrow to carry away all the dirt. They also use a whisk and a dustpan to take off dirt on the artifacts and to get rid of the dirt on the excavation site. There are many other tools to such as a knife for careful digging, skim shovel to remove a thin layer of dirt, a trowel to also do very careful digging and lastly, ( my favorite ) a 3D computer to see things underground. Isn't it sooo cool? I wish I had one!                                 Did you know Archaeologists also find famous buildings that every one thought were gone and impossible to find? They even found the house that George Washington lived in and James Fort! They found many things that will help us understand more about the past. They found burned pottery, clay pipes and kitchen utencials at George Washington's house. Along with armor, weapons, gold coins, stone ledges, metal toys for children, and food scraps from James Fort.                                 Learning about things like this is fun ( to most people ) and also educational. I hope that you all can learn more about this and maby discover something to.

Archeologists dig and find these things underground.       Archeologists usually find things that include pottery,tools and coins. they also find bones from the animals they ate.

Biographies don't have many information on when he was a child. Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.           People had lived in the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It's makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefore it's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was just six at the time.

An archeologists jobs is to find thing about the past. The only thing I saw an archeologists are a skim shovel and a pick and a shovel.

They keeped looking and found where people put their trash.Then for over the years of searching they found where it was built! today archologist find over 1 million object are found! The end.

Archeologists sounds like fun but some people dont like dirt.So i don know about you I would like to a archeologists.Did you know there is 35 people in one group of archeologists. Well think about if you want to ba archeologists or not.

Archeologist have an important job in life becaues they need to find out things about people. A lot of the time it's famous people. They need to figure out what certain people did in their life and thier childhood. It's very interesting.           Archeologist have to use special tools because they don't want to damage anything. One of the tools they use are pick and shovel. This is use for to dig in the earth, close to the artifacts. Another one is the whisk and dustpan. This is used for to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Next is the knife. The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. They use this thing called the wheelbarrow. This is used for to move iteams from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The skim shovel is used for to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last, but certainly no least the trowel. The trowel is probably used to most often. Used t scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.             Now who wants to be an archeologist!

Well, hopefully this report should answer all of your mind boggling questions that you have been dying to have answered.            First off, an archeologist's job is to pretty much uncover history. And, as you probably know, digging up the past is a long, laborious process. They pick different sites such as Mr. George Washington's own childhood home! Wouldn't it be interesting to learn all about his childhood since we really don't know that much about it? Archeologists pick other interesting sites as well. If you could think of one famous person who would you pick?            Archeologists have fancy, technical, modern day tools that play a big part in discovering our American history. A few example of tools and how they are used are:       The pick and shovel. The pick and shovel usually start the digging process. Their job is to slice and cut and dig into the earth to get close enough to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan. The whisk is used to simply brush off dirt and unwanted rubbish off the artifact and the dustpan is used to clear the dirt away. Just like a good spring cleaning! Knife. A knife is used for precise and sharp digging. Also to scrape dirt off of the artifact. The wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow is practically used for the same purposes of yard work. It is used to clear dirt away or to transport items to another area. The Skim Shovel. The skim shovel removes one layer of dirt at a time using a flat, sharp edge.     6.The trowel. The trowel is used to dig, scrape, and cut to see different layers of dirt.       Now that you have viewed the different tools and their purposes, you can probably guess how long and frustrating at times the archeologist's job is!            The sites the archeologists when to recently are Fort James and George Washington's old house. Some of the tools they probably used in the dig at Fort James are the wheelbarrow and knife and probably whisk and dustpan. The tools they probably used at George Washington's old home was probably the wheelbarrow the pick and shovel and the skim shovel.            As you can see, the archeologist has a very long job that could take hours upon hours of their time. But they have a very important job no less and without them, we wouldn't know half of our history. 	NNS CC PRP$ NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WP DT NN VBZ IN PRP$ NN .

Archeologists are good at finding important pieces of information and solve mysteries underground. Archeologist also have great tech that they can use to study and identify the different materials and substances on the different objects.           Archeologists can be very important. They can find pieces of information that we can't find in normal resources that could be important to know and find things that we have been trying to discover. We can always discover important things with archeologists that can be identified and studied by scientest that could turn out to be important information. Archeologists have different tools that are very useful to dig into the ground and create space for the archeologists to start their journey underground.           Archeologists have great tech that can be used to find images of what's underground and where there is a clear path where they can walk. The people who studied used computer mapping software to make an image of the area where the men are walking and to make sure their safe.           This is what an archeologist does for their job, they work underground to find objects and to identify them. Archeologists are important because they help us solve mysteries that can be very interesting and important.

Artifacts are old things such as temples,fossils,etc.                 The first artifacts were found in 1861.Archeologists uncovered armor and weopons.THey also diascovered  floors.Over 100 years a group effort to find the spot wherethe fort was build. The national park service actually found it.

For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. The first objects were found in 1861. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. That's when they finally found James Fort. The archeologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people whou lived hundreds of years ago.

I don,t know if that is what they where doing but that is what it looked like.        There was a guy that picked up something I was looking to see what it was it looked like a piece of gold but it wasn't. It was a ruby red diamond.The diamond was glaring through my bedroom window.        I went up too that guy and asked him if I could have it, he said probbably not son, and I said Oww shoot. Man how much do you think it is worth. He said I don't know $102.00 would that work sure son thanks.        Soon enough someone else found something it was also shiny my mom said I walked out and seen it , it was a huge nugget of gold. It weighed five LBs. I asked him if I could have it he said no this time but the next time I could no matter what.        He dugg for three hours and fifteen minutes.Finally he found a cryistal,flat piece of silver, and a gold nugget. He said he can't get nothing out of the silver or cryistal so he just gave it to me. Cause he reminded me that I could have the next thing that he finds next. 	NNP WRB VBP PRP VBG .

They also used Pick and Shovel, Trowel. The tool that they used the most was Skim Shovel because it had flat edge that carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Archaeologist studded everything from the past. 	JJ NNS VBP NNS WP JJ IN DT JJ IN JJ NNS NN CC WP PRP VBG VBD VB VBG NNP NNP RB RB JJ CC NNP NNPS VBP NNS PRP VBP NNS IN DT NNP NNP . . .

Just like when the archeloigists helped find Fort James in 1994 then they studied the reasearch and now its in books and in museams such as Henry Ford mueseam. Ilearned that it was built in1607 with is almost 500 years ago . However,objects found nearby were suggesteted  the fort was located a little farther the were it was found.                   Archeologists who study objects from the pasted ,uncover  more history. When they found Fort James the first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed were the walls of the building were.They are suppose to  find information  about history.

In 1861 the first objects were found.They discoverd that they found armor and weapons.They also discovered that thet found the floors of the buildings.Over 100 years later,agroup effort found the exact spot where the fort was built began.That's when they finally found James Fort in Jamestown,Virgina!The first thing that they found where the marks on the ground.The marks showed where the James fort's walls used to be.There were ledges that were designed to hold canons.                       Today, the group still finds nearly 1 milion objects a year. This objects include pottery,tools,coins and even metal toys for children.In the 1600's, humans used to throw their trash downan unused well or into a big pit. While digging the archeologist found bones of animals they ate and they found the settlers trash. This is what the archeologists found when they where digging.                  In conclusion, I realized that is hard how the settlers lived.One of the reasons is the food because if they had alot of kids and little food you cant feed everyone. Another reason is that the Powhaten tribe often attack them and there people died so they going to have less people each time they attack and they barely had soldiers.                                                                                            Digging up George Washington's Past             Humans have lived on land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years.Its location makes a perfect .Therefore,it's not surprising that George Washington's Father Augustine Washington, moved there to live. George Washington was a little boy at that time he was six years old when that happened.             No one knew exactly where he lived location since the actual building was long gone. How ever archeologist think that there is a stone based underground. They started to dig in 2003. It took over a year, to find the house. The first building had a kitchen,slave quaters, and storage houses. Few years later they found a main farmhouse.         In conclusion, I realized that George Washington house was born by a fire. Learned that Washington smoke clay pipe and live in Ferry Farm.

In 1994 a bunch of people interested in the past created the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. This project was made to find old secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia. For Over 200 years, some people thought the James Fort was washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might be still there in Jamestown,Virginia. The James Fort was built in 1607 when new people came to the 13 colonies to start a new life. Many people thought that the James Fort was built near a river. It was built there so it will we easier to dock their ships there so it made sense that the people would chose that spot to dock. The objects found nearby suggested to move the fort to move farther. The new spot that the settlers found was more protected from enemy ships.In conclusion 1994 was when the start of the James Town Rediscovery Archaeological Project.                  In 1861 archeologists found the first objects. Archeologists discover armor and weapons and they also discover the floor of the James Fort. Over 100 years later people tried to find the location of the James Fort again. The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to try to find how the land was used. They new that that it would help to find the location of the James Fort. The people doing the studying used a computer mapping software to imagine how the area would look like.They finally found the location they found marks on the ground the marks where the fort's wall.The archeologists thought the shape of the fort was a triangle but it was really stretched all away a crossed the river.  In conclusion found objects that lead them to find the location of the fort.              Another thing that archeologists study was George Washington. People have lived on the land called Ferry Farm for over 12,000 .It makes a perfect location to built a a house. That's why it is not surprising that George Washington's father moved his family there.When his dad moved him to Ferry Farm George was only 6 years old!No one really knew were was his home located since the actual building was no longer there. However archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. The archeologists started to dig in 2003.It took them over a year, but they finally found the stone base.The first thing the archeologists found was the kitchen,slave quarters, and the storage houses.After a few years later they found a farmhouse.In conclusion George Washington lived in Ferry Farm              At last the four houses have been built on Ferry Farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof why this was George Washington farmland.Records show that Washington had a fire in their house. The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery. This suggests a fire occurred in his house.They also found a part of clay pipe. We know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so this gave more proof this was George Washington's house.In conclusion the archeologists found 4 houses and they think one of them is Washingtonians         	NNS NNS VBP NNS IN NN NNS IN DT NNP NNP CD DT NN IN NNS JJ IN DT JJ VBN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NN VBD VBN TO VB JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP IN NNP , NNP NNP NNP CD NNS , DT NNS VBD DT NNP NNP VBD VBN RB IN DT NNP NNP NNS IN DT NN VBD IN PRP MD VB RB RB IN NNP , NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD VBN IN CD WRB JJ NNS VBD TO DT CD NNS TO VB DT JJ NNP NNP NNS VBD IN DT NNP NNP VBD VBN JJ DT NNP NNP VBD VBN RB RB PRP MD VB JJR TO VB PRP$ NNS RB RB PRP VBD NN IN DT NNS MD VB IN NN TO NNP DT NNS VBD RB VBN TO VB DT NN TO VB NNP NNP JJ NN WDT DT NNS VBD VBD JJR VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN CD VBD WRB DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP CD NNS VBD DT JJ NNP NNP NN NN CC NNS CC PRP RB RB DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP CD NNS RBR NNS VBD TO VB DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD DT CD NN NN IN DT NN TO VB TO VB WRB DT NN VBD NNP NNP JJ IN DT PRP MD VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNS VBG DT VBG VBN DT NN VBG NN TO VB WRB DT NN MD VB JJ RB VBN DT NN PRP VBD NNS IN DT NN DT NNS WRB DT NN POS JJ NNS VBD DT NN IN DT NN VBD DT JJ CC PRP VBD RB VBN DT RB DT VBN DT NNP NNP NN VBD NNS IN NN PRP TO VB DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NN WDT VBZ NN VBD NNP NNP NNP VBP VBN IN DT NN VBD NNP NNP IN IN CD JJ NNS DT NN NN TO VB DT DT NNP NNP POS WRB PRP VBZ RB JJ IN NNP NNP POS NN VBD PRP$ NN -NONE- PRP$ NN VBD PRP TO NNP NNP NNP VBD RB CD NNS JJ .

How life was back then and find supplies that was there when we weren't. Then they come back to there lab and they study what they had found.When there done they come back and go and find more stuff.But at a different place.Then they just do the same thing over and over again.                                   Then when they are all done with there reasearch on that study or lesson. Then they move on, to a maybe harder study or reasearch.Then when there done on that study they go on a even more challenging level.So as you can see I am describing it like it is like  school or college.But it isn't always the way I describe it, it could be written  in a different way.                                       Then after years and years some people retiare and then they leave.Then after they leave they pick new people.Of courseif they finished college. Then the new people go through the same process. that the others went through.

An archeoligist is a cool job becuase they get to find stuff that are very old and study the ancient times they were on the grounds.They also get to expierement things.They also get to see they world because some people have to go around the world to go to there jobs and find cool stuff.They also get to move to places around the worldand get to find stuff about George Washington and other presidents or famous people that we probably don't even know becuase they weren't born at our time of year.Archeoligist also pick up heavy things, so thats why they need to use the wheelbarrow.I bet its fun to be an archeoligist because when they find things they probabaly don't expect what they are finding so its like a mystery.They also get to dig into places to see if there is anything valuble and look and look through some things to see if they find anything cool. They also get to use some really cool tools like Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim shovel, and a Trowel!! They also get to explore lots of people and learn so much about them.I think they work all day to look where this famous person lived or where they were born. :D 	NNP NNP NNP NNP . . .

Archeologists need to be careful about some tools and need some pacents so the jo can get done with having to hear are we done yet they can  hurt them selfs and they what will happin if one person hurts the self and they are alone then what can you do after you hurt themself then you have no water to clear the cut.

They get to also get to experment cool things. They get to find cool stuff. They also get to see the world because some people have to go around the world to go to there jobs and find awesome cool stuff, they also get to move to places around the world and get to find stuff about Geroge Washigton, Or any famous person. Some Archeologst find stuff that are very very very HEAVY! and they need to carry that or use a wheelbarrow to carry it for them. They get to find some really cool stuff!!! I bet its fun for them because they don't even know what there expecting to find, so it kinda like exciting and a mystery. They also get to dig into places to see if they can find anything valuable and look threw some things to see if they find anything cool. They get to use some really cool tools like... Pick and Shovel,Whisk and Dustpan,Knife,Wheelbarrow,Skim Shovel, Trowel!!!!! They also get to see lots of intresting things when they find cool,valuable stuff. They also get to explore lots of peoples cool stuff that they find somewhere. But when they find something heavy sometimes they have to carry it like up mountains,valleys,acroos rivers,With a wheelbarrow I bet its kinda hard for them.

They find important things in history that could change somebody's mind about something. Archeologists are very important if we didn't have them we might not know where the tombs of Egypt are or what happened way back before even Jesus was born. We wouldn't know about the dinosaurs or dinosaur types if we didn't have archeologists.       Some of the most famous artifacts were found by archeologists. They spend years and years looking and searching not even knowing what they are going to find. But they do it so questions cane be answered and myths could be known. What people came before us and what customs and culture were they? We wouldn't know that with out archeologists. They are very important with modern technology. We wouldn't have our world today without archeologists.

I think an archeologists job is hard beacause they have to make sure that they didn't miss anything in the dirt. Also when they find something they have to sit down brush it off and find out what it is they've found.                In some days it might be boiling hot but you still have to get out there and work. And at other times it might be freezing outside but you still have to get out there and work.                Sometimes it isn't even an exciting artifact. So it's like you just dug but what you found you don't even like. Other times you do find something exciting! I would be super proud of myself, just like you should be proud of yourself if you found a artifact that was very exciting.                          In a way it could be fun being an archeologist.

It's not easy to be an archeologist, but it can be fun too every job is hard in some way. Some people think that jobs are easy, but all jobs are easy in some ways and hard on anther. I feel like archeology is one of the hardest jobs for me because you have to: do some researching, looking for the artifact, digging, dusting, and a lot more researching on the artifact.             If you want to be an archeologist when you grow up then you should start practicing now. To prepare to be an archeologist I get some thing that i dont like too much then I ask my sister to hide it or burry it then i try to find it. When I found it I predent to research by going on my iPad tap on notes and I pretend to describe it.             Archeology may seem to be a fun and easy job, but just like I said every job has ups and downs. Archeologist look for burried things so it may be easy looking it's still hard. Picks,shovels,whisks,dustpans,knifes,wheelbarrows,skim shovels, and trowels are all of the tool that archeologists use. They use every tool in a different way and every single one is an important tool for archeologists.

Archeologist have to be careful in the process of digging up artifacts.        One example of them in action is when a group archeologist went to find information on George Washington's past. The archeologist went to the spot where Washington's house used to be to look for artifacts. It took a year to find the spot but they did. The archeologist used many tools to find artifacts. They started digging with a skim shovel that can dig layer by layer in the ground. They also used a have-screen box, small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to help them find artifacts of George Washington. After they took the artifacts they found to a lab to get checked.        Another example is when a group of archeologist wanted to look for James Fort. It took 100 years to discover where James Fort was located at.  They looked for it with computer mapping software to make an image of the area.         Those are just some great discoveries that archeologist make. An archeologists' job is tiring and tough but it helps us in many ways.

Those people are archaeologists. Many Archaeologists dig up old artifacts or small pieces of things hundreds, and maybe thousands of years old. There are archeologists all over the world. There are archeologists in China, Canada, Australia, Russia, Kenya, France, and here in the U.S.A. There are archeologists many other places, too.   Tools they use are pickaxes, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels,   and trowels. Everything is used for something different. I bet you were wondering what a trowel was, or the difference between a skim shovel and a regular shovel. Well, I'm about to tell you.   Pick and shovel   Pickaxes and shovels are used to break and dig up dirt near the spot where the artifacts are.   Most digs start with these two tools. Picks are used to break up dirt and make the easier for the shovel. Shovels are used to dig dirt up to make the artifacts easier to get to.   Whisk and dustpan   These tools are used to brush dirt off of artifacts. They can also be used to brush dirt away very   close to the artifact, so the archaeologist won't damage the artifact.   Knife   Knives are used to scrape dirt away from the edge of the artifact. They can be used  to scrape   dirt from the insides of artifacts.   Wheelbarrow   Wheelbarrows are used to haul dirt away from the dig site. They can also carry heavy artifacts   away from the dig site.   Skim Shovel   This tool is used to dig layer by layer of soil from the dig site, and is mostly used when close   to the artifact.   Trowel   The most common tool used. It is used to scrape away dirt to examine the layers of soil.       Now I hope you know more about archaeology and how it's done. Thank you for reading my   report about archeologists.

Would you want to be an archeologist? I am going to tell you about the job of an archeologist! The tools they use, where they discover the past, and digging!                                I have you heard about those people that are discovering new things? They are archeologist! Archeologist use many tools to find interesting things. Some of the tools they use are a Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. The pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Now those two are really needed! The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Boy, those are two  things you will miss if you forgot them at home! Careful digging and scrapping dirt from around the artifacts is easier if you have a knife. Moving items from one place to another isn't easy without a wheelbarrow! Wheelbarrows are also used to carry dirt away from the excavation site. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The TROWEL is the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. If this one is not in your back pocket, you probably won't be finding anything!                                  For archeologist to find things they have to find the spot first.   Finding the spot isn't easy, you have to search and search and search.  Another thing that you have to do is to calculate where (for example) George Washington lived and where he would go, etc.  You would have to figure all that out then go there and find it.     It doesn't sound so easy, but it is quite enjoyable!                                                           Digging is a BIG part in archeology. Digging isn't that easy, it's not supposed to be, but digging can be the best part if you think about it. The digging leads you to the end and the suprise is waiting there!  Also you have a team of up to 35 people so that makes it a lot better! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Skim Shovels are used for when you dig. The whole digging process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.                                          You see archeology is a big job! You have a lot of work to get done and that work is very important! It is an enjoyable, good experience job too! You have to work hard and get dirty but that's where all the fun comes from! The past is always fun to find in the present to show the future! So you should try archeology as your job in the future, I might even consider it!

Those scientists are called archeologists and they study objects from a long time ago. They collect the data, find the artifacts, and use different tools to do it.                Archeologists need a place to start so they can conduct the investigation. That's where the data comes in. They use other scientist's research to know where to find what they are looking for. After they know where to look, they have to create data of their own to help other scientists. If they want to figure something out they have to find the problem and use their knowledge to research it. Collecting data is a giant part of how they discover information.                   After collecting all their data, scientists can look for the artifacts. This is important because actually seeing the objects makes it easier to study them. Archeologists look for artifacts where they know they can find them. But why do they look in the first place? This question is very easy to answer. Archeologists look for artifacts to find out more about the lives of people who lived before us and to advance in areas where other people needed help. Scientists also look for artifacts to find how things came to be. Documents are artifacts that we couldn't do without. If we did not have a documentation of how things happened it would be much harder to study the way things worked. Artifacts play an extremely important role in the study of history.                How do scientists get these things like data and artifacts? They use tools of course! Not just any tools though. They use specific tools to do specific jobs. Some of these tools are shovels and picks which help the scientists clear out land that they need to move in order to find their artifacts. No scientist could get this job done if they did not have the right tools to do it. Archeologists use whisks to wipe the dirt off of their artifacts and to collect small samples of their discoveries. They can even use knives to do things like scraping dirt off of important objects. These are only a few things that archeologists use for their investigations. Tools are another example of something very important to discovering information.                Scientists and historians know what happened in the past for all of these reasons and some more. Archeologists certainly have to collect their data, find their artifacts, and last but not least, use all kinds of special tools. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB NNS CC NNS VBP WP VBN IN DT JJ .

They get to find artifacts, fossils, and other neat things. Archeologists learn new things every day and can discover old artifacts from long ago.        The first thing archeologists do is get all the supplies they need. The supplies that they need include, a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. A pick and a shovel is used for digging in the earth, a whisk and dustpan is used for brushing dirt off artifacts, a knife is used for scraping dirt from around artifacts, a wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another, a skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil in each scoop, and a trowel is used for scraping and cutting to view the different layers of soil.                                                         Next, archeologists need to find a place to work. They would need a place with a lot of artifacts or somewhere that had a village or house that isn't there anymore. Somewhere like Fort James, Virginia would work. Fort James was built in 1607 so there is lots of artifacts there. Places like this would be perfect for archeologists to dig.       Then, archeologists would start digging for artifacts. They look for parts of houses, floors of buildings, armor or weapons, cellars, or anything old. They would use a trowel, a skim shovel, and a pick and shovel to dig. Then the archeologists bring the items they find to a certain spot in a wheelbarrow.        Last, the archeologists get the whisk and dustpan, knife, and start to clean up the artifacts they found. once they do that they start studying them and find the history of  what they found.         As you can see, being an archeologist is an exciting job and one day you might decide to be one too!

If your not patient you can loose control and start yelling at people then you can get fired. The tools an archeologist would use would be a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.          It can also be a  fun expierence if its a first time. You could find something really cool like a fossil or something from someone famious. I wish I could be a archeologist.          You must be very smart to be an archeologist because you have to be very good at math, science, history, and more. If you don't like getting dirty I don't think you should be an archeologist because you have to get on the ground or you'll get dusty. Thats about a archeologist.

There are a lot of tools that you need.           Digging could also be dangrous. If you hit a bomb that has not been defused, it will blow up.

They are different kinds off ways to find about the past.For example in this paragraph there is source #1, source #2 and source #3.I think the best way to learn about the past is to go online or to find a Archeologist and ask if he can explain somethings about the past.It seems much interesting to celebrate 'History Day' and learn about the past.In conclusion i hope one day our school celebrate 'History Day'.

For exsample today the Archologists are going to cliff to look for stuff.  For right now they will be looking at the layers of soil.  First they will use a thing called a Skim shovel it removes a thin layer of dirt.  They will remove the first layer of dirt because they do not need to researsh this kind of dirt.  Finnaly they will use the Trowl to scoop up the dirt and look at it.  And those are just some of the tools Archeologists use to infestigate.       Today the Archeologists are going to the same cliff to look for a different things rocks.  First they will use the Pick and Shovel to get close to the artifacte.  Second they will use a Kife to get the remaining away from the artifacts.  Third they will use a Whisk and Dustpan to remove the last bit of dirt remaining on the artifact.  Last they will use the Wheelbarrow to get the artifacte back to the research lab.       Those are all the toles the Archeologists use to to their job right.

They like to study artifacts, kind of like a scientist. They see how old and rare they are. They study dinasoure fossles, and also put them in museams. They dig into the Earth's surface, then they brush off the dirt on the arifacts, they also use a weelbarrow to move the objects or just to get dirt out of way. They study about all of the dinasoures. They traval all around the world to find all of the fossles. They also study the soil. They use a skim shovel to dig up a hole layer of soil, and they use a trowel to scrape and cut tho soil to view the different layers. They also study about Goarge Washington and the Revalutionary War.                                                            The Revaloutinary War.               They also study about the people in the 1700's, like Goerge Washington was the first U.S. president. He was in the Revolutionary War. He was the genral of the Patriots, his solders wore blue coats and the British wore red coats, the British name was the Regulars. The Patriots were harder to find because the Regulars were bright colered so it was very easy to find them. People don't realy know about Washington's as a child but people are starting to find out a little bit about it. Goerge Washington also had wooden teeth. When he was about 6 years old his family built a farmhouse. A few years later there was a fire in the farmhouse.

Also it tells you about george washington and fort James. They try to find stuff so we know what it is like back in the olden days.Like finding Fort James they looked where it was built and all that stuff.Also they tried to find where George Washington lived like they had to dig and read what happen at his house.

Well, I'm going to tell you what they do.       First, they pick what they want to work with because there are different types of things they can dig. There are ones that work inside, at digs, on shipwrecks and so on. Archeologists dig up facts about people that lived long ago. Or on shipwrecks they try to figure out what lead up to the wreck and when it happened.        When digging up information outside they work very carefully so that they can pick up every partical that might mean something and not miss it. First they take the pick and shovel and start digging. They use a knife to scrape dirt from around objects they find and use a whisk and dustpan to brush away the extra dirt. They use a skim shovel to carefully remove thin layers of soil. They use a trowel to scrape and cut layers of soil. Then they use a wheelbarrow to move items or dirt to a different places.       Now you know what archeologists do for work. So if someone elsse doesn't know pass on the information you learned. 	NNS VBP NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WP NNS VBP IN NN .

People were interested in doing the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaaeological Project. People discovered many famous artifacts in Jamestown, Virgina              Settlers came from England to start a new life to build the fort in 1607. More and more people came to discover artifacts. More and more sites were made near rivers for people to travel in ships. The first artifacts were found in 1861. They uncovered many things like armour and weapons.         George Washington's artifacts       Artifacts from George Washingtons time were found. His house burnt down and many clay pipes and other things were buried when it burnt. People are discovering these things today.

Archeologist don't just find random things and give it to a random museum or throw it away, they have to find out what it is and know what they used it for and more information. The things you see in the museum are somethings they got from archeologist that found that item undergound because you can tell by the dirt and the dust around it. Archeologist use items like whisk and a dustpan or a melterdetecter to find the item or a wheelbarrow to move the item or to move dirt out the way.       Being a archeologist is interesting because you can find things from the past or find something that belongs to a famous person that past away. Archeologist also found out secrets about James Fort in Jamestown, virginia and that over 200 years many people say that the fort was washed away by a river. Discoveries has been hinted that the fort is still around. The fort was all built in 1607 when people from england came to start a new life. Many believed that the fort was built next to a river because it was easy to dock ships there.Archeologist uncovered armor and weapons, they also discovered the floors of some buildings too. The National Park Service led a five-year to study the area to figure out how the land was used and what types of buildings where there.       Archeologist also found secrets about George Washington's past. George Washinton's father, Augutine Washinton, moved his family to Ferry Farm. People lived in Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. Its a perfect place to built a home. No one knows where the Washinton home is located. Archeologists believed the stone base under the home is still there. Four more houses have been built there. Archeologist found pieces of  burnt pottery and also found parts of clay pipe       Archeologist means a scientist that studys objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons too.

The process of digging in places is a careful one.Each year many teams will work on a famous place.The way the archeologists dig up these atifacts is with having  groups work on different things like let's say the first group maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small,flat and sharp that they can remove nothing but thin layers of soil,one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch  screen at the bottom. This let's the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Trowling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a place that is 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. So that's how the whole process is made and hoe the job is done and hoe thw archeologists do their job. 	VBG DT NNS VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP MD VB DT NN RP TO CD NNS CC VB JJ RBR .

A archeologists is all about the pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and the trowel. And even some times you can go on there web sites and see there information online. It take alot of time to dig up the past of the peoples history. People like to dig up the pst of famous peoples stuff is because they want to get money for what they found. And also for what they found they want money and fame for thier discovery for what they found. Yes it mit be cool being famous is all about the money and people knowing you and liking you, its about what you did to become and how you did what you did to become famous in the first place. So archeologist just want money or fame for what they found and they want to find they want what they found to be in the musem so everone can see what they have found. people should not do that because they should just have not because its valued because you found it. You should have what you find and be happy about it. That it what an archeologists does for a work or a job or a living. 	DT NN .

The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.             The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near a river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.   However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protectionfrom enemy ships.              The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists,the name for scientists who study objects from the past,   uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.             The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decidewhere to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.              That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where fort's walls used to be. Between all stories they heard and read, and drawings they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellers, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.

For over 200 years people thought that Fort James had been washed away by a river. And somepeople think its still around but no one knows. Fort James was built in 1607 when settlers came frome Englaned to start a new life. Peole been looking around for many years for things that will tell them what happend. the firs object was found in 1861. They uncovered armor and weapons.                     The group finally  found James fort. The first thing they found was markers that marked where the walls had been. Today the group finds nearly 1 million things a year. The objects include pottery, tools, cions, and even mettle toys for children. The objects they found helped then understaned how people in Fort James  lived.               Now lets start with George Washington. People have lived on the land known as the Ferry Farm for over 12,000 yaers. The location is a perfect place to build a home. Its not surprising that George Washington father, Augustine Washington moved his family there.George was only six years old at this time.               No one knew exacly where Washingtons home was located since the real building was long gone. Archeologist still belive there is stone base where his house used to be. They started digging in 2003.It took longer than a year but they found it. The first buildings they found was the kichen, slave quarters, and a storage house.                Therewas more houses on the Ferry Farm land they just needed proof that it was George Washingtons farm house. They found burnt pottery that means there was a fire there.they found part of a clay pipe. We know that George Washington smoked clay pipes, but they need more proof this is his house.

They have to discover and find out what happen to things from very long ago, and they have to find out what artifacts where used for.  Archeologist find pottery, tools, coins, and toys for children.  They even find bones of animals.  Archeologist use equipment like picks, shovels, whisk, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Archeologist find many great things and they put them in museums.                Every year archeologist find thousands of different artifacts.  They found were Fort Henry was, and where George Washington lived.  Now every body knows George Washington was the first President.It is very important because it lets many people know how it was back then.  Like what transportation the had, if they learned a lot, what books they had and just stuff like that.  People today don't care because they have technology.                If archeologist are finding wonderful stuff today just think of what they can find in the future.  People are always wondering what it was like back then well now you can find out.

After Jamestown was attacked several times all of the houses were broken.  In 1861 the first objects were found in Jamestown by archeologists.  The archeologists found weapons and armor.  Over 100 years later The National Park Service led a study that was five years.  Each year millions of objects were found.                   Source #2                   In source #2 you will read about the finding of George Washington's house and the events that occurred while he lived there.  Archeologists were digging and found burnt pottery.  Even before that there were rumors that there was a fire at his house.       People worked with 3-D computers to locate where artifacts might have been.  Diggers used wooden picks to remove dirt.

As a archioligists you would have to go in sertain missions. You would find a lot about sertain places and citys. You would go in a under ground tunnel and find some clues about what happend unnder a tunnel in history.  It is kind of scary to go on a mission like this but it is kind of cool about learning history in that place. Being a archioligist is cool becuse you lern what happend in the past. These are are the tools that you will need. (1 pick and shovel. (2 whisk and dustpan. (3 knife (4 wheelbarrow (5 Skim Shovel (6 trowel. Those are the things you will need. So if you are interested in being a archeoligists go to school and get good education.

They must work long hours of the day and dig to find what they are looking for. they use tools like, the pick and shovel, a whisk and pan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. These are all the tools that they need to find artifacts. they have had many archeologist finds over the years. They like when they find something because then they feel happy. They can be studied in labs and the information  can be put in books. That is all. Thank you.

Archeologists half to use tools like picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim-shovels, and trowels. Those are the tools of an archeologist , archeologists find architects , are fine pieces of work or ancient. When archeologists are at work they work really hard. Sometimes it doesn't look hard but it is harder then you think.            When archeologists are working they bring their tools with them. If an archeologist is looking for an ancient burial site ground it's most likely it isn't gonna be found, but they might want to be careful, they might bump into something they might not want to see or get hurt really bad. Using information from what you find is important because if you don't you really won't have anything.           When you do your job of an archeologist it's important to use all your tools, first you  have to get to somewhere ancient about to 100 to 300 yrs old search there if you don't find anything , go to another remote area. If you can t find any thing there search all over.

Archeologist will go find information about anything. Archeologist don't just work on the ground to find information or objects they also work in the lab. The lab Archeologist are on the computer to find information.         Archeologist use list of tool like the knife, wheelbarrow, pick and shovel, and many more. Archeologist use these tools to scrape the dirt off the artifacts. Archeologist use the skim shovel to remove to the thin layer of soil in the ground. The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of the soil and that tool is probable most common. The whisk and dust pan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts. The knife is used to dig and scrape dirt off the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush the dirt off the artifacts.The last ones are the pick and shovel they are used to start your hole of site.         Archeologist finds lost of artifacts. In the passage Digging Up George Washington's Past they found his smoking pipe so they knew that he smoked. In the passage Finding Fort James the made a map and when they went to go dig the fount out that the fort was pretty close to the water.           If i was a Archeologist i would go and search for Abraham Lincolns artifacts because i don't know a lot about him so i would like to find some artifact. If he smoked i would like to find his pipe.

There is a lot of archeologist every year over at The Ferry Farm Land because their wanting to find artifact about George Washington.There has been many things people have found.Like many archeologist already knew the Washington house was long gone but they knew the stone base had to be there.Later in 2003 they found 3 buildings.They found the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.Then later on they found the actual farmhouse.Archeologist have found that a fire occurred at the Washington house so they went on the search to find what had caused it.Then  buried up they found a pipe and we know that old George use to smoke pipes and they think that is what caused the fire.                                                                                                                                     In 1994 a group of interested archeologist were interested of the secrets of the James Fort.Many of the first objects were found in 1861.They found many armor and weapons.Over hundred years later they finally found James Fort.Archeologist found almost eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings.Today archeologist find almost 1,000,000 objects each year.These objects can include pottery, tools ,coins, and metal toys for children.Now this is all about archeologist.

An archeologists job is very important.when people go to a meusim and see gorge Washingtons  clay pipe, it was dug up by an archeologist.        Some artifacts are worth thousands of dollars. For example,some potory can be well over 1000 years old and worth a lot.Archeologist actually don't get paid a lot for digging these wonderful things up. They get paid by the month like any other normal worker. They dig up wonderful thing that sell for thousands and don't get paid but fractions of what they sell for.When they are digging they use very small tools such as small brooms, small shovels and things like that.         I learned that archeologist dig up alot and we dont give them alot of credit for it.

Archeologist use a lot of tools.Here are a few tools and other information about Archeologists and how they work.          They use picks and shovels, which most digs start with these two tools, for digging into the earth close to the artifacts. Next they use a whisk and a dustpan, which is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. They also use knifes for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. They also use wheelbarrows' sometimes for moving items or dirt away from the excavation site. There are several ways to find artifacts, buy using different tools.            When the Archeologists were digging they discovered or rediscovered that there were at least four other houses that have been built on the Ferry Farm Land, so the diggers had to find proof that they chose the right one. We know that George Washington smoked clay pipes, so therefore they had proof when they found a part of a clay pipe.             When a group of people were studying the past, they had a project and it was designed to find all the secrets of James Fort, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort have been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. The first object was found in 1861. Archeologists discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a goup effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.              A lot of stuff have been found by Archeologists, they have searched for over several years for objects and still are. They work hard searching, using knifes, and whisk all day and night. not many people think that is interesting figuring out hisory and the past of well-known people.

It will be talking about thier jobs, the differnt tools used, and how they do it. Archeologists are people that dig up different things and find things that have to do with the history of different things in the world. Archeologists have to have many different responsibilities to do what they do. There are 6 different tools that they use. Archeologists dont always find things every day. Somedays they might be just looking around and other days it might be very sucsessful but they should always have to have a positive attitude about it. Archeologists are very hard workers to get theur job complete for the day but the next day they should still be as positive and hard working as they were the day before.          First off, about Archaeologists jobs. Archeologists are scientists who study objects fromthe past. They have to be very patienrt otherwise they will not be able to find things. Not everything that Archeologists do is digging some of it is having to go look in old places or look in areas that are hidden but not unerground.  There can be up to 35 people on a team. The first team has to map the area and read it on a 3D computer. The information is recorded so that people know where to look to find things. Another team focuses on the actual digging and where they are digging is called a dig. Archeologists have to work together on things cause somethings that they are getting out are very big or delecate so they have to work together to get it out.          Next, is about the different tools that they use. The different tools that an Archeologists use are a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim and shovel and a trowel. All these tools have a very special meaning and are used for different things. A pick and shovel are the two tools that most people in a dig start with. they are used to dig into the earth, that are close to the artifacts. A whisk and a dustpan are used to brush the dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt form the excavation site. A knife is used for carefully digging out the artifacts and to scrape the dirt away from around the artifacts. Skim shovels are a shovel with a flat edge used top carefully remove a thin layer of soil at a time with each scoop. The last tool is a trowel. A trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology and is used to scrape and cut to veiw the different layers of soil.         Lastly, about how they do their job. Archeologists are very determine people who walk around loking for bones or old artifacts. They do this because they want to learn more about the history of the world and they would like to share it with the rest of the world. They are not all the time digging but sometimes just looking areound to see what they can find. Archeologists have to be very careful to make sure that they dont brake any of the objects. They have to use the special tools for what they are made to do only or nothing else because if they arer used improperly theycan brake or they can brake the artifacts. They would especially have to work together when they are in a team of 35. Each team has a different role to do to get the job done. One team might be digging while another team could be mapping out the whole area to tell the other team where to look.          In conclusion of this passage about Archeology it was talking about theier jobs, the different tools used to do this, and how they do their jobs. I learned that a team of Archeologists can be up to 35 people at a time and that ther are six different tools used.  I hope that you learned lots of new things too. If I were to do this again I would do it about a teacher's job. i would do it sbout that because i think that teachers have a very interesting job. Hope you enjoyed learning about Archeologists.

Archeology is a hard job. It requires patience, determination, and a bit of strength. Archeologist first dig, to find artifacts and other pieces of preserved history. Then they analyze these pieces to identify whose it was, when it as used or made, why it was used or made, and of course, what it is!       Archeologists rarely find important things. Normally when they find something, it is not important. It may take weeks, months, years, even decades to find things. But in the end it is worth it for society, for they get to learn about people's past.        Archeology is a very hard job, but if it is done well, society benefits.

An archeoligist has to do lots of digging, studying, and thinking. While at work if they find something they have to go thourgh a process I like to call cleaning, picking, and choosing, why? They have to clean their piece they found pick out with a knife the tiny specks of dirt left, then finally they have to choose weither the piece is important enough. If so They move on to the next process.       Here to the studying process they next have to study the product to see what piece of information it gives us they wonder is it important, does tell me enough information  to right a paragraph about it? Once that process is done they next think about what other piece of information it gives us and also if it tells alot about what we don't know about a person that is important in history.

Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood.      George Washington's father, Augustine Washington moved his family to a very known land called Ferry Farm.  George was just six years old at the time.       No one knew exactly where Washington lived. The actual building was long gone. Archeolighists found it in 2004. The first buildings found were a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.        At least four houses were built there.  Diggeers needed to find proof Washington lived there. They found burnt pottery and suggested there was a fire.  They also found a clay pipe. We know that Washington smokes a pipe. That is Washingtons history.

I know that they wanted us to find the stuff they left behind and we did and that is a good thing so now we know a little bit more than we used to about James Fort.we know that they were going to die so they left behind stuff.We thoght that a river flood James Fort.They did not we still do not know how they died,but a flood did not kill them.It was difficult because they did not have a lot of food so they almosted died og of hunger.The archeologistfound eleven cellars,ten buildings and dozens of burial sites.

The project was put together to find James Fort secrets in Virginia. Over 200 years, people thought the fort has been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came to the land from England to start a new life.              A lot of people believed that the fort was built by a river. It was easier to dock ships there so it makes more sense. Objects were found nearby and people suggested the fort was farther away. The new spot gave settlers more protection in case an enemy is nearby.               Objects were found in 1861. Archeologists uncovered armor and weapons. And floors of buildings were found. More than 100 years later a group went searching in the exact same spot where the fort was built.                National Parks gave a 5-year study of how the land was used and looked for proof of the fort. They finally found it! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks led where the fort wall used to be. And today the group finds nearly 1 million objects a year. Including pottery, coins, tools, and metal toys!

Most digs start with these two tools.Used to dig into the earth,close to the artifacts.We also use Whisk and Dustpan. Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. We also use Knife.used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.We can also use Wheelbarrow. Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. We can also use Skim Shovel. A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Also we can use Trowel.Probably the most common tool in archeology.

Thay found pieces of burnt pottery,clay pipes,thay discoverd that it gives more proof that it's the right house.         In Jamestonw thay found pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toy's for children.The first bilddind thay found In GOGERGES WOSHINTEN PAST was the kitchen,slave quartes,and the storage house.Thay found the mine farmhouse a few year's later.The Archeolgiests tools are a pick,shovle whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovle,and a trowel.           This is all about an Archeoliests and i like all that thay do it is relly cool.I what to be an archeoliests when i grow up. This seemes like a cool job.

They use tools and other things for investigation too . If you want to know more about Archaeologist follow me this way.       Did you know Archaeologist  used tool and now you tool for treasure and stuff like that but  I can tell you what they used . digging and  pick is what Archaeologist used to get for artifacts and they use now today also.Whisk and dustpan is what they use for  to get dirt  off and clear  away dirt from the excavation. they had knife for safe and careful digging around the artifacts.       Archaeologists used wheelbarrow to move one items to another or to carry the dirt away from the excavation site.They used skim shovel with flat edge to used to carefully remove.Trowel probably the most common tool in archeology.   Those are tool  archaeologist use.Archaeologist also investigate thing back like there was a time when they were  searching where president and soldier  George Washington.Archaeologist was trying to  find where he live after he die .        In 2003 archaeologist began digging , it took over a year but the finally found it . The first thing they found was the kitchen where the slave quarters storage were .       Archaeologist  really can do  can  investigation artifacts and use tools and thing and that what archaeologist can really do. and that why I like archaeologist 	WP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBP NNS WP JJ NN IN RB IN DT NNP NNP VBP NNS CC JJ NNS IN NN RB .

The thing about Jamestown is that some fort was built in 1607 when settlers had came from England to start a new life.  Most of the colonist believed that James Fort was built near the river because it was easier to dock the ships there, so it made since why the settlers would choose that.           However now, there was spotting of objects nearby an they had relocated the Fort.  The new location of where the James Fort was at it was a spot where it probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.          Most of what we know about george washingtonis that he comes from his time as a solider and president.  Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood,.          That's changing, however.  recent discoveries at Washington's chhildhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy     	DT NN IN DT NN VBZ RB WRB NNS PRP VBP TO NN IN DT JJ NNS CC WRB PRP VBP TO VB NN IN NNP NNP CC NNP CC WP PRP VBP IN TO VB PRP VBZ IN DT NNP NNP NN IN NNP VBZ IN DT NN VBD VBN IN CD WRB NNS VBD VBD IN NNP TO VB DT JJ NNP NNP IN DT NN VBD IN NNP NNP VBD VBN JJ DT NN IN PRP VBD JJR TO VB DT NNS RB , RB PRP VBD IN WRB DT NNS MD VB NNP NNP RB , EX VBD VBG IN NNS RB DT PRP VBD VBN DT NNP NNP JJ NN IN WRB DT NNP NNP VBD IN PRP VBD DT NN WRB PRP RB VBD DT NNS JJR NN IN NN NNP NNP IN WP PRP VBP IN NN NNS WDT PRP VBZ IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN CC NNP NNPS VBP RB VB RB RB NN IN PRP$ NN , .

Archeologists job is also to dig up dirt and pick up dirt  to do that they use a pick and a shovel.Archeologists also use a whisk and a dustpand to clear away dirt from the excavation.                                An archeologist also use knifes for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Archeologists use wheelbarrows to move items from one place top another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site .Archeologists use skim shovel which is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.Archeologists use trowel which is known as probably the most common tool in archeology.Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers ao soil.

Their job is to discover things from the past, such as George Washington's home or the James Fort. This is a very exciting job because one you have found a peice of history, it belongs to you.                 When working you have to be very careful because you may find a piece of evidence that doesn't belong in that certain category. Then you'll have to go back and find it, but by then another archeologist would've already been observing it.             Taking your time is another important rule for archeologist. If they are rushing the could break the object, lose the object, or hurt themselves. If any of those things happened they would be upset.             Being an archeologist isn't an easy job, it takes practice to get profection.

Even an object found in a old house can tell a story about a person, place, or thing.       In George Washingtons house, the diggers found a clay pipe and burnt pottery indicating it was his house.       There are teams of up to 35 people that dig up these relics. They are called archeologists. They dig the relics up carfully so they dont destroy or disturb the artifacts.       The archeologists use skim shovels to remove layers of dirt from the dig site. Then they put the dirt in a box with a screen at the bottom that lets dirt fall but not the artifacts.       Another way to dig is called troweling. Troweling is when you use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to dig up dirt.       It takes about two weeks to dig up a 25-sqare-foot section when you use troweling to dig. Its a long time but its worth it!

I have! Let me tell you all about red foxes.:)       Red foxes are parts of hunting games. Red foxes build their burrows underground, and when an animal passes overhead, it's senses are so very observant, it can hear the animal. Red foxes don't have to be typically ALL red, they can have golden on them somewhere, or , white on them to. Red foxes typically eat fish, rabbits, and other prey.   Red female foxes are called, Vixens,   when she mates she has eight to twelve pups. The Vixen mother hunts for her pups and teaches them how to hunt until they are well taught and old enough to hunt on their own.             	DT NNP NNP POS NN IN NNP NNP NNP PRP VBP DT VBN NN IN .

The job of an archeologists is to find things or objects that were buried, left, or even hidden over 100 years ago or longer. Archeologists study things like pottery, old jewelry, and a lot of other things. Archeologists discover so many things by researching, digging, and with all the other technology we have know. Archeologists use all the resources they have or need to research something.            Today, archeologists find nearly one million objects! A group of archeologists wanted to study the past that started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was made to find interesting facts about Jamestown.Archeologists study,work, and search on projects like this. Archeologists use so many sources to study and find objects from a long ago, especially with the equipment that we have know and the equipment we will have in the future.                 Archeologists have to be really careful with the objects they do research on or the objects they find because the object might be really fragile or really delicate. Archeologists uncovered weapons and armor while they were researching over James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. They also discovered the floors of buildings. The first objects that were found by archeologists was in the year 1861. Archeologists found James fort by finding some marks on the ground, drawings they made, and archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. See, archeologists do use all of there resources, they even made maps to find out were the fort would be.               Some of the resources archeologists use are knife, pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Archeologists use these equipment to help make there job easier and help them find more objects then they usually do. If we didn't have archeologists in the world, we wouldn't be finding all the interesting things in history or how people looked like over 1 million years ago. We need archeologists so that we can discover so many other things. That's what archeologists do in there jobs.

For History Day I have chosen to write about archeology. Archeology is about helping the people of today learn about the past. There are many tools used in archeology such as the knife and wheelbarrow. People who study archeology are called archeologists. One discovery requires over one hundred archeologists. Archeologists spend years and years digging for things from the past.     There are many tools used in archeology, here are some of them, the knife, the wheelbarrow, the trowel, the skim shovel, pickaxes, shovels, whisks, and dustpans. Whisk and dustpans are used to clean artifacts. Wheelbarrows were used to move dirt and artifacts from one place to another. Most archeology digs start with picks and shovels and they are used to dig close to artifacts. The trowel is the most common tool used in archeology and it is used for scraping and cutting dirt. The skim shovel has a flat edge to help carefully remove a thin layer of soil.     Now I think archeology is very interesting. Some discoveries such as the finding James Fort and George Washington's house have been very helpful archeology discoveries. Yes you may think archeology is boring but think of all the cool things you could find. You could find dinosaur fossils, gold, a buried ancient civilization, and caves of diamonds! So really archeology isn't very boring at all and I hope you agree with me.

What they do!      People have been searching for long lost artifacts for hundreds of years and have found them. These amazing discoveries were made by people we call archeologist. I read many different story's and passages on what archeologist do and what they discover throughout their jobs. I found out that their jobs may seem easy to do because people think 'Oh how hard could it be to dig a hole?', but what most children and even some adults don't realize is that you have to be really careful in what you do and how you do it. Also many people don't realize that it's not just digging in the first passage that I read the author put in this sentence 'The National Park Service led a five-year study of the Jamestown area to figure out how the land was used.' Now just think if it took five years to discover things about the land and over a hundred years to find that land do you think they took their time?                                                                    The great American discovery!     Amazingly enough things are still being discovered whether it's old fossils, broken pottery, or even a historical land mark like George Washington's old house! Yes, we are on the verge of finding George Washington's childhood home. The archeologists believe that they have already discovered the Washington's home but are not sure. They have pretty stable evidence of it being the right house for example they found pieces of burnt pottery and we know that the Washington's went through a fire. They also found a piece of clay pipe which they believe belongs to our great President himself since it has been recorded that he smoked clay pipes.                                                            Tools!   Archeologists use an abundance of tools. There are so many so I'll list most of them.       .Pick   .Shovel   .Whisk and dustpan   .Knife   .Wheelbarrow   .Skim shovel   .and Trowel                                Interesting facts that were discovered during archeology!   .The first object from Jamestown Virginia was discovered in 1861.   .During the 1600's people basically used wells and pits as trashcans.   .There were ledges on the Jamestown fort to hold cannons.   .George Washington lived on a place called Ferry Farm.   .Their is a camp for kids where they can discover about George Washington's life.             I hope that some of you grow up to be an archeologist I know now that maybe it's my life's calling maybe I'm meant to discover a priceless long lost artifact maybe just maybe!

Archeologist go out and about to historical places to look for artifacts. They use different tools to look for artifacts.              Each historical place requires special tools such as a Whisk and Dustpan, a Pick and a Shovel, etc. etc. the Archeologist will use these tools to uncover the artifacts. Then after the person who digs digs a different person looks at the artifact. Many people are evolved.              Like when you find a arrowhead in the dirt you are doing what an Archeologist does every day for a living. Sometimes when you are working in a garden you find an old piece of pottery or a handle of a mug Archeologist look in old Battle Forts and old abandon town's to look for those kinds of artifacts.              So the next time you find a piece of old pottery or a arrowhead think of an archeologist.Is an Archeologist what you want to be when you grow up kids?

They need a whisk and a dustpan to clear up any objects like a fossil. They need a skim shovel too, so that they can dig up any thick layer of dirt. Archeologists, even need a trowel, knife, and a wheelbarrow.          Archeologists are people who discover the things from the past. They may or may not discover how old they are or from what place was it from. Archeologists sometimes find things that are more than  one million dollars. Many archeologists find fossils. Acheologists get lots of money for finding gigantic things like dinosaur bones.          Archeologists need tools because if they use their hands and feet it might take a whole year. Archeologists are important to us beause they help us find things that we don't have time for. They even get us, kids, interested in history. Not only do we get interested in history we might even want a job like that. Many people thank archeologists for what they have found.       Archeologists work a lot which I'm sure no kid would want to do a lot of work. Kids usually would think that it could be easy working a job like this. There are mostly men who work as archeologists. I've never seen or heard about a woman be an archeologist. Usually there are books about archeologists.

Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president.Archeologists don't have very much information about his childhood.Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know a little more.Therefore, its not surprising that George Washington's father,Augustine Washington, moved his family to Ferry Farm, a perfect place to build a home.George was just six years old at that time.No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone.However, archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there.They started digging in 2003.The first buildings under ground they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.they found the main farmhouse a few years later.This discovery gives more proof it is the right house.

It can take over a couple years and you have to konw what to do and where to look. You haft to have the right tool. Archeologist , the name for scientists who study objects from the past, uncoverd armor and weapons. They also disoverd the floors of buldings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the excat spot of where the fort was bulit began.

They find out information about anything in the past for example, animals, landmarks and even people. Sometimes there is not enough information to be exact so it takes years to get the information.       One thing that archeologists studied is about George Washington. They do not know much him as a child but it is changing. They are finding out more and more about him. Archeologists do know about where he lived though. George Washington's father moved to Farm Ferry when George was only six. They don't know exactly where his house was but they found a kitchen slave quarters and storage rooms.       To find the information they use 3D computers to track what is underground. The information is recorded so that other people can start digging. They start skim shovels which are flat shovels. Archeologists then put the soil in a box with a screen at the bottom. This lets dirt fall that is not important. Another team goes to a lab to analyze the objects.

They might tell you about what they found from Fort James and from George Washington. I will talk about what they found from Fort James and George Washingnton.            In 1861 they found the first objects of Fort James. The archeolgist uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of the building. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing study used computer mapping software to make in image of the area. While digging in the area,the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away,including the bones of animals they ate.             The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery. They also found part of clay pipes.

They have a vast range of tools, computers, and radar that help them find the artifacts. Some tools are the Pick and Shovel, which most of the digs start with. They are used to dig into the site and find artifacts. Archeologists also use the Whisk and Dustpan, which are used to brush dirt off of artifacts and clear dirt from the dig site. Following, there is the knife, and that is used for causuos digging andmoving dirt from the artifact. Next, we have the Whellbarrow, which is used to move either dirt or items from the dig site, and the Skim Shovel, used to scrape a thin layer of earth from the dig. Finally, there's the Trowel, which is most likely the most common tool for Archeolologists, used to cut and scrape to look at different parts of the soil.         One of the digs Archeologists have done is find George Washinton's childhood home. They used the recordings from that time and matched it up with the items. All of them mached! If Archeology weren't around, we could have never done that. So, we should all thank the Archeologists that did that.         Last, another dig was made. They found a whole entire fort! This fort was called Fort James. Colonists made it to defend themselves from the Indian tribes. Archeologists have found over a million items there! Some of the items were dolls. They also found a few cellars. Archeologists also found a stone ledge overlooking a stream that had cannons on it once!              	NNP : NNPS VBP RB JJ .

You get to use special tools like a scientist if your an Archeologist you use a pickaxe,shovel,whisk,dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow,skim shovel and a trowel.

In class were are preparing for History Day and writing about the past and how the archeologists found these many diff-rant people in our world.We have been reading about George Washington and The James fort and how there both important.In 1994, a group of people where curious to find about The James fort (It was said that James fort was washed by a river).The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.       There were objects found in 1861. They found bones of  animals, weapons,and tools that they used back then.Then as they started to move closer and look a bit better they finally found it! First they found many diff-rant markings in the ground that are made from houses.Then they found out that there food source was very low and was difficult to survive. Today archeologists find nearly 1 million objects each year.They have found many diff rant discovery and now plan to figure out and find more amazing finds.They are very important people.       They have also been interested in finding more about Washington and his lifestyle back then and what his child hood was like.They found that when he was six he lived on a land named Ferry Farm and it was the perfect place to build a home.The archeologists know this because there was a structure in the middle of a piece of land called Ferry Farm and as they looked into finding who lived here George Washington came up into the picture.They found pipes under the structure and tools tat where aged for millions of years.They found many diff rant facts about George W. When he was eleven years he worked like the other children(Mostly on the land he lived on. As we all know he became president and the people of Ferry Farm where going to show that there a strong community.

This project was formed to discover secrets!For over 200 years people guessed the fort had been washed away.Discoveries in that area had a litttle hin that it was still there.         Then a fort was built in  1607.people believed James Fort was by a river.Then they gave settelers more protecrtion from enemy ships.Thats when people suggested that they move it again but this time further away from them!Also the ships was easier to dock at the time.          Then the first object was found in 1861. Scientist that studied  from the past time!They then dicovered  floors and buildings.Scientist also studied Undercovered armor and weapons!.100 years later a group  found hte exact spot where the fort was built.!           National park led  5 year studys of areas to figure out how the land was used.   The people knew that this would decide where to get proof from.!People who used study used computer maping.Thats when the FINALLY found James Fort!They first saw a set of marks. The marks that was left on the ground the marks showed some of The Fort's walls still there.!!!The heard stories and read books it is now Reality ! The Fort was actualkly shaped out of a triangle but thats wat the scientist guessed.             Now Today, other groups finds all kinds of stuff from the Fort.!

Like people who discovered that dinosaurs are real and found dinosaur bones are archeologist. A archeologist is like a scientist because an archeologist studies stuff from they past so does a scientist. They also look for clues from a long time ago.            Once there were people looking for dinosaur bones and clues about dinosaurs, and also proof that dinosaurs were alive. First they didn't find much, but then they went to the hot and dry places, then they found more bones and clues, and every time they find some thing they go put it some were, some were that everyone could see it. In the museum if you go to a dinosaur museum you are going to find a lot of stuff on dinosaurs.            Archeologist find a bunch more stuff but every time they find stuff they put them in museum. museums are filled with old stuff but interesting that archeologist found. I think that is very cool what archeologist do. A museum is filled with a bunch of information on what archeologist do and how they discover it, also on where they find it, and what they found. people discovered that along time ago when no one was alive there were dinosaurs, but then they died.            After they died there bones were left on the floor and then it went under the dirt, after that people came along and they were digging they found bones and when they were wwalking they found some foot prints on dinosaurs some were big and some were small. After that they had proof that dinosaurs were alive along time ago and that made the people that found the bones and foot prints archeologists.            Do you know how much archeologist there are? There are a lot of them they all discovered something new and there are a lot of cool stuff that they discovered like  George Washington's childhood but there wasn't much. Also finding fort James they discovered the secrets of James town. Also more fun and cool stuff.             From all this information i would really like to be an archeologist, but this seems like a hard working job. Most of the time you're gonna have to be digging and researching and typing and all the hard stuff but if you put your effort into it you would find a lot of coll stuff so fast it would probable take a day or two. usually it takes like week or two. this is a very cool and interesting job.

In 1994 a group of people interested in studying the past they started the Jamestown rediscovery archaeological project. the project that they were making was to discover secrets of the James fort in Jamestown, Virgina. people thought that the fort got washed away by some river.                The Fort James was built in 1607. most believed that James fort was built near a river.if James fort was built near a river it would be easier for the people who lived there to dock ships. it made sense that the settlers moved there so it would be easier transportation.                  The first objects that they found were in 1607. the name for scientist who studied objects from the past, uncovered armor, and all types of weapons.They also discovered the floors of the building.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built.                 That's when they found the fort! the first thing that they discovered was markings where the forts wall used to be. they knew that that the fort was shaped like a triangle. they made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. that how i knew that they used the river to dock ships. they also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten building all within the border of the fort.                Now have heard about fort James, do you think that fort James was a awesome place? i think fort James was a cool place and the people who found Fort James worked day and night and, every day to finally find fort James and i'm so proud of all the people who found that place!

They go to abandoned historical sights to dig up artifacts. Which are objects from the past.      A group in 1994 were interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. They were going to find and study Fort James. They were going to dig up old objects to study what people used in the old days. It took over 100 years to find the exact spot were Fort James was! The National Park Service led a study of the area to figure out how the land was used. This would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. That's when they finally found the fort! They found a set of marks on the ground indicating where the fort's wall was. The archeologists knew the fort was a shape of a triangle from all the stories they have heard.      Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even little toys for the children. They found trash the settlers threw away in a well or large pit. Including the bones of animals they ate. Archeology gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who lived hundreds of years ago.      Archeologists are important because if we didn't have them we would know very little about our past. Also about what life was like in the old days.

When George Washington was young nobody knows where exactly he lived but they think he lived in this farm house in Ferry Farm. The hose was over 12,000 years it makes a perfect place to live. Then George Washington dad Augustine Washington moved his family when George was only six years old.  Washington  smoked clay pipes so this gave proof to the diggers that this is Washington house.               'How do archeologists find all of these things that where in Washington's house all those years ago?The progress of digging at the ferry farm is a careful one. Each year many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 people on a team! the first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before digging and the place the team does the focuses on the actual digging and the actual digging and those archeologists start their dig with what they call skim shovel' this  is in the story.                 The diggers use a process trowing, its when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden pick's to remove dirt.' The trowing can take up 2 weeks to dig a 25 square - foot section!Another team spends days in the lab studying  the objects what are found. the whole process is slow and tiresome, but  it's worth it.' this is also in the story. .

Without actual work, archeologists would have never found George Washington's house.  It took a while, but it was worth it.

So get a tight grip on your might because i about to blow it away.                  Archeoligist is a person who has a intrest in learnin and studing the history of big places and lednges . They go out with a group of many people about 35 and higher and search for artifacts and clues about history and life long ago.So find histical places and dig for artifacts,treasure,and tombs.The most common places you would find amazing artifact is in egypian pyrimads and tombs.       You can find Acheoligists in romot places or in desert hunting down tombs of old Pharohs and King and Queens.The special tools they used were  picaxes,shovels ,wheelbarrles, wiskes,dustpans,and paint brushes.Using these tools it took a lot faster in the prouses.Sometimes there tools break and they are in a romot area and that person would st there for mounths maybe even years waiting for the others to finish and proseed in there task.       If this is all new to your learning you are not an Indiana Jones fan then.Now you know all the thing you need to now about Archeoligist and what they do.And this is all you need to know beacause i would bore you with every single fact and it would take you days to read and that is just very wrong.And i don,t want to bore you to your deaths.Or do i.

Other things that they find is burnt pottery and stuff back then. Archeoligists discover so many things! The one thing I was most intereasted in was George Washington's smoke clay pipe.                                                                     They probably knew were it was already but they had to dig it up. Some of the tools that the archeoligists used to dig up things  was a shovel, wheelbarrow, trowel, skim shovel and more. They also used a whisk and a dust pan. Probably the most tools that were very important were a shovel, whisk, dustpan, and a wheelburrow. They would need to use a shovel to dig up the burried artifacts. They would need to use the wheelbarrow to put the dirt in or to put the artifact in depending on how big it is. They would also need to use a whisk and dust pan to clean the artifact or artifacts.                             An archeoligist is aq very important job. If it wasn't for an archeoligist, we wouldn't have art mueseams and stuff like that. It's also important to were gloves when digging up artifacts because they might be made out of glass. Also, don't forget to bring special gear to dig up with. That's why it's important to be an archeoligist.

Such as when a group of archeologists decovered Fort James the archeologists found that the fort was farther away from the river then they thought. So all of the artifacts tha not washed away in the river.           Archeologists also have to think about how the land was used and what they know happened at the place they are looking for. Agin such as finding Fort James it took five years studing how the land was used.            After all of that work the archeologistsdo have somthing to look foward to. the archeologists who found Fort James sure did with 1 million objecte found including coins, tools, childrens toys, and even a trash can.             So i conclud that archeologists not only have a long name but have an exciting and adventures job. they have decovered hany important artifacts. For that I thank them.

They can really teach kids about the U.S's past!             Archeologists do lots of stuff. 1important job is to find things about the past. Like how they found George Washingtons house. Also how they found stuff about Fort James. Archeologists were curious about George Washingtons house they wanted to find more about it. All they knew was that there house was on Ferry Farm. So they decided to dig their. Some of the tools they use to find stuff are: A Wheelbarrow, they used this to take away dirt. Another is a trowel, they used this to view the different layers of soil. Another was a Whisk and Dustpan, they used this to brush off artifacts so they could see the artifacts better. All of these tools helped them during there dig. Another place where they digged was where they thought fort James was. There they used the same tools as at George Washingtons house and others. Like a skim shovel, used for removing a thin layer of soil with every scoop. Another is a Pick and Shovel, they were used for digging into the earth close to the  artifacts. The last one they used was a knife, it was used to carefully dig and to scrape dirt around the artifacts. They use lots of tools when they are digging. Archeologists help us learn a lot about the past! Another impotant thing they do is take there time finding the Artifacts. They don't rush finding it they take sometimes over a year! Like when they were digging for George Washingtons house in the text it said 'They started digging in 2003. It took over a year,but they finally found it.' This means a lot to americans because finding artifacts about the past is important to our country. It tells a lot about how our country was started.             Archeologists sure do a lot doing there job, find things about the past and taking there time for us. They do a lot in there job.

The artifacts are useful because the archeologists use them to tell about the past.                  One group of archeologists were determined to find Fort James. While looking for the fort they found many interesting artifacts about how the people lived. By using computer software they were able to see the most accurate place of where Fort James was. Some artifacts that the archeologists found around the fort were coins, metal toys for children, and weapons.                   Another group of archeologists wanted to uncover George Washington's past at Ferry Farm. At first the team found the slave quarters, kitchen, and the storage houses. Then they found the main farmhouse.                      The tools and processes that the archeologists use are complicated. Archeologists use picks and shovels to dig into ground near artifacts. A whisk is used to brush off dirt from artifacts. Knifes are used for careful digging. Wheelbarrows carry heavy things. A skim shovel is used to remove a thin layer of soil. Trowels are used to scrape and cut to view the differing layers of soil.

They also have to be very careful with what they are touching and what they are digging for. The cool thing about there job though mostly is that they search for artifacts that are before my time, your time, your parents time, and you grandparents and great grandparents time!       There job is very serious though. If they dont hold an artifact right or drop it than the artifact(s) can brake because they are very fragile. There job is to search for old artifacts from a long time ago. They have discovered already, parts of our first United States of Americas president George Washington's old house that he lived in before it burned down. They also discovered old childrens toys and old animal bones from the people that lived on Fort James a long time ago.       Doing this type of job is not like the average job where you work at a gas station or anything, this job is a job that takes time, hard work, and you get a little more than a little dirt on your blue jeans. They have to be careful with digging too. The wrong tools can not help them out in certain sistuations. They have to be very careful on how they dig.       Im sure the people love there job. They get to spend every day searching for artifacts from long ago. They dont have to worry about being on a time limit either because they work at there own paste to get the job done right and completed. They have to examine what has been discovered very therilly and hard so that they understand what they have found.       Being a archeoligist is not any easy job it takes a long time and hard work. You have to dig up things from long ago so that you can use your teamates the examiners. They so a very good job though and im sure that they need alot of time on there hands to be able to find that buried treasure!

I have learned they have to be very careful. In the stories Digging Up George Washington's Past and Finding Fort James I have learned a lot about archeologist tasks         In the article Digging Up George Washington's Past I found out there are 35 or more people om a single dig. The team used 3D computers to scan the underground so they don't miss a single piece of history. One of the many tools the used was a skim shovel. The skim shovel is very flat and pointy. it is built like that so it can pick up more than i layer of dirt at a time.          Inside of another article named Finding Fort James I learned they were looking for Fort James for a long period of time. Then finally found stone walls that used to belong to Fort James. The archeologist spent a whole year just studying the stone walls. After that year they tried to find more evidence that Fort James location was that spot. The walls led to the rest of the fort that went all the way to the river. The many years they worked on the dig was successful. The archeologist also found 11 cellars, 12 burials, and 10 buildings within the border.         Archeologists have very interesting jobs. I learned you have to be very patient and careful. when you're an archeologists you have to be very smart and review an artifacts several times. I hope you learned  as much as i did and try to learn more about history.         	PRP$ NN CC PRP VBP TO VB IN JJ NNP '' .

They find stuff out about ancient ruins and writting on walls, clay pottery, and other artifacts found underground. They dig in spots where they think something might have been. If its not there they look somewhere else until they fully find it.They find pieces of burnt or broken stuff from the past so they learn about what happened.       They run stuff through machines to find out how old it is and when if burned down or got broken. when they have to much dirt or something in a hole people take wheelbarrows and hual dirt or other minerals away. when they finally find something they put it away and look online for other places to look for ancient artifacts.

If we didn't have archeologist then we wouldn't know were Jamestown is and we wouldn't know what they made or were they threw away their trash.                 The subject of social studies was made because of archeologist. If we didn't have them then we wouldn't have social studies because it's based off of history and artifacts.                       Also if we dint have archeologist then little kids wouldn't want to have a good job like that one. Some kids don't know what they even are. Some don't even know it's real! But I don't want to be one when I grow up.                           Everybody should thank the acheologists for all they have done for us. THANK YOU!

They learn things from digging and testing. They can tell kids about what things they found and from the places they found them in.       Archeoligists use a lot of equipment. They use picks and shovels to start digging into the earth. They use a whisk and dustpan to brush off dirt, soil, and sand off of something. They use a knife for careful digging and scraping dirt.Wheelbarrows are used to mover things from one place to another. A skim shovel has a flat edge which can carefully remove a thin layer of dirt. A trowel is used to scarpe and cut to veiw different layers of dirt.       I think that a pick and shovel is most important because Archeoligists need something large to start digging with. Recently archeoligists discovered at George Washington's childhood house helped people know more about him as a kid.       Archeoligists find lots of things at different places. There are lots of archeoligists who find things that are very helpful to people who love history.

The prodject was desined to to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginina. Fof about 200 years peaple thout James Foft was washed away by river. Now some discovrys found in the area hint it might still be around.   The fort was built in 1607 when settelrs came from Engalnd to start a new life. Most think that James Fort was biult by water. However, Objeckts found sugjest James Fort was located further away.   The first objects were found in 1861. Arceologist uncoved Aromor and wepons. They aloso desoverd  the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group decied to find the exeact spot where the fot was biult.   Their was a 5 year study of the area to figer out how the land was used. The peaple doing the study used counputer snaping software to make an imag of the area.   Finally they found James Fort! The first thing they found was marks that held the walls. Later they found the rest of the fort.   The group finds neary 1 millin ojects a year! In the 1600s, peaple used to throw ther trash down holes.Thes objects helppeaple under stand James fort today.

Most of what I know about George Washington is that he comes from his time a great solider and president. Boigraphies don't have very much information about his childhood. Thats changing however. Recent discoveries at George Washington's childhood home have helped all sorts of histotians know alot more information about George Washington as a little boy a long time ago.          People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for a very long time, over 12,000 years. It's location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefor, it's not suprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington , moved his family there. George Washington was just six years old at that time. No one knew exactly were the washington home was located ever since the actual building was long gone. However archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year, but they finally found it.           The first buildings they found were the kitchen , slave guaters , and storage houses. They found the main farm house a few years later. At least four other houses have been built on the Ferry Farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washingtons farm house. Records show that this was Washingtons had a fire in their house.  they lost a lot of there stuff in the fire.             How do the archeologists find all of these things that were in Washington's house all those years ago? The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams willl work on the site. There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.             Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place team does the digging is callled a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These are so small, flat, and sharp they take up soil.

Then they put it in a museuim for either money or just for people to look at and think that it is kind of cool to do some thing like that for a job. Some times they find things that are really old and maybe cost so much money and they can go to a plce to find out how much it is worth and the person who found it might turn it in the the cash shere and that person would get that amount of money it was worth.                       The thongs that they show picters of they use them to dig you some things that they are tring to look for or they just found by mistake or something like that. They use the pick and shovel for diging and picking up things that they dont want to pick up with there hands, so they use the pick and shovel for it. They use the shovel for the diging part they use it because things could be stuck and they could not get it with there hands so they use the shovel.                         The whisk is used for dusting things of when they have not been dusted off for a very long time and they cant see what it really is. The dustpan is use for cleaning up messes that have been made befor the people have left befor they have left that area. The other reason they use them for is because they would not want all that dust on there while they are trying to look at it.                                The knife is used for scraping off dirt from some things. They are also used for diging a little spot.The wheelbarrow is used for carring big and havy things out of th area. The skim shovel is used for just taking a little bit of somthing and removing it to a different place somewhere eles.                               The trowel is used for also for taking off thin layers of somthing that you dont want every thing gone you just want that little bit gone and removed. So dont need to wory about taking way to much of a layer off of somthing that you only want a little bit coming off. You also dont need to have that big shovel that takes way to much off of what you only wanted a little bit taken off.

A archeologist always come prepared to go across the world, A archeologist always have six things that they carry with them, these things are called tools these things are a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel.   The Pick and the Shovel it for to dig into the earth close to the artifact.   The Whisk and Dustpan is used to brush dirt off the artifact and clear away dirt from the excavation site.   The Knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.   The WheelBarrow is used to move items from one place to another or carry dirt away from the excavation site.

They were sent out to discover the secrets. for over 200 years people had thought that jamestown was washed away for ever but that may not be ture. The fort was build in 1607 when settlers came to england. some people think that jamestown was build near a river.                        Many things happened at jamestown like getting diesese or getting realy sick even some died in the winter there. There was little food and less water. The indians had all kinds of food and water. The indians deicied to share there food and water with them.The indians were very strong and tof and they hunted there food.                             When the winter was over jamestown had lost a lot of people. Most of the women and clilder stayed on board the ship to stay safe. When the winter was over the men in jamestown went out to find some food and water to surrvie. Some more people had died of natural causes.                         The town had a lot of problems but sone the began to grow corn and stuff. people would portect the garden.They would even grow weat. the people would get water to drink and food to eat. then people began to have a good life.                          They would play a lot of fun games. They had church and worship hour every day. They had supper lunch and breakfest. The people would even have saramonys sometimes. They even went out to hunt deer and all kinds of things.

They help us discover history. They even digged up George Washington's past! Let's see how!          Archeologists have learned about George Washington's childhood. He grew up in a place called Ferry Farm. He was only six years old at the time. No one really knew where his home was located because it had been gone for awhile, but Archeologists belived that the stone base beneath the house was still there. They started digging in 2003. They finally found it! The fist buildings they discoverd were kitchens, slave quarters, and storage places, a couple years later,   they found the main farmhouse.           Finding Washington's was important for a lot of reasons. One reason is that it gives the citizens of the U.S a better understanding of who he was before he became president. Another is it help historians learn about life our past Americans lived.          Archeologists is an important job. We wouldn't know half of what we know noe without them. I want to be one when I grow up.                        	DT NNP IN NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBP DT RB JJ NNP NNP VBP PRP RB NNP NNP RB VBD RP NNP NNP POS JJ . NNP POS NN WRB .

Both articles are based on how archeologists find artifacts from really famous places.One place where they went was to the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The second place the archeologists went was to a house where they thought that George Washington lived in long ago. I am going to tell you what they did, researched, and analyzed in both places.           The group of archeologists are  interested in studying things from long ago with the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. This project was formed to discover some of the deep secrets hidden in the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The jobs of these archeologists is to find the hidden artifacts in James Fort. The first objects were found in 1861. The archeologists or the the scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered many weapons and armor. They found floors of buildings, too. At least 100 years later, another group came and tried to find the exact spot where the fort was built. The National Park Service led a five- year service of the area to find out how the land was used. They always knew that this would help them find proof of the fort. The people studying this used computer mapping to look at an image of the area. That's when they finally found the James Fort! A set of marks on the ground was the very first thing they saw. they showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between everything they research, heard and read about, they knew that the fort was going to be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and that showed him that is stretched out all the way to he river. The archeologists always were researching and trying to find out many new things about many ancient things and places. That is what makes their jobs so interesting and importing.               Where George Washington lived and spent his childhood was another place that the archeologists went to. The archeologists went there to find out if that was where George Washington lived as a child. There, they found proof to rediscover the place where George Washington lived. As a result, thy keep on finding many more things that lead to the conclusion that what they wanted to discover was true. The discovery of George Washington's  home was extremely important for many reasons. First of all, it makes the citizens of the United States understand George Washington's life story and give them a better understanding of where he lived and actually walked through before becoming famous and being the first president of the United States. Second of all, we would know the decisions he made and why. Lastly, it helps us learn how the Colonial Americans lived. The archeologists found many artifacts and things that belonged to George and he used.       So, now you know the things that archeologists do for a living. Their intersting job helps them and many other people understand the ways of people that lived long ago. Archeologists learn, even though they already know alot. Having that job is great for understanding the lives of famous people back then. So, now you can understand the jobs of archeologists and what they do for a living and how they do it.

Now lets get digging!       Archeologists usually work in very dusty enviornments where there is a very large chance of finding ancient artifacts, such as toys, tools, inventions, and even entire buildings or cities! The artifacts they find are their pay, so the more items found, the more money. But it is very hard to find these objects, and most archeologists are lucky to find one every week! The items are also used for reasearch on past cultures. For example, if a goblet was found in Greece, it would most likely be sent to greek mythology professors for research.       The tools of an archeologist are very simple.You have the pick and shovel, but did you know there are more than six others? The shovel is, obviously the most common tool found with archeologists. The pick is used where the shovel cannot pierce the ground. It is very heavy, and has two very sharp ends used for cracking rock. Then there is the whisk and dustpan. They may not be very big, but they are essential tools to archeologists. The whisk is used to clear dust from delicate objects, such as teacups or very old books.The duspan is used to gather up the dirt and see if it has special minerals inside. Now we come to the knife, another essential, but small, tool. The knife is used for getting most of the dirt off of artifacts so that the whisk can get the remainder, because a whisk is only a brush and can't get all of that dirt off. I could go on and on about the tools, because there are many out there, but I digress.       So, as you can see, the life of an archeologist is a very confusing and long one, but in most cases, a fun and challenging one.

They explore and study anything from a sercet fort to a Old Presidents house!           Archeologists use many tools while exploring and there are quite interesting. They use picks and shovels to dig into the Earth. The whisk and dust pan is used for brushing off artifacts to see more detailing in the object. Also they use knifes for scrapping dirt around artifacts not for cutting our dinner like we do. Wheelbarrows are used to get dirt away from where there are studying. The skim shovel is used to scoop a small layer of soil. A trowel is used to cut the view the different layers of soil.           Archeologists have found the James Fort that we thought we had lost for years by the river sweeping it away but we were wrong! The fort was built in 1607 and was used for surviving attacks, there were even canons! We found artifacts such as pottery, tools, coins, and much more.          Also they have found George Washington's House when he was a kid. They started digging on Ferry Farm in 2003 and it took over 1 year! What do you think they found at his old house? The diggers found burnt pottery. They knew this house was George's because his house burned down in a fire. Also because they found pipes and George was known to smoke them.          It's amazing what archeologists can do! Do you want to be one when you grow up? They make a big difference on Earth and without them we wouldn't know what we know today.

You have to dig, you have to wipe dirt off of objects, you have to even find.You have to use all kinds of tools like a knife!        The tools you need to use and have to be a Archaeological are alot of tools. Like a pick, shovel, Whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.That is alot of tools.The pick and the shovel mostly startes out digs.Whisk and dustpan mostly dust objects off.The knife is used for careful digs, and to scrach dirt off of objects.The wheelbarrow is used for moving objects.The skim shovel is used for taking thin layers of dirt off.        I learnd alot about a Archaeological. Like all the tools they used and the things they did. When I grow up i'm going to look up to that.Would you consider being a Archeological.If you said yes then I would go be one.I would like to be a Archaeological because I like learning knew things.

The project was to discover the secrets of James fort (in Virginia). For 200 years people thought it was washed into the river, discoverys that were found hinted that it might still be around                   The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came over from England so they could start a new life. People thought that James Fort was built along a River, That would have made it easier to dock ships.                       However when people made discoverys farther away they tought it might be frther out than the river. The first object(s) was/were found around 1861, They found armor and weapons. They also found floors of buildings.                         They led a 5 year study of the area trying to find the fort. Tey even used a computer mapping software to scan the area.                   Thats when they found it, the first thing they found was marks were walls used to be. After all the time searching for it they found it. The fort was shaped like a triangle and showed the walls in use.                 As they progressed They found that the fort did strech all the way to the river, with ledges designed to hold canoes. They also found 11 cellars dozens of bariul sights and 10 buildings all in the Fort.                 Today they find nearly a million artifacts a year. They found stuff like pottery, tools, coins,and metal toys for children.           Its amazing how much we know about the past, I can't wait to learn more.

They have to use tools specifically for what they do.

They also have a really cool job they find all sort s of neat stuff like old pots and pans, and old rocking chairs. They get to discover all over the world and they get to eat all sorts of food and other really cool thing like that. They really work hared to find nice stuff for us to hear of see .         My opinion is that they are really smart and know what they are talking about. I think that they are the most danger taking people in the world exepet for sky divers. Their are a lot of thing that are cool that they find like there are din-sores, and lots of other stuff. They need to stay healthy wile their are at work. They probably have a hared day all the time with the wither and all that they probably should stay inside win there is snow all over.

It is when you would find a special little piece of history. Like if you've ever found a small little bulet in your backyard or just found somthinf cool in your yard. To this job there are 3 sources I will tell you all the info I've read about in the sources.            Source #1 The info is really confusing  and they get like that somtimes I've learned that the article is going to tell me were they found artifacts in Jamestown, When ther found it, What they founed, And who found it.             Source #2 I know what this artical is going to tell me It tells me who, what, when,. and were the fund artifacts in Gorege Washinfton's house.             Source #3 This one is a little tricky So this will thell me what do I need to be a Archeolgists I will give you one example You would have to have a Whisk(witch looks like a small broom) and a Dustpan. To sweep all the dust off the artifact.

An Artifact is something that helps show   infomation that came from the past. Archeologists can discover many things like dinosaur bone, pieces of old buildings, and even ship recks.   Tools that archeoligist use for outside work are like picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows,   skim shovels, and trowels. But not all archeologists work outside, they can work inside too. The archeologist that work outside do digging and search for artifacts. Thats hard work! The archeologists that work inside analise stuff and do research.   I'm sure that archeology can be fun but it sounds like hard work too. So if you ever want to be an archeologist   its hard work but it sounds like fun. 	WP VBP NNS .

In the following essay i will explain how Archeologists find things of the past, what they use and how they used it.   To start off, Archeologists use Picks &amp; Shovels to mostly dig up dirt, stone , and other minerals. A whisk &amp; Dustpan is used to clear artifacts of dust and grime and to clear from the site. In excavation site is the trowel, which scrapes and cuts soil to examine. Most items used are for scrapping and removal but the skim shovel uses a thin metal plate and carefully removes a thin layer of soil.   Archeologists find many things that they don't know what to do with then send it to a special facility to get it named, discovered, and even broken down into smaller pieces of the artifact, but most of the time they find bones and fossils that have decayed over time. Archeologists send most things they get from a dig site to a museum and get rich and wealthy. People help and pay for some digs and they get half or maybe even full pay of items, money, and artifacts. Some of the dig people have done either came out bad or even the archeologists die in the dig. Even though archeologists dig some find rare items in time like George Washington watch.   After all, Archeologists uncover secrets they cant uncover all of the secrets they find.

Some people may not know who archeologist are but they are about to find out today. Archeologist are really cool people that look for things that were all the way back in the 1600s. Like the James Fort in Jamestown. A lot of people beleived that it ws located near a river. Then one day archeologist found objects nearby, they suggessted the fort was further away. They began their hunt. the first objects were found in 1861, they also found floors of buildings. 100 years later they found where the fort was built. They took some artifacts back to their lab where they used computer mapping and software to make an image of the area.That 's when they found it.          Acheologist use some cool tools to help dig for artifacts and clear dirt from artifacts. They use tools like a whisk and dustpan and a skim shovel. Everybody knows who George Washington was but no one knows him as a boy. People have lived on the land called Ferry Farm for years. It is not suprising that George Washington 's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George Washington was just six years old. No one knew where his house was located, however archeologist think that there was a stone base under the house. They started digging, it took a year, then they finally found it they artifacts with it. The whisk and dustpan was used for some of the artifacts like pottery they found.The skim shovel was used to dig up the soil, it can dig up one thin of soil every scoop.           Archeologist never give up and they are very careful. Even though it took them 100 years to find the James Fort in Jamestown they never gave up they stuck to what they had to do. They were also very careful. They made sure they didn 't pass up any artifacts or dig to hard when they were looking for George Washington 's house.              You can be an archeologist too. It is very fun to learn about history and use those cool tools. Even though you may not no what it is you can still give it a try if your young or  old.

Some peoplesaid it got washed away by a river but the grup of people thing it is hiten they said it might sill be around.       The fort was built in 1607 it was when the settelers came from England to start a better life. Some people say's it was built next by a river for the settlers boat's and it was fathier. It was a new spot for settlers and protection from enemy ships.       The grup of people are sicentists they found the fist objects of Jame's fort .Then they uncovered the armor that whent to the fort and weapons and found the floors.

I dont know about you but I love finding out intresting things. I think its a challenge and people like challenges. if you like the study of  boddies and stuff like that then this is your job! I like it when you get to see old objects that know one uses or has seen. with this job you have to go to collage for awhile. I would say for about 3 or 4 years. what you do is first look at the article that you find or that has been provided for you. Then you write a topic or response about what the article is or means. And make sure you double check to see if you are correct about what you have wrote. then you look at many helpful ressorces or objects. The main part of the job is to see what people back then did. like what they ate and what they played as games and also what they made. When I grow up Im going to do this job because this is something really intresting to me. If you like jobs that are spooky sometimes and sometimes long then this is the right job for you!

They are the people who studied the past.            Arsheologists are people who went and found things like George Washington's home as a child. They find artifacts. Special artifacts from the past. They can find cool things like fort James from the Jamestown colony.              They can also tell story about the items they find. Some of them can be scarce. Most of them are. They can find things that have a lot of value and have a lot to do on how America was founded.            Normally people don't thing the artifacts are true. But most of them are they have a ton of things to do on how are founding fathers made it what America is today. artifacts tell the past, like how people farmed and did other things.            And that is why people should listen to Archeologists. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WP VBN NNP .

They had cannons to protect them from the enemy ships. Alot of people thought it was wash away by a river. The people who study the site uncovered weapons and armor that they used.               They used a computer to map all the stuff they did.

Thats really cool seeing things that are old and that are antices. I might want to be a archeologist someday and hopefully that day is soon.       Finding Fort James       1994 of group of English men came to a place called Jamestown. They lived well and they did and had cool things that archeologist's want to study. The English men threw trash and bones from animals that they ate down a well or a pit. Archeologist's would find that pit and see all of the things that were useful top them at that time. Also they would study those bones and see what animal that once living free in the wild.           Digging up George Washington's Past       In 2003 archeologist's were digging up the sight of George Washington's home. They found lots of cool things that they could study on.Some cool things that they found were the kitchen. They also found the slave quarters and the storage houses.A few years later they found the main farmhouse.           Maybe you Have Learned       Maybe you have learned alot about acheologist's job. I know that I have just from reading this passage. You have learned that being a archeologist means you need to study alot on artifacts. Also you need to do alot of  digging to find the artifacts. Just by reading this passage you even want to become an archeologist someday also just like I do when I'm older.

The Fort was made in 1607.That's when settlers came to start a new life.most people thought that the fort was built by a river.It was easy to dock ships there.It makes sense that the settlers chose that spot.Some objects near by made it easy to know thatJamestown was further away.The new spot gave more protection to the settlers.                         The first objects from Jamestown were found 1861.They uncovered armor and weapons.They discovered the floors and buildings in Jamestown. A 100 years later a they found  Jamestown.It took a long time to find Jamestown.They succeed to find Jamestown.                    That's when they found Jamestown!they found a set of marks on the ground.They showed were the walls used to be.They knew the fort would be shaped lika a triangle.thats how they found Jamestown. It was an amazing story.Thats the story of Jamestown.

Thats right! Archeologist. Archeologist can uncover many interesting facts  and objects that were from long ago.       Some things archeologist find out are from long ago peaople such as there journals and things they used.George Washington's house is a good example of an acient artifact.In 2003 Archeologist found a burnt peice pottery which shows sighns there was a fire.       Archeologist have a very important job. Without them we could not be able to know about our past as good as we know it now. Archeologist work hard to reveal many interesting things that can be priceless or worth nothing at all.       People should have a speacial thought for Archeologist. We should thank them because they help you learn about how interesting our past was and how old fashion it was also.This is why I have a great respect for Archeologist.       There are many old things in uor past that can give us a better understanding of what uor past was like.Mabey one day if you barried something of yours like a toy racecar it would be an ancient artifact and someday archeologist would find it and it could be in an meuseum.Everyone could one day be an anciant artifact.       Have you ever wondered if archeologist enjoyed there job,well I do. Do archeologist sometimes do it just for fun or do they hate what they do and just do it for a paycheck.       All in all, Archeologist jobs are very hard and we should appriciate them. 	PRP$ NNP MD VB JJ NN CC VBG NNS IN RB JJ PRP RB VBN WRB DT NNS IN DT NN NN IN . NNS RB .

The fort was built in 1607 that was the time the settlers from England came to start a new life.

Over 100 years later, a group put all there effort into trying to find out were the fort began.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The national park service led a five year study on the area to find out how the land was used. They knew that it would help them to decide were to look for proof of the fort by people doing computer mapping software to make images of the area. That is when they finaly found the fort!

He can be very skillful on the  tasks he does,but its worth it.                    He explores a lot and goes in caves and temples and other places.                                                           They record information that will help them withe the exploration                       and find treasures. They are able to have 35 people up to a team.

Troweling                          means to use a small shovel to dust of the dust on on the treasures.                   The shovels design is that it is flat and very sharp and small.                                     One team spends time studying in the lab the objects that are found.                        In a place were a team does lots of digging this is called a dig.It can take                        up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-section.                                                       Here are some tools that Archeologists use. A pick and shovel for digging                                                  into the Earth. A whisk and dustpan for brushing of the dust on artifacts.A knife                           for careful digging and to scrape dirt around the artifacts.                                                             A wheelbarrow is used for moving items from one place to the other or to                           carry dirt away from the excavation site. A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat                      edge and remove a thin layer of soil.

They found his house ad some of the artifacts the found were: the kitchen slave quarters and storage houses and the main farm house.  They say that recoreds show that he had a fire in his house.         the diggers found pieces of burnt pottery.  And that this suggests a fire occurred there.  they also found part of a clay pipe.  We all know that washington smoked clay pipes,so this discovery gives more proof its the right house.

Also they founded out about a fort no one ever knew about in there lifes.It was foud near a river. The new spot gave away protection from the enemy ship.Thats when they found James Fort.

Archeologists are very interesting and important people. You might have some questions though such as, 'Who are archeologists?' or 'What do they do?' Well, archeologists are people who study artifacts or objects from the past or dig up mysterious or well known artifacts from the past. They are important because, they help us discover past artifacts such as, James Fort or George Washington's clay pipes.                                                                         Discovering James Fort        James Fort was built in 1607 when settlers wanted to start a new life. In 1994, a group of archeologists studied the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological project. The project mission was to discover the secrets of the James Fort. But, beforethat, the first items were found in 1861. Archeologists found armor and weapons. Then, 100 years later, a group found the exact location where the fort began. The National Park Service studied for five years to discover how the land was used. They used computer mapping to make an image for that certain area. Then, they finally found James Fort! First, they found marking on the ground. The marks displayed where the fort's walls used to be. Then, they found stone ledges built over the river which, were designed to hold cannons. Also, archologists found 11 cellars, lots of burial sights, and 10 buildings! For archeoloists this was a fantastic discovery and a great acheivement that will be remembered by the forever!                                                                                        Tools     Archeologists use many different tools for all of their hard work. Most, if not all, of the tools were used for digging as you can probably imagine. One of the tools they use is a shovel. A shovel is used to dig up the dirt. Another one of the tools they use is a pick or pickaxe. A pickaxe's job is very similar to a shovel even, though they look different. A pickaxe is used to dig into the Earth. Unlike, the shovel it is used to dig stone and harder subtances than the shovel. Now, let's talk about the whisk and the dustpan. You probably used these before in your homes. A whisk is used to sweep up dirt into the dustpan. You can probably picturing yourself using this tool at home. Now, lets move on to the knife. Another tool you probably use in your everyday life. But, for archeologists it is used differently. A knife is used for carefully used for digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts. There are more tools but, those are some main ones                          Anyway, that's all I have to share. Archeologists are very interesting people and will never be forgotten and are important in history.            	WP VBP NNS . NNS VBP RB JJ CC JJ NNP NNP MD VB DT NNS IN JJ IN , NNP VBP NNS .

I know this  because in the text 'Finding Fort James' and ' Digging up George Washington's past' says that archeoligists were finding objects of the past. For example, archeoligists found pieces of the kitchen, slave quaters, and storage houses in George Washington's house from the past when he was little.  	WP VBP PRP VB NNS VBP .

What about different historical facts they've discovered? Soon you will be an expert on all of these topics and more.   First you need to know the tools they used. These are some tools they use:         Pick and Shovel Whisk and Dustpan Knife Wheelbarrow Skim Shovel Trowel   These are used for scraping away layers, digging shallow and deep digs, and transporting and clearing materials such as dirt. When archeologists search for hidden mysteries buried beneath the ground, they can't just jump right in, they have to check all their equipment and determine which tool is best for the work their doing. If they were looking for small delicate artifacts right beneath the surface they night use a knife or a skim shovel and then a whisk to dust treasures off. If they were looking for the base of a building buried deep in the ground, they would probably use a pick and shovel and then a wheelbarrow to wheel away dirt.   If it weren't for groups like The National Park Service or Ferry Farm we wouldn't know very much about America's history. Ferry Farm discovered George Washington's life before he became president. It took a year just to find the stone base of his house. The National Park Service conducted a five-year investigation of James Fort. It's hard to believe, but this group finds approximately 1 million artifacts each year! They've found tools, coins, metal toys for children, pottery, etc.   Now you know all about the job of an archeologist. Could you even imagine how much effort each person puts in each day. It's hard work being an archeologist!     	WRB JJ VBP PRP VB IN NNS . NNP PRP VB DT NNS PRP VBP . WP IN JJ JJ NNS PRP VBP VBN .

First of, you can't just start digging, you have to plan a lot. You need a 3-D computer to map out the area so you will know where to dig because if you dig in the wrong spot you will get nowhere fast. So always use a maping devise so you will know where to dig.        Second of all, archeologist use a lot of tools. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil in each scoop. Whellbarrows are very important too, they are used to take items or dirt from one place to another. Everybody knows about a pick and a shovel these items are very helpful to archeologist.        Archeologist have to be very careful with their work. They do not want to dent, break, or damge any of the important items of our American history.

Well if you do become an archeologist.       Being an archeologists is fun because if u like digging that is basically you job. Archeologist are meant to dig up spaces for people to build on or do dig up artifacts from the past. An archeologists team could hold up to 35 people. Being an archeologist takes time because it takes about two weeks to dig up 25 square feet of land.       In 1607 the settlers were trying to find James fort. they all believed he lived by a river . on the way they found a ton of tracks and signs of him with the help of an archeologist. over 100 years later some archeologists started digging to find some items that James Fort had to discover the past. Today they find nearly 1 million objects each year.         If your an archeologist it takes a lot of tools. pick and shovel to start the dig, whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifact and clear away the dirt from the excavation site, wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another, skim shovel a shovel with a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop, and trowel used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.       Finally, this is how it is like being an archeologist.                 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP PRP IN VBG . NNP PRP IN VBG NNS .

This project was designed for discovering the past and secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia . For 200 years some people thought it was washed away by a river.        James Fort was built in 1607 and it was built next to a river so it was easier to dock for ships. In researches the fort was located somewhere else. The new spot was probably gave people protection from enemy ships.       The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists study objects from the past,like uncovered armor and weapons.They also discover floors and buildings. Over 100 years later a group of people put an effort to find where the fort was first built.       The National Park Service led a 5-year study in the area to figure out what the land was really used for. They knew that this would help them decide where Fort James really was. the people used the computer to use a mapping software to make an image of the area.       That is when they finally found Fort James! the first thing they did was set marks on the ground. The marks would show where the corners of the fort wall where. from all the stories they read they new that the fort was shaped like a triangle. They made maps and they found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river. They soon realized that stone ledges were built for cannons and to hold cannons for enemies ships or troops.The archeologists also found dozens of burial sites and cellars and ten buildings within the border of the fort.       Today the group finds 1 million objects each year. The things they find includes pottery,tools,coins and even metal toys for children. in the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down in an unused well or a pit. While digging they found trash that settlers threw away. we know how the powhattan tribe attacked and how they fought back. we also know how they survived with little food.       It is exciting to discover objects from the past. It helps us know how the past was.

One of the kids picked archeologists, whose job is to study objects from the past. In 1994 , a group interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.  It was started because people have been wondering the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia.For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river.Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.                   The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.        Some people thought that James Fort was built near a river.  It was easier for the captains to dock their boats there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot.   Sometimes people would find objects nearby and suggested that the fort was probably farther away .The new spot gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.                     Some of the fist objects were found in 1861.Archeologists, the name for scientists who study objects from the past,Uncovered armor and weapons.  Some also discovered      the floors of buildings.  Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.                             The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used .  Some knew this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.

They used picks and shovels so they could dig into the earth.They used the whisk and dustpan to wipe the dust off of things they wanted to see.The wheelbarrow was used to move heavy things.The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.                 Archeologists dug up Gorge Washington past by going to his home.They have to be very carefuller not to break or hit the house. The archeologist started there digging with skim shovels.The skim shovels are so small that they can remove thin layers of soil.the soil that the archeologist dig up they put it in a box with a half inch screen at the bottom of the box.                 The meaning of this discovery is very important for the archeologist for many great reasons.First of all it helps people that live in the United States Washington was and what he did. They started to understand why he made all of the choices he made. We are learning more of our American past.                 No one knew exactly where George Washington home was for sure not even the archeologist knew.The archeologists believed that the stone base under his house was still their. That suggested that there was a fire their. the diggers found burnt pottery.that is why the archeologist beleaved that George Washington.

Some group of people want to discover Jamestown in 1994.Jamestown was in Virginia.Over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river.The fort started builting in 1607 when settlers from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river because it was easier to dock ships there, so t made sense that the settlers choose that spot.The new spot have probably gave the settlers more protection from the enemy ships.The first objects they found was in 1861 and they also discoverthe floors of the building.Over 100 year later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.The Natipnal Park Service led a five years study of the area to figure out how the land was use.They knew taht this would help them decide where to look for the proof of the fort.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area and that when they finllay found James Fort!

Geoge Washington lived with his family on a fram called Ferry Farm.They lived there for over 12,000 years.No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone.The first buildings they found were the kitchen,slave quarters, and storage house.At least four other house have been built on the Ferry Farm land, so the diggers need to proof that this is Geoge Washington's farmhouse.The records show that the Washington had a fire in their house. the diggers found pieces of burnt pottery.They also found part of a clay pipe.We know that Washington smoked clay pipe, so discover gives more proof it is the right house.They was a skim shovels to dig. The skim shovels is so small, flats, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soils , one at a time.

They learn more about how the person lived and how there childhood was. They dig big and deep holes that contain layers which are also called horizons. These are used to tell how much human activity there was at that time.               The tools they used where to dig and some where to take horizons so you could see how much activity there was and because if they used a shovel they might break some they find. If they use a skim they can stop when they hit something. They used a skim shovel to remove thin layers of soil. To move the dirt and soil they use wheel barrows.                   The other tools they use are a whisk and dustpan. This is used to clean off  artifct they find while doing there digs, a knife is also used to clean off artifacts. But it`s mianly used to scrape the dirt off. A trowl is used to scrape and cut to show the different soil in the layers. the pick and the shovel are used to start most digs in archeology.

Archeologists are people who's jobs are to search for old things. So they mostly dig things up or look for where it is and try to find it. Well if you still don't get their job it's OK I didn't either at first. So to find more about archeologists read on. This essay will tell you all about them.                         Archeologists have a very important job. They search for things that might help us to see what life was like before our generation. Recently  (in 2003)  they were working on finding more about our very first president George Washington.                           Archeologists were looking at his home. They didn't find much about his childhood though. It took them a whole in tire year to find a stone base they believed was under the house. They first few buildings they found were a kitchen, slave courtiers, and storage houses.                             They were also looking for the story of his life. If you don't know what that is, it means like what his life was like. He lived in ferry farms. He moved there was just six years old. Archeologists also found four other houses there. George Washington's father moved his family there because it makes a perfect place to build a house.                            You may wonder how they found all that stuff about George Washington. Well, to start they have different teams. There can be up to thirty-five people on a team. Teams have different jobs, though. One team tracks what's underground and uses maps to do that.The other team focuses on digging. And the last team studies objects that are found.                             And that is the job of a archeologists, and one of their projects.

Some people think that some things are lost in time but others don't like archeologists they don't give up almost ever. Archeologists don't give up because they have hope that the will find something new like a prehistoric species or answers to a question that nobody knows.        Being a archeologist is very hard and you have to put a lot of effort into it.But its all worth it when people are congratulating you for something you found just under the dirt. Someday if you become a archeologist you just might have something in a museum.

Archaeologist have to be very smart &amp; have to be very patient for things.     Archaeologist have to know the person really well to find there artifacts. Archeologist have to be wise. they had to of payed real good attention in social studies.                                                                   Archeologist are very hard workers. They have patience lots of it a pretty massive amount. Archeologist have to be wise almost as wise as Yoda from star wars.you have to have gone to a architect school or college and have gotten your degree.                                                                                           Being an archeology isn't all fun in games it's about finding useful items and being able to dig for things like dinosaur bones or even looking at stuff  in Pluto!being a archeologist isn't sitting in science and getting paid for it but it is also about digging for the precious artifacts people didn't even know of!                                                                                                                      if i were a archeologist i would make a lot of $ but that is not what matters. finding precious artifacts is a big thing for a lot of kids and adults. valuable artifacts is a big thing like how people used to mine for money. well, now they mine for artifacts so being an archeologist isn't about the money it's about the artifacts they find.                                                 being an archeologist is a wonderful thing to do in my opinion.   like my friend Isabella, she watches the history channel everyday and i can prove it because she doesn't even know what the show Jessie is! but it isn't about her. if you pay more attention to your teachers maybe one day you will become an architect i mean archeologist.                                                                              so in conclusion being an archeologist isn't so easy or to hard if you listen in social studies.

Archeologists are people who dig up artifacts from history and display them. Being an archeologist is like being able to dig up the past. You can find artifacts from famous people and buildings!            Some archeologists have found artifacts from James Fort &amp; George Washington. If i were an archeologist i would want to find artifacts from Abraham Lincoln or Benjamin Franklin. I think that being an archeologist would be really cool hope you do to. Hope you've learned a lot.             HAPPY HISTORY DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Archeologists go onto excavations to find abandoned places and find artifacts that are probably worth more than a mansion. They explore the world looking for places to excavate. They find many things, and the job pays well, (probably).          Archeologists do many fun things and use many different tools. They use these tools during an excavation, which is the hard part of being an archeologist. You dig in the ground carefully and once you find what you're looking for, you carefully dig around it. If it's a buried artifact, you carefully grab it with gloved hands and bring it up.         If it's a building that has been covered in dirt, then dig around until you've found the door, because most buildings have doors. Once you're in, you look around the building for artifacts, if there are any in the building.       Like I said, an archeologist's work is simple, but not easy.

In 1942 there was a group of people  that were interested in studying the past.   They started The Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project.The project was to discover the secrets of the James Fort In Jamestown Virginia.for a long time people thought the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it may still be around.

And it is probably really hot and humid but the satisfaction about it is when you find what your looking for you get a big relief. Whats fun about it is that you get to travel all over the world. You also get to find some really cool stuff from 100 to a thousand years ago. You also probably get payed some good money. You also get to use pretty cool tools to find what your looking for The good thing is that you find what your looking for and even more.

My name is Erik Dollani and I am a fifth grader at Endeavor Elementary in Kentwood, Mi. I will tell you about the job of an archeologist and what one does. Now enough chit chat, lets get this started!               Well if you think about it I first thought that an archeologist was a person that dug up dinosaurs but he does that and much more. Like for example in source #2 it says that the archeologists had to find the right house because they were looking for George Washington's house, then after they found it they could start working. How did they find it you say?                    Well they needed to find proof that the farmhouse they found was the right one so looked at Records of his life. The records showed that his house had a fire so the archeologists had to find a burned house that not only looked like George Washington's house but again needed proof.  So when they started to dig (the house was   so long ago dirt buried it) they found pieces of burnt pottery, a part of a clay pipe, etc. The clay pipe is when they were looking at the records they also found that he smoked clay pipes.                Now you know what a archeologist does for a living. So maybe you could grow up and be a archeologist or whatever you want to be. And while I'm at it I might as well be one too.

Archeologists have a very difficult job. They have to very carefully and gently clean and find artifacts. They have to have gentile hands when they work and a lot of patents. It may take them up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! That's along time!           Archeologists can find many things. Some archeologist found the remains of Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. Others found some things from George Washington's childhood, from his childhood home. Lots of things have been found by archeologists. Lots more are waiting to be found.                   The place where archeologists do the digging, is called a dig. Archeologists have many tools:       Pick and Shovel- Lots of digs start with these tools. They are used to dig into the earth, to get closer to the artifacts. Whisk and Dustpan- This is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. Knife- This tool is used for careful digging, and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow- these are used to move items from one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel- A shovel with a flat edge. This is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Trowel- This is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.   Archeologists have though jobs, long ones too. I think it might be cool to be an archeologist, but maybe not. It would be cool to find something. But I don't think I have the patents. I like reading about them. I hope you do too.     	NNS WP VBZ DT NN .

There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like  before people stared digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging , and the  place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologist  start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These are to small ,flat and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, at a time. That soil is than placed in a box  with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets  the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-feet section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.                                                                                                                                                             I'm going to tell you what it means.The discovery of Washington home is important for many reasons. first, it gives the citizens of the United states a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous. We also begin to know why he made the decision he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as many lived Americans. Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at Ferry Farm are bringing to life the country's first president in ways we have never seen.           I'm going to tell you about getting involved Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved. The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classrooms and outdoor activities.  Kids can explore the site, experience colonial life, and became junior archeologist.

The team that digs uses the following:      Pick and shovel    Whisk and dustpan    Wheelbarrow    Skim shovel    Trowel               They use these six to help make their job easier.     Archeologists have made many discoveries and continue to make more.One of the discoveries is the when archeologists found Fort James.The National Park Service led a five year study just to find out where to look for proof of the fort.Archeologists take their time while their on a discovery and do it carefully.              Another discovery was George Washington Past were archeologists were looking for information on Washington's past.This took a while too because Washington's home was long gone.Around the remains of Washington's home the archeologists found artifacts like clay pipes and burnt pottery.Now that archeologists know more about George Washington they have a better understanding about him before he became famous.These are only a couple of discoveries archeologists have made.                In conclusion even though archeologists job may be tough it is important because we learn more every day.Also when you dig something up you can be proud that you found somthing and know it's worth it.Further more if you're an archeologist you learn about the past andd ties you with people in our past.It's exciting to be an archeologist and your work pays off.                     	.

If they don't pay attention they might find something that isn't what they think it is.  In 1994 a group of people were interested in studying the past of jamestown.  For over 200 years people thought the fort had been washed away by a river.  But since the group of people went to study it they found that it might still be around.  People can find really amazing things if you are an Archaeoligist.  When someone writes a biographies about George Washington's childhood it doesn't tell very much information about it.  When people go and study his past they find amazing stuff that would not have been able to find from a book.       Some tools that Archaeoligists use is they use a pick and a shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.  They need to use a variety of different tools when they go and study about someone.       When Archaeoligists go to work they need to have 35 people on a team.  The first teams maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.  They would use that so if there is something buried underground they know it is there.  Also so they can know where to dig.       George Washington has lived in Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. Its location makes it a perfect place to live. No body knew where George Washingtons  home was located until the actual bruilding was gone.

THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FROM HIS CHILD HOOD AS A KID. THE FRIST OBJECTS WERE FOUND IN 1861. ARCHOELOGISTS THE NAME FOR SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY OBJECTS FROM THE PAST, UNCOVERED AMOR AND WEAPONS. THEY ALSO DISCOVERED THE FLOORS OF BUILDINGS. OVER 100 YEARS LATER A GROUP OF EFFORT TO FIND EXACLY SPOT WHERE THERE HOME WAS. NO ONE KNEW EXACLY WHERE THE WASHINTON'S HOME WAS LOCATED SINCE THE ACTUAL BUILDING WAS LONG  GONE. HOWEVER, ARCEOLOGISTS BELIEVE THAT THE STONE BASE  UNDER THE HOUSE WAS STILL THERE. THEY STARTED DIGGING IN 2003. IT TOOK OVER A YEAR , BUT THEY FINALLY FOUND IT. THE FRIST BUILDINGS THEY FOUND  WERE THE KITCHEN, SLAVE QUARTERS, AND STORAGE HOUSES.THEY FOUND THE MAIN FARMHOUSE A FEW YEARS LATER. AT LEAST FOUR OTHER HOUSE HAVE BEEN BUILT ON FERRY FARM LAND, SO THE DIGGERS NEEDED TO FIND PROOF THAT ThIS WASWASHTINTONS FARM HOUSE.RECORDS SHOW THAT THE WASHINTONS HAD A FIRE IN THEIR HOUSE. THE DIGGERS  FOUND PIECES OF BURNT POTTERY.THIS SUGGESTS A FIRE  OCCURRED THERE.THEY ALSO FOUND PART OF A CLAY PIPE.WE KNOW THAT WASHINTON SMOKED CLAY PIPES, SO THIS DISCOVERY GIVES MORE PROOF IT IS THE RIGHT HOUSE. PEOPLE HAVE  LIVED ON THE FERRY FARM FOR OVER 12,000 YEARS.IT'S LOCATION MAKES IT A PERFECT PLACE TO BUILD A HOME. THEREFORE, IT'S NOT  SURPRISING THAT GEORGEGE WASHINTON'S FARTHER,AUGUSTINE WASHINTON, MOVED HIS FAMILY THERE. GEORGE WAS JUST SIX YEARS OLD AT THE TIME. THIS DISCOVERY OF WASHINTON'S HOME IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS. FRIST,IT GIVES THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO GOERGE WASHINTON WAS BEFORE HE BECAME FAMOUS. WE ALSO BEGIN TO KNOW WHY HE MADE THE DECISIONS HE DID. ANOTHER THING IT DOSE IS HELP HISTOIANS LEARN ABOUT THE TYPE OF LIFE COLONIAL AMERICANS LIVED. ALL OF  THESE THINGS  ARE KEY PARTS OF OUR PAST AS AMERICANS. FERRY FARM  OFFERS MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS TO GET INVOLED. THE GOERGE WASHINTON SOCITEY RUNS SUMMER WORK SHOPS  WITH BOTH CLASSROOM AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITES. KIDS CAN EXPLORE THE SIT, EXPERIENCE COLONIAL LIFE, AND BECOME JUNIOR ARCHEOLOGISTS.

Though you do get to find interesting facts about the past.                Many people want to find out about the past. So that is the reason why you see people digging on the ground. Those people are called archeologists.                What they use arae picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, trowel. When they dig they need to be real careful when using the tools. Archeologists don't know when they're going to hit a clue.                    Archeologists work hard all day and all night. So we should be thankful for what they do.                     Without them we wouldn't even know dinosuars existed, or dodo birds, or even how native americans surrvived in the wild.

Their trying to find facts about George before he became famous and to find out what life was like during that time period.           Archeologists also uncovering facts about Fort James. They're finding armor, weapons, cellars, burial sites, and a lot more. They found floors of buildings and walls of the original fort. The information they find lets us see what the life of the first American settlers was like.           The work of an archeologist can be exciting, fun, or disappointing. But whatever it is it should feel rewarding to find out about or ancestors lives.

When the fort was built.Fort of Jamestown was built in 1607 when setterlers came from England to start a new life.For 200 years people thought the fort was washed away by a river.Setterlers a new spot to live in to give them selves protection.Archeologists uncovered armor and weapons.Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.These objects include pottery,tools,coins, and even metal toys for children.                  When finding George washington house.No one knew excactly were George washington house was.When George washington house got burned down archeologists found aclay pipe.The discovery of George washington house was important for many reasons.One main reason it gives citizens of the United States as better understanding of who George washington was before he became famous.                   The tools of archeologists.A pick and a shovel was use to dig into the earth.A whisk and a dust pan was to use to brush dirt off and clear away dirt from the excavation site.A knife is to careful digging and scrape dirt off the artifacts.The wheel barrow is to move  anything to one place to another.A skim shovel is to use carefully remove thin layer of soil.A trowel purpose is to use to scrape and cut the soil.The trowel is the most common tool of archeology.                   Some archeologists found out when the fort was built.Some found George washington house.Archeologists have to have common tools.

Dogs and animals are like kind of my favorite too, but I like puppies a lot.                        Nurses &amp; doctors are awesome because they have like the coolest job ever. They give you 'medicine' when you are ill. Some nurses &amp; doctors get paid real lot cause of their hard working. To adults they don't give you a sticker, but if your a kid you get to have a sticker,and sometimes they give you a lollipop.                       Electronics are my 2nd favorite things in the world, because they help you with stuff that's hard for you. I like ipods,ipads,iphones,laptops,computers,and TV. Some electronics need chargers and all that stuff.                        Dogs &amp; animals are like kind of my favorite too, but I like puppies more better than other animals.

The archeologists used whisk and dustpans to sweep up dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the amazing looking excavation site.They would also use it because they needed to clean up dirt when they step in the house with dirt and other stuff thats on there shoes.              Poeple would always use a knife to carefully dig and scrape dirt from aroun the artifacts.They would also use knifes to carve stuff on the wall or on a tree and they used it to take skin off of what they re going to eat and they wouls kuse them to carve ther names in the tree so that when they die there kids can read what there dad carved on the tree that he carved on.          Archeologists use wheelbarrows because other poeple couldn't carry heavy stuff so they would always bring the wheel barrows because whe n somone tells them to carry help  them carry something they would always get the wheelbarrow to carry the heavy thing that poeple were telling them to carry and they also use it so it wont hurt them so they just use the wheelbarrow that is a really big help               Archeologists use skim shovel that has a flat edge to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scope.And they use it sometimes so they could dignin the ground and they could find stuff in the ground and they could always use it for digging up gold or other stuff so they would always use helpful skim shovels.they would always come in handy for digging the dirt.           People use trowels to scrape and cut to veiw the different layers of sol that were put in the dir.They also used trowels for there gardens and for there flowers and the trowels would help the plant grow because the trowels could dig the dirt and you could put soil in the hole were you used the trowel to dig a hole for the flower and you could dig with trowels so you can get another plant in your garden.

It also gives people information about who they were and what they did. It also gives you information grom before that person became famous.         The job of an archeologist can be boring. It can be tiresome and slow. It sometimes takes archeologists two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section, but it's worth it.          The discoveries of famous peoples' belongings is important for many reasons. It tells us what kind of life that well-known person lived, like if thry were poor or wealthy. It also gives us information on what decisions they made and why they made them.          All of those reasons are key parts of our past as americans. For examples the discovery of Fort James, or the discovery of George Washington's house. It also makes oppertunities for kids to get involved.

But what we don't know is that he lived on a land called Ferry Farm. His father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was young. No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was not there. Archeologists thought that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in the early 2002 or 2003. It took almost a year to complete. They  used 3D cameras to find the base of the house. They finally found it with the right tools that  archeologists have and the right archeologists.                                                                              Finding Fort James                                      In the early 90's a group of people got interested in studying the past started the Jamestown R.A.P. The archeologists used different tools like picks, shovels, whisk's, dustpan's, knives, wheelbarrow's, skim shovels, and trowel's. Archeologists found out that the fort was built in 1607.And they also found out that the new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.                And that is what tools and what archeologists do for a living. They find things that was burried a long time ago. They finD different things in different places.

When they wake up they have an entire day to to look for interesting artifacts that might make history.     Although digging is exciting, it is not all fun and games. Some days include long and tedious work. The archeologists have to be careful while digging. They also use long hours using sifts to go through every single ounce of dirt to make sure they did not miss anything. It could take a  long time just to dig up a small area.         Archeologist also use a variety of tools to help them with their work. they start the dig with small shovels called skim shovels. these shovels dig up a layer of soil at a time. Next they can use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to help them dig dirt. they also use a wheelbarrow to clear away excess dirt.                                When someone finds something, the archeologist can use a whisk and a dustpan to dust off dirt from the artifact to better identify it. it is then sent to a lab for study.       That is the life of an archeologist. It is sometimes fun and always makes an impact on the world.

Some tools they use to help them find the artifacts they need are: picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels and trowels.Archeologists use these tools to find artifacts that help people understand the mysteries of the past.   Tools And How They Use Them        Picks and shovels are basic tools that archeologists use to dig up dirt.   A whisk and dustpan brushes off dirt from the artifacts that the archeologists find.   Knives are used to scrape dirt from the edges of the artifacts.   Wheelbarrows are used to carry artifacts and dirt away from the place they are searching.   Skim shovels have a thin edge that helps the archeologists remove a thin layer of soil each time they scoop.   Trowels are used to scrape and cut to see different layers of soil.   What Archeologists Do While Working         Archeologists have to be patient, so they won't be frustrated. If you are frustrated while working you won't get a lot of work done. They don't just zoom through their work, they take their time and handle the artifacts carefully. They use the tools I had listed earlier to uncover the artifacts they find. Once they find all the things they need they might take the artifacts to a museum,so that we can better understand the mysteries of the past. 	NNS WP VBP NNS .

They dig up things underground from a long time ago and unlock our past.                    Archeologists found a small place called Farry Farm. They were trying to find George Washington's house. They found a burned down house.  They found a clay pipe, they do know that he smoked a pipe.                         They used 3D computers that can track what's underground. Another team focuses on the actual digging and get far, and the place the team does the digging. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section underground.                      They used tools like the pick and shovel,most digs start with these tools and get the digging started. The whisk and dustpan it's used to brush off  dirt from little pieces of artificial pieces. The Trowel was probably the most common tool archeologist used.                      So have you learned a lot about archeologists and what they do. They have a great job if we didn't have them we wouldn't have our past history.

But there is evidence that there was a fire at G.W. farm house but they are not sure that they have the right farm house.                           they do have proof that G.W. was a semi rich family. So they have found some clothes that looked fancy. but it could also be another rich familys farm house. So the clothes migh have belonged to someone else.

Yes you do win alot of money and even with a piece of gold.         When George Washington became famous they wanted to know who was George Washinton. They discover that his house got on fire.Peaple use to be in 35 in each group.They use little shovels that were pointy.George would smoke .They would dig 25ft and wide.          Archeologist would be a fun  thing to do you mabe  you might find gold or some thing  you never seen before.If you dont find nothing well at lease you had a fun time.

Being a archeologist can be a intresting person because you can find intresting stuff like achient stuff and even old stuff from    another place far far away.The stuff that you will need is a shovel,pickax,and a wheelbarrow now when you have all those materials you will have to go to a  far  place where you think where you think you will find any kind of artifacts.So if you find a artifact you have to take it to a reall special place like a huge musiem where people can see it.    When you take it to that musiem where people can see it they will tell you where you put it then they will reward you with alot of money because when its like from 1991-2012 they will say hey that looks really really old because that time you took it to the musiem they will take alot of pictures of what you have tooken to the musiem.         Also when you are older people will have many questions for you to ask because they would want to know where you found it and how long has it took you to find that very important imfomation and special thing you found mabe you it was your dream come true.   So if if you want to be archeologist just read my story and you will understand what would you find when you turn into one or not just go the web sight called ecolocicolpedia well you know what i mean so just type it in archeologist in in that web sight so if you find it what you were looking for i am glad that you have found it ! see ya later aligator have a nice day.

I would like to find Aberham Lincon's top hat so for Hisory day I decide.t things like Dinosaur bones or old pottery from back in the old days.                                                                                                                              Your hard work pays off when you get a big find and then when you uncover it all by the end of the week you can celabrate with your co-workers.And the tools you get to use but don't forget some of the artifacts are fragile so be careful especialy with the pick and shovel because if you are not rare things can be destroied.For most digs you start with the pickovel to dig to close artifacts and with the whiskustpan you can brush off the dirt on the artifacts or clear way from the escavation site. The kife is used to carefully dig and to scrape dirt from from around artifacts.Those were the ones used the most.The next three tools they use some times.       The wheelbarrow is used to move items from place to place or to carry dirt away from the excvation site see wheel barrows are handy when your artifacts are deep into the ground for all that dirt you have to dig through so all you have to do is transport the dirt out side of the site.The skim shovel is flat edged used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop it looks like an every day shovel wrong its the same tool but its specily made for lifting up artifacts just incase if the wheel barrow is full you have anther option. The trowel is the most common tool to an archeologists it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Thats why I choose Archeologists for my history day project.

You go on adventures and hunt for those artifacts. Then those artifacts go in the museum. Sometimes you might get rewarded for what you've found.    If your an archeologist you go around the world to search for an artifact from famous people. When you find an artifact you might learn something from it. If you read about the person that your finding an artifact from, it can help you on your search. Some archeologists never give up from finding an artifact.    If there is an artifact buried underground, archeologists would dig it up with a shovel and put the dirt in their wheelbarrow. If a artifact had dirt on it, archeologists would use a whisk and dustpan to clean it up. When they need to put the dirt somewhere they would put it in their wheelbarrow. It might take an hour or more for them to find some hidden artifacts. If archeologists are far from a museum it would take them a while to get their.    Archeologists get paid by people just for finding old artifacts. Its like there going on a scabenger hunt for prised possesions. They love doing their job, being an archeologist. I think that they think that their job is awesome. Their job is also very interesting.    These are details about what archeologists do. They search for artifacts. They dig up artifacts. Sweep the dirt off of it. They also bring it to the museum and get rewarded. This is what archeologists do.

The first objects found in 1861.   Acheologistss,the name for scientists who study objects from the past. They discovered  the floors  of buildings.over 100years later,a group effort to find  the exact spot where the fort  was built began.               The national park service led a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used . They knew that this would help them decide where  to look   for proof of the fort .They were studying. they knew  that forts would be like triangles . they made maps and found out that the forts stretched all the way to the river.Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.the objects include pottery ,tools coins, and even metal toys for children.                             No one knew exactly where the washington home was located since the actualbuilding was long gone. they found the main  farmhouse. the first builings they found were the the kitchen , slave quarters.                                                                                                                                   at least four other houses have built on ferry farmland , so diggers needed. the diggers found pieces of burnt pottery.                they found found part of clay pipes so this discory gives more proof .

If  I were an archeologist. I would love to get up in the morning every day!   As you can see the life of an archeologist has it's ups and downs. The life of an archeologist would be very different and cool at the same time. So hope that anyone who want's to become an archeologist that good luck. The life of an archeologist would be very interesting compered to most jobs. Being an archeologist could be hard but it also could be fun you never know what's around the next corner in your life so go around that corner. Archeologist's are like a type of scientist so if you want to become an scientist than the job of an archeologist would be perfect if you want to dig up treasure from the past. The job of an archeologist is pretty cool so if you feel that you want to become an archeologist than go for your dreams there is no limit to what you want to accomplish in your life! So go above those limits and become an archeologist. So I hope that you want to become an archeologist.              Being an archeologist is tough here are some ways.           You have to do a lot of digging   You have to do a lot of sitting and standing to!     You mite get injured    You would go away from home for a long time.[Like for a year maybe two]                                         Though being an archeologist is tough it mite actually be fun. Here are some ways that being an archeologist would be cool or fun.           You would be able to travel all around the world.   [Africa, New York, Texas, Russia are all places that you could see.]   You would be the person who would discover  a creature that has never been seen before.   {Like a type of dinisore}   You could go to King Tut's tomb. {but only archeologist can touch the artifacts}   You could discover another mummy.   You mite even get to discover the lost city of Atlattice. [now that would be cool!]   You get to see things under water that some people wont see in a life time.   most people want to be a archeologist but cant because they don't have the education that you need to become an archeologist.             While being an archeologist you mite have the opportunity to say           'Look I think I found bones buried over here!'           Who knows there is a list that could go on for ever! So as you can see most people can't afford to go to school so that they can get the career that they deserve. So if you want to be an archeologist I say you should go for the job of your dreams.              Here are the steps of getting artifacts from a curtain location.           First you have to find the location in which  you will search for artifacts.   Secondly you have to find the location on the site that you want to dig   Thirdly you have to dig all the dirt off the area   Fourthly you have to gently grab the artifacts and place them gently into a safe place were they won't be damaged on the way to be exam-end.

Archeologist can find interesting things of people that have vanished that might have did something great to change the world. An archeologist gets to learn about the history of someone if they didn't now anything about them. Some archeologist starts their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time.               That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called a troweling. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paintbrushes and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifacts that are found. It can take up two weeks to dig a 25-square foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but worth it.            All the tools that are used by archeologist are the pick and shovel-most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Whisk and Dustpan- used to brush dirt off the artifcats and clear away dirt from the excavation site.                      There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that the people will know what it looked like before people started digging. I think the job of an archeologist would be cool because you get to learn about the past history of many wonderful people.

First you would have to try and find artifacts. It is also interesting because archeologists get to learn more about the past. It would also be hard because you have to spend days or weeks on finding an artifact, I also think the job of being an archeologist is pretty amazing because you would get to discover cool artifacts from the past that nobody has known about yet, also in the reading section it is written that archeologist discover old artifacts from the past like George Washington's burnt pottery.       I think it is important that archeologists tried their best to take their time on finding artifacts. An archeologist would have to be careful to use the right tools to use at the right time or they might mess up.Archeologists also have to be patient because if they aren't patient they would just probably get mad and tried of just digging and tried to dig faster and instead they might just destroy the artifact. If an archeologist finds an artifact then it means they have discovered a piece of America's past.       Also they get to find information that nobody has known about yet and information to add on to what we already know. Archeologists also have be the kind of person that does not loses their temper very easily  because if they did they might just throw the artifact on the ground and it might break into tiny pieces.An archeologist would have to work hard and they might probably have to have some experience with technology because they might have to work with computers to locate where an artifact is. An archeologists job is mainly to dig up artifacts from the past to find out more about the past.       The job of an archeologist is also important because the past of America relies on them. Also archeologists have to be careful on finding artifacts.The job of an archeologist is important because in the reading section 'Finding Fort James' it is written that there is a group of archeologists to discover about James Fort. Archeologists have to dig up the past so that we can know more about America's past.These are some of the things that I think about for the job of an archeologist. An archeologist's job is important for us because we need to know more about the past.

The thin about being an archeologist is you need to know what your doing because if you don't know what your doing you screw up the operation.Each tool has a special job to do so we will start with the pick and shovel you would start with these tools first. Than you would start with the whisk and dustpan they are used to dust off the artifacts. Next is the knife the knife is used to do careful digging and scrap the dirt from around the artifacts.

The project was for Jamestown, Virgina for over 200 years. People thought that Jamestown had been washed away for a long time.Some people might think its still around.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England. They believe that James Fort was built near a river. It was found in 1861 over hundred years later some people went out to find the exact spot where it was built. People did a computer map to make a image of the fort. When peple found James Fort the first thing they did was   make  marks on the ground.The marks they made showed where the walls used to be at.They found out that in the fort there were canons in the fort and a dozen burial sites and ten all buildings in the border of the fort.           All the things people know about George washington are about his time a soldier and president. people dont know that much about his childhood some people resently found more about his childhood.           George was only six years old when his family moved  to Ferry Farm no one knows where his home was at because the actual building had been gone for a long time. people started digging in 2003 for the stone base from the washingtons house that they thought was still there it took over a year to find but the people found the stone base of the house. The first buildinds they found were the kitchen,slave quarters and the storage houses a few years later they found the main farmhouse.There were at least four other houses that had been built on Ferry Farm.Records say that the washing tons house was set on fire the people found pieces of burnt pottery they also found part of a clay pipe this gives proof it is the right house.

A knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.A wheelbarrow is used to move stuff. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.A trowel probably the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the diffrent layers of soil.

Artifacts are the belongings of people that lived long ago, such as pottery, jewelry, and coins. Archeologists dig to find all things like that.       Archeologists use tools such as picks, shovels, Trowels, wheelbarrows, and knives. Archeologists use all of these tools for a different purpose, shovels to clear dirt, picks to clear rocks, wheelbarrows to move dirt, trowels to delicately remove dirt, and knives to clear dirt from artifacts.       Archeologists have a hard job they have to dig a very long time to find anything, normally. It takes Almost 2 weeks to dig a 25-square-foot hole, so it does, in-fact, take a lot of time. Archeologists normally work in 2 teams one researches found artifacts and looks at the area from 3D computers and charts out the land, while the other digs for artifacts. Digging for artifacts is very long process and you need to have enough strength to endure a lot of digging, as well as heat and sweat.       After artifacts are found the possessing team examines, cleans, and researches all the found artifacts and they either get thrown away or gets put in a museum.

That is because there are many good and bad things about the job. You may call these pros and cons. In this report I will tell you about the job. After you read this you decide if you want to be an archeologist.                     In the Job of an archeologist you will learn about history by digging up, studying, and graphing famous places in history. now, you won't be doing all of this at once. The archeologist are broken up into teams. There can be up to thirty-five people on a team! The first team graphs and maps the area on three dimensional computers. How cool is that! The second team works on the actual digging. They start their digging with a tool called skim shovels. Skim shovels are flat, small, and sharp. Troweling is another process. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt from artifacts. When you are digging it can take up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five square-foot section! The other team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts. It takes a long time to figure out the story and reason for the artifact, but the outcome is huge!                          In this paragraph I will tell you the good things about the job of an archeologist. One good thing about the job is that you would uncover, or dig up, pieces of history. When you uncover pieces of history it helps many people, including average Americans not just archeologist. When you help people you help them in these ways: You help American citizens a better understanding of the situation. It helps People understand why things are the way they are. The last reason is it helps historians learn how life was at the time. Another reason an archeologist is a good job to have is you could dig up one of a kind items like a cavemen spear so it could be a good paying job. A good thing about the job as an  archeologist is you could make new friends at the digging site. Those are all the good things about being a archeologist.                      Some bad things about the job of an archeologist is you probably not be around your family a lot unless they work with you. Another bad thing about the job is that you are working in the sun all day and you would get really hot and sweaty and you would probably get a lot of sun burns over the summer. You are working in mud all day if you are a digger so you would be filthy, so that is a bad thing about the job. Money would be a problem depending on the site and amount of things you find there so that could be good or bad.                         Now it's time for you to decide do you want to be an archeologist? I wouldn't do as a full time job but I would try it someday.

In school, we have to prepare for a school-wide event called History Day. This event happens every year, and i am very excited to start doing it. Here is what I've come up with so far. This event also contains information about archeologists.                                                       Archeologists                                            Archeologist are not only diggers, they are also are type of scientist. Archeologists have tough jobs, but strange enough, they seem to like their job. Whenever they are digging at a important site, they have to be careful that they are using the right tools. They have to use thin tools, so that they can dig thin layers of soil at a time. They also have to be careful that they don't damage any artifacts while digging through the soil. They have 3-D computers that they use so that they can see what is under the soil, and that they don't accidentally step on something that is valuable.                                                         Learning About the Past                                             Many Archeologists have dug at George Washington's home. They have found out many things about George Washington's life as a young boy, and also have found many artifacts. They have found out that he had a fire in his house and found several pieces of burnt pottery proving that. George Washington's home was located on Ferry Farm which has been there, for about 12,000 years.If you want to become an archeologist, start digging, and get into the world of archeology.

What do they go through to find the artifacts, what problems do they encounter. Being an archeologist is a hard job. You must have great patience and patience is a virtue. It can take years to find such treasure, just like the archeologists who tried hard to scour the Ferry Farm for George Washingtons homestead. It took them a good amout of years to find even a few artifacts. But let's not go to far into that, and get close to the real subject.                      Arceologist have to use many methods to find ancient arifacts. They slowly dig using tools such as picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. Some tools allow these scientists to carefully dig for treasure. They also can use tools like the pick to dive through tough rocks. Methods that they use can be methods such as sending teams at differrent times, making 3D models that track things underground, and checking notes before digging.                      Clearly, archeologists must have many tools and methods. Without them, the scientists can get lost to many times. Archeologists can have very hard jobs, yet it benefits them in the end.

For 200 years people thot that the fort was washed away.  the fort was bilt in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.  Most belev that the fort was bilt  by a river.  Over 100 later we fond the exakt spot.        We fond the fort we put marckers were the wall was.  We aso fond a big hole whar they throw trash and bones.

Then the second team stats digging and looks for the artifacts. The last team studies the artifact. But first the diggers must dig up the artifacts by using the skim shovel.               Then the archeologists dig until they fill the wheelbarrow. And then take the dirt to a box and put the dirt inside. And the box has a half a inch screen so that lets the dirt out an the artifacts stay in. Another  process of digging is called troweling. Troweling is when diggers use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.               The last process is wean the dirt and the artifacts are separated the archeologists send them to the last team at the lab. And the archeologists tire to classify the artifacts like as broken pottery and pieces of cloth. Then they see how they wear used and how used them.

It can help you learn about it too. digging up artifacts can tell people about what happened in the past and how animals went extinct. There was a process going on where up to 35 people were digging at a Ferry Farm.              Discovering Washingtons house gave the citizens a better understanding of the infamous George Washington's life. George Washington's father moved his family to a ferry farm when George Washington was 6 years old. Archeologists started digging in 2003 to find the base of George Washington's house to get its location of where the house was actually sitting. One year later they found the location of the house. The ferry farm that Washington lived on gave lots of children lots of things to do. The children had lots of games and puzzles to do on the farm. Washington had society going that ran summer workshops. There were also indoor/outdoor activities for the children to do on the farm also.

They work in teams there can up to thrity people in a group. Before they can even dig they have to study the land get an idea where the artifacts are in the ground. Archeologists use many tools to help them like the skim shovel it's used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.          Many things haveover been found by archeologists over the years but one of the coolest was when they found Fort James. Fort James was  over 1000 years old and they still found it.  If you think about it is pretty cool to find those Kind of things.  Did you know that they found  Washingtons childhood house.          Being an archeologist would be pretty cool getting to find aintent artifacts.

An archeologist is another name for a scientist who looks for stuff at historical places. An archeologist usually finds artifacts for museums or other places. When an archeologist finds something, it's usually not something modern day-like.                   Archeologists have tools that they have to use so they don't get the artifact dirty. Also they have to use the tools so they don't damage the artifact. When an archeologist damages or gets an item dirty, it dosen't have as much value. When it dosen't have as much value, the museum may not want it.               They also should wear gloves so they don't get fingerprints on the artifact. If they get fingerprints on the artifact, the have to wash it. When they was it, it could have something important on it that they wash off. If they was it off, again, it might not be worth as much or lose value.                     Archeologists should also make sure they don't carry they heavy things too recklessly. They should use a wheelbarrow. But, they shouldn't use a wheelbarrow for they light objects. If they go too recklessly with the light objects, they will probably break. Same with the large objects.

The job of a acheologist is finding the evedence of where historys people lived, went, had, or there secrets. Being a acheologist can be hard or fun depending if you like it. They use many tools too like the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheel barrow, skimshovel, and the trower. For acheologist diging up a sene or place can take a while maybe even years long! But its all worth it.             Being a archeologist takes time and hard work to find artifacts that no one a found. As a archeologist you can find many things like packs of sigerets, clothes, possibly weapons, and all sorts of stuff! As a acheologist you can find things no person has found or discovered.            How do archeologist find all these things?- Well what they have are teams of 35 to take a turn and work on the site. So wht the first team does is maps the area using a 3D computser which can track to see what is underground. What the firt team of archeologist do is record the things under so the next team knows where to dig up what is under. After all that they keep on going and going. It can take very very long to dig these places up, it takes two weeks just to dig up a 25-square foot section too! Last of all the last team spends days studying the objects they found in there lab. The whole thing is slow and hard, but its all worth it.            If you never knew, finding Washinton's house is important to many people because first, it give every person a better understanding of who George Washington was before he had died. The only people who can find this out is the archologist. Finding these clues about famous people really do help people figure out thing about people they never knew. Why is this so important? These famous people may have had or done things we all dont know about. Think about it, maybe Washington made a crime before the war, maybe Ben Franklin was in the war fighting with a gun. But you never know. This is the job of a acheologist.

So now The next story  Finding Fort James, well they find out that fort james was by a dock by a river and it was built in 1607 when settlers form england had moved there well there is a good reason why well beacause they wanted to get away from their enimes witch that was a good place to live at Well that was it.

Like in the story Finding Fort James they dug up a trash can from that time and they found out what they threw away and also found the bones from animals they had killed. Some people even threw away thier dolls.           Archeologist don't know much about everything. Most archeologist can't dig up everything with just a shovel they have to use a pick,whisk,dustpan,skim shovel,and a trowel. Archeologist have found lots of dinosaure bones and drawings that cave men and women have wrote. Archeologist aren't the only people in the world who have found dinosaure bones before or that have found a fossil or two before.           Archeologist aren't the only people in the world who can go and find bones and fossils for a living lots of people aren't archeologist and they go and pick up fossils and bones for a living . So if you find somthing that looks like a bone or a fossil bring it to your school or bring it to a place were they could find out if it is a fossil or a rock. You don't have to be embaressed about brining somthing to a place where they would know what it is.               If you are a kid who wants to be a archeologist when they grow up you have to study a lot. If you want to be an archeologist when you are even a grown up you can go to college and study about different animals bones and you will have to know the difference between fossils and rocks. You are never to young to start to study to be an archeologist.But you do have to have a good edacution.

They use picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim, shovels, and trowels and search for things. Once they find a weird little item, they brush it off and observe it. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but in the end something is found.       In 1994, archet ologists gather together and searched for what seemed to be James Fort. People thought that it was washed away by a river;however, they didn't go searching for possible artifacts. Discoveries in the area are hinted that James Fort is still around.       James Fort was built in 1607. The first objects were found in 1861. The items found were armor and weapons. Then the National Park Service led a five-year observation of the area to find James Fort. They looked for proof that James Fort was still there. That's when they found it. The proof was that they found marks where walls used to be. Their mission was complete.           Archaeologists wanted to find George Washington's past so they went to Ferry Farm. They started digging at 2003. It took over one year, but finally it was found. They first identified a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Main farmhouses were found later.       Records indicate that George Washington's house caught on fire. They found a clay pipe. We know that George Washington smoked a pipe. Therefore, the evidence is relevant.       Digging up the past takes work to do. It is tiresome, but worth it in the end. Whether looking for dinosaurs, people, objects or anything.

To begin with , George Washington farther moved his family to an island named Ferry Farm when he was just six years old .No one knew were the Washington family lived However archeologists believed that the stone base under the house that was still there.          Futhermore,at least four other houeses have been built on the Ferry Farm land ,so the digers needed to find proof that this was George Washingtons farm house.The diggers found picees of burnt pottery .           Another thing , that how did archeologists find all these things that were in George Washingtons house all those years ago . Each year,many teams will work on the site .

Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels.These shovels are so is the small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. this lets the dirty fall out while the artifacts stay in the digging also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes,and wooden picks to remove dirt.It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! another tams spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. the whole process in slow and tiresome, but it's Worth it.

If you have the best thinking and more background knowledge you will be able to me an archeologist. You need well trained people to teach you how to be one. SKILLS is what you need to be one of these very smart people. Don't think it is a skip, hop and a jump away to being an archeologist. You need a lot of tools and to know how they work.                     So just say you were going into a place where archeologists work at. Don't think their going to just give you a job. Their going to give you a whole bunch of tests because they don't know if your well trained. Then your probably going to mess up in the report with spelling issues. Nobody would want that to happen and get a lower grade in the report.                     Many people are going to need several resources for their report. If they do not have any they will be in great danger and suffer from not having any sources. Also, anyone who is far behind might not get enough sources and work on their report.

Some archeologist went to George Washingtons house to see what they could find, they found a clay pipe and knew it was George Washingtons house because George Washington smoked clay pipes. Archeologist is the name for scientist who study objects from the past, they uncover many things such as armor and weapons from wars, stuff that people from the past had. Archeologist use a lot of tools like pick axes and shovels, whisks and dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowel.

They have been looking for artifacts of George Washington's past. They have found out that his house was burnt down.       Archeologists dont just look for items from the past they may dig in deserts to find fossils from back maybe 1,000,000 years ago. Archeologists will try to dif from the oldest rock layers (thats where the oldest artifacts or fossils are located)       The tools they may use are: A Pick and Shovel (that is what most digs start off with), A whisk and Dustpan which is used to clear away dirt from artifacts. A knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts, A wheelbarrow which is used to move items from one place to another or the carry away dirt from the excavation site,a Skim Shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. A Trowel  is probably the most common tool in archeology and is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.           Archeology started when a group of spanish people found fort james and started digging there that has attracted many people to become an archeologists they used 3D computers to judge what it is.

They are excited to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. These people find many artifacts of a person they would like to knnow about.            They have to use patients and take time in their work. Now, the objects that they find include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. While digging in the area, the archeologist found the trash the settlers thre away, including the bones of animals they ate.            If i were an archeologist, i would try to find unknown inventions of Benjamin Franklin. If you were an archeologist, who would you want to do research on and then what do you want to find about them?

Sometimes why people hate it is because they don't get money so they get blown off for nothing.   Or sometimes people fine a really rare artifact like gold and diamonds so they get rich.   Some people think it is stupid like me. But maby in the future we will like the job   of a archeologist maby who knows?                  If there is ancient castles or a famous persons life is like we can find it.   If so maby we cant or maby we can find the lost city of Atlantis. if it exist we can find it no matter what.   If you want to be an archeologist thats fine but other wise we can all dig for fun who knows what we will find?                  If I do be a archeologist I will be alone and look for gold, diamonds, and rubys. You can do all of that too.   You can be a archeologist all you want. I dont care if you do if I would do it I would just want to do it so I   can get rich. It would be nice if you go out and dig on a nice hot day for fun thats what I would do if I where   you. If there is a legend of a golden kingdom under sea we could find it. Or maby we can find the rest of the Titanic. So all I am saying if you want to be a archeologist be one if you want to I don't. Im waiting until I get older. Because I want to be famous so I get rich but I will have to think about it beause I dont want people following me all around that will make me made but I will have millions of fans you can be like that.                  All im saying is that im not ready yet maby you are but me not yet. Just to be sure heres the tools you will need.      TNT,  Pickaxe, Knife, Shovel, Flashlight, lots of Batterys, Helmet, lots and lots of rope, a dump truck, a bulldozer, a metal detector and some matchs for the TNT. Here are some some more tools for artifacts. Wheel barrow, trowel and a whisk and a dustpan.

The job of an archeologist is fun and interesting. When you are an archeologist you find artifacts from the past. You also learn about the history of places. You get to see and interact with things back then. finding fort James and interacting with things when George Washington was a boy can be the little things that Archeologists do. When archeologists look over things they do not just skim it they examine it with great care. When someone wants to be an archeologist they have to have a lot of patience. It is really exciting to be an archeologist because you get to discover objects that were frequently used by people long ago. It is interesting to learn about the past and who used to walk around the earth before us.           There are many puzzles when you are an archeologist. You have to look very carefully and recognize things. When you are an archeologist you use many utensils such as a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and a trovel. when you are an archeologist you may get dirty!           To Conclude, being an archeologist is nice and educational. It is fun to do and is very interesting. Digging up the past is a great way to imagine how people used to live in the past. Now even you can! Ferry Farm offers many oppurtunities for kids to get involved. Kids can sign up and do fun crafts, classes, games, and crafts.

In this job you can find many interesting things of many famous or well known people. why do we care about these old pots of clay pipes you may ask your self. Well that's easy an archeologist finds these old things and examines them to figure out its importance in the past. we would not have know about dinosaurs and cave men if there were never archeologist.           If you are ever doing a report on George Washington you have archeologist to thank for finding out about his child and young adulthood. before we knew mostly about his time in the militia and as first president, but a team of archeologist wanted to find out more about him. So it was up to the computers to find the dig spot. After scanning the area they found it, George Washington's house. Now it is time for the diggers to come in. they dug for over one year until finally they uncovered the Washington estate in 2004. Still they kept digging after that and a few years later they uncovered the main farmhouse.            We still don't know about some famous people's past life so to this day archeologist are searching for more evidence of these people's childhood. There still may be more about the revolutionary war, or about the boycotts. this is one of the reasons archeologist still are trying to uncover the secrets of our worlds past. Though it may be long and tiring archeologist find the artifacts because the think it is worth it.            The job of an archeologist is an interesting job, yet it requires a lot of patience. Those who choose the life of an archeologist may get bored after 25 five days of uncovering one single area, but the one thing they look forward to is finding things no one else has found. Still patience is needed they have to send it off to a lab to examine it for a very long time. Then after that you may finally become famous because of what you found.             To conclude this essay the life of and archeologist has its ups and its downs, but even we can learn from archeologist not just about antic items we can also learn patience. Anoughther thing if you thought it would be all dirt and nothing else think again archeologist find many thing in one dig. Finaly acheologist may spend along time digging but in the end it is realy worth it.

They find artifacts by  mapping the dig area with a 3D computer, and start digging with a skim shovel until the digging team gets close to the object. But before they start digging with a trowel or a knife, they use a wheelbarrow to clear dirt out of the dig area. When they get to the artifact, they then use a whisk and dustpan to clean the object and send it off to the lab for analysis.

Well, if you didn't 'Finding Fort James' by Cheryl Bradley and ' Digging up George Washington's Past' by Gloria Corres ?? explains you all about it. Archeologist's job may be hard and difficult but, if you accomplish what are you looking for they will have a joy.               To begin, it will be very hard. It will be hard because you have to find the place at first. Next, you need to dig until you find it. Then, you need to get rid of the dust. It is very hard and waste of your time when it is not a artifacts. If you find it it will be nice. You need to buy many equipments too. Like whisk, wheelbarrows, pickaxes, shoves etc.also, you will need lots of crews to find your artifact. It will be hard to dig all the places by yourself. You will need 3D computers too! you will need it because you need to see the land, landscapes, how deep is artifact, and where is the artifact.              One other case, it would be difficult. you need to find a artifact, if you didn't you need to go to another place. Also, it takes a long time to find a research and a proof. If they don.t believe what you found it would be a waste. Then, you will be popular and then you will need to find more. Also it is a risk for your life. if artifact is in the volcano you might die.              Finally the joy will come. You will have a great success because of your artifact. It is worth it to risk your life.              The archeologist's job may be hard but, it will be worth it. In Life there may be a challenge but you should never give up.

Archeologists use all kinds of tools.The first tool they use is the pick and the shovel.They use the pick and the shovel to dig into the earth close to artifacts.Sometimes they have to be very careful because one little bump could make the artifact break because it is so old.        The second tool they use is probably the trowel.I think it is the trowel because the trowel scoops up thin layers of dirt.The trowel kinda looks like a shovel but it is way smaller.Sometimes the archeologists don't even have to use the trowel because they have so many other tools.         The third tool they use is the skim shovel. The skim shovel has a flat edge.That edge is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil  with each scoop.That is what the skim shovel is used for.        Fourth is the whisk and dustpan. The whisk and dustpan are used to carefully brush dirt off the artifact and to clear dirt away from the excavation site.This is so it won't get to dusty.That is what the whisk and dustpan is for.

Well, you have come to the right place! In this article, you will learn all about the study of artifacts, otherwise known as archeology. If you want to learn more about this marvelous art, then read on!                      First of all, it helps us learn all of the facts that may not be seen in biographies. This was stated in the article titled Digging up George Washington's Past, 'Most of what we know of George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have much information about his childhood. That's changing, however. Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.' This shows how by archeology we can find out more about historical people, landmarks and place. Due to this compelling quote it should be easy for one to see how important archeology is.                      Also, there are six essential tools to learn about before becoming a world class architect: {from Tools Used by Archeologists}       Pick and Shovel: This is used to dig into the earth in order to get close to artifacts. Whisk and Dustpan: Together these are used to clear off dirt from artifacts and the excavation site. Knife: Used for careful digging. Wheelbarrow: To move items or carry away dirt. Skim Shovel: To remove a thin layer of soil. Trowel: To scrape and cut layers of soil.                       Last but not least, how do you practice the art of archeology. Well there are various methods but we will only cover there most basic ones today. There are three teams of people as large as 35 people. One team maps the area using 3 dimensional  computers to track the underground. Another team does the 'real digging'. The last team studies the artifacts that are found. Working together is very important in archeology.                          In my opinion, archeology must be fun and I would love to be an archeologist. All in all, archeology is a very important study. Maybe in the generations  of the generations of the future their will be technology to scan for artifacts and to analyze them.

After that study and make a presentation. Practice in front of a mirror to get used to an audience.       Take deep breaths before you go on so you're confident. When you're talking make sure you look more at the audience and try not to look at you're notes so much.       Last but not least don't worry about it because that can get you very stressful and usually when you're stressful you make some grammar mistakes or stumble on you're words.

The things that they dig up is called artifacts. Artifacts can help us know about the people of the past. We could know how they lived, how they worked what they used to live, and etc.               Archeologists work in groups. Some study the artifacts, while others do the digging. Before the digging,there is a group with 3D computers that that track what is underground. People work in teams. there could be more than 35 people on a team . the digging site is called a dig. People dig out dirt to get the artifacts. Archeologists need patience. Digging could take month or even years. It can take two weeks to dig 25 square feet of dirt. Digs begin with pick and shovel, which is also the most common tools used by acheologists. Sometimes, you won't find anything at the dig, but other times, you will find artifacts. Some artifacts are very precious. It is worth the effort of digging for a very long time.                Many kinds of tools are used by archeologists. Pick and shovels are used to dig into the dirt to find artifacts. Whisk and dustpan are used to cean dust off artifacts. A knife is used to scrape the dirt around the artifact. Wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt and artifacts. Skim shovel is used to remove thing layers of dirt. A  Trowel is used to scape and cut to view different layers of dirt. It is one of the most common tools for archeology.                 Archeologist help us to study the past. We can know about how they lived, how they worked, and the things they used. Being an archeologist is a fun job.

Archeologists find fact's about history. They find fact's about people or  even thing's like cave's or old building's. They work very hard on not trying to mess up.                                                                                                             Archeologists are realy smart at thing. Studying facts is raelly fun they get to go to fun places.They got to know alot of thing like math or other things.They got to dig and find things so its a really hard work for them so work is hard for them.

These people have changed history so much today.               They discover things such as floors of buildings.Over 100 years later,a group effort came to find the EXACT spot where the fort was bulit began.Archeologists knew that their fort would be shaped like a triangle.They made maps to see where to go.                Archeologists dig with a lot of tools/supplies.They used things such as Pick and Shovel,Whisk and Dustpan,Knife,Wheelbarrow,Skim Shovel,Trowel.Well first is the Pick and Shovel it is used for the digging for the most part.Whisk and Dustpan are used to brush the dirt off.Knife is used to cut things but you have to be very careful with this knife.Wheelbarrow is used to move items.Skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to move a thin layer of soil.Last but not least is the Trowel it is used to cut or scrape a item.                  I hope you learned something from my essay.I also hope that you understood.I hope you understood the meaning of the stuff they use.It is very important that you understand that a whisk and duskpan clear away the objects and a knife is used to scrape away the objects and a trowel is used to cut different layers of soil.It is mainly important that you know the meanings. Again, I hope you enjoyed my essay.                                                                                                      BY: ADAIR STILL!!

Then they found a trail of lines were the fence use to be and found the fort. They found  garbage and some bones from the bottom of the fort they also learned how they lived in winter. They know find a 'million things a day'.       the second discovery is the home of George Washington and his life as a kid. they were digging at what the archeologist thought was his home and found a a kitch a slave quarters and a storage house. They finly found out that it was his house.       So today we learened that the archeologist are realy cool and they find thing that we wouldn't.to be an archeologist  you sould have patience and skills.

In the following paragraphs you will learn about archeologists and there very important jobs. Without them we would have never learned about George Washington's childhood and much more.       Archeologists have special tools that they use. For example the Skim Shovel it has a flat edge to be able to dig easily through the rough dirt. Also it won't brake things because it doesn't have that much force. An other tool is the Wisk it is use by wiping back and forth against the artifact. The Trowel is used to slowly look at the different layers of the soil. Those are some of the amazing tools that the archeologists use!       An archeologists job is to go were they have not yet discovered about a famous person. In the passage bout George Washington it said that they didn't know about his child hood so, they went to where he grew up and dug. They found some more information about him. Also in the other passage about finding Fort James. They discovered that they live by the water they lived inland.       In these paragraph hopefully you learned a lot about astrologists and there very important work. Also you learned about there tools that they use during there work. Thanks for listening.

You would be able to discover things about famous people that nobody else knows and you would be the first one to find out about it, plus you get to do it every day.       Archeologists use tools such as the pick and shovel which is used to dig into the earth close to artifacts, the whisk and dust pan which is used for brushing dirt off artifacts, and the knife which is used for careful digging and scraping dirt from around the artifacts. Thats not all the tools, there is much more, thats only a few of them.       Archeologists find out new things all the time weather it's a famous person or just an artifact such as a bone or a fosil. Archeologists discover things like dinosour bones, different types of rocks and lots of other things.       Now that you know all this about archeologists don't you think it would be fun and interesting to be one. You would get to dig for stuff hasn't been found for over a thousand years. maybe more? The most interesting part to me would probably be the dinosour bones knowing they've been there for over a thousand years.

It is a very long process requiring multiple people to carefully dig up artifacts from the ground. Though it takes a long time, the results are worth it. Many sites relate to famous people or areas or even ancient cities, homes or forts. Archeology teams can be huge, lots of people are needed for delicate work.      Digging up the past takes a long time. There can be up to 35 people on a team but still it takes years to dig up small/medium sized areas. In 'Digging up George Washington's Past' it said that it took years to just finds some buildings. Archeologists can find interesting things, that's what makes their job interesting. In 'Finding Fort James' it said that they found the trash that got thrown away. The archeologists have to use small and delicate tools (in source 3). Some tools include a pick, whisk and dustpan, knife, skim shovel and a trowel. Some tools were for moving large amounts of (useless) dirt with no artifacts, such as the shovel and wheelbarrow (the wheelbarrow could be used for artifacts too).      The process takes a while, but it is worth it. There are a lot of tools for this process. This process sure is important, surely not boring.

For 200 years people think that James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia had been washed away by a river. Because of some discoveries mad that might just be a myth.               James Fort was built in 1607 when settlers or people came from England. You can see that in 1994 it would be had to recover these interesting artifacts. Not just historians but other people thought that it was built near a river, but objects that were found were in fact not at all close to the river. So these people figured that it would give more protection when enemy ships were near.            The first objects found was not even in this century. They were found in 1861. The archeologists found armor and weapons.                                                                        Archeologists             Some of the tools used by archeologists use are picks, shovels, whisks and dustpans. They also use knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels and trowels.                They have many different ways to use these tool here are all of them. Picks and shovels are used to dig into the earth near artifacts. The whisk and dust pan is to brush off dirt around the artifact or clean around the excavation site. The knife is used to scrape dirt from the artifacts . The wheelbarrow is to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The skim shovel is thin so it removes thin layers of soil. Finally, the trowel is used to scrape and cut different layers of soil.                                                                        Goodbye   We've learned about James Fort All the way to archeologists but its time to say goodbye. Have fun learning more about these interesting topics.

Many of history's mystery's are solved by archeologists. Their job is to find artifacts about how was it like in the past. One of their amazing discovery's they found was about George Washington and Fort James.       We all know about George Washington as a solider and a President but what about his childhood? Archeologists are finding more about Washington's childhood everyday. As we know it George lived on the property now know as Ferry Farm. His family moved there when he was just six years old. Four other houses have been build on Ferry Farm. Archeologists found burnt pottery in one of the houses, they are suggesting a fire might of occurred in the house. Along with the burnt pottery they found a clay pipe. We knew that Washington had smoked on a pipe. Now they know that this was Washington's House! We need to know about out ancestors in the past to build new items that can help us with the world today.       Now during that whole process of finding burnt pottery and Washington's clay pipe their is a team all behind it. Thirty-five people can be on a team and five teams each have work to do. The firsts team maps out  the area to see whats underground and what the artifacts on a 3D computer. The second team does the digging that is called a dig. This archeologist team uses skim shovels. Skim shovels are small, flat and sharp. Skim shovels are used to remove thin layers of soil. Each layer of soil goes in a small box with 1/2 of a screen at the bottom. The dirt falls out and if your lucky you can find a artifact.       Diggers also use another process or technique called troweling.The archeologists use paintbrushes. wooden picks and small shovels for troweling.When they are troweling it could take them up to two weeks to trowel a twenty-five-square foot section. Then another archeologist team is in a lab to find out what this artifact was used for and what can it do to help us in the modern world? Its a very long process but after all that hard work its worth it! Also architects use modern shovels, and a whisk and dustpan. you never know if your standing right on a artifact! Archeologists also use a knife to scrape of dirt off artifacts. Wheelbarrows are also useful for carrying dirt or artifacts.       Archeologists found another interesting artifacts at Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia, For over two hundred years people thought it had been washed away by the Pacific's ocean by its strong current and waves. But archeologists believe that there still might be some remains of the Fort. Fort James was built in 1607 where the settlers came to separate from England and start a new life. No wonder why they chose to set up a fort there. It was easy to dock ships, they thought the fort was located near the dock but near by artifacts that it was farther away that probably was a good idea so they could be hidden and protected by nearby or enemy ships. The items that indicate that it was farther away was in 1861 now about a hundred years later they started the search again.       After a five year study and learning how the land was used by National Park services they finally found Fort James! They set up pegs on the ground to show how big the fort was. With all the rumors, books, and drawings the archeologists made they found out the fort was shaped like a triangle. They also found out the top of the buildings ledges were for cannons. The archeologist also found that there were dozens of burial sites and ten buildings near Fort James. Each year the archeologists found a total of a million artifacts. They found tools, armor, weapons, coins, pottery even metal toys! This place was a natural gold mine for architects!       Today its very exciting to learn how people were back then. How they lived and survived through the night. How their childhood was or how they kept safe from enemies! Isn't it amazing how we are finding more and more about history everyday! Archeologist are looking for more historic artifacts today. Not just in the United States. There is still millions of artifacts that are needed to be found! So maybe when your older you can join the hunt!

Archeologists find objects by digging. First the archeloogists map the site where they will be digging using 3D computers. The place where they dig is called a dig. Next the archeologists start digging.  They start digging with small, flat, sharp shovels that can remove thin layers of soil one at a time. These shovels are called skim shovels. Next the archeologists put the soil in a box with a screen in the  bottom. The soil goes through the screen but the artifacts stay in the box. Next the archeologists remove dirt from the objects. The artifacts go to a lab where another team of archeologists study them.        Archeologists use many tools to do their job. These tools are a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. A pick and shovel are used to dig close to the artifacts. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts. A knife is used to scrape dirt off the artifacts. A wheelbarrow is used to move things and dirt from one place to another. A skim shovel is used to remove a layer of soil wiht each scoop and a trowel is used to cut the soil to view different layers of soil.        Archeologists help us learn about the past and how peopole in the past lived. They also help us learn more about the lives of famous peopole that lived in the past. Being an archeologist is a very interesting job.

The first objects were found in 1861.Scientists that study objects from the past are also called Archeoligists,Archeoligist have found  armor and weapons.A century later,a group were sent to find the exact spot where fort was built again.                       The National Park Service had a five year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.This would help them where to look for proof of the fort.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area, when they used the software thats when they found James Fort ! The first thing that they found was a set of marks in the ground.The Archeoligists found out that Fort James was built like a triangle they also found out that fort streched all the way to th river.The Archeoligists found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten other buildings.                           Today people find nearly 1 million objects each year! Some of the objects are pottery, coins, tools , and toys for children. this imformation helped us how people used to live.We also know hoe the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.It is really exciting to discover objacts from the past!

Lets say its George Washington's homeland, archeologists found that most biographies about Mr. Washington doesn't include his childhood. So they decided to make a difference and go to Ferry Farm, where George's family moved when he was six. No one knew where the house was since it was long gone, so they tried to find the stone base of where it was.                                                        The Findings                                       In the year 2003 the archeologists started digging. After a year the finally found the stone base. The first building had a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later, four other buildings were built in Ferry Farm so they needed proof  that it was George Washington's farmhouse. Records showed that they had a fire in their house and diggers found burnt pottery in the house and found part of a clay pipe. They also knew that Washington smoked clay pipes.

Archeologists have teams of thirty-five.  there are three teams per site or dig.  Team one maps out the area, team two digs with skim shovels (they are very sharp thin, and fat shovels that pull up one layer of dirt at a time) the third team studies the artifacts found.  I takes two weeks to pull up twenty-five square feet.

Well, I can tell you about them now. Archeology is very intresting because you can learn things. You can also find many artifacts. Lastly, there is a chance to become famous.        If you are an archeologist looking for things. You will be able to find out things others do not know. You can also learn things you never knew personally. Also, you can learn things that do not seem possible. These are a few good consiquences of being an archeologist.        If you were an archeologist and found artifacts what would happen? If it is a very important artifact then you will become rich. You can also start a collection of these important facts. Lastly, you can display the artifact somewhere for a high price. You can beat the odds of finding very important artifacts.        When you are an archeologist and find things. Some may be important and some things might be not. If they are important you can become famous. You will be well known for finding this artifact and might inspire people. If you are famous many people will look up to you and think it is possible to do things.       In conclusion archeology is very facsinating. You can learn important things. You can also be able to find artifacts. Lastly, you can become famous. Archeology is very intresting.     	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP PRP RB VBP IN DT NN IN DT NNS .

Archeologists dig in places to find an object to discover more about something or someone. To find those things, they dig in the dirt with tools. The tools they use to dig are the pick and shovel, skim shovel, and trowel. Other tools they use are the knife and wheelbarrow. Lets move on to what those tools are for. The pick and shovel are for digging in the earth close to the artifacts, the whisk and dustpan are for brushing dirt of the found artifacts, the knife is for careful digging, the wheelbarrow for moving items from a place to another, the skim shovel for removing a layer of soil, and the trowel, the most common tool, which is for scraping and cutting.      Being a archeologist is a great opportunity to discover and explore new and exiting things waiting to be found. 	DT NN VBZ DT RB JJ NNP CC VBP PRP VBN RB WP DT NN VBZ .

Using the tools an Archeologist use includes:pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife,wheelbarrow,skim and shovel and trowel.Archeologist start their digs with the pick and shovel.They use the whisk and dustpan to dust off the dirt from the artifacts.They also use a knife to around the artifacts.The wheelbarrow is used to hall off dirt and artifacts from the scene.The skim shovel removes a layer of soil with each scoop.And finally the trowel it is used to scrape off different layers of soil to the artifact and to get a better view of it they do that.Also the trowel is the most common of all the tools in archeology.          When you find some artifact of the history it is truly amazing because you just found a piece of history.When you have the piece you would probably sell the piece to a big name industry.You can find from gemstones to George Washington's toys as a boy.The artifacts are very valuable to American history.          The digs can take a very long time to do.They often take weeks to months to years.You can dig up dinosaur fossils and much more.Archeologists explore the living things of the past. from digging up treasures you can be a multi million air.

Compton,I am almost 11 years old,and I go to the 5th grade ACTS program at Woodfields Elementery School.I am writing a factual essay on the tools of an archeologist.In this essay there will be information on the many tools   archeologists use,how they use them, even what archeologists hoped to find in the past!An archeologist's job is to uncover artifacts and/or posesions of dead/famous people.But that isn't what is going to be in this paper.This paper will include information about the tools archeologists use,how they use them, and past experiences with uncovering artifacts!             This first paragraph is going to have information on the many tools archeologists use.Archeologists  use a lot of tools for many different reasons.The tools they use are a   pick and shovel,a whisk and dustpan,a knife,a wheelbarrow,a skim shovel,and a trowel.Most of the tools I am going to be focusing on in this essay are the pick and shovel , the whisk and the dustpan,and the wheelbarrow.archeologists use these tools to clean dirt off of artifacts,move things(artifacts and rubble) around the dig and to dig deeper into the ground to try and find artifacts.                 Next,this essay is going to include information about previous artifacts archeologists have found, how they found them and the tools they used to do it.The first past artifacts I am going to tell you about is George Washington's house.Archeologists wanted to find out more about George's early life,(before he became a famous polotician/soldier.)Archeologists have found a great many artifacts now including,the kitchen,slave quarters,stoarge houses and even the main farmhouse!They also discovered there was a fire in his house and they found peices of burnt pottery and they knew young George smoked pottery so that gives even more proof that that is the right house,(the one George Washington lived in.)                     Lastly, this essay will explore information on what some of  archeologists special tools do and why they are used.Most digs usually start with the pick and shovel,they are used to dig into the earth,close to the artifacts.The trowel is probably the most common tool archeologists use,it is used to scrape and cut to view the different laers of soil.The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.                   In conclusion this paper explored the many amazing tools archeologists use( some we already know about some we dont),how they use those tools ,and past artifacts archeologists have discovered.I hope in this facual essay I have typed you have learned some new things and you enjoyed reading it.Thank you for your time.

I am writing an informational report on the job of archeologist.Archeologist are people who find artifact about people who lived long ago.Maybe not even long ago they may have been killed not long ago.                 Archeologist uncover interesting artifacts information about people who lived a while ago.(Most of the time dead yet famous.)People they usually study is presidents and famous singers and more.If they think they have found what they are looking for they have to have some proof.That is why the use tools to clean,carry or,dig up the artifacts.Artifacts are usually objects that the person they are studying has used or had.                 This paragraph is about the tools that the archeologist use while working on the scenes.A pick and shovel starts the digging it is used for digging close to  the object or artifacts.Whisk and a dustpan are use to get the sand,dust,debris,dirt of of the artifacts.A knife is helpful when you need to get dirt out from small places of the artifacts.The wheelbarrow is used when archeologist move things from one place to another.They may be heavy,dirty or, or to big to carry.The skim shovel is a flat edge that carefully removes a thin layer of dirt or sand.The trowel is a common tool is used to cut then view the different layers of soil.                 The job of archeologist is very important.If it was not for archeologist we would not know about the people that lived before us all.Archeologist are very important to the world.In conclusion archeologist have many things to do and they use lots of tools in their day of work.

1442	AI-XC	20131118131242	1500	1500	B	N	N	M	654129	5	10468700	Y	56274	                                                                                               My Report               Hello, do you won't to be an archeologist?. well if you do you would like the idea after you read this. A job of an archeologist is very fun because let me tell you that archeologist found things that were in George Washington's house years ago, but how did they find all of those things years ago. This is how. The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one.            First and foremost, Each year, many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 archeologist on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The imformation is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called the dig.             Secondly, Tose archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This let's the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.             Third, It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. This means that the discovery of washington's home is important for many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became fomous. We also begin to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.             Fourth, Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved. The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities. Kids can explore the site, experience colonial life, and become junior archeologists. Kids can sign up for classes, games, and crafts. There is even an interactive website! It challenges kids to solve puzzles about the work being done at the Ferry Farm.              Fifth, The tools that archeoloigists use are the Pick and the Shovel, the Whisk and the Dustpan, The Knife, The Wheel Barrow, The Skim Shovel, and the Trowel. The Pick and the Shovel are use to start digs. they are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifact. The Whisk and the Dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. The Knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The Skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil wit each scoop. And the Trowel is probaly the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layrs of soil.             Last but not least, People have lived on the land known as the Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It's location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefore, it's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was just six years old at the time. No one knew exactly where the Washington home was long gone. However, archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there.                     Digging around in dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at the Ferry Farm are bringing to life the country's first president in ways we have never seen.             	PRP$ NN NNP , VBP PRP MD RB TO VB DT NN . .

They have a lot of work that needs to be done, they work hard to find interesting facts.So let me tell you a true story of an archeologist I have heard of.      A archeologist along time ago once discovered a interesting fact about our president. They discovered George Washington father Augustine Washingtonn moved into a house that was able to be built into a home . One clue they found was an old clay pipe along with many other things.George Washington used to smoke old clay pipes, so that is what gave it away.     So now you see how hard a job of an archeologist is they have a lot of clues to solve and lots of work to do but if we haven't had a archeologist he may not know all the things we know. So next time your outside playing in the dirt and find something remember this archeologist.

Well I do and that person is George Washington I would love to find his house.Was it big, was it small, what color was it? So many questions one of the reasons why i admire him is because he was president and solider at the same time i think he was a great man. He was also always my favorite president and solider. When George Washington was six his father Augustine Washington, moved his family to Ferry Farm. Another four houses were bulit on the Ferry Farm land. They finally found the house the first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later.                So I found out how George Washington's house looked like and i also so learned a little bit about George Washington he will always be my favorite president and solider as that went on i also found out George smoked clay pipes!! . Archeologists found out a fire occurred in Washington's house. They found this by looking at pieces of burnt pottery they also found part of clay pipe and they knew George smoked on clay pipes so that was the evidence that it was George Washington's house.

Archeologistdon't just go dig around any where they want they have to look at books of history like in jamestown there used to be a fort there but people thought a river took it awaybut the arti factsand the fort was found  undergound.

Archaeologists discover objects from the past, and they are scientists.  Being an archeologist takes time and patience.  Some clues are the pottery that the Americans made long ago.  You could also get clues from the trash and objects that they used!  Pottery is they most likely way to find ancient artifacts.  You could also find marks on the ground and find the place where it all began.  The artifacts that the archeologists find are important are a big part of our past.                                The way archeologists dig up the past is that they have 3 teams and they all have different jobs.  There could be up to 35 members on a team!  The first team maps the area using a 3D computer so that they can track what is underground.  Then the information is recorded so that people can know what they are looking for.             The second team starts the digging, the place the team digs at is called a dig.  The archeologists start their dig with a tool called skim shovels, which is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully get off a thin layer of soil.  These shovels are flat, small, and sharp.  Then that soil is placed in a box with a 1/2 inch screen at the bottom.  This lets the dirt fall out and lets the artifacts stay in.             The diggers also use a process called troweling.  That is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt.  Another team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts that are found.  The reason some people stay in the lab is because that analyze the artifacts, they find out how old it is, they find out who used it, and they fin out who made it so thay can have more information on the object or person they are finding more about.              Some of the tools used by the archeologists to discover these ancient artifacts are picks and shovels which are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.  A whisk and a dustpan are used to clear the dirt away from the artifacts.  A knife is used for careful digging and to scrape the dirt around the sides of the artifact.  A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the digging site.  A skim shovel, as I explained in the other passage, is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil.  A trowel is probably the most commonly used tool in archeology.  It is use to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.  These tools are used every day to discover the precious artifacts.            An archeologists job is long, tiresome, and hard.  They must take their time or they might miss and important clue of fact.  It can take up to two weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section!  All of the weeks you are working adds up when you are working to dig up a large space.  It also takes up time to dig up the important information and artifacts.  Archeologists must have patience to really discover, enjoy, and appreciate the true meaning to be and archeologist.                   Without archeologists we wouldn't know anything about our past and we would be clueless about the people who came before us.  Archeologists give us proof that there were people who came before us, they give us a better understanding of what tools they used back then, and they give us a picture of what their life was like.  This is what makes the archeologist's job so amazing and interesting. What would we do without our archeologists?

However if you want the job to be quick on finding everything, then this may not be the best job for your personality. But it never is good without you trying your best! Before you become one perhaps you should know a little about this important job you are about to encounter.           Like I said before, having the job of an archeologists means that have to have lots and lots of patience. It might take perhaps a whole entire year for you to unearth a single bone or artifact! I know it does sound so terrible, however lets leave it this way. Say you are digging in a place and your quest is to look for artifacts of Abraham Lincoln. All of a sudden you touch a hard and bony thing, then you see that it is no bone but a hard and wrinkled letter from Lincoln to a close family member before his death. You have made an important discovery and you become famous! OK maybe not famous, but you have changed the world's knowledge on him forever!   You have heard the good news, but you still need patience to do this. Without patience doesn't mean that you can't do the job. You can practice having more patience. It is hard work but worth it until the end.           As a archeologists you will find lots of artifacts that are important and have not been discovered yet. There is a lot of tools that you will use to unearth artifacts to the surface, including shovels and more! This job requires a complicated list of jobs. I you even miss on it won;t be a good thing. Some of the tools include shovels to dig out stuff and be much easier than digging with your hands. Another tool is the wheelbarrow that helps you carry many things instead of going back and forth all the time! There is the whisk that helps clean fragile things and clean small narrow parts that your hand can;t reach. These are only some the tools, but soon when you have that job you will know more of the tools.           The job of an archeologists is hard bur a lot of fun to find knew things! I myself would love to become an archeologist when I grow up! It is a great job to dig up the past, and learn new things about  your home , the U.S and explore its wonders.

I learned from the article that archeologists are people that dig to try to find artifacts about a certain person or a family.               I also learned from this story that archeologists dug to find   George Washington house and found pieces of a clay pipe and some pottery. They also found the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage houses. A few years later they found the main farmhouse. I think to search at George Washington's house was a good choice because you can learn more about  him when you search to find how their families way of life was. It also helps historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived.               One thing that was very intresting to me is what tool an    archeologist uses. They use a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpans,  a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.

So the Archeologist had to dig and find out an it turn out it wasnt washed away by a river it was still there by the river.they uncovered amor and weapons and floors and building.                                                                                                                   Archeologist also is well know for discovered  digging up George Washington`s past . Biographies didnt have very much information on george  about his childhood so the archeolohgist went  to dig to get more information on his childhood and where is the hoousec he grow up in at. and they think they found the house because the finally  found the first  building they found was the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses. they found the main farmhouse a few years later. at least four houses other houses have been built onthe ferry farmland ,so the digging needed to find proff that thhis was george washington house.Records shows that the Washington`s had a fire in their house. the digger`s found pieces of burnt pottery this suggests a fire occurred there.             We know that Washington`s  smoked clay pipes,so this discovery gives more proff  itis the right house.How do the archeologists find all of these things that were in washington`s all the years . the process of digging atthe ferry farm is a careful one. some of the material the archeologist use to help them are pick and shovel ,whisk and dustpan ,knife ,wheelbarrow,skim shovel ,and trowel. finally you know what a archeologist is and i wonder do you think archeologist is interserting.

They use whisks and dustpans for cleaning off dirt that's loose on the artifact. They use the knife for digging around the artifact. They use the wheelbarrow for carrying things around.

Then when they went what they were looking for.           If it was underground they would probably use a wheelbarrow and move stuff to another place they might be looking for history.           Then when they found it they would probably show it to a museum or somewhere else.

This is the job of an archaeologist. They have to first find a location, look for the artifacts, and then transport the artifacts to scientists to see what they mean and why they are significant. A lot of tough work!                 So to even find artifacts, the archaeologists need to find where to look for. A good place would be a place that is really old, like a sixteenth century mansion, or a cave used by cavemen. After they have targeted their location, they need to get to the location and begin looking around for good places to dig and work on.             After they perfect spot is located, here comes the toughest job that may take weeks or even months. The digging is the most significant part of an archaeologist's job and life. So first, you use a trowel and a skim shovel to get the sand or ground away. Then they use the pick and shovel and start searching for artifacts. And when they hear a CLINK! they use their knife for careful digging. The hard work is complete!             Then comes the transportation. After people have taken out the artifact from the ground, light artifacts are usually given to scientists by hand. But when the artifacts are dense and heavy, archaeologists use a wheel barrow to transpot the artifacts. After the archaeologists have transported the artifacts to the scientists, the job is done!              As you can see, being an archaeologist requires a lot of work. It is not a job that can be taken by ease. But the good part is when you found the artifact and just revealed a mystery.

Be sure you have more than five people.The gold is going to be heavy. All five of you need to work out.                                                                                                                                                                                        If you do find go to a gold shop and trade the gold and they will hopefully give you gold.Try to find a lot of gold.Start getting ready today. That's where you find gold and what you need to do the job.                                                                                         .                      .        2.Get lots of rest. Eat healthy food everyday. Everyday workout. Don't eat junk food at all.You make your own or for your whole family.

Buy tents or build a tree house or find shelter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .       3.When you are ready ask the people that are going to help you with they are ready. If they are ready tell them we will go tomorrow.                                               .                                                                                                                                                                   when you are there tell your people to get a little rest.Later that day start getting your tools out and start getting water and put the water in a bucket. Then the next day start digging holes in the ground and start finding gold. 	WRB TO VB NNP CD NNP NNS CD TO NNS CD DT JJ NN CD VBG PRP RB VBP DT NNP RB VBP CC VBP NNP NNP VBP TO NN NNS IN PRP NNP .

By: Chardonnay                         In 1994 lot of people was interested in studying the past. The people that studied the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The design was to discover the secrets and mysteries and the past of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For many years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. A little bit if discoveries  in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when people came from England to begin a new life. A lot people believed that James Fort was built near the river. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The spot probably gave the people move protection from mean ships. The first objects were found in 1861. archeologists, the name for scientists who study things from the past. The people who study things use computer mapping software to make images of the area. That's when they finally found James Fort ! The first thing they found was a set of marks. The set of marks showed where the forts walls used to be.                 The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for the children. In 1600's people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a bid pit. While digging in the area the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including bones of animals ate. The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in James Fort lived. Now the archeologists now know how the settlers fought Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. The archeologists also know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.                The archeologists think it is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. The archeologists say it gives them a piece of their past and ties them to the people who first started the American colonies.                The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof the fort.               An archeologists- Is an name for a scientists who is interested in studying artifacts and things that famous people left behind.            An archeologists dig up the past from a famouse person they use an pick and shovel most of their digs start with these two tools. It is used to dig into the earths artifacts. An archeologists use an whisk and dustpan an whisk and dustpan is used to brush dirt off the artifacts to see clearly. An knife is used to for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. An whellbarrow is used to move items from one place to the other or to carry dirt away from thew excavation site. An skim shovel is simaler to an original shovel but the bottom part is shape like an square and the shovel is with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. An trowel is probably                                   	DT NNPS NN .
