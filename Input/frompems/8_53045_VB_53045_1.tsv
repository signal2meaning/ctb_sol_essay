Some of the things we use today have been created by these three cultures. These things help us in our daily lives. Also, the things invented have helped change the world.            Discoveries that have been made by the Inca are important because they created a quipus to record the calandar and keep track of livestock. The Inca also left behind clues such as portraits that displayed their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and way of life. Lastly, the Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces so looters couldn't easily get to them. These discoveries that have been made of the Inca are important.            Discoveries that have been made by the Puebloans are important because the skills for basketmaking are still used today. The Puebloans learned how to make pottery and weapons by using their skills in basketmaking. The Puebloans also invented kivas. Kivas were underground chambers that were ceremonial rooms. This was similar to a church and helped Puebloans gather and make places to weave baskets. These discoveries that have been made of the Puebloans are important.            Discoveries that have been made by the Plavlopetri are important because without these discoveries, nobody would know about how a sunken city may have submerged. Archaeologists have discovered that the Plavlopetri had created over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. This suggested that the town had been used by an elite and raised the status of the settlement. Also, the settlement might have been sank by sea level changes, ground subsidence; earthquakes or a tsunami. These discoveries that have been made by the Plavlopetri are important.            These discoveries that have been made about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Plavlopetri are important. These discoveries have helped archaeologists make assumptions of the lives of these three cultures. These discoveries have also shown archaeologists how the lives of these three cultures were lived. This is why discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and the Plavlopetri are important.

The Incas from the Andes mountains had lots off gold, sliver, pottery, and stone buildings.  Are knowledge comes from the artifacts we find at dig sites where the Incas could have been at.  Spain took over the Inca empire by killing the last Inca king in 1532.       The Pueblos were now for there basket making.  They lived in pithouse cluster up into small villages  built on mesa tops or in cliff recesses.  They learned that a bow and arrow is more efficient hunting weapon then the spear thrower.  In 1000 A.D. the Mesa Verde had be come very skillful stone masonry.  They made walls of thick, doubled stone and rose two to three stories high.  They have more than 50 rooms.  the farming the did was most of there diet.             Pavlopetri is very important the city that sunk under the ocean.  a group called Anglo-Greek team discovered the lost city.  They think that shifting sands made it go into a protected bay  where the team can look at it.  they found 5000 year old pottery.          those where the very important thing about the civilzation.

It's simple, we learn things by either kept records, passed down stories, or in older cases, archeological discoveries.  Archeologists go to many ancient civilization settlements and make new discoveries almost everyday.  While some discoveries seem boring and not important, archeological discoveries are one of the main things that shapes the way we see the past and how we are now in the present.  These discoveries have given us information about a few specific civilizations, the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.  Foundings on these ancient civilizations are some of the very things that have created the way man-kind is today.         Many artifacts found in ancient civilizations show records; perhaps of stories or just some sort of writing.  For example, the Inca had no alphabet or form of writing, but they kept track of their livestock and made a calendar all using different colored string called quipus (Ancient Inca). The development of today's language could have very well started with strings the way that the Inca did.  Records about the Inca were also kept by the Spanish, who came to the empire in 1532; they wrote about the Inca in their language and much was learned about the Inca from just that.  To justify what was learned by the spanish cam from artifacts found such as pottery and textiles (Ancient Inca).  These artifacts could very well also show the development of tools and art throughout history and how we are today.        Discoveries about civilization can also effect how we and why we build houses and buildings the way we do today.  The Puebloans were ancient settlers in Mesa Verde, and were well know as skilled craftsmen and basket makers.  The Puebloans made certain types of houses called pithouses.  These houses have support beams and a fire pit with an air deflector (Mesa Verde).  In today's world we have kept a similar method of having good support and fireplaces and chimneys in our houses.  These pithouses later evolved into Kivas, these were very similar but a better design.  Both of these houses had a symbolic hole in the ground called a sipapu, that represented a passage to the underworld (Mesa Verde).       Much like how the symbolic passage to the underworld for the Puebloans, Archeological discoveries can explain myths and legends that we learn about in today's world.  For example, the discovery of the Pavlopetri perfectly explains the legend of the under water city Atlantis.  The Palvlopetri is a sunken settlement off the coast of Greece.  This settlement is likely to be one of the oldest sunken cities their is, with ceramics dating back to the stone age.  We have all heard the stories about a mythical Atlantis and this discovery explains why those stories came to be, just like many archeological discoveries guide us to how today's world is.

We also wouldn't have some of the modern architecture because some of the buildings we have today are based off of the buildings they had.       The Inca were a very large empire. They rivaled the the expanse of ancient Rome. Some of the clues that the Inca left behind are a big 'window' to their lives. Stories were also passed down by the Europeans who took over the empire. The Spaniards were not very fluent in the Inca language so they may not have been very accurate with their stories of Inca history. Artifacts left behind are something else that give us some history. Pottery made of stone, silver, and gold lasted hundreds of years buried under ground; some were even found in graves for the dead to use in afterlife. Inca textiles and clothing also shockingly lasted just as long. Ancient cloth usually gets ruined by dampness, but these survived in the dry deserts of Peru or the cold Andes mountains.       About 1,400 yeas ago, Mesa Verde was chosen to be home for a group of native American peoples called the Puebloans or 'the ancient ones'.  For over 700 years they flourished in this area, building elaborate stone communities in the cannon walls. The Puebloans were known as basket-makers. Beginning as nomads they started to lead a more settled life. they replaced hunting with farming, and lived in small one room houses called pit-houses. Thel later began to build houses above ground out of poles and adobe. The baskets that they made show a decline in quality stating that the widespread use in pottery means less attention to the craft.       In the waters of Southern Grese a sunken settlement is thought to be the inspiration of the myth Atlantis. This site straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. the findings surpassed all expectations; there were buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures as well as thousands of shards from pottery. Then after exploration there were 9,000 more square meters of new buildings. Marine geologists have no idea why the city could have sunk: earthquake, tsunami, or just a rise in sea level. It is the firs sunken city discovered in Grece that predates the tale of Atlantis.

Everybody learns about them and how they lived, more than one time. It starts out in elementary school, and the basics are taught. The men hunted, and the women sewed, because women were considered not as superior as men back then. In middle school, you get into a little bit more depth on how those people lived, and what they did in everyday life. In high school, you go deeply in depth on the ancient civilizations of America, that started out our country. Learning about these ancient civilizations are very important, because life today is very similar, but with more technology. People farm, cook, sew, ect. Some do it everyday, depending on the living. All 21st century kids should and do learn about the ancient civilizations of our country. All discoveries are important because they have led us to believe what we do believe today.       The discoveries of ancient artifacts on the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have shaped today's life as we know it.

To start off they did not have any type of formal alphebet system or form of writing. They didnt leave very much behind for historians to study. One thing they found left behind was a quipus it showed a calendar and kept track of livestock. There are knots on the quipus but no one knows what they mean.       The only things we know about the incas passed on from generation to gerneration. The incas lived between 1438 to about 1532. We know this because of how portraits of there religion. Some artifacts were found in graves that were buried with the dead to use in the afterlife. Lots of there clothing have still surived they were presurved in deserts.

Some important civilizations are the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. They are all important archeology sites.   Inca was one of these important places. Incas had no system of    alphabet or writing. They made quipus, knots made of colored string, that were used to record the calender and keep count of livestock. No one in the present knows how to read the  quipus. Some of what we know about Incas comes from stories passed from generation to generation. Some things we know because of the Europeans who visited the Inca empire in 1532, they described the Incas in letters and diaries.   Inca textiles and clothing have also survived. Other Inca sites    have been disturbed by looters that took anything of value. Looted sites don't offer much to archeologists.   Another important civilization was the Puebloans. They lived in   Mesa Verde , they lived there for 700 years building elaborate stone communities. They were skilled at making baskets and pottery. They farmed instead of hunting and gathering, and lived in small villages. They used alot of sand stone shaped into rectangular bricks. They deserted Mesa Verde by about 1300 AD. No one knows the reason that they left, but there are many theories.   The last important cililization was the Pavlopetri. This lost city that might have inspired the myths of atlantis. It was sunken 5000 years agoo, and it is the oldest submerged town in the world.

Many things from ancient civilazations, have been discovered by archeologists. Three main civilazations were the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri civilations. Many things have been dicovered. I will now explain the civilations grew into the world we have today.         I will first begin stating facts about the Inca civilation. The Incas had no form of alphabet, and they loft no writings for the future. The Incas used colored strings as a calendar for their life stock proportions. Many grave sites were left for the dead to use in the afterlife. The Incas lived in the Andes moutains, which could be a problem for archeologists, because dampness could ruin the artifacts.         Next I will tell you about  the Puebloans. The Puebloans lived in Pithouses, which had some of the first chimeneys. They also had many forms of weapndry, like spears, bows, arrows. Also, many Puebloans lived in Kivas. Kivas were homes built with the overhangin of cliffs. This civilaszation used many natural resorces like: forests, soil animals, ect.         Last, but not least the Pavlopetri civilazation. This civilazation, was found sunken is Grease. Archeologists found that there were many courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structres. Also they discovered thousands of shards of pottery. The Pavlopetri was the real life insparation for Atlantis.         Many ancient worls have been discovered, and there artifacts have shaped our world today. The Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri civilazations have advanced our world. Maybe one day we'll be shaping someones civilazation. Who knows?

The problems Archaeologists face is weature,location,and condition.Depending on were an object is at can really change how much investigation is done and also timing.If there is really bad weature in a location then not much research well be able to be done.For example if a artifact is located in the jungle under ground it can take a really long to to prepare for the trip.Also if not completely prepared then useful tools to help the Archaeologists find the Artifact.     The condition of the land had a big impact as well.when the Archaeologists observed the land it holdes alot of backround on how people lived.Town and Artifacts helped the Archaeologists determain and collect information needed.

They had no writing system or education like we do today. They some left clues for scientists to discover. The clues left behind form their religion, art and architecture, government, agriculture, transportation, and ways of life. We know some stories from writings by the Europeans. Spanish soilders and priests also described the Inca in letters and diaries. The rest of our knowledge comes from artifacts discovered. These treasures have led to the facts we know about Incas.       Another group of people we know about are Puebloans. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were skilled in craft making. They were forming a more settled life style. Farming replaced hunting and gathering. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages. By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonary. Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. They migrated out of Mesa Verda due to drought and crop failure. The Pueblo people of today are descendants of the smart and strong Ancestral Puebloans.       A team of geologists have found an under sea city in Greede called Peloponnese. They had found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. Their investagations also revealed over 9000 square meters of new buildings. They still haven't figured out why the settlement sank. The team says, 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. Less than 1 percent pf the world's ocean floors have been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'       If it wasn't for these teams for discovering and testing out these lost places we would know nothing about. Anicient civilization is very interesting. Finding more and more never explored places is fascinating and scary. That's what keeps them going and trying to succeed. Their hard work is what educates us today. Also our Ancestrys' hard work led us to the technology we have today.

It talks about the systems the past had. They did not leave any form of history to study. 'The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock.' The first Europeans were so amazed that the Inca could  run a large empire using strings to keep records. Today no one knows what the knots meant. 'Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history...'        The reason we know some of the old stories, because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. 'The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worwshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult. High-alltitude archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountain for study. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern edical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived.'       Section #2 says that the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. There were people that lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, as settled agriculture began .        'Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880's, archeolagists have sought to understand these people's lives.' 'Fires built in summer were mainly for cooking.In winter, when the alcove rooms were damp and uncomfordable, fires probably burned throughout the village. Smoke-blackened walls and ceilings are reminders of biting cold these people lived with for several months each year.       Section #3 is about exploring the underwater worlds. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myth's - The fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Grrece. The seas have been explored by many people.

The Incas were important because they showed how people lived everyday life and how they survived without the use of the technology that is available for us now. The Puebloans were important because they were the ones who created the idea and reality of elaborate stone houses/buildings. The Pavlopetri is important because it is an ancient myth for greeks since 1200 BC.

From what I have read so far this was a smart civilization in many ways. First of all they use coloerful knots called uipus to record the calandar to keep record of their livestock. They have also given us the ability to know how they looked and what they wore because they were found in the mountains, and there it's very cold so it has perserved many thing for us to study.   The next thing that I'll tell you about is the Puebloans. They left evidence about what they lived in very detailed. They first started with pithouses then they started to envolve them into kivas but population grew so big they had to make pole-and-adobe. From what people can tell they start to relay on farmland alot more. My last thing I'm am  going to talk to you about is the 'lost city of greek' It has mnany remains of pottery and the good thing is since it was under water no many people would take the nature things. THey left behind many things since they were sucken underground so many thing were swept under. There was even buildings, coutyards, mainsteets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. That really help people get a very good idea of how they lived, and what they did.

They all made great inventions and this is how we can learn where our inventions today came from. In these next paragraphs you will learn how we learned so much about these ancient Civilazations even though they did not even have a written language!                 The First topic I will be talking about is how we learned so much about the ancient Inca. The Inca didn't even have a written language or any archives for historians to study from. How we know that the Inca lived for hundreds of years in South America. By finding ancient clues about their religon and everyday life. Some stuff we learned by stories getting passed down from generation to generation.  Also there were pictures that the spaniards could predict ver y well what they meant. Unfoutunatley the Inca empire vanished in 1532 because the spaiards killed the Inca king. Now it is very hard to trave what happened after words.                      The Second topic I will be taling about is how we learned so much about the Puebloans. About 1,400 years ago in the four corners region a group of people started living on the Mesa Verde. which means the green table in spanish. They lived in Pithouses from about 550 A.D. to 750 A.D. Later they invented the Kiva. Kiva is a Hopi word for cermonial room. This was like our Churches.                   The last topic I will be talking about is the Pavlopetri. These people are the people that are said to have known the most about the lost city of Atlantis which in its story sank under the sea long ago and has explorers looking for it ever since. These people consist of Anglo-Greek team of geologists and archelogists. There is some evidence is that they found ceramics that date back to the stone age and alos there investigations have explored over 9000 square meters of new buildings. Elias Spondylis said 'It is significant beause as a submerged site it was never reoccupied,' this man co-directed the survey as the head of Greece's underwater antiquities department.

The studies in the article at the right talk about archaelogists have found there house and dead bodies that are still in good shape and also about how the lost greek city isnt lost but is found.             The Inca had no formal alaphabet when they wrote or no system of writing. They made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender date to keep the livestock. The spaniards didnt speak the inca language well, they may not have understood there discriptions making them un-accurate. The rest of our knowlege comes from acient Inca artifacts left behind in the civilizations. There bodies have been said to be found in good shape, and the archaeologists revealed information about how they lived.             The Puebolans first settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages bulit on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They were basketmakers and their population multiplied because they were to prosperous. In about A.D. 750 they started to begin buliding houses above ground with walls make of poles and mud. Ancestrial Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. This was because of drought and crop failure.               Finally, the Pavloperti were located in the acient city of greece. The sunken settlements dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heros and in term size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. This is the oldest submerged town. The site which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor southern the Peolponnese, is believed to have been comsumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It is the first time a sunken city has been founded in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken conitent of Atlantis.               These three groups of people are important about the discoveries by the archaeologist because they all had to do with history and how they were all discoverd and discovere by.

Both of these stories are similar because both of these groups are being pushed away from their homes by the Euopeans. They are both some of the most intelegent cizilizations that their were.

Well try living in a agricultural town where there is no power, no cars, and no elctricity. The archeologists and historians are working hard to figure out the ancient Inca tribe of Peru. What these scientists already know is that the inca doesent have an alphebet system. They also don't have any archives for historians to use.       Understanding the Inca is kind of like a mystery. There lives on earth are nearly impossible to know of because there are hardly have any records. They survived nearly one hundred years on there own and ruled over the south american empire. With that one hundred year domaine came religon, art, agruculture, goverment, transportation, and a new way of life.       As some of you may know, the Inca people were very creative people. Most of the antiques left behind are old artifacts, and objects mostly made out of items like gold silver, and stone. These very rare artifacts were mostly found inside anceint Inca buildings, and inside of the dead poeple grave to carry with them to the past life to play with.       The archeologists work effortlessly each day to find out more and more about the Inca tribe. The archeologists keep careful notes, and take photographs of every thing they see and write down the exact same spot they found it. They learn as much as possible so they can be able to understand the Inca tribe. They also Read  ancient drawings and try to see if that is how the inca communicated.       Finally, the most inportant thing about the Incas is what happened to it. In fifteen thirty two the spaniards mudered the last Inca king, and took over his empire. This is why the incas are so hard to trace. The area where they lived had long been inhabited by many different people. And the Inca tribe will be no more.       In conclusion, There are many different cultures and cities that once lived in the ancient world, but by far the Incas are the most unique. The are also the hardest to record because they couldnt read or write. There culture and art surpases all others who came before and after. the Incas left behind a great legacy. That is my lost civilization performance task.

It teaches us about what the people before us did, and maybe, we can learn just a little from them. I've learned a lot from my research, and I hope you do too!            The discovery of the Inca people wasn't very surprising, but it was very important. We know about their past because of the weather, believe it or not. Peru's dry coast or the cool mountains of the Andes preserved any artifacts that were left behind for archaeologists to find, and Spanish people passed down information of the Inca people's oral past. Nobody can really rely on it, though because the Spaniards did not speak the language of the Inca. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by looters, though. All in all, despite some setbacks, the Inca sites was a fantastic discovery.            The Mesa Verde National Park preserves amazing, ancient information that happens to be quiet important. The Puebloans lived in tiny pithouses that were clustered into towns, and they relied on farming. From what any clues that were left behind tell us, the Puebloan people were formerly nomadic, and they were looking for a more settled lifestyle. The Puebloans were important to history because they made numerous weapons that seemed to be very useful. Do you know anything about the Puebloans?            Last, but certainly not the least, the Pavlopetri people were, in my opinion, the most interesting. In Greece, a submerged city was found by Pavlopetri people. Without them, this sunken Greece city wouldn't have be found when it was. I always thought sunken cities were just a myth. Maybe Atlantis could be real!            All in all, the findings of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri people have been an amazing discovery. It's just one more thing to add to the history book. Finally, answers were found. We don't have to worry about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetris people's history any longer.

36	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	W			F	394839	8	11061846	Y	53045	 Lost Civilizations       Ancient Inca   The ancient Inca, found in Peru, doesn't have any formal system of writing. Instead they use colored strings and knots to communicate and keep records. Today nobody truly knows about what these quipus, colorful strings and knots, mean. Even though we don't know what the quipus means, we do know other interesting information about the Inca. We know things like religion, art, agriculture, government , transportation and way of life. We know some of the information we know from the Europeans who had written down stories in letters and diaries of what the Inca were like, when the Europeans first arrived in the 1532. Historians had to be careful when reading these letters and diaries because the Europeans did not speak the Inca language and may have misunderstood what the Inca had said. Other knowledge about the history of the Inca comes from artifacts, and other objects that they left behind. Most of the Inca textiles were preserved int eh dry deserts on the Peru coast or in the cold Andes mountains. Some of the Inca sites were ruined by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that they might think is valuable. Looted sites do not tell archaeologists very much, because non-looted sites give the best idea about the life of the Inca, because nobody has moved or touched anything. This is also why when archaeologists study sites they photograph and write down the exact position in which they find artifacts. Artifacts from the Europeans shoe that the Inca fell in 1532 when the Spaniards murdered the Inca king and took over the empire. Other artifacts that were found are harder to trace to the Inca because after the Inca had fallen to the Spaniards many different peoples had lived in the same area as them. Archaeologists do know that the Inca lived high places like the Andes mountains and the Inca even worshiped some mountains peaks. The Inca were also buried in high places such as, cliff faces, caves, and mountain tops. Because the Inca liked to live in high elevated areas, this actually helped archaeologists because looters cannot easily get to the sites and also because the mountains like a big freezer. Any body that was found was in good shape that they could use modern medical scanning ans equipment to learn how the person had died, and how they lived daily. This also made the archaeologists jobs more difficult because archaeologists would have to carry all their equipment up to the site before they could start to work, also anything they found would have to be carried down the mountain so it could be studied closer.       Ancestral Puebloans   Close to 1,400 years ago, people that were living in the Four Corners region moved to Mesa Verde. For about 700 they lived and flourished here. They built stone communities in canyon walls and beneath overhanging cliffs.Which is now preserved in Mesa Verde National Park. Archaeologists have called people who lived in these communities Anasazi, which is Navajo word for 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies' and are now called Ancestral Puebloans. A Puebloan is a Spanish word for village dwellers. These people were also known as the basketmakers because of their skill and craft for basket making. They aslo had skill for making pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. They farmed, hunted, and gathered as a way to get food for their families. They lived in pithouses that clustered into small villages that were usually built on mesa tops and in cliff recesses. In 750 A.D. the Basketmakers started to build houses above ground. These houses were agianst each other in long, curving rows. They usually had one or two pithouses in front of their actual house. By 1000 A.D. the Mesa Verde people had advanced to stone masonry. Walls on buildings were thick, double-coursed, rose two or three stories high and joined into units of fifty rooms and sometimes more. These walls are regarded as the finest ever built by the Mesa Verde. During this time, pottery also changed. It changed from smiple designs and gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming was big during this time as well. Farming accounted for more of their deit than ever before and much of the mesa-top land was cleared for farming. Baskets declined in quality, possibly because the use of pottery was higher that meant less interest in baskets at the time. In about 1200 A.D. the people of the Mesa Verde moved back onto/into cliffs alcoves that homes the ancestors many centuries before. The structures of the cloff dwellers are evidence of a society that over centures gained many skills and traditions and passed them through the generations. By the Classic Period the population reached several thousand.  This is also whent he accomplishmants of the Mesa Verde had among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.   In the beginning the basic material for construction was sandstone. They shaped the sandstone into rectangular blocks, the size of a loaf of bread. In between the blocks were a mixture of maud and water. They stacked these block on top of each other, and aside each other to make rooms. These rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, there was room for about two or three people. In the upper levels the generally stored crops. The underground rooms were ceremonial chambers, and eventually front rooms. Their roofs created open courtyards where daily routines took place. In the summer, they built fires to cook. In the winter,  fired burned throughout the village. Smoke from the fires blackened walls and ceilings.   Around 1300 A.D., Mesa Verde was deserted. Theories why they moved were: migration,  drought and crop failures, land and resources were depleted, and social and political problems took place. When the cliff dwellers left they traveled south into Arizona and New Mexico.       Lost Greek City   The lost Greek city is located of the waters of southern Greece and known as the oldest submerged town int eh world. This sunken settlement dates back to 5,000 years ago and consumed by the water around 1000 BC. It has artifacts dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC. The lost Greek city lays on 30,000 aquare meters of ocean floor. The shifting sands and the settlement's encosure in a protected bay help to save most buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, pottery and religious structures from being destroyed. Many think that this cite sank because of sea level changes, earthquakes, or tsunami.

Not much is known about the Inca's, but we do have some clues about their art, religion, architecture, government, transportation, and way of life. An example of this would be the Inca way of keeping records by tying knots in colorful string. This is a very advanced way of keeping track of things for such an ancient civilization. Another clue we have about the way these people lived and how they built things out of stone, pottery, gold or silver. Scientists have also found remains of clothing that have survived remarkably well because they were preserved in the deserts of Peru, or in the high altitude of the Andes mountains. After the Spaniards murdered the king in 1532, the Inca's became more hard to trace. Even though the Inca's lived a long time ago, they were still very advanced for their time, and we can learn a lot from the, about how humans developed strategy and learned to make life easier for themselves.       The Puebloans are known epically for their talents in basket making. They were nomadic but over time started to settle and farm. The Puebloans were very skilled and learned to make pottery and the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting. Their populations multiplied quickly, and they learned to make houses and walls out of poles and mud. The Puebloans however never left any written records of their life, it is epically hard for scientists to learn about why they moved around so much. The Puebloans were also good at building, such as their famous Kivas, which were used for religious purposes and rituals. The Puebloans were extremely advanced in their building techniques and we can learn so much about how they came up with ways to improve life for themselves.       As you can see, it is very important for us to learn about how people lived in ancient times, and how humans developed over times.

Many people decided to go and travel to discover new things on the lands. When you hear about the town of Kinsay, it made Courtney want to travel there and explore the lands. When Courtney set off to travel she discovered Marco Polo. Marco Polo had made many discoveries himself, and so many were excited to see and hear about what he had to share. She kept exploring, and had to find new places to stay along the way. With all the languages being different, and not sounding quit the same they had to find ways to communicate. All of our knowledge of these cultures, are by items left behind to be discovered my new people. With all the explorers and searchers out to find new things, we may not know about any of these people. Marco Polo and Courtney are just few of the many people who set off and explored to find new things such as different cultures and lands. We have more settlements, and more findings still today that change are world drastically.

Many people, such as the Inca's, used things called quipus to record their way of life. Now, this may have been alright then, but now, we can't read their quipus and archiologists have to rely on the artifacts that had been left and well preserved so that we can understand how they lived. Many places all over the world have lots of artifacts that have been preserved in ice, water, and even the dry deserts.       Archiologists have found artifacts all over the world from Greece, to South America. In Greece, in the past 40 years someone has found a lost city sunken off their southern waters. This city is home to remains dating from 2800 BC to 1200 BC. The whole city covers 30,000 square meters of ocean floor! Its crazy that archiologists can tell all these things simply from the way the artifacts have been preserved.       Another place that archiologists have found artifacts was in Mesa Verde. In Mesa Verde archiologists have found little houses called pithouses that the Puebloans used to live in. These, like the lost city, have been preserved by the desert. Along with the pithouses and remains of the city, archiologists have found weapons, pottery, baskets, gold and silver, buildings, and even bodies! It is extremely fortunate that these have been preserved because without them, we wouldnt know exactly how these people lived or even if they ever existed, but with them so well preserved we have been able to find out so much about them.

They were a great importance because we can learn all the ways they were able to stay together as a civilization.       The Incas were a very great empire that lasted for about a hundred years. For that time most civilizations did not last that long or joined another people. The Incas though, did not leave writing for historians to research. This makes it difficult for us to know much about certain events that happened to them. Because of the way they did things, like living in mountains, their bodies get preserved and sometimes we find them and can find out what happened to them. We also found out information about the Puebloans at Mesa Verde National Park.       The Puebloans were an ancient people that were settled in North America but then later moved to another part of the world. These people seemed to be a farming people which took much of their time instead of gathering and farming like most ancient people.These people also were able to make the bow and arrow which shows there great minds and intelligence. They would use nature to their advantage, too, by building their houses on the tops of cliffs. Though people don't know why the Puebloans left, scientist have theories that they tried to find new opportunities elsewhere.       The last ancient city, or civilization I will talk about is the lost city of Atlantis. Most people would think that this is a myth but scientist now have new light on the subject. A team of Anglo-Greek archaeologists have found some sunken settlements that have proved an underwater civilization. The city is believed to have been consumed around 1000 B.C. All there buildings, streets, and religious buildings are show under water which can tell us today how we could build certain things to help our cities. This also gives scientist an idea of how waters affect the land.       These discoveries give a very great importance. They give us information on how we could or shouldn't do things to help us. They also give scientist a pretty could idea of how the Earth can change and how humans have evolved over the past years. Sites like these are very good places to remember how far we have come in society and they show how lucky we are today to have these things.

It is quite challenging for archaeologists because sometimes there isn't another person alive who knows the languages of these people or there isn't a language for these people. So how do you suppose archaeologists figure this out? There are a couple of way that they do this. The ways aren't always simple but they are very effective.            In the ancient Inca civilization, there area couple of ways to figure out how they lived.  One way is by these colorful knots they left called quipus. Archaeologists have yet to figure out what they mean so this part is a bit of a puzzle to the archaeologists. Art is another way to figure out how they lived. The Inca were very big on forming portraits on religion, art, agriculture, architecture, government , and how they lived. Also, the Inca told stories among themselves and in 1532, Europeans came and wrote down the stories. Unfortunately, the Europeans didn't speak their language very well so not all the stories were correct. The final way archaeologists found out about the ancient Inca was artifacts. Artifacts made from stone, pottery, gold and silver have been found.            The Puebloans were another ancient group that archaeologists have a had a bit of trouble finding out. They were easier to figure out than others. The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde, or the green table, which was in the Four Corners area. They also didn't write any records so its hard to figure out how they lived. Archaeologists have found ancient Puebloans' kiva. A kiva is a ceremonial room that they used to use as churches. They were places to gather and also places for weaving. Archaeologists have also found that ancient Puebloans lived under overhanging cliffs. These had an advantage for every season. Studies show that today's Pueblo people may be descendants of the ancient Puebloans.             In conclusion, archaeologists have a very hard job, but they all do it fairly well. They use all their resources and usually figure out the puzzle. Even if they have one little clue, they are still able to figure it out.

We have to learn about history because there is so much interesting stuff we could learn about. Not only that, but we can learn about some mistake our ancestors made. It`s important to learn this because maybe it could be your ancestor who ruled the temple or city. if these people didn`t exist there wouldn`t be days, weeks, months, or years. We might maybe not even have technology at this time.                                We got our knowledge from the incas. that knowledge comes from ''artifacts, or  objects that they left behind...' The stories are posibly may not be true because the spaniards did not speak the inca language well. They might not have accurate descriptions. Their stories were passed from generation to generation and that helped the archeologists alot. The first ancestral pueblanos were the ones who settled in Mesa Verde. They were known as basketmakersfor their skill at the craft. They built their houyses the same way the Incas did. Their history was also passed from generation to generation. These people lived in the cliff dwellings for almost 100 years.                This is why we have to learn about history. We have so many traditions and knowledges and thanks all to our ancestors. they have made us many useful things like calenders, crafts and so many more stuff.

The discoveries they have made help them figure out how the tribes survived and how they lived.            They have found many artifacts that have told them how they made food, bulit shelter, farmed, and more. The artifacts also help them with how some people died or what killed the tribes mostly. But some of the things that they find they dont understand them, or know what they mean.             From the things they have found, each item comes with a story. They study the object and figure out what it does and find out the story behind it. The stories they find they tell others like people who want to learn about history.             They find the colonies shelters and study their homes. The homes could be over 1000 years old so they have to be careful. The homes were so small that only about 2 people could fit in most of them. But they made a whole family live in just one home. Before A.D. 750 they bulit home underground and after that they began to build them above ground.             Some Acinet Greek citys are under water. So scienticts go under water and dig up artifacts in the sand. The artifacts they find are about 5,000 years old.

The first Europians to meet the inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archoelogists have found many ancient quipis but today no one knows what the knots mean. Passing on the stories was an important way to peserve a community's history. Historian have to be careful when they interpret these account.the spaniards did not speak the inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so thier descriptions might not be accurate. Some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history.                            The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found. As many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, silver. Materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.                      Some treasure were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archeologists very muvh. Sites are reported to archeologists, who can dig them up carefully. They provide the  best idea of all about life in peru before and during Inca rule. Archeologists  who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and phtograph any artifcats they find, and note the exact position in which they find them, and they need to learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence. An Archeologists can compare what they learn from the artifacts and sites with the spaniards account of the Inca. Archeology confrims historical  records. The most important things to learn about the civilizations are where it came from and what happened to it. The fall of Inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The orgins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived had long been inhabited by different peoples. Archeologists have to be careful to make sure  exactly which people built which site.                       An Archeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discovered more about the Inca's predeccessors. Photography can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they canoot see from the ground. The Inca lived high in the andes and may eve have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried n caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites , because looters cannot easily get to them, but it also makes job of the archeologist more diffucult . high altitude archeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical sacnning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived                       In the future archeologist will use more techniques in the worl to discover more about the Incas predeccessors.

These discoveries were made for our benefit. One reason why these discoveries were important was so we can learn more about our past history. Another reason is so we can learn more about the past and how things have advanced since these ancient civilizations. My last reason why I think these discoveries are important is because we can learn how to make our society better so we do not become like these ancient civilizations and die out.                My first reason why I think these discoveries were important is because we can learn more about our past history. We can learn about their way of live like how they lived, what they did, etc. So this way we can have more knowledge about the past and learn form it. And if more discoveries are made about these civilizations, then we as people will have endless and more knowledge about the Inca, the Puebloans, and Pavlopetri civilizations.                My second reason why I think these civilizations are important discoveries is so we can learn from our past and how we advanced since then. We can learn about how things have changed and how we advanced since these civilizations died out. We can learn about how inventions during that time period have been improved and how we use these inventions now. We can also learn about their inventions that we do not use today and see if there is a way to make that invention better and see if there is a way we can use it today in our society.               My last and final reason why I think these discoveries are important finds is so we can learn how we can make our society better than the Incas, the Pueoblans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations, so we do not die out like their society. We can learn from their mistakes and make sure that our society do not make the same mistakes and die out like theirs. For example, if they make a bad choice and that is the reason why they died out, then we have to be smart and not make the same choice as they did. Lastly we can build off of their bad choices and mistakes so our society can grew and not die out like theirs.               In conclusion, the discoveries made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations were important finds. I think these discoveries were made so we can benefit from them. I have reasons why these were important discoveries. My first reason is so we can learn more about our past. My second reason is so we can learn from their civilizations and how things have advanced since these time. My last reason why i think these were important discoveries is so we can learn form their mistakes and make our society better.

Do you picture a Native American setting, or do you think of some indigenous tribe? Today I will be writing about some ancient civilizations and how they are important to today's life. I will specifically be writing about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.        The Inca are a very intelligent race. They have been credited with creating a system of counting by tying knots on a string, growing crops on terraced mountains, and building roads in the sides of mountains. They left behind many clues of their legacy, and archaeologists have been studying them for a long time. Some of these discoveries include descriptions of the Inca by European soldiers and priests, Inca pottery and gold, clothing, and building structures. This is very important because we discovered a whole new way of life: a whole new government, transportation, art and many other things. This could influence how we think, and how the human race slowly became more civilized with the ideas of great people.        The Puebloans are known as great architects who built ingenious buildings on top of mesas. They lived by farming and hunting, as many Native American tribes did, and recorded their history through drawings. The discovery of these people are very important because it introduced new ideas of how to live. We learned how they built their homes, and the meanings of their pottery. We still have much to learn about them, like why the left Mesa Verde, but we have learned so much from what they left. They also showed us that living in a rough terrain is definitely possible.                                    Probably one of the most advanced civilizations known to man is the Pavlopetri. Although the sunken city of Atlantis was most likely a myth, a discovery of an underwater city could prove that this is true. The Pavlopetri have been discovered to be very intelligent in their architechture. They built many buildings, streets, and religious structures. This shows that they had their own way of life. I think it is a very important discovery because it could prove several myths true. I also think it could lead to new things being discovered like a different way of life or new ideas that have been buried under the water for centuries.          All of these discoveries are very important. They show patterns of how their life could slightly influence how we live our life. It is amazing to see the different ideas and ways of life are all connected if we look at it the right way. Thank you for taking the time to read my paper. 	WRB PRP VBP IN JJ NNS , WP VBP PRP VB IN .

A city that was thought to be a myth, a fable, until just recently. the city of atlantis straddles 30,000 square meter across the ocean floor. atlantis is belived to have been consumed by the sea around 1000BC, and has artifacts such as pottery dating from about 2800 to 1200BC. Atlantis is a very old and ancient city that has been consumed by the world largest mass of water. another example of ancient civilizations are the incas. the incas lived up in andes and were easier to learn about. the incas buried their dead in mountain faces and they burried artifacts with the dead for the afterlife to use. but since it was so cold up in these mountains, it acted as a giant freezer and preserved the bodies enough for the archeologists to use our technology today to find out how the person of the remain found, died. as you can see the incas and the lost city of atlantis were just hiding. we just need people who are willing to take risks to find lost citys like atlantis or the hidden empire of the incas.

If these discoveries had not been made we would still be in the dark when it came to these civilizations.

If it were not for archeologist we would not know the religion, art, architecture, agriculture,goverment, trasportation, and the way of life for civilizations centuries ago, it would change mankind as we know.        In source one it talks about how archeologist found old stories that opened new ideas that the stories could of been from a whole another civilazation, ( kind of like a key in a door).  From the stories they found out about the ancient civilazations form of life, like what many of the people were good at what there form of work was and what troubles they had.       The big think it talked about in the last paragraph in source one was what they did with the dead, the archoloigst found out that they would burie the dead in high mountains and caves, so that robbers would stay away. Many of the archeoloigst made the long journey up the mountain to try to find clues but the article did not say that they found anything.       In source two it talks about the old civilzation of the Puebloans to me I found this article very intreasting because it revivled facts that I had know clue about from the Puebloans. Some of those facts were how they intouduced the bow and arrow to hunting instead of the spear throwing. It also talked about how the people were skilled basket makers. I feel I would not know these facts unless if it were not for archeoloigst.       In source three it talks about a diver who found artifacts in the bottom of the ocean in Southern Greece, it also talked about how they think that these clues could be linked to the lost city of Atlantis. My self personally I thought that was cool and kind of exciting. It also talked about more divers who found old potery lying on the ocean floor, in Southern Greece.        All of these articles are very important, and in source one it talked about old storys that were passed down from genration to genration and it talked about how that revivled the way of life for the ancient Inca, but to me I think it was the archeologist going out and finding clues that out the puzzle togather about what that civilzation was like.

The Inca have helped us out in a lot of ways. They were the artistic type of civilization that struck rich with its makeings. The reason we know this is from all the looters that have raided there tombs and have found art work that should go to the after life. We also know that they were a civilazation that was also dominate and did not trust anybody thats why they lived in the  Andes.They lived in caves in side of the mountain becuase we have found bodys that have been preserved their for more than a century.               Puebloans are a civilazation of movement and like to make change in day to day life. We have found out that they use to live in a type of house call pithouses. A pithouse is a really small house it consits of a 'living rom sunk a few feet in the ground.Four corner timbers supported the roof, and had a firepit an air deflector .' They used these types of houses becuase they were easy to pack up and go when it was time to. We also know that they loved to develop new creations or make an upgrade to an old. When they made a Kiva it took the same old idea of the pithouse but remodeled it to make it fumction better than the old one did. We have found this out through the types of writing that they have left behind. We also can tell 'they lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years.' After that they moved south to Arizona And some to New Mexico settling among their kind who where already there.           We also know about the loss city of Atlantis that is on the bottom of the ocean floor. The way we learn from this not to have a city that is basicly floating on top of water because it can erode away the most part of the foundation that is sitting their. We can also learn about the way 'The  city looked like by finding peaces of the town pice by piece left behind that we could pin together that we found on the ocean floor'.       This is important to us becuase it gives us some ways it was like back then. Even though we will never know exactly what happend or the journey they alll took by finding new information about them we can learn alot about there past and the way thre Civilization worked 	DT NNS VBN IN NNS VBP RB JJ TO PRP$ NN CC NN IN PRP VBP JJ NN IN DT DT NN PRP VBP VBN VBP IN CD JJ NNS DT NNP , NNP CC JJ NNS VBP VBN PRP NNPS VBP WP PRP VBZ IN TO VB DT NN , DT NNP NNP NNP VBP VBN PRP RP IN DT NN IN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN IN NN IN NN NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN PRP VBP DT VBZ IN DT DT NNS WDT VBP VBN EX NNS CC VBP VBN NN NN WDT MD VB TO DT NN NNP NNP RB VBP IN PRP VBD DT NN WDT VBD RB JJ CC VBD RB VB NN NNS WRB PRP VBD IN DT JJ VBN IN NNS IN NN IN DT NN NN PRP VBP VBN NNS IN VBP VBN VBN PRP$ IN JJR IN DT NNP NNP VBP DT NN IN NN CC IN TO VB NN IN NN TO NN NNP NNP VBP VBN RP IN PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NN IN NN NN NNP DT NN VBZ DT RB JJ NN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN NNS VBD DT NN , CC VBD DT NN DT NN NN .

The discoveries about the Inca showed they had no writing system or alphabet. Discoveries on the Puebolans showed about what time that they civilized and became farmers and builders from  hunters and gathers. Archeologists discovered that because they civilized that they became very skilled at masonry but basket weaving slowly faded away. In source three scientists possibly discovered the lost city of Atlantis though the fable is unlikely to be true it does make a case that even records from long ago can be accurate.

Studying these clues some archaeologistt are able to piece together some of Inca life.Some old stories are told about the IInca, by Europeans who arrived in their empire in 1532 and described them in their diaries and lettters.       most of our knowledge  about the inca come from artifacts, or objects that they have left behind. In many ancient civilizations the Inca artifacts might be objects that are made from stone, pottery, gold, or even silver. Even though they have been buried for hundreds of years some of these magnifacent artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in graves of the dead for them to use in their after life.       Some ancient textiles and clothing have also been found and havbe survived remarkably well. Some materials like cloth were usually destroyed by dampness, but these items were preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coast or the cold mountains of the andes.But sadly some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. they will take anything that is valuable.Most of the treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today.       The fall of the Inca is easy to date back because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and then soon after toook over the empire. The origons of the Inca however are much more difficult to trace because the area where they live had long been inhabited by many different people.They lived high in the Andes and may have even worshiped some mountain peaks.Many of their sites are in remote , high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces. But ths has helped preserve the sites , because loooters can't easily get to them.       The high mountains are vey cold, so cold that they act as a giant freezer. Bodies are found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn how the people died. the bodies also reveal information about how they lived.                Long ago about 1,400 yaers ago Europeans explored North America. A group of people lived there in the Four Corners religon chose Mesa Verde for their home. For over 700 years they and their decendants live and flourished here,eventually building building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D 12000s, in the span of a gereration or two, they left their homes and moved away.       Mesa Verde national park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture.Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'. We now calll them the Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descendants.       The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are also known as 'Basketmakers' for their skill at crafts.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithousees clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. they learned to make pottery and acquired th bow and arrow, a more efficient wepon for hunting than the altatl , a sper thrower.       About A.D. 750 they began building houses above gorund, with up right wallls made of poles and mud. They built the houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or evn two in front. From here on these people are known as puebloans, a spanish word meaning 'village dwellers'. 1000 A.D the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Walls of thick , doubled-coursed stone often rose twoor three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. Pottery also changed , form simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before, and much mesa-to land was cleared for agriculture.       A.D 12000, another major population shift saw people begin to move back to the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Why did they move ? we dont really now why. Perhaps it was for defence; perhaps it was a religious or psychological reasons.Or whatever the reason or reasons, it gave rise to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is mot famous.       When the clifff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there .       .    The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the most enduring myths- the fable of Atlantis- have been brought to light beneath the waters off southern Greece. this site, which strattles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Pel0oponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C. What they found surpassed all expectations.       Thanks to the shifting of sand and the settlement's enclousure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world. A world of buildings , court yards,main streets , rock-cut ombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.       Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank.Theories include sea level changes , ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.       'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps under water explorations going ' said Sakellarious. ' this is and extrordinary find but there is still alot more down there that has to be found'.

We need to knwo whether they were a real ancient civilization or just a myth.                Some archaeologists who study special places find many different things such as the things that belonged to Inca civilization who's remains and artifacts were found in Peru. Form some of the artifacts the scientist have found, they have concluded that that the Inca had no formal alphabet or any system or writing. Scientists were amazed when they had found out that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Some of they Inca textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well concidering all the time that has passed and all the weather that has probably erode it a bit. From just the Inca we have learned so much in how people used to live back in that time.                 Another civilization that has helped us understand more anout the past is the Puebloans. The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') on 550 A.D. They lived in pithouses from 550 A.D to about 750 A.D. By 1000 A.D they had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between 1000 A.D and 1300 the population had reached several thousands, that helped us understand that they had reproduced pretty quickly making it into a pretty big civilization. Using nature to their advantage they had built the dwellings in the sides of clifts. This shows us that they we pretty advanced in intellegence. Puebloans were pretty advance as a civilization also helping us more in understanding the life of the past.                   One more civilization that helped us understand the past are the Pavlopetri. The investigations that the archaeologists have made is that there are over 9,000 square meters of new buildings but what really surprised them was  hte discovery of a possible megaron, a monumental  structure with a rectangular hall, which suggests that the town had been used by an eite. Scientist have yet to discover why  the settlement had sank  but it might be one of the oldest dating back 5,000 years. They were even more advanced in architecture that than the other civilizations.                    In all many people believe that new discoveries are important for people to study. We want to know what had happened to any lost cities that may once have been very advanced. I believe that these dicoveries are very important.

The Inca of Peru people did not leave any archives for the people who study the Inca of Peru. The archaeologists say that the Inca of Peru people made kntts in colored strings called quipus to recored the calander to keep a count of there livestock. The Europeans that were first to meet the Inca of Peru people were amazed that they could run a huge empire just using colorful strings to keep records. The people who study the Inca people found many ancient colored strings (quipus)- but he people who study the Inca people stil do not know what the knotts on the quipus means. The people who study the Inca people say with out any one who knows what the knotts and the strings on the quipus mean, then it is like solving a big mystery.       How do we know about the civilization that is nearly a hundred years (1438-1532) ruled a South American empire that rivialed the expanse of ancient Rome? There was clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of there religion, art and architecture, agiculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. If the people who study on the Inca's study there clues, archaeologists and other people can piece together details of the Inca of Peru people.       The things that we know about the Inca people comes from oral history, or stories passed down through generation to generation. Passing down stories was important to the Inca people because it was a way to preserve a community's of history.       The way we know about some of the stories of the Inca people is because the stories were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The people who visit were Spainish soldiers and priests. They explained the Inca people by writing letters and by diaries.       The people who study things have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The spainish soldiers did not speak the Inca language as well as the Inca people did. The spainish soldiers may not know what the Inca people were saying, but they understood wht the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accrurate. Some of the Inca people's stories were legends rather than history.

Know their alphebet, their calendar, and their religion.        The Inca never had an official alphebet or system of writing at all. They left nothing for modern historians to study or read. So that means they really did not have documents either. They left nothing!        Ancient Inca did have a calendar though. They made knots in various colored strings called quipus. That was used as a calendar and also to keep track of their livestock. Many historians and Archaeologists have found quipus but they can not seem to find out what they mean.        The Inca left many clues that can open up a window to their religion. But so far, Archaeologists still does not understand much about their religion.        The Inca is a very mysterious civilization today. Still many people know little facts abaout the Inca. Maybe someday researchers will finally uncover the real truth about the Inca.

I read three sources that explained a lot, they talked about the under water place atlantis. They sent divers down to search, the sand had shifted, and why it was so unique. The inca also talked about how they made bow and arrows out of popttery.  Atlantis was one of the oldest submerged towns. They also found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5000 years ago at least 1200 years originally thought. That are some examples of this article.

The acient Inca of Peru had no form of writing system so they had left no files or documents for historians to discover so they kinda had to go on about with the idea of how things happened. It was like a puzzle with no picture but they still put together the pieces. The Inca made knots in colored string called quipus, to record the calander days and to keep cout of the livestock. We have found many acient quipus but people today do not know what the knots mean. The europeans that met the Inca were very shocked that they coold keep a huge civilazations running on knots in string! Understanding acient Inca is like solving a mystery.        The civilization for nearly 100 years ruled a South American empire. Clues left behind by the Inca show us about their government, transportation, and way of life. By studing all of this we can piece together the way of like by the Inca. some of what we know comes from the oral history, or stories passed from generations. Passing on the Inca's stories, preserving the communitys history. Some of the old stories were written down by the Europeans. The Europeans arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They mostly described the Inca in letters and diaries.       Historians have to be carful when the interpret the language because the Spaniards didnt speak the Inca language well. So some of them may have not understood what the Inca were telling them. So they might not all be accurate. Some of the Inca's stories were rather ledgends then history. The other things we know comes from artifacts that the Inca left behind. Most of the things that we have found are made from pottery, stone, gold or silver. Those types of materials last a long time even if they have been buried for a long time. Some artifacts are dug up in the ruins of buildings and others are found burried in the graves of the dead to use in the afterlife.        Some of the Inca textiles like clothing also survive well. Materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but they have been preserved in the dry deserts on Puru's coasts or the cold mountians of the Andes. Some sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some of the treasures were taken long ago but some of them still get taken today and if there is a site that people have looted on are not a very good searching spot for historians and if there is a site that hasnt been searched the historians get to it as fast as they can and search it slow and carefully.        Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and photograph artifacts they find. They also note the exact position they find them in. they try to learn about every single piece and they try tolearn as much as they can. They can compare what they learned from the artifacts and sites with the account with the spainardas and Inca. Sometimes they confirm historical mysteries.

And here is how we can do that; you see all the things we are finding in these 'lost civilizations' and we always say, 'We are looking at this very closely to see what we can find.' but are we really looking close enough?            First we found Pithouses; and what these are is little houses that are sunk into the ground a few feet--they look sorta like a livingroom-- and the only thing holding up this roof on the top is four corner timbers. there was also a firepit, this had an airdeflector, who knows what they used this for! maybe the mothers used these to cook vension or other foods they ate back then. this Pithouse also contained a hole for passage to the underworld, storage bins, etc. people lived in these from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750.            we also found many other things such as Kiva;   what this is, is what we call today, a church. back then they might refer to it as obviously a Kiva, or a ceremonial room. here we found underground chambers also comparable to our churches today. these were most likely used for healing rites or for praying for rain or luck in hunting or maybe even good crop growing seasons. Kivas were used for many different things most likely but we can never be sure of what exactly they were used for.            these things are very important because now we know part of what it was like living back then, and how its comparable to todays society and how we live. also now, we can uncover more legends and stories and see those to come.

Achaeologist found quipuses that kept records which this was probably one of the first new ways to have a record. We know know about their amazing portraits of thir religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. All of that helped us learn and put together details of Inca life. We also found some letter and diaries that Europeans who arrived at the empire wrote but they did not preack Inca language very well. They have also found graves and burial places most places have been looted though.        The Puebloans discovery was important because we found new weapons that they invented that are now used today, and we have learned so much from them they were practically the inventing discovery. We found some of their weapons that tehy made, they made pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. For hunting they made a more efficient weapin the atlatl (a spear thrower). They had underground chambers which later they found out they were like churches. They had all of their religious things in there.       The Pavlopetri Discovery was important because it showed that Atlantis could be real not just a myth! It was the first planned sunken town. It was underground for almost 5,00 years. This discovery showed what the ansisters are like, proves under water towns do exist, and it brought logic.

They would leave things that told us about there life and what are the things they liked to do.They would often find very cool thing sometimes.Some of them would find or dinosaurs bones maybe sometime un discovered people and  animal bones.           So like in 2040 when I pass I would leave my  great great great great great grand child a tresure box full of things to describe how things are now a days.In the treasure box I would leave money.Clothes that may have been in style.Techonoglys that we use now such as Iphones ,galaxys, and Ipods.The ways we was learnt math in.different types of ways and straggies.Jelwery that is most popular now that we wear.Games like a xbox 360.Types of candy we love to eat.   Books thats we were giving in our school years.Magizines about people we liked too watch on Tv like the people on BET or Diseny Channel, Or child hood favorite cartoon.Books about our current president(Obama).Also a Scrap book made by me with pictures and things about me and family tree with alot of pictures.Thats what kind of things I would leave my great great great great grand children and make them feel like a Archeology and learn a little about me and how I lived.       Archeogologys have sought to understand these peoples lives.Despite decade of excavtion,analysis.classifacation,and comparison,scientific knowledge remains sketchy.( The Cliff Dwellers).They left no writting stories so the  Archeogologys just had to study alot and learn just off what they had. They found all types of thing like Kivas (Used to heal rites or pray for rain,luck in hunting,or a good cropping.They were also used for many more reasons).Thank to the rain and storms that they found all these wonderful things.

The spaniards did not speak the inca language well.The rest of our knowledge of the inca comes from artifacts and objects that are left behind.And to show advanced our civilization is today and how more advanced they may how been. some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well.

The first europeans to meet them were suprised on how they can keep a empire so big with just a bunch of colored strings.       Some of what archaeologists know comes from stories passed on from generations.The rest of what they know comes from things they left behind like art, archetecture and way of life.They also know many things because of what the Inca people wrote down.Based on all of these clues on how the Inca people lived archaeologists study them and can  piece together details on their way of life.       The first Ancestral Pueblans settled in Mesa Verde.They lived in small little tents called pithouses.They were usally built on mesa tops or cliffs.In Mesa Verde they learned how to make pottery and weapons such as bow and arrows, and spears.They were also known for their skills to make baskets.   Around 750 A.D they had advanced alot more on how they would builed thier hoses.Their houses were now built above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud.By 1,000 A.D they advanced even more.Pottry went from simple designs on dull gray back grounds to black drawings on a white background.       Alantis  was inspiered by the secerets of a lost city. it was brought to light beneath the waters of southern greece.Anglo-Greek is  a team of archaeologists who have explored the waters of southern Greece for the so called myth Alantis.They revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings.Marine geologists have yet to figure why it sank.Theories have been made that the sea level might have changed wich made the settlement sink.

The Incas of Peruha had a very interesting way of how they controled their empire. The Mesa Verde were very good craft people. The Lost City of Atlantis was their such a city or is it just a myth?                The Incas never had no writing system instead they use colered strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. Their whole empire ran on these quipus ( colored strings). Archaeologists have found so of these quipus andthe still do not know what they mean or how they used them.It should be really interesting how the mangeged to controll their empire off of these colorful strigs               The Mesa Verde lived in pithouses. These pithouse were very strudy, their roofs was a float area. Their houses were in the shape of a table. They lived in these houses for about 200 years. Farming replaced huanting in the year 550 A.D. They were very skilled in crafting. The Incas were also know as basketmakers.When they moved near cliffs there they learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. they used these bows and arrows for a more efficient haunting weapon than the spear. In around 750 A.D the Incas began to build house above the ground. These houses were made of poles and mud.                Many people are on the hunt of finding the Lost City of Atlantis, but no one till this day knows for a fact that their really was a city call Atlantis. Say if their was a city called Atlantis would it be as amazing  as they say it would be? They have found a ceramics dating of the stone age. it settle ment was 5,000 years ago. That is at least 1,200 years earlier than they had originally had thuoght. It was over than 9,000 square feet. Marine geologists are still trying to find why it sunk in the frist place. People say that the sea level changed.                All of these citys has something in comman. The thing that they have in comman is that we hummans want to fully grasp how live was for them. How their personality was. How their every day live was for them. What they ate? What they would wear as clothes.

It is important to science because it shows how ancient civilizations were so far ahead to their time that they were able to adapt to a climate that was harsh. The Inca city in the mountains was an idea that probably took years to build. This discovery is also good to the advancement of history because it shows the way the Americas were before Europeans came.                      Mesa Verde national park also helps science and history. It helps history by showing us a picture of what a common pit-house looked like and describes to us the name and a idea of what their weapons were. It also helps science by showing us a machine built for people being allowed to breathe in their climate. This may have led to the advancement of today's modern heaters an air conditioners.                      In lost Greek city we get the idea that most myths might be just rumors. By using modern technology the divers were able to find Greek ruins under the water. The divers helped history by giving us an idea how cities can 'sink'. This is not a thing that happens on its own but by natures creation. Throughout the world more divers may find different submerged cities which may benefit science and history.

Archeologist made the discoveres because they want to learn more about the tribe or town and help make earth a history worth making. So having to do that why don't you go and find some discoveres yourself? 	NNP PRP VBP NN IN DT VBN . IN RB RB WRB RB VBP PRP VBP TO DT JJ NN TO DT JJ JJ .

I am going to explain to you how archaeologists figure out how it is exactly how they lived ,and what challenges they encountered on their journey.                Archaeologists have found ancient artifacts that have helped them determine the way of life during ancient times.  They have found things like clothing and buildings.  They have used these things to figure out how it is that these ancient people lived.  Archaeologists have discovered that the people that lived during ancient times had their own way of life.               Anyways, there is how the archaeologists figured out how the ancient people lived and their way of life.

Also how it was in the past in different places when we weren't here. The Incas showed us how they lived and what kind of technology they used back then. Showed us what happened, what kind of problems they had. The Puebloans showed what it was like back then in the Americas. Also how they developed in housing. They made baskets and bow and arrows to help them with the things in life. The Pavlopertri makes us wonder how it beneath the ocean and makes us develop the things we need to find out how that happened.

I think it is very important to learn about the ancient civilizations in the past because you can learn many things.              First, you can learn about the geography. You can learn where the civilization was located. For example, the Incan empire was located in South American in the mountains. You can also learn about the climate. Some places it was cold and some places it was warm.              You can also learn about what they wore. The Incas wore thing made out of cloth. If you learn about what they wore, then you would be able to figure out what type of climate they lived in.              It's very important to learn about these civilizations for many reasons. You can learn lots of things about your culture and your background. 	WRB JJ VBP PRP VB PRP VBZ TO NN IN NNS IN DT JJ .

I read so much about them in social studies that i know the things by heart okay lets start off by saying the indians dint have guns so they used bow and arrows to kill the animals and people whom tried to kill them at times. The people were really old they was in the world at times like 200 A.D now that is a long time. See they had a whole thing of unpolished gold on their properties that were called gold mines tha they got removed from here home bribery and force that  was crazy some died from dieases and some survived. They caught dieases like nuemona cause of there thin clothes and they were walking in the snow. So i actully see how they felt. So they had to find better places to go their houses was gone and everything I felt very sorry for them. The one that tried to resitce and get killed it was sad cause they were fighting for what were theirs. But now indians are everywhere cause this is a very very free wide and long world they cant be told to move unless a reason. But anyone whom never been their or own anyhing cant go and say move now cause the indians have a right in law to do what they fell to them. But i see how it was back then it wasnt the country it was the presidents weve had so many racism one that it is to many to count everyone count in the world no one deserve to get treated diffrent no one. But the indians had to build forts out of sticks,stone and rags things like that. This how they lived but not today. We and they have houses but some still are in the same place well that is what i learned today       Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World                                                        Jeivon Donshai Moore                                                                                                                 	PRP VBD IN DT NNS VBD VBN JJ NNP PRP VBP DT NNS WDT VBP NN NNP NNP VBD RB RB IN PRP IN JJ NNS WDT PRP VBP DT NNS IN NN NN NNS VB RP IN VBG DT NNS VBP VBP NNS RB PRP VBD RB CC VBZ TO VB DT NNS CC NNS WP VBD TO VB PRP IN NNP NNP NNS VBD RB JJ PRP VBD IN DT NN IN NNS IN CD JJ RB WDT VBZ DT JJ NNP NNP PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS WDT VBD VBN NN NNS VBP PRP VBD VBN IN RB NN NN CC NN IN VBD JJ DT JJ IN NNS CC DT NNP NNP VBD NNS IN NN NN IN EX JJ NNS CC PRP VBD VBG IN DT NNP NNP PRP RB VB WRB PRP NNP NNP PRP VBD TO VB JJR NNS TO VB PRP$ NNS VBD VBN CC NN PRP VBD RB JJ IN NNP NNP CD WDT VBD TO VB CC VB VBN PRP VBD JJ NN PRP VBD VBG IN WP VBD NNP CC RB VBZ VBP RB VB DT VBZ DT RB RB JJ JJ CC JJ NN PRP VBP VB VBN TO VB IN DT NNP CC NN WP RB VBN PRP$ CC JJ NN NN VB CC VB NN RB NN DT NNS VBP DT NN IN NN TO VB WP PRP VBD TO NNP CC PRP VBP WRB PRP VBD RB RB PRP VBD DT NN PRP VBD DT NNS VBP VBN RB JJ NN CD WDT PRP VBZ TO JJ TO VB NN NN IN DT NN DT NN NN TO VB VBN NN DT NNP CC DT NNS VBD TO VB NNS IN IN NNS , NN CC NNS NNS IN NNP NNP WRB PRP VBD CC RB NNP NNP CC PRP VBP NNS CC DT RB VBP IN DT JJ NN RB IN VBZ WP PRP VBD NN NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP CC NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP

In Inca traces of small, long buildings are being found. While this occurs, massive structures such as arenas have been discovered in the central area of Rome. This shows that back in acient times, as well as today, where you live can affect the types of houses and buildings you will face in your lifetime. Personality played and still plays a big part in the design of places. This is why we see huge structures in Rome while in Inca they have small, minute buildings to mold their life in.

But its also good to know that they made/have their calendar. The fact they left clues behind was even better, because they could let someone know they was here also details about their life.They also made things from gold, sliver, stone, and pottery, and after they were doing making it they  would put it in one of their famlily grave if they have passed away instead of making it and throwing it away. They made their own clothes, and other materials.Hunters would come and take anything valuable.They wrote down and photograph anything they could find and note the exact position in which they find them.... they were also important for uncoving things that no one really knew about..The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the spaniards murderd the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliffs face,or on mountains tops. This has helped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it aslo makes the job of the archaelogist more difficult.The dead bodies also reveal information about how they lived...   END OF PART ONE !!!!!!!!!!!

Sometime in October 2009 The was a Greek diver diving as usual and he saw something in the distance so he went to go take a look. He swam all the way over there and he couldn't believe his eyes It was a town in fact later after some research it was the oldest recoreded town ever, It was made about 5000 years ago , It's remains dating from 2800to 1200 BC. This city covered about 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. It revealed they had courtyards, houses, streets, and religous structures, just like we have today. This shows how much that we dont know about whats under the ocean, how much we have not saw. Well thank you for reading my article i hope everyone tunes in again for my next piece. GoodBye.

The rest comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind. Some of the textiles and clothing have also lasted all these years.

They didn't leave archives for historians to study. Inca made knots in colored strings to record the calendar and keep a count of livestock. First Europeans that met the Inca were suprised that they could run a big empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists found many ancient quipus- but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.

Archeologist got more fasinated by these myths they were hearing about, they got courious and wanted to discover if these myths were real or not. Archeoligist have learned things by reading books about Ancient Incas, Ansetral Pueblanos, and Atlantis City.                  First I an going to talk about Ancient Inca's lost civilization. The Ancient Inca's were from Peru. Archeologist have been trying to look for Ancient Inca history. The Inca did no leave behind any archives for historians to study on.  Archeologist have found may ancient quipus. Quipus are knots in colored strings to record the calender to keep a count of livestocks. Quipus have many knots on them but no one know what those knots mean. The Inca did not have any formal alphabet or system of writing system. Without anyone knowing what these knots mean the Ancient Inca's history remains a mystery. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looter. The treasure hunters or looters took anything valuable that they found. Now archeologist have nothing they can study on all they can do is look for clues and take pictuers to look for things they can find or discover.                  Next I am going to talk about Ancestral Pueblanos lost civilization. Archeologist have called these people Anaszi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or' ancient enemies.' We now call them Ancestral Pueblanos. The Pueblanos lived in pithousees that they built them selves. Ancesteral Pueblanos also lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. The material they used to built their dwellings are sand stone that they shaped in to rectangular blocks the size of a lof of bread. The motar between the blocks was mix of mud and water. Roos averaged about 6 feet by 8 feet, space enough for two or three persons. Isolated rooms in the rear and on the upper levels were generally used for storing crops. The kiva roofs created open courtyard where many daily routines took place. When the Pueblanos left Mesa Verde they travled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling amoung their kin who were already there.                  Last I am going to talk about Atlantis the   lost civilization. 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr jon Henderson, associate professer or underwater archaeologist of the University of  Nottingham. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meaters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It was discoverd by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago , it was this year that marine archaeologist, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. What they found surpassed all expectations. thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's encloseure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. They also found thousands of shards of pottery the pottery might of been stone, silver, or gold. Atlantis was occupied some 5,000 years ago. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploring going.                           This was a very interesting report on lost civilizations. With the the help of archeologist and new technology theses lost civilizations are know. They are known by people that had no idea that these civilizations even existed. One of the lost civilizations that I thought was the most interesting is Atlantis.  I would recomend to people to research about  Atlantis City.

Scientists want to learn and study about the past so that they could share it out with the people. Archaelogists are fascinated by the civilization of the past because you get to learn and see how it was back then.                                                                                                                                     The Pavolopetri are an Anglo-Greak team of archaeologists and marine geologists, which expolore the sunken settlements of the Lost City beneath the waters off southern Greece. The archaelolgists are inspired by the Lost City because it's one of the worlds most enduring myths. The Lost City is an important find because it's one of the oldest sumerge town in the world, which is underwater. The Lost City has been dicovered fourty years ago, it's been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Archaelogists had tooked notes and studied it for a long time so that they could share thier information with us.                             The Inca were studied  because archaelogists want to learn about thier past and to see if the legends that wrer told of them are true or if thier just legends. All of the archaelogists knowledge from the Inca comes from artifacts, or things that were left behind, also from the places that were left behind. The've learn that the artifacts might be made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. They study the past so that archeology comfirms historical records.                        The Puebloans are North American group of people that lived in a region called Mesa Verde. Archaelogists called them Anasazi from the Navajo word times. Archaeologists have learned alot of the Puebloans. They've learned how they lived, were they lived, their resouces, and how some had crop failures, and also were have they traveled.               Archeologists learn all of the past so that they could inspire the past, and know how they lived, and how they have disapeared. They study so that they could share thier information all over the world and to know about back then, the people's life and to confirm historical records.

The discoveries made from the Incas were very incredible. The Incas left many clues behind that form an amazing portrait of their art, religion, architecture, transportation, government, and their way of life. Archaeologists studied all these clues left behind and were able to put them all together and see how the Inca lived. Also, by finding bodies they found out how they died. From the clues they found, they know now many information about the Inca life.            In Mesa Verde, Pluebloans lived there for about 700 years and settled there in A.D. 550. Pluebloans lived in pithouses which were a few feet underground. As the population multiplied, they built more pithouses. Pithouses included many things inside. For example, it had air deflector, storage bins, or living room. I think pithouses are the reason on why we have houses today. Their architecture influenced us to making better, bigger, and stronger houses. Ancestral Puebloans accomplishments were ranked among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.            I believe the discovery of Atlantis was the most important one of them all. Atlantis is located beneath the waters off southern Greece. There were many myths of Atlantis, but nobody knew exactly if it existed or not. Thanks to the archaeologists and marine geologists they were able to prove that Atlantis did exist. It wasn't until this past few years that we were able to survey some of the ruins. Archaeologists and marine geologists were able to see a whole different world underwater with buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. Conclusively, all this discoveries made from the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were important and very fascinating.

These discoveries help us find out information about the past. It helps us uncover the cause of their effects. We learn about how they functioned in the past, both labor wise, and person wise. Without these, we wouldn't know the where's, when's, why's, and how's of our ancestors.      To begin with, the Inca made knots in colored strings, quipus, to keep count of livestock, and to record the calendar. Quipus could be one of the components to our now a day calendar. Also, the building of objects from stone, pottery, gold, or silver, could be one of the reasons why today we know that they do not last little. Puebloans aren't left behind. They too, helped with our current 'civilizations.'      Puebloans were known as 'cliff dwellers' because of where they lived. They built a civilization on cliffs. These 'cliff dwellers' could be the foundation to what we have today, houses in rare places. ' 'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths...' This is the Atlantis myths, a lost Greek city.      Atlantis, is a very well known ancient civilization. In the passage, it says that they have found a possible megaron, which is a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall. This could have lead to the building of monumental statues. This is why ancient civilizations are important. Although we might not take them into consideration, the could've been the foundation of our daily lives.

Archaelogist research all territories to see if they could find any clues like artifacts. Artifacts were a very important resource because they could find dates and diferent traditions.       With ancient Inca they found artifacts which made archaelogogist helpful to discover their existence. For example they found some quipus but unfortunately no one knows how to read them. Archaelogist have to fly up mountains and pyramids to find patterns and to find knew things.       The secrets of a lost city that may have ijnspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis- have been nrought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.

In the article Ancient Inca, by Beth Gruber it talks about the Ancient Inca, and how they can run huge empires and how they lived throughout those empires.                  In the Incas way of life they had to run huge empires and watch after everyone. The civilization that ruled for nearly a hundred years in South American. They have left behind clues like amazing portraits of religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their ways of life. Archaeologists can put together the Incas way of life from these tiny pieces of evidence's.               Another great civilization was the Puebloans who lived in 550 A.D. In the article Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, by Roy Anderson it talks about how they lived and the economy. They settled in Mesa Verde, they were known as basket makers for their skill at crafting. They replaced hunting with farming. They lived in pit-houses clusted into small villages, usually built on mesa tops and sometimes on cliffs. They learned how to make pottery and bow and arrow a better hunting weapon. In time their population multiplied. In  750 A.D they started to build homes above ground.                  In about 1000 A.D they had advanced from pole and adobe construction to skillful stone masonry, they were three stories high. They joined together for about 50 rooms. By 1100 and 1300 A.D the population reached several thousand. By 1200 A.D they lived on cliff alcoves. Then they reached to cliff dwellings it was most famous. Cowboys reported them in about the 1880s. Puebloans lived on them for about less than a hundred years.             Both the Incas and the Puebloans were both very intelligent for their time period. They were both good in running empires and farming and crafting. They were personally the smartest of them all. They both made a change to their economy.

A reason we go to such lengths to perserve is so we can better understand our history as human beings. For example reasearchers from around the wolrd investigated acient incan civilizations to learn about their customs and shed light on their culture.

It's always interesting when someone's culture is very different than what we do. The Inca's had string to keep records, their clothing was very different, and the god or gods they believed in. For the Puebloans their culture interests us because we do not know why they migrated even though there are seven theories. The Pavlopetri culture is interesting since they lived in one area for more than 700 years which turned into elaborate stone communities.     Depending on what happened to them it can interesting to know. The Inca's left in a sad way but it also interests people cause you think of how someone can kill a entire civilization. For the Puebloan's they just left then centuries later they came back. The Pavlopetri for reason that we don't know is under water in really good condition and we don't know what happened to the people in it even though there are artifacts. But we do find out information about other civilizations telling us that this is what happened to them.     I would be interesting if one day we could go back in time and see what ancient civilizations did or might of done in their everyday life. Inca's everyday life might of been worshipping, gathering or hunting food, making types of art and other things. For the Puebloans I think almost everything is the same except they lived in cave dwellings unlike the Inca's who live in the mountains mostly. Pavlopetri had a whole different thing since they lived in a planned town. Even though we don't know much about them I can infer that they lived a fun,most of the time relaxed life without having to do to much depending on the jobs they had. The artifacts are important since they can tell us those things.    Those are the three things that make discoveries about the Inca's, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri so important. Their culture was different from ours. Also the way they died out or just left for no reason. The last one is what they basically did everyday with their lifes.

Today, we try to solve the mysteries of who lived on this Earth before us. There is no main reason for our obsession with the past other than utter curiosity. It is human nature to want to know where we have come from and to find connections between now and previous societies. Perhaps it is necessary to know what has already happened so we can change the outcome if the same circumstances occur.                         Three major ancient civilizations that connect us to our past are the Incas, from what is now Mexico, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Because of our natural curiosity to know what came before us, archeologists have dug up and studied these ancient civilizations and have used artifacts, items found in the ruins of past civilizations, to piece together the mystery of who they were, what they did, and how they ended. From the Incas, we learned that they kept track of live-stalk, citizens, and calenders with knotted strings called quipus. We also have journals and records from the invading Europeans that explain the invasion then downfall of the Empire.                 Another lost settlement that we have recently discovered and studied is a civilization found underwater off the coast of present-day Greece. There, divers found ceramics almost as old as the stone age and other interesting artifacts to help us learn about the mysterious city. Their downfall is extremely self evident as the entire city is now submerged underwater.                 We can learn many things from these past civilizations. For example, with the clues archeologists have found, we now know how the civilizations were destroyed. The Incans were attacked by Spanish and other Europeans who wanted power and were just greedy for land. On the other hand, The city that used to be in Greece wasn't invaded but ruined due to the climate and geography. Because it was so close to the ocean, the waves engulfed the entire city and has hidden it under the sea for over 5,000 years.                 It is important that we know what happened that ruined these ancient civilizations so it wont be repeated. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, 'learn from other people's mistakes for you wont live long enough to make them all yourself.' This holds very true to how we should live our lives today. As we have learned from the ancient Incas, it is necessary to have military protection to keep greedy power craving societies away. Also, we have learned by example to never build a society near the ocean because unlike placement of our homes, the weather is uncontrollable. As help from past civilizations guides us and the curiosity to know our origins drives us forward, our society will always be interested in studying and piecing together the mysteries of the life that came before us. However, we must be careful about not dwelling on the past because what has happened is over and cannot be changed. We must use the knowledge gathered from previous events to lead us into greater things in the future.

With all the imformation arechaeologists keep we'll know more about the way ancient people lived.          Its important to keep imformation about ancient people because this way we can see what they did in the past. For example, from their artifacts we can see that they would make them themselves and from something that would last a long time. We can also predict the way of their lives. To find an artifact is very important because it tells us a little about some of the things they would make. Its also very important to keep record of the ancient civilization because we can learn many things from them. For example the calendar, with out their ways of telling the diferent times of the year we would have the calendar right now.         In conclusion its important to keep a recoird of what archaeologists find. This is very helpfull to our time that we live in right now. wit out it we wouldnt have some of the things that they had.

In the beginning of this article, the writer, Beth Gruber, talks about Ancient Inca; Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past. First, she tells us, the ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Secondly, the article shows us that for nearly a hundred years (1438 - 1532) a civilization ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. Lastly, she tells us that clue left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.           In the middle of this article, writer Roy Anderson gives us imformation of the Mesa Verde National Park; Ancestral Puebloans and Their World. First, he gives us facts about how 1,400 years ago, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. Secondly, he tells us that that Mesa Verde is spanish for green table.

And I agree these structures are mysterious, so people would create myths. '-the fable of Atlantis- have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' The myths were told by ancestors from years ago to be pasted on to other generations. The ruins of where the myths take place may have been plants, human remains or fossils of some sort. Buildings and religious structures may have been found to create these myths. They say ' What they found surpassed all expectations.' They are talking about in the ruins and what they thought of it.

They did not leave any thing for the historians to study the alphabet.  They would  tie knots in colored string to keep track of the count of livestock,and they called it quipus. When the first European met the Inca they were superseded that they keped track of there livestock on a string.                So do you know about the civilization from 1438 to 1532 whom ruled one of the many South American empires that have rivaled the growth of ancient Rome? Artifacts have been left  by the Inca have formed history of their religion. Things like their art, agriculture, government, transportation, architecture, and also there way of life were left behind. with the materials ant buildings and everything else they left behind the can put together and pieces and detail of how there life was then.                Clothing was also another find in the lost civilization. it seamed to be that the clothing have survived and is to this day in a decent condition. Usually ancient clothing would be destroyed by the dampness. But the reason why the clothing stayed in good shape is because it has been in a dry dessert, Peru's or the cold mountains of the Andes for all these years.                Inca sights are being distributed by treasure hunters or looters, who will treasure anything that may be ether valuable or a piece of art that may mean something. Treasures have been found all over and the treasure hunters may have found most of the artifacts but they still keep looking because they just might find something else that will make a difference.

One of the three most popular is Ancient Inca, Ancient Puebloans, and the lost Greek City that inspired Atlantis. Each one of these discoveries of these civilizations help dramatically throughout world history.                     First of all, the discovery of Ancient India was very important to Historians for a lot of important reasons. One reason is that  they had a early  number systems using only knots on a rope, this was called a quipus, it also kept a calender. Another good reason is how the Incas lived, which was very interesting. They were very religious people and did many cerenomies, traditions, etc. But this isn't the only civilization that was very important throughout our history.               Secondly, the Ancient Puebloans were also a very sacred, ancient civilization. By the time of 1000 A.D. they were masters in stone masonry. They built villages out of many rooms, with kivas built inside. The Puebloans also built cliff dwellings but no one fore sure understands the peoples lives. All they know is that it takes great skill to build such buildings without modern technology. The end of them was most likely crop failures or intensive depletion of resources. Many known things are a mytrh about them, similar to the historical lost city of Greece.               Lastly, the lost city of Greece inspired many people to come up with the story of Atlantis. Since it is so difficult to explore a lot of fables have sprung up, but recently due to the increase of digital technolgy archaeologists are now able to survey the ruins. Biologist found over 9,000 square meters of buildings and possible megaron.                All in all, the discovery of these lost civilizations are very important to our world history.

Why is it so beneficial? I will tell you why in these next couple paragraphs. Starting with learning from mistakes.        Learning from our ancient ancestors mistakes could definitely be one of the most important things we do. Learning from ancient civilizations is important because we don't want to make the same mistakes that they did. Making those same mistakes could lead up to us falling like the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri did. We can also learn from there mistakes and not go to war with people that we have no idea how weak or how powerful they are. Believe it or not we can even learn from there mistakes by pottery and bowls and cups. How we could possibly learn from that is not making the same as them possibly making them better so we have better bowls/cups then they did.         In conclusion, we can learn from ancient civilizations by not making the same mistakes such as:   Going to war with people we have no knowledge of.   Making pots cups and bowls that arent all that great.   Making better shelters then they did.    Better Clothing.   and a strong economic base so we dont fall like the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.

Alot of the knoledge we have today is because of the past happenings . Mistakes from the past have given us a fair warnings on wat not to do again ,even though we get those warnings most oftenlt we still make the same mistakes all the time .                     If we hadnt found ancient inca we would never have known that they had no system of alphabet or writing system . They also didnt have any archives or historians left to study. Quipus are colored strings that make up there livestock callendar. Quipus were probobly the emost common thing found of the ancient inca civilization.                                       Our next discovered civilization is the mesa verde national park. They were northern europeans that thrived about 1,400 years ago. There time of flurishment lasted about 700 years . Then in the late 1,200s the population got so big they hadto span to othe rparts of land . They were excelent hunters and gatherers and mostly lived in pithouses wich were small dirt houses that were partialy encane in dirt wich gave them good insalaton and protection from weathering.                                                                    In conclusion we as a societey have learned alot from our older civilizations. All important discoveries have benifited us in some way. The past reminds us on how to advance im life and how to correct possible future mistakes.All in all we wouldnt be the same today without our very important past.

We can find out how life was different and what has changed. They can provide us with good information on what has happend long ago and what important stuff happend.          Archaeologists have found many cities that are from long ago. For example the Incan Empire was a big empire and from items that they find gives us better information on what it was like back then. The ancient Inca made knots in colored string called quipus to record the calender and to keep count of livestock.We know it lasted from 1438-1532 because of the clues left behind by the people living there.

The Inca made knots in coloredstrings called quipus to record the calender to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus, but today no one knows what the knots mean. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and artitecture, argiculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life.         Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Archaelogists who study these sites keep careful records. They write them down and photograph any artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. They need to learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence.        Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record. Amoung the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it. The fall of Inca is eay to date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. Archaelogists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about the Inca's predecessors. About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verda for their home.   Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated 'the ancient ones' as 'ancient enemies.'          Between A.D. 1100 and 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. It mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. The stone walls of the large peublos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde, with their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. Using nature to advantage, Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread.

These civilizations lived in different locations and lived different life styles.    The Inca stories were legends rather than history. Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Their materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. The bodies that scientists find also reveal information about how they lived.The Puebloans flourished for more than 700 years and built elaborate communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. The Puebloans population multiplied. They built houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pit house or two in the front. Baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery and less attention to craft. Also, scientists have found buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures in the Pavlopetri. The seabed was a replete with thousands of shards of pottery. They also found ceramics daring back as far as the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied for some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originaly thought. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploring going.

From what civilizations leave be hind we can catch a glimpse of there religion ,art ,architecture, and government. So that by analysing we can determine there every day life.However since some civilazations ,like the inca didnt have a formal alabet or system of writing they didn't leave ancient writing for historians to study so noone really knows much about them.          Some of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts. Their artifacts are usally made out of stone,pottery,goldor silver. These materials last for a rellay long time and cloth was preserved in the dry deserts along the coast. Archaeologists study the sites but keep a carful record of every thing, and where it was buried. Unfourtunatly some sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters.Many things can be taught from the artifacts found at theses sites.

First off, the Inca were important because they started recording things like the calendar to keep track of their livestock.  They did this by using quipus which are knots in colored strings. Also they are important because the artifacts and things they left behind when they died help us to learn about what civilizaton was like in Peru.  Archaeologists record everything they find and compare it with the stories that the Spaniards tell to see if they match up so they can record it for us to learn about our history.  Then there is the Puebloans.What's important about them is they started to replace hunting with farming and they also started to make pottery.Another thing that's significant about tham is that since they started to farm they started clearing land for agriculture and a new way of life.  The structures they built are evidence of how civilization started to evolve.  Then there is the Pavlopteri, which is one of the oldest submerged town in the world.  This sunken town is unique because of how it was discovered that it was a very planned out town.  The shifting sands and water preserved everything down there better than they had hoped and they found a world of structures!  This captivating underwater world represents a frozen moment of the past.  All of these past cities are so important for us to learn about today because it teaches us about the mistakes and sucesses of the past and how to learn from them.

Archaeologists have studied these lost civilizations with advanced technology, but they still do not understand how they spoke their own language.   When scienctists found the Inca's homes they found how the government, transportation, and the way of life worked. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from stories passed down from generation to generation. When we found the first lost town of Inca, they were written down byt Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The rest of our knowlegde comes from artifacts.   About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate  stone communities. The first Ancestral Puebloan settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. They are known as basketmakers for their skill of craft. They lived in pithouses with a sipapu, a hole for passage to the underworld.   Divers explore the sunken settlement of the Pavlopetri. It dates some 5,00 years ago. The town is found in Southern Greece today. It was the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.   This concludes how archaeologists discovered thes tribes way of lief.

The Incas left behind many clues. The inca formed great portrait of their religion, art, government, transportation, and way of life. The clues scientist found help them found out about Inca life. Inca period has left behind many things to help our scientist tell how their life was back then.Stone, pottery, silver, gold and clothing help us tell about their life and what they went through. These facts are important because we would like to know what happend in the past.       Puebloans played a big role too! they settled in Mesa Verda in about AD. 550. They are mostly known for their basketmaking. They lived in Pithuses. they usually built their houses long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in front. This group started to move whan another population started to come in. Noboby knows why they left, scientist say that it was for a defense of stand point  or psychological or religious.       The Pavlopetri is a sunken cilvilization about 5,000 years ago. Scientist have been studying this civilization and found many interesting things. They found a  world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, tombs, and religous structures. What the scientist found was surpassed their expectations.           These tribes helped us understand life more and how ther life was in ancient times. The discoveries we have made had way more than we expected. All the things the scientist have found are amazing. The things they did in ancient times we do the same today so thats why its important to know what happen in ancient times so we can improve our world today.

The civilizations of the Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and Ancient Greece, were some of the most important contributors.  They left behind clues that tell the story of how they lived, their culture, traditions passed down from generation to generation, their government and politics, the practice of their religion, the beauty of their art, and the planning of their architecture.  Studying these clues lead to a gateway of understanding for how our culture and way of life developed over hundreds and thousands of years.           The Ancient Inca            The Ancient Inca ruled a Southern American empire during the years of 1438 to 1532.  Since the Inca had not created an alphabet or a writing system, there were no written records to inform archaeologists on life of the Inca.  The only records we have are quipus, which the Incas tied knots into a various assortment of different colored strings that kept records.  However, the significance and what they symbolize are unknown to archaeologists.  We must rely on the comparison of ancient artifacts with the historical records of Spaniard's to find evidence of their daily lifestyle and routine.  Although, there is another way to discover this.  The tradition of passing down stories by mouth from generation to generation is another method.  These methods can have flaws though.  Stories are warped over time and can become a false version of the original.  Also, many of the stories of the Inca people were not history or facts, but  it was legends and fables.            The artifacts and corpses of the Inca people may also provide clues.  The position, location, and age all give necessary evidence to discover their meaning to archaeologists.  However, looters and changes over time can tamper with the accuracy of the artifacts.  The archaeologists will collect whatever information they can from the site.  Mountainside sites in particular can harbor a lot of information.  The extreme cold preserve the bodies in the frozen ground.  These specimens can then be X-ray to discover the life they led and cause of death.  But to get to the site is difficult.  Expert mountaineers can reach these high-altitudes with all of the needed gear and return the body to be examined.           The Ancestral Puebloans            The Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde finally stopped their lives of being a nomad, and settled around A.D. 550.  Their former lives of hunting with atlatl and gather transformed to the tradition of farming.  Villages were built and the land on mesa tops were cleared for agriculture.  The new area inspired innovation in their tools, creativity, and architecture.  The Ancestral Puebloans were avid basket makers.  They also created unique pottery and more efficient weapons.  The earliest houses were called Pithouses, which later became Kivas.  These Pithouse were clustered into villages, and communities were formed.  By the year A.D. 750, the population of the Ancestral Puebloans had multipled massively.           The City of Atlantis            The infamous city of Atlantis was rumored to have sunken in the waters off of Southern Greece.  Underwater archaeologists have found it in excellent condition.  The 'Lost City' is more than 5,000 years old, and one of the oldest sunken sites ever.  With the aid of new digital technology, they will be able to explore it.  The city was supposedly sunk by either sea level changes or ground subsidence.  Considering that only one percent of the ocean floor has been explored, this is a major discovery for oceanography.  This was one of the most extraordinary finds.

Some of these are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.  All of these three civilizations were present a long, long time ago.  The Pavlopetri was even in B.C. Archaeologists have found the remains of these and many more and are studying the artifacts to learn as much as possible about these societies that we hardly know anything about.  Each and every piece of information helps us know that much more about these people and their lifestyles,  The discoveries of lost ancient cities has helped us improve our knowledge of history and the particular ancient civilizations.       Archaeologists have found out an abundant amount of information on ancient civilizations and what they were like.  In every lost city, there are tons of aritfacts for archaeologists to collect and study so they can gain a lot of information about the city and the people who lived there.  These artifacts are able to give archaeologists information about these people's lifestyles, everyday hobbies, and even their religious beliefs.  All of this information helps the archaeologists get a larger sense of what the civilization was like and how it functioned.  This knowledge helps us know more about our past generations.  Also, building structures of ancient civilizations can help archaeologists have a better understanding of how their constructions knowledge was.        All of this can give us a better idea of how peple have evolved over the generations.  We are able to look at how we used to be and then look at how we have become over the generations. The discovery of these civilizations has helped us have a better knowledge of our history and ancient civilizations.

In this section, it will show you evidence on why the Inca, the Pueboloans, and the Pavlopetri are an important discovery.        'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, are and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life,' says Beth Gruber in the selection Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past. With all of the oral history, or the storeies passed down from generation to generation. Can be somewhat true but we only know that from which it comes from. The stories passing down brought us to preserve the history of the community's history. When historians are carefully studying the accounts, the historians have to stay very careful on the way they interpret of judge something. Any misunderstanding would change the discovery made.             The way that the Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde shows us the way that they adaptive to their living. 'They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft,' says Source #1, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Pueboloans and Their World. During A.D. 750, they began building their homes against one another and above ground. Which gave them the name 'village dwellers'. On the time A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. Many historians have a prediction on why the Village Dwellers desereted their home. Some people say it was crop failures, saw drought, social and political problems. What ever it was, they left amazing artifacts for scientists to study.         With the discoveries of the Inca, the Pueboloans, and the Pavlopetri. The discovery has inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis -. Marine geologists have yet to piece together the facts of the sunken boat. Many theories left... but none prove yet wrong. Sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going,' said Sakellariou. 'Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'         Therefore, the discoveries about the Inca, the Pueboloans, and the Pavlopetri are important because it shows us the way people lived and survived before us. With all the architeture left for us to investigate we can use these ways for our own being as well.

My favorite article was the one about Atlantis, I thought thye were talking about the Little Mermaid. I loved the article because it told us about the past.what was intersesting to me was the struggles the arc haeologist went through to find this stuff that fascinate us all.The struggles with climbing mountains and looters destroying evidence and trying all their hardest to find out the truth and how people in the past lived.      What i found intersesting is how the simpliest things can destroy artifacts. Like for instance water, looters &amp; the weather. The water can dampen cloth or jouranals written on paper.  Looters can burn or sell the treasure. Weather can hurt the homes where our ancesors livedand the evidence. The colorful knots they found on the strings will be really cool  to figure out what they meant or if it was a way of counting animals or something.     You see, all these things are really cool to know. Wouldnt you want to know how your ancestors lived and wouldnt the people in the future want to know how we lived? Well it'll be much easier with the technology and different types of recording now and days. But they dint have that back then all they had were they're eyes and memories. So we got to do it the old fashioned way and find out about them.

These cities are so important beacause they are from a long acient part ago. That is mentioned alot throuought several different history related things.These cities have bee mentioned by in our ancestors stories, ancient cities and even ancient books.But there are so many different stories over the same thing.      Every ancient reaource that leads us to these cities are completly unrelated in there stories. They have no relation to each other and they are possibly even wrong.We as people and scientist cant neccasarly trust these resources beacause they all say something different.      This discovery of the other citie is very exciting beacause they may have found the actual lost city of atlantis.This may have led a myth to actual ancient history.

Well we always been able to study their remains and artifacts.Our knowledge we  know about the Inca is their thing that they left behind. they lived in high remote places. they kept up with time and the year basically the calender, with stings called quipus. can u believe that they kept up with a whole empire just with strings for over a 100 year                                   How do we know about the Puebloans well here are some facts. After 1400  years ago ,long before Europeans explored North America a group of people living in four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. for food they hunted and gathered so they could eat. their only weapon was a spear thrower. houses were above ground, with upright walls. They built their dwelling beneath the overhanging cliffs. Finally they traveled to new Mexico and Arizona.                       What do we know about the Pavlopertri people their settlement sunk under water, in the sea of GGreece . The submerged settlement is the oldest in the world. we in progress have found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into working of Mycenaean society.It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied.

Some ancient civilizations that scientists have been studying are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. The artifacts are great discoveries that are very important.                Finding the artifacts of the Inca was hard for the Archeologists to do. The Inca lived mostly in the Andes Mountains, and were frozen into them. Archeologist had to dig their way into the ice and climb on the Andes just to find the artifacts. They could have lost their lives doing this, and it took a lot of time and effort. The scientist discovered a many thing when they were climbing the mountians. Some of the things they discovered were that the Inca had no formal aphabet, they made knots in colored strings as a calendar, some of the objects they made were mad from stone, pttery, gold, or silver, and Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532. We know and learn everything from the artifacts, so the discoveries that the archeologists find are very important.                We have also learned about a lot about the Puebloans from discoveries. Some of things we have learned is how they built their cities, and their population between 1100A.D. and 1300A.D. These are some of the discoveries from the artifacts they found.                The Pavolptri are also very interesting to learn about now that we have discovered things about them. One thing that we have learned is the theories of how the settlement sank. The marine geologists think it sank because of the sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. Another thing we have learned is where the city was. It was near Neapolis. We really can find interesting discoveries.                The artifacts are great discoveries that are very important. I am really glad that we found so much information on the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavolptri. Now that we have more technology I hope we can find more discoveries and learn more. Discoveries can really help you learn a lot.

What they ate, how they communicated, or what life was like in general? You might think that these questions are impossible to answer because nobody from the past is alive to tell us what life was like back then. That is not true. An archaeologist could probably answer these questions. Archaeologist, find and interpret information from the past, they study our past life. They travel, dig and search to find old remains. With these remains, such as old clothing, artifacts, and other things they find valuable information and with this information they discover things about the past that no one ever knew about, which in this story was information about the Inca, Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.            Information about the Inca, Puebloans and the Pavlopetri is so important to us because in some cases it teaches us how they communicated or what language they spoke in their day of life. In source 1 we learn that the Inca lived in Peru and they didn't have a formal alphabet or system of writing. So if they didn't use an alphabet or didn't use writing to communicate, what did they use? Archeologist found that the Inca used 'quipus' to keep track of days and to keep track of their livestock. Quipus is simply the knotting of colored string. So before our time where we have, electronics and paper and pencil to communicate, you now know that people used to use knots to communicate. One may not think that this information is important but it shows us how our world is changing.       Although this was the past, it really could affect the way an individual might act. Knowing that life wasn't always easy and and everything was always there we now know that people in the past communicated in many different ways.

Such is the information found about the Inca, the Mesa Verde, and the city of Atlantis. These things could be found helpful with good ways of decrypting the information.        The Inca have told us alot about ancient Southern American culture.Such as their ingenious recording system of strings with differnet colors depending on the things that happened that day. Their locations surved as a defence mechanism of keeping robbers, bandits, and enemy tribys away. the textiles and clothing tell about life at those times as it was cold.

Clues about their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life will improve our knowledge of the way they used to think and do. It is also important to interpret the artifacts in such accurate ways so we do not carry inaccurate and incorrect information for years and years to come.             Trying to discover about these three people has helped archeologists also learn about geography and where people used to live. It also helps us know how long objects can last and under what conditions such as rain, snow, or sunny summer days. It will help us organize the facts away from the myths and we can go back to written information and discover whether or not they were false.

The Incas               The Incas date back to the time frame of 1438 to around 1532. They were known to have ruled a southern American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. Historians know some of the olden stories because of the writings of the Europeans. They had left behind journals and letters. As in many ancient civilizations Inca artifacts might be of object made from stone, pottery, gold, and even silver. Some artifacts are buried with their owner to be with them in the afterlife. The fall of the Incas was easy to date because the Spaniards murdered the Incan king in 1532 and took the Incan empire.               The Puebloans           The first Peubloans date all the way to A.D. 550. They were known for making baskets and for their skills of crafting. They lived in pithouses that were clustered into small villages usually that were built on mesa tops. When it was about 750 A.D. they began to make their houses above ground. During the Classic period (1100 A.D. and 1300 A.D.) the population reached several thousand.   Cliff Dwellers were first reported by a cowboy during the 1800's. They left no written records, yet for all the silence these structured speak with a certain eloquence.               The Pavlopetris                The Pavlopetris city was lost under the waters off of southern Greece enduring myths know as the lost city of Atlantis. The sunken settlements dates back about 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. Dr. Jon Henderson says 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' He then stated ' It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece.'The site which straddles around 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor is believed to have been swallowed up by the sea some time around the date of 1000 BC.

We find ourselves intruiged to know more about the wonderful civilizations that lived before us so we strive to find little things that connect the puzzle. All of these little things add up to one big thing. That big thing is the lost citie's secrets that people have been awaiting for years. We can find these secrets through curiosity, wonder, and amazment.            The lost city of Inca is a very fascinating place to discover. The Incans had no formal writing system or alphabet. They kept track of livestock and calendars on knotted colorful strings they caled quipus. On the quipus, there are symbols, but because there is no alphabet we know of, we cannot understand what is written on them. There is little left for historians to discover about the Incas. One contribution to this problem is looters. Looters are people who hunt for treasure that may be valuable to them. The only problem with looters other than it is wrong to steal is that they are taking away pieces to a puzzle that we are struggling to understand. Some of the things that we know about the Incas come from stories that we have heard from the spaniards through letters. We have to be cautious though when interpreting these letters because they cannot speak the language well so they may not actually be telling what is written. The other part of what we know comes from objects they left behind. They left textiles and clothing which was mostly preserved becuase of the hot weather, they left bodies on the mountain tops which are frozen becauase of the weather and we are able to bring the bodies down and study them using advanced technology which helps tell us when they died and what happened to them. Though we may not know much, the Inca's way of life is an extraordinary mystery just waiting to be discovered.            Another city waiting to be discovered would be the Puebloans. About 1400 years ago, a civilization of Puebloans flourished for abut 700 years.

Stories were passed by generation to generation to give later on the community history.       Inca clothing and treasure were a great sign to the looted sites that couldn't tell archaeologists that much of the history lefted back grom long ago.But they would dig up history and say,Peru had better life with and wothout Inca rule.Most of Inca lived in the high peaks og moutain's.That's were most researches went after they had died to get evidence on how they lived and died worshiping.       Most ancient Puebloans built there own supplies to live off in cliff's, Then when Inca went and lived in Mesa Verde it had soon became deserted maybe because of migration.Most people had lost opportunities and went somewhere else such as New Mexico.

These discoveries tell us a lot about the cultures, discoveries, religion, and disappearance of these people. We know many things about each civilization. We know that the Inca have no system of writing or archives for history. They recorded everything in knots in colored strings called quipus. Too record everything in such a way makes some of our accomplishments obsolete. Even now we cannot figure out what the quipus mean.        We know exactly how the Puebloans lived. We know that they lived in pit houses and used atlatl. We would not have known that if we did not discover these artifacts. We also know that some of them were amazing stone masons because they carved their houses into side of the mountains. We have not yet discovered why they made the move into the mountains. We also know that they were very skilled with pottery through the shards that we have found.        We know that the Plavopetri lived in a planed city. This is significant because this is the first planned city that archaeologists have found to date. It was found 40 years ago by a british archaeologist. If he did not discover this then we would not have the wealth of knowledge about the Greeks that we do now. It also offers insights into the Mycenaen society which disapeared without a trace...or so we thought.        These discoveries have added to our stores of knowledge and made us curious. It makes us wonder what else is out there. It makes us ask 'What else could be burried under the sand, or the ground, or in a mountains?' Without asking questions we would know a lot less about the world. Discovering new things leads us to asking new questions. Asking new questions leads us to new answers.

They learn about the history of civilizations that have been gone for centeries. The ancient Inca of Peru, the four corners region of North America, and the lost Greek city are places an archeologists would love to uncover the mysteries of their history.       The Incas had no alphebet or system of writing. This makes it hard for historians to learn and study. Art, architecture, religion, argriculture, government, transportation, and way of life still lives on. This has helped them learn about the Incas who have been gone for almost a hundred years. Old stories were also written down by the Spaniards and Europeans. Ancient Peru's textiles and cloting did survive the rain and sun. Archeologists did learn that the Spaniards did kill of the Incas.       Mesa Verde national park  is by the four corners of New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. These people were the Anasazi, which is translates into 'the ancient ones' from the still thriving Navaho heritige. Puebloans were the first to settle in Mesa Verde. The were known as basketmakers because this was their talent. Faming and pottery was also their spelilty. The modern mavahos still keep this terdition going. Their poplulation incresed during A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 called the Classic PEriod. Later the cliff dwelers moved into New Mexico and Arizona.       The lost city of Greece have given us many secrests. Archeologists spend their life searching for the awnser. But he secrets of Atlantis still hasn't been found. Marine geologists found the 'sunken settlement' a while back. 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.', quotes Dr. Jon Henderson, a professer of underwater archeology at the Universtiy of Nottingham. It is told to be a myth but acheologists want to find the awnser. Is Atlanits a real forgotten Civilization?       Archeologists devote their life to finding the mystery of ancient civilizations arouond the world. The ancient Inca of Peru,the cliff dwellers city of Mesa Verde, and the lost city of Atlantis are places where archeologists would dream to learn the secrest of. Archeologists are devoted people who are seeking information to incite people around the world on ancient civilizations.

That shows how people used to keep records and how smart people were. They ruled part of South America at one time. Archaeologists found ruins of buildings, and gold and silver, pottery, and artifacts made from stone.         The puebloans for more than 700 years lived in Mesa Verde. Instead of hunting the puebloans farmed and gathered food. they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages built on mesa tops or in cliff recesses. the people learned to make pottery and how to make bow and arrows, and more efficient weapons for hunting than a spear thrower.          The Pavlopteri were important because they found a underwater city. They found buildings, courtyards, main streets, and rock cut tombs, and religious structures. they also found shards of pottery. They found ceramics dating back to the stone age. That is important because you can study the ceramics to see what the tools were like back then and learn some things about them.the site of the city takes up 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. Dr. Jon Henderson says that there is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. It was discovered by a british oceanographer about 40 years ago. It was only this year that marine archaeologists were able properly survey the ruins. They say that the site was never reoccupied.

That is why they are so important it helps us learn about the past and how it was to live during those times and what they used.

These discoveries have a lot to learn from. It tells you how the people lived and what the enviornment around them was like.               First I will tell you about the Inca. The Inca were people who lived near the Spaniads and lived in Peru. They had no formal alphabet like us today. When the first Europens saw their strings to keep records, they had no idea what they were meant for. The Inca had a very different way of living than the Europens. The Inca couldn't even clearly communicate with the Spaniards because they couldn't understand each others language. But they would figure out what they were trying to tell each other. The rest of our knowlage behind the Inca were from their artifacts.                Now I will tell you about the Puebloans. The Puebloans were a group of people who lived in North America before the Europens discoved that land. Archeologists called these people Anasazi which meant 'the ancient ones'. The first Puebloans setteled in Mesa Verde. They lived in pithouses, in very small villages. They learned a lot of things like how to make pottery and how to use a bow and arrow.                I will also tell you about the 'Lost Greek City'. The Lost Greek City is a site of 30,000 square meters and was consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It was discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago. This site is near Neapolis in Greece.

'pithouses.. the most relaxing thing you can every be on, or better yet the bestest house you can ever live in.' ' Not.. i shall not let you take his offer!' a voice from a distances. ' The best house you can every have is Cliff dweller' said a coyboys. ' But you have misktaken here this is no cowboy sir.'                           PITHOUSES       Pithouses are just dug up pits that is transform into a house, most likey to care care of a family, this pithouse was invented when from people skills and crafts. This houses has a opening on its top for the smoke from you fire to go out, this house is also very helpful for you nd youe family, this house my look small but it is very likely to get everything in go shape. People lived in Pithouse from about A.D 550 to A.D 750, as settled agriculture began. The pithouse is design by a few feet sunken into the ground, and it also has a four corner supported the roof. Pithouses are los similar to kiva, nother type of house.                  CLIFF DWELLERS      Cliff dwellers are specially made for coyboys. Ever since local cowboys reported the high cliffs in 1880s, some of the archealogist have understanf why these cowboys live on the high cliffs. The structures are evidence of a society that, is over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed then on to generation to generation. This houssing design was used from A.D 1100 to A.D 1300. Ancestral Puebloan were heirs of a vigorous civilizations, whose accomplishments in community living and the atrs rank among the finest expressions of human cultures in North America. This house was most used for the people who like traveling a lot.               KIVA      A kive is somewhat similar to a pithouse, The thing is that the house is mostly above ground level. The kiva was specially builded for the church people. The kiva contains 1 ventilator, 2 bench, 3 air conditions, 4 fire-pits, 5 sipapu, 6 pilaster. This type of house is like a get together kind of thing, this house is also used for rich people in there time, and the houses is very uesful. Kivas were gathering places and sometimes also places to weave. Pilasters supported a beam-and- mud roofs. Entry was by ladder through a hole in the center of the roof. The small hole in the floor is a sipapu, or symbolic entrance to the underworld. For the Puebloans may have used kivas fro healing rites or to pray fro rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop, so a kiva is mostly a church.             ' Ahh indeed' said the cowboys   ' So you sir should try and get a pithouse for you young looking family' sid the man   'Yes... indeed you should get the pithouse' sid the cowboys   As I walked down the dirt road and started to dig my pit for my family.

Also, stories passes on from generation to generation can teach us more about the incas life. Another example is the structures that the puebloans built are evidence that there was a society a long time ago with skills and traditions that got passed on from generation to generation.

The Inca of Peru made knots in colored string called quipus,so they can recorded a calendar to keep count of the live stocks.Each knot meant something but the scientist couldn't figure out. Inca left a lot of clues like art,portrait of their religion, architecture,government,and transportation.The scientists put these pieces together to figure out how In a lived there life.The Spanish soldiers wrote letters and diary of the Inca but they didn't understand there language so most of the letters are not true.The Inca lived in mostly remote and high places.Most of the Inca was buried in high tops so the looters could not find them easily.There body revealed on how they have lived        The Mesa Verde National park showed a spectacular reminder of the ancient culture.One of the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde.They were skill at doing craft and was know as the basketmakers.  They lived in pit house usually built on Mesa tops, and sometimes in cliff recesses.They use pottery to make weapons like an bow and arrow.They left no written record about how they lived.About by the 1300 Mesa Verde was deserted.There was droughts and crop failures.Most of the traveled to Arizona or New Mexico.

Maybe what they used is something that we might use next that is why it is important to learn about different ancients.We know that some old stories were written by the Europeans it is important to know about the stories of Europeans because something in the stories may be important to us maybe not today maybe not tommorow but im sure one day it will. We have to know about the different ancients.Some things that they find are made from stone,pottery,gold, or silver. It may be something that we want to be very careful with or something that may worth alot. It is also important to take records.           It also important to know about this because things change. For example, pottery changed from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drwaings on a white background. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before. soils,forests, and animals were depleted. Some stuff have veen brought to light from beneath the waters of southern Greece.To the shifting sands and the settlesments enclosure in a protected bay, it revealed a world of buildings,courtyards, and main streets.

That is the reason why we should keep the aritfacts found and preserve them so that they can last forever for futue genegrations to see.

Then there's the idea to use knots to keep track of numbers! Then they color coded them to oginize even further.           then you can take the Ancestral Puebloans the used nature to their advantage by digging out homes from the overhanging cliffs for protection       the discovery of the underwater settlment reveals a important part of greek history and inspires more exploation of the seabed                 	DT NNS VBP JJ IN DT RBR PRP VBP IN DT NNS IN VBD IN PRP DT RBR PRP MD VB IN PRP VBP DT NNP IN NN PRP VBD DT NN IN JJ NNS IN VBG CC NNS WDT VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS TO VB WP VBG NNS TO WP CC WP PRP VBZ NNP NNP RB VBZ DT NN TO VB NNS TO VB NN IN NNS .

Most are filled with mystery and discovery, only using hard determination to find it. Using three resources, i will explain how three civilizations came to be discovered and what they discovered while examining.            In the first source, the Acient Inca were examined. The Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet, so they used knots in string to make a kind of alphabet instead. But, because it was so long ago, noone knew how to decode it.            In the second source, the Ancestral Puebloans were examined. Long ago, before european people came to morth america, the Puebloans lives in the four corners of america.            In the third source, the Lost Greek City was examined. Divers explore the city that lay under the waters of southern Greece, maybe a city that inspired Atlantis. This settlement came back 5,000 years, and its fairly in well shape. The water has preserved it for many years, and thats why so many other underwater citys are so well preserved.

The inca lived up high in the andes mountians in peru until about the early 1500's. In source you, it tells you the historians learned alot about the Inca from artifacts. It also says that archeaologists discovered the perserved bodies of some incans in caves, in cliff faces, and in mountian tops. With that being, it is very dangerous to investigate those places. Another thing that source #1 says is that the fall of the Inca was in 1532, when the spaniards murdered the Inca king and took over the empire.       Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago in the four corners region, Source #2, tells us that they lived there for over 700 years. It also says that they built 'elaborate stone communitys... in canyon walls.' Puebloans were very good at pottery, and used a bowrow for hunting, rather then throwing a spear. The people lived in Mese Verde until about A.D. 1200, when many people moved back into the cliffs. It is unknown why they moved there.       Pavlopetri is a sunken settelment that dwells on the ocean floor. Archeaologists belive that this settelment dates back about 5,000 years... thats around the stone age. In the underwater ruins, they found pottery and building also dating back around 5,000 years ago. This town that was found is believed to be greek. Archeaologists are still investaging it.                                                                                   - Abby Bay 	NNS VBP VBN NN IN JJ NNS IN DT NNP , NNP , CC DT NNP NNP NN VBD RP JJ IN DT NNS VBZ IN NN IN IN DT JJ CD NNP NN PRP , PRP VBZ PRP DT NNS VBD NN IN DT NNP IN NNP NNP RB VBZ IN NNS VBN DT VBN NNS IN DT NNS IN NNS , IN NN NNS , CC IN JJ NNP NNP WDT VBG , PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB DT NNP NNP NN WDT NN # CD VBZ VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NNP VBD IN CD , WRB DT NNS VBD DT NNP NN CC VBD RP DT NNP NNP VBD IN CD NNS RB IN DT CD NNS NN , NNP # CD , VBZ PRP IN PRP VBD RB IN IN CD NNP NNP RB VBZ IN PRP VBD JJ NN NNS : IN NN NNP '' NNP VBD RB JJ IN NN , CC VBD DT NN IN NN , RB RB VBG DT NNP NNP NNS VBD IN NNP NNP IN IN NNP CD , WRB JJ NNS VBN RP IN DT NNP NNP VBZ VBN WRB PRP VBD NNP NNP VBZ DT VBN NN IN NNS IN DT JJ NNP NNP JJ IN DT NN VBZ RB IN CD NNS : NNS IN DT NN NNP NNP DT NN VBZ , PRP VBD RB CC NN RB VBG RB IN CD NNS NNP NNP NN WDT VBD VBN VBZ VBN TO VB NNP NNPS VBP RB VBG NNP : NNP NNP

The Inca had no real formal alphabet or writing system, but they still got there needs done. They hunted and farmed to provid ethe basic needs for there families. Some may wonder how we knew these places exsisted well they left behind clues and archaeologists study them closely to find information about them. Some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters who take things form other people.       The Puebloans were around about 1,400 years ago then in A.D. 1200s they moved and left there houses behind. They always made baskets or they were basketmakers, but soon after that farming replaces hunting and farming became there main livelyhood. Last about A.D. 1200s a very large population of Cliff Dwellers took the land over from them.       The Lost Greek city might have just inspired Atlantis myth to come up. Divers Covered 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor and found a ancient town. They found this thanks to shifting sands and the settlements enclosere in a protected bay.

The Incas had a huge deal on where you are now. They lived a very long time ago, dating back to 9,000 years ago.       We don't much about the Incas because we don't have any clue in how to read there language or data, but there are legends, and artifacts. All though some is not easy to get because the Incas were very smart. They didn't want any looters to come so they buried their things on top of moutains.       The Mesa Verde were the first ones to build the modern house. .The houses they made were extraordinary for their time. The house had a firepit with a air deflector. They had a living room with sunk in a few feet under the ground. And they lived in A.D. 550 to A.D.750.       'Atlantis,' Does that name sound familiar? It might have been inspried by the Lost Greek city. The city dates back to 5,000 years ago. The Lost Greek city, though is underground. While they were investigating it, they found the possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall.       Our ancestors taught us so much. They taught us how to build modern houses all the way to preserveing bodies and artifacts. This is why we wouldn't be where we are today with out our ancestors. They have been a huge part of our lives, and will be for many of years to come.

They tell us about are past and how we evolved into the society we have today. we need to be able to know about are past and are past mistakes if we don't want to repeat those mistakes. we can learn so much from are past. by discovering the history of these three ancient cultures we can learn more about how we can improve and move forward.       Finding the history of the Incas can tell us so much. They had no alphabet and no form of writing. yet they managed to survive and thrive. and there empire was so vast it rivaled ancient Rome. so how did they do it with no form of writing or an alphabet? they used quipus. quipus where lots of colorful string with nots in them. that is how they kept track of materials and goods and live stock. and the date. that was how they kept things writin down. the Incas feel when the Spanish murdered the incan king. they where a great agricultural society and we can learn a lot from that and we have. we discover the ways that they farmed and it has helped us improve are farming and learn better ways to farm.        Discovering the history of the Puebloans is also very important. they where once a nomadic people but then the decided to settle and develop a community. learning about there history show's us that evolution is very important and change can be good.they evolved their small houses called pit house into above ground homes with upright walls.they then upgraded there homes again from mud and pole walls to stone.they made better pottery and better ways to farm. looking at what they did can help us move forward too.       And last but not least the discovery of the pavlopetris is important because it is the oldest and biggest submerged site ever to be found. and because it is submerged it hasn't been used by any other culture but the one that made it. this can tell us so much about the people that made it. how they lived and worked and there whole history.       To conclude finding about about the history of all of these different culters is incredibly important because it can help us today in many different ways.

It's because they are curious about how whoever lived there lived and reacted to their surroundings. And also they want to discover artifacts from history that might be important to the rest of the world.       Not all of these discovers or trips have something to discover like he/she might have traveled thousands of miles to get this specific artifact that they researched and when they get there they are surprised to find out that they traveled for no reason. So they travel another thousand miles back home but instead of being happy they are sad and disappointed.        The reason why the Lost City of Atlantis is being explored is because of an ancient myth and archaeologists want to be the one who discover it or be the one to prove it to be real or a lie. So that is why they researched for months and maybe years to find its exact location so they can dive and explore the ocean floor and seabed to see what they can discover.

Some of what i know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history.I know some of the old stories because they were written down by the europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.

The Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, have all had different tools and adaptions. By unlocking the secrets and history behind the artifacts, we can fully understand our past. Let's begin.             The Inca were an advanced group who tied colorful strings together called quipus that recorded time and events. If we can find out what these events are, it might lead us to discovering new things about our world. If we can find out more about our world, our lives could be better and more advanced.            Discoveries made in the Puebloan section of research included kiva and cliff hangers. This helps us find out that they would have had to have special tools and advanced math knowledge to know how to not let it cave in. They had advanced math knowledge that we don't know about and if we learned or if we already know, it could change a few things in history.           Thank you for reading my article on important discoveries.

In today knots were hard to understand. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into colored things the ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.Clues ledt behind byt he Inca form an amazing portrait and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologits and others an piece together details of Inca life.Some of Inca we know come from oral history, stories passed to generation to us. Passing stories was an importna way to preseve a community's history. The reat of their knowledge of the Inca comes from the sited where artifacts are found.As in pottery. stone, gold, and silver. Some of Inca's textiles and clothing are here as well. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts ans sites with the Spaniard's accounts of Inca.The Inca lived high in the andes and may have their own things in life.       The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde it is green in Spanish. They are known as Basketmakers for their haed working and skills.They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlalt, a spear throwner.Between A.D. 1110 and A.D. 1300, during the classic period the population may have reached serveral thousand. It was important to them.The stone wall of large villages are finest ever bulit in mesa verde. Baskets are a mexian tradition to make baskets and collect items for other people.       Lost greek city that have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. A diver explores the sunken settlement the water off southern Greece. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the most myth's the fable of atlantis have brought to light form beneath the waters off southern Greece. There is no now doubt that is the oldest submerged town in the world. We found ceramics dating back to the end of th stone age, which suggest that the settlement was occupied some years ago.More than any other underwater site so far its the greatest to see. Old generations always have knew something was there but we had no idead about the extent of it.

You might find a rare artifact from long ago or maybe even a lost city. If we didn't make new discoveries we wouldn't be as advanced as we are now in this day and age. In the next paragraph I will explain why I believe discoveries about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important.       The Inca, who hail from Peru used colored strings tied into knots to keep track of   things.They didn't have an alphabet to write so you may wonder how we know so much about them. There were many things left behind by the Inca which included artwork representing their religion, transportation, government, way of life, and many more things. We know more because of stories passed down from ancestors, generation after generation. It's important the we know how they lived, why they died out, what they were like so archaeologists go to where they inhabited and take notes/pictures of anything they see.   Another group of people called the Puebloans inhabited Mesa Verde which is now   a national park. These people were also known as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'. The Puebloans advanced in many ways when they came to their new found home, an example would be that they made bow and arrows instead of having spear throwers. This invention made hunting easier for them. They were also getting into farming, this made them hunt less because they spent more time in the feilds.       The last group of people I'm going to mention are the Pavlopetri. Long ago their   city sank. This city was in ancient Greece, not the ancient Greece we all know of but even longer ago than that. Recent discoveries with hi-tech underwater equiptment made it possible for archaeologists to dive down and see what life was like there. Although we have no idea why it sank, we have many theories.       The art, the architecture, the way they lived is something we can use now so we   don't make mistakes that they may have made. If I do say so myself, I find this interesting. Honestly, where would we be today without learning this, without making discoveries? Probably living in caves wearing animal fur to cover us up.

They contributed culture, language, and acrchutechture into our modern day society.                               The Inca had no official language or alphabet but they used methods of knotting strings called quipus to record the calender and to keep count of livestock. The Inca had left clues of religion, art, agriculture, government and transportation. How do we know about the Inca? We know most of what we learn about them from stories or legends being passed down. Some of the stories we know of today come from the Spaniards who did not speak the Inca language but described what they saw. Some artifacts we know of come from the ruins of buildings and graves of the dead. The Inca had lived in the Andes mountains where it was difficult to reach. From what the Inca had done in their civilazation, has contributed to the future. They lived in the mountains, later on, other uses for protection has been used. Language has devolped differntly, art has evolved, transportation and our calender may had follewed a pattern of the Inca as well. Therfore, Inca society has influenced modern day as well.                   The Publoans had influenced society as well but in different ways. The Puebloans lived in pithouses from A.D 550 to A.D 750. Agriculture then began for their civilization. The mesa-top was suitable for farming. They were known for bascket making  and their skill for that craft. From beind nomadic they began to have a more settled life style. They farmed, hunted and gathered. They created weaponds such as the bow and arrow, and for more accuracy the atlatl, a spear thrower. Later on, their population multiplied. They have contributed alot to society by having agriculture, hunting and weapondry. Inconclusion their life style had been used later on as well, people created more advanced weaponds, farming and crafts.                   The lost city is more seen as a lovely scenery to live in. There were courthouses, gardens, courtyards, main streets, shards of pottery and religious sculptures were discovered. Marine geologists are still trying to determine why this city sank. Theories want to show that it sank due to earthquakes, or a tsunami. The site stretches 30,000 square meters above the ocean ground. The sight was founded only forty years ago by a British oceanographer. Therfore, the Lost city had contriuted architecture, landscaping, and crafts to society.                   In conclusion, the three civilizations of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavopetri have influenced the modern day culture of farming, architecture, and crafts. Without these civilizations we might not have had the arts and buildings we have today.

The wars we have ,like WWI, was repeated not less than  20 years later. By finding out what happens to these ancient societies we try to stop what happened to them happening to us. we have archaeologists to find out how to stop it,but it won't help.

219	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	NR			F	469725	8	11062107	Y	53045	 The Past       Have you ever wondered what the past was like? How we       developed into what we are now? Well I have, and that is why I       am typing this report so I can tell you all about it.       To begin with, I would like to tell you about the ancient       Inca of Peru. Surprising, they did not have a formal alphabet or       system of writing. Instead they made knots in colored strings to       record the calendar and to keep count of their livestock. The       first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed at their system of        quipus. How did they run such a large empire with just strings to       keep records. No one today even knows what the knots mean.       Since we have little record about the Inca most of what we       know comes from stories that were passed from generation to       generation. We only know some stories though because the       Europeans who arrived in the empire described the Inca in       diaries and letters. The rest of our knowledge comes from       artifacts and other things they may have left behind such as       pottery, gold, silver, or clothing.       Secondly, I would like to explain to you the history of the       ancient Puebloans. Mesa Verde National Park has a great       reminder of the culture. These ancient people have been called       the Anasazi or 'the ancient ones', Puebloans or 'village       dwellers', or Cliff Dwellers. They are also known as       Basketmakers because they have a skill for crafting. Agriculture       began to replace hunting and gathering and they lived in small       villages and sometimes in cliff recesses.  Also Pithouses       became very popular buildings and their population multiplied.       These people were excellent at building, they were very crafty,       and they were skillful.       Lastly, I would like to inform you about the Lost Greek       city. The secrets of this lost city may have inspired one of the       world's most enduring myths.  The fable of Atlantis has been       brought to light beneath the waters off southern Greece. It has       been explored by many archaeologist and marine geologists.  It       dates back to 5,000 years. It is thought to believe that is is the       oldest submerged town in the world and it was there long before       the classical Greece. Atlantic takes up about 30,00 square meter       of ocean floor and was consumed into the sea about 1000 BC.        Well I told you that I would tell you about the past and I       have. No longer do you have to wonder what it was like and       how we got to where we are. This report told you everything       you needed to know and more. Did you learn as much as I did?

First, the discovery of the Inca civilization was important because it helped us learn about their history and preserve it.It also tells us or explains how life was back then for these people and what they did during the time of 1438-1532.Not only does it provide us with information on their way of life, it gives us a way to preserve it through stories and even maybe art.Although getting the information was a hard task, it was well worth it.            Second, the discovery of the Puebloans was important because it tells us about their culture and what they did about 1,400 years ago. It gives us insights on what they did to flourish here and their techniques on surviving.We also learn how they built their houses and what they used for their crafting.From these information, we can probably even use some of their ideas to help us invent or come up with other things that'll help us in life.            Lastly, the ancient city of the Mycenaean city was an important discovery because it helped us with many things.It gave us something very big to discover and learn about the under water city that was once a settlement.With the discovery of it, we made new technology for underwater discovery and learned about how the city probably sank.We also learned what they built and what they used in crafting pots,buildings,statues and many more.Most importantly, we learned how they lived and what they probably did during the time before the city sank.            In conclusion, the discoveries of these ancient civilations were important in our lives and maybe even in our histories 	IN PRP$ NNS IN JJ NN NNS , EX VBP CD IN JJ IN VBD JJ CD VBP DT NNP NN , NNP , CC DT NNP NNP NNP , DT NN IN DT NNP NN VBD JJ IN PRP VBD PRP VB IN PRP$ NN CC VB JJ RB VBZ PRP CC VBZ WRB NN VBD RB RB IN DT NNS CC WP PRP VBD IN DT NN IN CD RB VBZ PRP VB PRP IN NN IN PRP$ NN IN NN , PRP VBZ PRP DT NN TO VB PRP IN NNS CC RB RB JJ NN DT NN VBD DT JJ NN , PRP VBD RB JJ NNP NNP , DT NN IN DT NNPS VBD JJ IN PRP VBZ PRP IN PRP$ NN CC WP PRP VBD IN CD NNS NNP NNP VBZ PRP VBZ IN WP PRP VBD TO VB RB CC PRP$ NNS IN JJ RB VBP WRB PRP VBP PRP$ NNS CC WP PRP VBD IN PRP$ JJ DT NN , PRP MD RB RB VB DT IN PRP$ NNS TO VB PRP VB CC VB RP IN JJ NNS IN JJ NN PRP IN NNP NNP , DT JJ NN IN DT NNP NN VBD DT JJ NN IN PRP VBD PRP IN JJ JJ NN PRP NN RB JJ TO NN CC NN IN DT NN NN NN WDT VBD RB DT JJ DT NN IN PRP , PRP VBD JJ NN IN NN NN CC VBD IN WRB DT NN RB JJ RB VBD WP PRP VBD CC WP PRP VBD IN NN NNS , NNS , NNS CC JJ JJ RB , PRP VBD WRB PRP VBD CC WP PRP RB VBD IN DT NN IN DT NN NNP NNP NN , DT NNS IN DT JJ NNS VBD JJ IN PRP$ NNS CC VB RB IN PRP$ NNS

I think it's a good idea because then i feel like a ginnypig testing out the website for them. I don't mind but i guess it would be kinda boaring. It would also be a good idea because then teachers and parents can see what you would put on the website. Writing an article on the website would help the students when they are working on a project, doing homework, or maybe just to study for a test/quiz. This website would help the student a lote. Well if kids or teacher would write articals everyday.               I personoly would use this website because it would help me a lot. i would be able to help kids out by writing articles and they would also help me. This website would be better for kids because they wouldn't have to take notes in class, wouldn't have to cheat, and they wouldn't have to stress. All they would have to do is go on-line and study or maybe if they wanted they could maybe take notes or something like that.            i like this website!!!!!

Well because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in 1532. I learned that the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language very well.some Inca stories were legends rather than history.    Lost City Of Atlantis:people believed that there was a city that was barred under water bu we don't know exactly what happened.Some say myth some say true but we don't know.The secrets o the lost city have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths.

The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing . By studying these clues, archaeolojists andothers can piece together details of Inca life . Some of the old stores were written by Eropeans who arrived in the empire in 1532 . The ones that would go visit were Spanish soldiers and priest . The Apaniards did notspeak the inca language well . They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their desacriptions might not be accurate . As in many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone,pottery,gold or silver . Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings . Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today . They provived the best idea of all about life inperu before and during Inca rule . They write down and photograph any artifacts they find, and note the exact positions in whick they find them. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record . Tell fall of the Inca is easy to date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and tookover the empire . The area where they lived hadlong been inhabited by differnent peoples . this has halped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them . But it also makes the job of the archaeologists are expert mountains . They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start to work . Anything they find has to be carried down the mountain for a study . The coldmountains act like a gaint freezer .   Then in the late A.D, 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away . They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow,a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower .   They built the houses one against another in long curving rows,often with a pithouse or two in frint . Farming accounted for more of their diet than before, and much mesa-top land was clearded foragriculture . 	DT JJ NNS TO VB DT NNP VBD VBN IN PRP MD VB JJ NN VBG NNS TO VB NNS .

They have made an amazing impact on life as it is today. Without these ancient civilizations , our world today could have been very different.                The Inca have done a good job with conserving their artifacts by chosing what type of material they used. If they wanted something to last a long time , they chose rock material like gold, stone, etc. They also used some knot technology. This helped them predict the weather for their crops and their harvest. As they lived in the high mountain area , they also had to adapt to the extremely cold temperatures that were handed to them in their daily lives. This  meant that they had to kill animals with fur and skin them to use their fur as a  , what we call today , sweater. The high mountain areas also helped them by adapting to lthe liow amount of oxygen that was presented into their everyday life.                 The puebloans also built many good homes as well. They built their homes underground about 4 feet below the surface. This meant that less heat could enter in the hot sunny days in mid-August. But when the heat went away in the winter they use the fire-pit as warmth. Although this was a smart idea, it also had its bad times. In august   this would be to cook their meals. When winter came, smoke filled the village and left some habitants walls on their homes charcoal black.                  The sunken city also has a great impact in our lives today. It shows us that although we can live by the sea , it can be unpredictable for us to know when the city will submerge underwater. These people's acietn artifacts showed that they lived in a big city habitated by many. Their artwork shows how their lifestyles. Along with this shows how they made ceramics. Many people have tried to guess how the city was submerged. Many have guessed that a giant earthquake hit the city which caused a giant tsunami to hit the city and make it look like the ocean's snack.                 All of these  have made in impact on today's world. We have taken notice of these cultures and their rulers behind it. Many arts today have also had smiliraities with the art from back then. They've made an amazing impact on today's world and will also make an impact on the future.

The Inca civilization might have been vary different in some ways like how they lived and how their survived. They might have known about some things that we may not know like on things that they used in their regular lives.                   Today we still don't know on how they spoke or communicated because they had no system of writing or no formal alphabet. This left historians questioning themselves because they made knots and we still don't know what they mean or what they symbolize.The civilizations  left behind art, architecture, transportation and their ways of life. Some of the things that they left behind answered some of our questions.                   All civilizations have made good homes. For example,the Pueblonians made and lived in cliff dwellings for less than 100 years but later their home became deserted. The Inca civilization had to be careful because they lived in high ground close to mountains. The people that lived in Atlantis were very close to the sea. their climate might have been warm, but it was a dangerous place to live in the middle of the sea.                 The sunken city has been one of the worlds greatest mysteries because it has gotten all of us to wonder what really happened and how it all went down. Some people have dedicated their lives to try and explore and to try and answer unsolved questions.Some people say that the lost city of atlantis might have been swallowed by the sea by like tsunamis and never to be found.             These great finds are good for today because it can show us if these were a myth or something that really happened and that have been passed down by generation to generation.  I think that eventually we will be able to answer all of these questions and once we do it will it will be a big impact in our lives 	DT NNP NNS VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NNP NN MD VB VBN JJ JJ IN DT NNS IN WRB PRP VBD CC WRB PRP$ NNP NNP MD VB VBN IN DT NNS WDT PRP MD RB VB IN IN NNS IN PRP VBD IN PRP$ JJ NNP NNP PRP RB VBP RB VB IN WRB PRP VBP CC VBN IN PRP VBD DT NN IN VBG CC DT JJ NNP NNP VBD NNS VBG PRP IN PRP VBD NNS CC PRP RB VBP RB VB WP PRP VBP CC WP PRP VBP NNS VBN IN NN , NN , NN CC PRP$ NNS IN NNP NNP IN DT NNS IN PRP VBD IN VBN DT IN PRP$ NNP NNP NNS VBP VBN JJ NNP NNP NN , DT NNPS VBD CC VBN IN NN NNS IN JJR IN CD NNS CC JJ PRP$ NN VBD NNP NNP NNP NN VBD TO VB JJ IN PRP VBD IN JJ NN NN TO NNP DT NNS IN JJ IN NNP VBD RB JJ TO DT NNP PRP$ NN MD VB VBN NN , CC PRP VBD DT JJ NN TO VB IN DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NN NN VBZ VBN CD IN DT NNS JJS NNS IN PRP VBZ VBN DT IN PRP TO VB WP RB VBD CC WRB PRP DT NN NNP NNP NNS VBP VBN PRP$ NNS TO VB CC VB CC TO VB CC VB VBN JJ NNS VBP IN DT NN NN IN NNS MD VB VBN VBN IN DT NN IN IN NNS CC RB TO VB NNP NNP JJ NNS VBP JJ IN NN IN PRP MD VB PRP IN DT VBD DT NN CC NN IN RB VBD CC IN VBP VBN VBN RP IN NN TO NNP PRP VBP IN RB PRP MD VB JJ TO VB DT IN DT NNS CC RB PRP VBP PRP MD PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS

There are three important discoveries on lost civilizations. Those are: The Incas, The Puebloans, and The Pavlopetri.Each civilization is important in their own way.             The Inca discovery was important because we can learn their ways of life. It is important to know their ways of life because we can use their mentality of union to unify ourselves. We can also learn how the Incas died. It is important to learn how the Incas died because we can prevent our death by eliminating the possibility that we will die like they did. We can learn about the rules they used to control society. It is important to know the rules they used to control society because we might be able to use the same rules.              The Puebloans civilization discovery was important because we can learn from their skill and craft. It would be nice if we could establish their skill of crafting because they aquired the bow and arrow. Their civilization discovery is also important because we can learn, but improve, their architectural ways. The Puebloans were great architects. They had great buildings that we could use now. This discovery was also important because we could use nature at our advantage like they did. If we used nature better we might be able to get more out of it.             The Palvopetri discovery was important because it was the oldest submerged town in the world. There were older sunken sites but none were so pre-planned. It was also important because of its uniqueness. In terms of size and wealth it was extremely unique. It is also important because it was most likely to be considered a a planned civilization. The fact that this was a planned civilization explains that the Palvopetri people were smart perfectionists.               All discoveries have been important. These three are some of the most important discovered civilizations yet.The Incas Civilization was important for its ways of life. The Puebloans was important for its skill and craft. The Palvopetri was important for being the oldest submerged civilization.

The discoveries range from the discoveries of ancient temples to pieces of broken pottery. These can portray ideas of religion, government, languages, and ways of lifestyle. These items can help archeologists to learn about their life, and in turn, our past.                 The Incan civilization has many different artifacts which have helped archeologists learn about our past and attract tourists alike. The scientists can use the information collected from the artifacts to learn about other civilizations as well. Tourists can improve a country's wealth and cultural diversity. The Incas and their architecture, art, and government system can draw tourists and archeologists alike.                                                                                                                                                                  The Pueblo civilization contains many important artifacts. These range from primitive pithouses to weaving tables. The weaving tables can show us how clothing looked and was made during that time. The pithouses showed us that they should not take over makeover jobs. These people have many different interesting ways of life, and their artifacts help us to learn more about them.                  The Pavlopetri people had many interesting artifacts in their sunken city, the fabled 'Atlantis.' Its remains show the architecture, arts, tools, and lifestyle of Greece before the Classical Era. These include pottery, temples, tombs, and more. All of these different items make up this fascinating archeological dig.                  The different items in the three civilizations varied widely, but their purpouse to us was always the same; to help us learn of our past. From the pithouses of the Pueblo to the Pavlopetri pottery, each artifact tells a story. Every arifact is unique, and they are truly really neat.

Their sites were remarkable.        The Mesa Verde National Park was a home to many settlers. They built their communities amongst the canyon walls. The first Puebloans that lived there were know as the basketmakers. They lived in pithouses.        The lost Greek city was also very important to discover. It remained from 2800-1200 B.C and covers 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. The exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, and religious structures. They found a possible megaron, and that suggests that the town was a previous elite. Marine geologists thought the settlement sank because of an earthquake of tsunami.

All though they may not be the same group of people, or have the same story, they all have one thing in common- they all contain important information on why we are who we are today. These civilizations contain facts about how we as humans have grown physically, and mentally. Although it may not be easy to find, these ancient cities have more information than we can see.                                    First, much of what we know about the people of these ancient cities had been found in simple pieces of clay, stone, or even rocks. For example, the Incas people left some pieces of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. They also found these items in the graves.  This might tell us that they used those items daily, so they possibly made their homes out of them. Also, finding those items in the graves could mean they believed in an afterlives. For another example, the Puebloans were found to have houses of stone, discovered with ruins of stacked stone. Also, some baskets that were found reveal that because they did not use pottery, they did not pay much attention to craft. There are so many things found in only a piece of stone sometimes.                                                                                                                                                  Secondly, a large portion of what we learn from past cities is from stories and sights passed down through the generations. For example, the Puebloans were the first cliff dwellers, but we know this because the cowboys told stories of them to the people. For another example, archeologists often check with the Spaniards for what they know about the Incas from their ancestors, possibly by telling stories or myths. Also, the Lost city has always been known as 'Atlantis', and this was a story that has never been confirmed until recently. Stories and myths play a large part in unlocking the past of ancient civilizations.               Finally, sometimes geography helps us learn more of the cities we know little about. For example, the waters surrounding the lost city in Greece have helped to move the sand and reveal artifacts. For the Inca, the cold mountain tops and cliffs have prevented the looters from taking and ruining history to be discovered and preserving the information for archaeologists. geography plays a large part in our history that is being discovered.               Lastly, it is all because of these many things that we know where we come from and how we have learned to adapt and grow. Without the information we have learned from ancient cities such as the Puebloans, the Inca, and the Lost City, we would not understand why things are the way they are today. We cannot learn anything more without the help of our past relatives.

The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabrt or system of writting.They did not leave archives for historians to study.The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to recrord the calender to keep a count of livestock.The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could have a huge empire using strings to keep records.Archaeologist have found many ancient quipus,but today no one knows what the knots mean.        The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D 550.They are known as baskrtmakers for there skill at the craft.Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as ther main livelihood.        Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of the archaeologist and marine geologist and known as the pavlopertri,the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of homers heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented.        The site,which staddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern pelopronnesse is belived to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.Althogh discoverd by british oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologist,adided by digital technolagy,wre able to properly survey the ruins                                                                      	WRB VBD DT NNS WDT VBP VBN VBN IN DT NNP , DT NNS , CC DT NN RB JJ WRB TO DT NN PRP NNP NNP NN NNP IN NNP VBD DT JJ NN CC NN IN JJ NN RB VB NNS IN NNS TO NNP NNP VBD NNS IN VBN NNS VBN NN TO VB DT NN TO VB DT NN IN NNP JJ NNPS TO VB DT NNP VBD VBN IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN VBG NNS TO VB JJ NN VBN JJ NN VBZ , CC NN DT NN VBZ WP DT NNS NNP NNP JJ NNP NNP VBD IN NNP NNP IN JJ CD VBP VBN IN NNS IN EX NN IN DT JJ JJ , PRP VBD VBG TO VB DT RBR VBN NN IN JJ VBN VBG CC VBG IN JJR NN NNP NNP IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN CC NN NN CC VBN IN DT NN , DT NN NN VBZ RB DT CD NNS TO DT NN IN NNS VBZ CC IN NNS IN NN CC NN IN NN VBZ NNP DT NN , WDT NNS CD JJ NNS IN JJ NN IN DT NN NN VBZ VBN TO VB VBN VBN IN DT NN IN CD JJ NN IN JJ NN DT CD NNS RB , PRP VBD RB DT NN IN NN NN , VBD IN JJ NN , NN JJ TO RB NN DT NNS

The Incas had been defeated by the Romans in 1532. We would be able to figure out the Romans battle strategy and plans. we would be able to use there battle formations in our own wars. Not to mention that the Romans took over most of Europe at one point.       Wouldn't you be interested  in learning the past about your country. learn what your ancestors did back in the day. You would know the Incas lived in the same places as monks. That the Puebloans fled mesa Verde to be with there own kin. Or how about a lost Greek city that has been submerged underwater for more than 5,000 years!       Now think about our economy, Global Warming. back then , they did not have to worry. they did not make carbon footprint. No, they did everything the old fashion way. By hand, not by robots and machines. People are just getting lazier in the years.       older civilizations will always be important to us. we will not always succeed  but we will learn from our mistakes. we can leave a message so others wont make the same mistakes. Like getting beaten in battle because of a strategy. Or learning something new can make changes. These discoveries could possibly help our economic goals. That is why discovering older civilizations is important.

The Ancient Inca have been found in Peru, Ancestral Puebloans have been found, and most excitingly a new sighting of the lost city of Atlantis was found off the coast of Greece. Recently archeaologists have may discoveries of these sightings.                 First off there are the Inca found in Peru. An ancinet sighting has been found in Peru but archeaologists are having trouble learnign about their way of life.The Inca did not keep any records in a form of alphabet or writing system but only knots and colorful string. Archeaologists know that these were used to record crop growing. There is knowone that we know of that can translate these knotted strings. Other ways we know about the Inca is from some of the stories passed downfrom older generations. Some of these stories were also written down by Europeans who had arrived. Sadly, some of these stories were rather legends than history. Another problem archeaologists face is that this sighting, as well as many others, have been looted long before. The ancient Inca still lay as a mystery in our hands.                 A group known as the Ancestral Puebloans lived in North America before Europens had showed up. They lived in the Mesa Verde for over 700 years. This group was known as 'Basketmakers' for their skill and and weaving. They were once nomads but soon became farmers and begn to settle. They lived in houses called pithouses. They aslo have found out about bows and arrows which quickly replaced throwing spears. After their population grew they began to make mud houses with walls above ground. Even later after that theyu began to make stone buildings up to two or three stories high. The Peubloans later moved back to the cliffsides. knowone knows the reason for sure about why they made this move.                 The last source is about the Greek city which is most commonly known as 'Atlantis'. Atlantis has been mentioned many times in different books, but recently archaeologists have found an underwater settlement that has most likely been identified as Atlantis. This settlement dates back about 5,000 years ago. Divers have found buildings, courtyards, sidewalks, and religious structures. There are many different theories anout why the city sank but the most agreed on theory is that a sea level chango occured or ground subsidence. It was also predated about the same time Plato wrote his book about Atlantis.                  These three sightings bring up interesting and important event changes in our modern day archeaologists lives. This has been a great find and can reveal old myths and legends from the past. I think the significant finding of Atlantis is the most interesting find of the three.

Well the Ancient Inca, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, and the Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets are all mysterious in their own ways. they are all different in their own ways and yet equally interesting. In the following paragraphs I will give information of all sites and answer some educational questions.      The Ancient Inca of Peru, had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They also didn't leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots with colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of live stock. Since now one knows how to read the yarn patterns that they used, we don't really know exactly what they mean. Understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery. The rest of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind. Yet some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. Some of the Inca's lived high in the Andes where looters couldn't reach. Which was goof for the historians.      About 1,400 years ago, before Europeand explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. 	NNP PRP DT NN IN DT NN NN .

Clues left behind by the Inca have told us all we know about there way of life. Artifacts and clues are the most reliable sourses but stories that have been passed down from generation to generation have been somewhat of a help.     The Mesa verde people lived about 1,400 years ago in North America. Some lived in little hut things that they made and some were cliff dwellers that lived in the cliffs and hills. They had fire in the summer that was mainly for cooking and in winter it helped them through the harsh cold weather.      Archaeologists have discovered some lost ruines of a city lived in long ago. The city is located in Neapolis, Greese. They found lost artifacts like ceramic pots, walls of buildings, and other things like that. They still dont know for sure what happened to the city to make in sink but their theorys are that sea levels changed and earthquakes or tsunami's may have accured. This find inspired Atlanis. Atlantis is a myth in which there is a sunkin city called Atlantis. Atlantis is a myth but its a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.

But it also made the work of the studiers more chalenging because they had to climb very high mountains, dig thourgh a cave in order to find a villiage, or a village might be on a mountain side.                   So i already told you about why the inca are so important and what they found that can unravel some of there past and there empire. No i'm going to tell you about the achient puebloans. Now before farming they were big time nomads and if you don't know what they are nomads are people who would hunt and gather vegies or fruit and once they basicly cleaned the place out or untill the end of the season they would get the heck out of dodge. Now you might think why would they do that right? well like i originally said they didn't know how to farm to regrow the stuff that they cleared. But once there was faming the nomadic way became absolite. And that's what happened to the Puebloans they began to farm and they stopped in Mesa Verde (spanish for Green Table).   so anyways the Puebloans lived in Pithouses which wee hand built Just like any other shelters exept if your a hermit and lived in some cave or a tree but anyways the pithouses would include a living room, a fire pit, an antechamber to store stuff in, and a sipapu a passage to the underworld. oh and also Puebloan means 'Village Dwellers'. But by 1000 A.D. the Puebloans had swiched to stone building and they built huge homes with so 50 rooms.                     Now the peple around 1200 A.D. made a move to the cliffs of mesa verde The reason they made this move nobody knows but we do have a few possiblities they could of moved for deffense reasons or maybe because of religous reasons but what ever the reason or maybe there is a few elements in the mix but regardless there was a rise to the cliff dewlers and they became the most famous. The first people to spot the dewlings were local coyboys when they were hiking (that's just what i'm guessing'. Studiers of the people have sought to find out why they lived this way. the cliff dwllers built there homes over the side of a hanging cliff what they normally built with was sandstone that they shapped in to about the size of a loaf of bread. There were underground Kivas which were basicly churches. and rooms about 6 feet by 8feet which would probely be enough for two to three people. the cliff dewlers only lived in there homes for about a hundred years by 1300 A.D. Mesa Verde was desserted many think it's because either droughts or they used up all of there resources ffor food and materila to build with.                  Alright so i had a very very long explanation about the people of Mesa Verde now the next people there not an achient people but there a modern greek Srchaeologist and Marine Geologist. but they Studied they Achient place of atlantis and they found out some awesome things like that it was the oldest submerged town. and they found mainstreets, buildings, and othe things. read more about them in a Wikipedia Article or something.

Knowing the difference between ancinet civilizations are important. Characteristics of civilizations vary depending on where they live. Its important to have a general idea on how they lived at the location they were found. You can tell a lot about a civilization just by the region they live in.       Its also important to know a little bit about every civilization so you can compare and contrast others. Such as how mountain civilizations vary from mountains from one country to mountains from another. This way you can tell if those two groups were similar or even the same.       Another important thing is to know where it came from and what happened to it. Knowing what happened to a dead civilization would make it much easier to find the remains of a city or remains of the people themselves. Discoveries like that could tell archaeologists all about them, without having to do very much.       The last great reason to know about these civilizations is artifacts. It is very important to know what these ancient civilizations made, and how they influenced the production of materials today. Such as how the Puebloans weaved baskets and how they made their houses out of stone. These ideas had to come from somewhere. The regions in which they lived may still look similar to how they did back then, just because their ideas and beliefs have been passed down.

In the second source it says ' another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Why did they make this move? We don't know.' That is a prime example of us discovering ancient stuff but we still don't know what happened or from the example why they did something. Another reason why I know that we don't know everything about our discoveries is in the 3rd source it says that 'Less than 1% of the world's oceans floors have ever been surveyed.' Again there is another example of us not knowing about one of our discoveries. Why I think that us discovering these is important even though we haven't completly discovered what happened it is a start and where there is a start there has to be an end just like what happened to these civilizations, which give us the knowledge that there is more than we think there might be, and more things that we will probably discover in our lifetime. Another reason why they are important is that we have learned more about the history of earth even if there isn't writings there is still archetecture and art.

Without the information we would be almost completely clueless on whatever happened to the tribes in South America and we would probably say that nothing ever happened. These discoveries also contributed to the origination of a alpahbet, calendar, and possibly even more modern things that we use. We have also discovered many valuable artifacts made out of precious metals like gold and silver. The point is that without these ancient discoveries our world would definetly not function the same and these discoveries were very usefull to our inventions and even our life.

In this article im going to be telling you exactly why they are, Using these three sources: Source #1 'Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past,' Source #2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' and finally Source #3 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets.'            Archaeologists learned alot about the history of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, by finding artifacts and historic sights. In Source #1 'Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets oth the Past,' There were some examples on why finding and learning these things are so important. Without knowing these things we wouldnt know how the way of life was back then, and how much weve changed since then, we have something to compare us to. In the passage it says, 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life.'            In Source #2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' there were examples on why finding artifacts, and history about the tribes are important also. In the passage it talks about how Puebloans florished in there village as basket makers, and hunters. We wouldnt have known that if archaeologist had'nt of studied them, and found artifacts. 'Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1800s, archaeologists have sought to understand these people's lives.' Wiht that said even if you arent an archaeologist you can still help of give information you found to help.            Source #3 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets,'  Is a great source for examples on this subject. With most if not all of this civalization under water, it is quite hard to learn, and see to find different artifacts to tell the world about. In the pasage it talks about how without this we wouldnt have very much prrof to back up the myth Atlantis which very much of the world has been going on about for years. here is an example from the passage, ' The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' Thats a big discovery if you ask me.            All of this said, The discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are all very important to students, techers, and even the world.

Although some of it was hard to get because they did not leave any artifacts to cover in the empire, but the scientist saw the mountians as giant freezers and they saw that the bodies and anyother facts or clues that were there were perfectly stored. They said that the bodies that were stored there were so well intact and so well kept that they just could scan them and find out how they died and how they lived in the empire. And I think the discoveries were very important because now we can see that there way of life was alot different than ours. As in the scientists found knots tied in string and they discovered that the knots kept up with their livestock and they were also used as a calander. so the discoveries show us how much their society differs from ours in the 20th century.

Making discoveries about civilizations helps us understand how and when things happened a long time ago. Because of these discoveries archaeologists found safer ways to get to them, how to excavate the places, and better awareness of dangerous climates.       An example of finding safer ways to get to a spot where there is artifacts is in source one 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks Secrets of the Past', there is a spot where the Incas could have been buried but it was up in a cave on a mountain and the archaeologist found a safe way to get there. Also there is more technology that is forming that is helping archaeologist get places and find them. Another example is in source three, 'Lost Ancient Greek City that may have inspired Atlantis myth give up secrets' where the city is underwater and archaeologists have to use a submarine to get to it or they have to use scuba gear.       Archaeologists also are more aware of dangerous climates where the spot where they are finding their artifacts are. In section two, 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks Secrets of the Past' there is a quote 'Many of their sites are in remote, high places.' This quote means that the archaeologists have to make a good plan on how to get there, how to get out and what to do if they are lost.

All those discoveries have been in that place for years and nobody has discovered them until recently. I think the most imortant discovery was the underwater city of Povlopetri. It was the most important because the ruins of that city could have washed away throughout the whole ocean, but they stayed all together in one spot and were discovered. I think we will have many other discoveries like this one in the future.

But, what they don't realise is that the past is living around them. Many of things we use today was inspired by the past. Take for instance the dome or pillars that we use for housing.  The language and writing we use is based on the earlier verson of it. Some of the things today involve old monuments that we want to look at and explore. I believe that even though the future sounds great, the past is even greater.

They also did not leave any archives for historians study, and no one today knows what their knots mean, and without understanding what they mean the Ancient Inca is a like solving a mystery.               The Puebloans were a tribe that settled in Mesa Verde they were very good basketmakers and were known very well because of their skill. They were really good at hunting also and farming.They were very talented people they knew how to make pottery and also how to make bows and arrows. The houses they lived in were called Pithouses, these houses featured a living room and also had a air deflector and storage bins or they might of had pits.               The Pavlopetri is an underwater town and is one of the oldest towns on earth the dating is about 2800 to 1200 BC, it is a very unique and old town. it is about 30,000   square meters on the oceans floor. The secrets of a lost city have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths, the fable of Atlantis it has been brought to light from under the ocean of southern Greece.               I think the author chose these because they are different and are also very interesting. They also have to use historians for all of them to figure out what they are and other things. I think people think this is very important because now they know a little more about the past. We now know that they also were civilized about 3,000 years ago, and know they had roads and everything like we do except in a different part of the world and they did not use cars they used horses and carrages. I think its a start so scientist can start searching the oceans trying to find out if their are anymore citys or towns that are also in the bottom of the ocean, so that they can learn more about the BC days. Maybe they could get some ideas off those towns to do the same on the U.S, they could get many ideas on how to build some building like theirs because they've been underwater so long and still have not been destroyed.                I think they could also learn about how to make bows and arrows like the indians and how they did their way of life like growing crops and many other things. They could also find some peoples ancestors so that they could know if they had indian blood or atleast know who their ancestors were and where they're at now.

The discovery of this finding was to unravel clues and to see if it is really true and it is true so that also shows how important it is. This city was located in Greece and as we all know Greece was famous back then so that's why these city's like this one is so important to find so that people can find clues about how life was back then. It does show how the tectonic plates move because tsunamis happen when plates touch each other and the plates did move because the earth was once a big piece of land and now its split up so that does tell you some information.           This discovery is a big leap for science and for scientists because not only have they found this city but they might fin more and more around that area because of the movement of the continents. Scientists are more than likely working on this major project to find out more information about how it because submerged and how it is at the bottom of the ocean today. Some people do not think that this is important to us because it was a long time ago and its been down there for a long time but in my opinion it is important because one day where we live might be under water and scientists will research it and find out where it went.               The discovery might find some old tools and things that they used back then and maybe see what they did with these things. Being one of the oldest city in the world makes it an amazing find and makes it maybe a new tourist destination that people might want to go to and that people would enjoy very very much. The people in Greece are really happy that they found this little city that used to be a big place to come and now it is under water so the people do think it is important to find out what is really down there. I myself am really excited that they found this town and i really look forward to more discoveries of the ocean like this one.

When the europeans met inca they were amazed that they could run a huge empire using stings to keep records, The ancient inca is like solving a mystery. They left clues in the form of fasinating portraits of their  religion,agriculture,goverment,transportation and the way of life.               Mesa Verde National park was about the europeans moving to Mesa long before they went to explore america, once they got the land the eventually started building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered acloves of the canyon wall. The archeologist called these people Anasazi from a Navajo word that was sometimes translatedas ' the ancient ones' or ' ancient enemies.'            The lost creek city that may have inspired Anlanis myth gives up there secret was about the secrets about a lost city which was southern greece they said it maybe lost under a ocean.

And the reason that i think that millions of people think that civilizations from the past like the lost city of Atlantis are fascinating is, because just to think that it used to be up top on the surface somewhere near to were you are standing is an incredible thing and also strange.               The reason why in my opinion it is so strange is because you start to think of all the ways that a piece of land like that just vanish into thin air is just a strange thing. If i were a archeologist some of the artifact that i would like to find on the job would be some of there pottery if they made any. And some of the other artifact that i would also find would be text/writing to be able to tell what happen to them and why there no long any more of the group/civilization, i would also like to find some of human remands,the reason why i would like to find human remands would be because i could find out what kind of diseases and or bacteria there was during there time to see if they still the same as today's bacteria/diseases or to see if there were some that haven't been around for hundred of years.                some of the other things i would like to find would some of there research, and some of the gold. The reason why i would like to find some of this stuff is because i could compare it to some of today's stuff. so that is my conclusion on why i think that discovering the lost land was so important.

If we do not have our facts right about the past we cannot advance toward the future.  We absorb this culture to learn about what we could use to advance now.  We can use this knowledge to learn better ways of surviving and living.  With their information we can use it to plan our future, and how Earth has changed.  With this we can see how we have changed and can change.       Ancient Inca:  Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past   The Inca was a tribe who inspite having a weird way of running government and economics they survived.  Their artifacts that were left, had barely been damaged due to their environment.  This helps us learn how our environment has a great effect on us.  The Spaniards came and wrote about them.  These newcomers to this land they have never seen before was odd, because they could not understand the Inca.  These two types of people were different from eachother and on two different levels in technology.  Stories about the Inca were passed down from generation to generation.  The stories lived on and on, even after the loss.  The Inca were took over by the Spaniards.  The Spaniards killed their king.  We now know how we have advanced from doing things like that.  Killing enisent tribes would now be thought of as 'not right'.  This shows how we have changed to more civil people.       Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World   Before the Europeans came their were different people living here than we have today.  They were called Ancestral Puebloans.  They are knowns as Basketmakers.  This is different from how it is today, because we mostly have machines do all the work.  They lived on mesa tops. They have pithouses, it was a house that sunk in the ground and was almost like our houses today.  The houses evolved to kivas.  That shows how much change is happening and how it is forming to today.  They later started building them above ground just like most people today.  Their population was increasing and they were evolving in technology as well.  They went from pole-and-adobe construction to stone masonry.  The population was getting out of hand so some people were moving back to the place that sheilded their ancestors.  Researches may use this information to help deal with problems of today like immigration and other problems that may cause population issues.  Then drasticly almost all of the Ancestral Puebloans moved back to the place where their ancestors lived.  Soon the place was deserted and almost no Ancestral Puebloans lived at the place they left.  Researchers could not find the information about why they had left that place.  They guessed maybe it was resource, social, political problems, or maybe they look for new opportunity.  We could use this information to stop things like this from happening in the future.  Information like this could help with this if something like this ever happened again.        Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets   Their was a fable of a sunkin city.  They found something that may have started the fable and are now excavating it.  It is said to be the oldest sunked city in the world.  It is said to have had people in it about 5,000 years ago.  This tells us how much has changed over the years.  A whole town was put under water.  This can give us later information about how the ocean will effect our environment.  It was nearly untouched since it has been isolated.  The town was big and suprised them.  Some say it was either earthquakes or a tsunami that put it underwater.  Some say both.  The story was passed down from generation. This tells how we can provide information for future people.

They were very smart and used a system of writing or alphabet. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunter or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures today were taken centuries ago and know are being studied.   Archaeoligists compare what they learn from artifacs and sited with the Spandiards acounts of the Inca. They take artifacts and stufy them to see there history. They write down anything that they find out. They keep records and keep them safely so that they don't get destroyed or lost.       The Peubloans lived in pithouses which had a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. They built the house on against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in front.

Because they are rare. just like the planned lost city off the coast of greece. unlike most citys this was a planned city which is rare for tha era. it is also under whater sparking myths of the city of atlantis.      this is important to find because it was a legend proved true. it is the oldest city that is submerged in the world. this revealed a different world of buildings, courtyards and artifacts.      the most important to leave behind in this civilization is the gold,money, farming equitment, pottery, scrolls and other anchent artifacts that can help us take a look into what their world was like many years ago.

To see how people built things, how things are diffrent, look at their history so we don't make the same mistakes, opens new windows to discover, there are things that people never would have imagened to be real or have done.        Also it show how important they are. Like the Inca had some textiles and clothing that were preserved by the dry deserts or the cold mountains of the Andes'. The Puebloans had pithouses wich had a living room suck a few feet under the ground. The Palopetri is the oldest submerged town in the world!!!

By Clay Martin       Over the years, archaeologists have made several amazing discoveries about our world from the past. Some of these discoveries, for example, are the discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations. We can learn and discover many things about ourselves and these people from the artifacts we find in their homes. These civilizations are obviously very important. In my opinion, the reason that they are most important is that they can teach us about both ourselves and them.       The Inca are one of these amazing civilizations. Through artifacts, we have learned that they used colored strings called quipus to record things. We have learned that they were defeated by the Europeans in 1532. We have learned that they had one of the largest empires ever. All of these facts were discovered because of artifacts.       The Puebloans are another great civilization. They lived in Pithouses. They invented the bow and arrow. They were known as the basketmakers. We have learned all these facts because of artifacts.       A third civilization in this group is the Pavlopetri. Archaeologists have discovered that they lived in Atlantis. They've discovered that Atlantis is the oldest planned town ever. They've been able to come up with theories of how Atlantis was destroyed, such as sea level changes, an earthquake, or a tsunami. Again, these discoveries came from artifacts.       There is a lesson to be learned from these artifacts and discoveries. Although these civilizations were amazing, they all have one thing in common: they made mistakes. They weren't perfect. There isn't, never has been, and never will be a perfect civilization. But if we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us, we will be able to become more perfect. There is only one way for us to become more perfect: if people work together and honor and respect one another. 	NNP NNP : WRB VBD DT NNS WDT VBP VBN VBN IN DT NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP RB JJ .

The Inca made knots in colored string to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Today no one knows what the knots mean. A lot of the knowledge comes from the artifacts left behind, and from the sites in which the artifacts were found. Archeologists found stone, pottery, gold, and silver. They also found Ince textiles and clothing. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. The Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may have even worshipped some mountain peeks.   Source #2.   About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They used bow and arrow for hunting.   Source #3.   The sunken settlement dates back some 5000 years ago. The site is believed to be consumed by the ocean.       Part 2.   Archeologists find artifacts which help them to discover what happened to the lost civilizations. But sometimes the artifacts dont always survive.

The cliff dwellings-for instance-were found by the cowboys but are still visited today as people marvel at the beauty. I myself have been and i must say they are beautiful, but I didn't know their history until reading Mesa Verde abrigement from the national park. the incas fasinated me when i read about them in Anceint Inca's, but my favorite article was The Lost Greek City that may have inspired the myth of Atlantis.               The tale of Atlantis a very popular myth, often spoken of on children shows like the little mermaid and sponge bob, but what stumped most logical people (such as myself) is where the myth originated. Helena Smith wrote the Article about a diver that discovered an underground city. The oldest one of sunken sights to actually be a planned town infact. Experts say that this city may be where the creative bed time story actually came from, exiting isn't it?

For example, the house they use too live in and what they did in the past. A lot of things have been found and have been discovered. Many of these things date back before Christ. That makes you wonder what did the worship? They worshiped some mountain peeks. A lot of there cities were up on high places. Where they began to make record of what they did, how they lived, and, the calendar.                 These records where kept on knots and strings. Many of theses records where called quips. Many archeologist do not know what theses knots mean. Some clues where left behind. When some Europeans come they have to be careful when they translate the stories because the didn't speak there language well. Scene they didn't speak there language the stories might not be correct.                   In Mesa Verde they are known for there skill and at the craft. There were farming places, hunting, and, gathering. They learned to live in pit-houses and clustered into small villages. They learned how to make pottery, bow and arrows and efficient weapons for hunting and a spear thrower. In those pit-houses they had a fire pit, an air deflector, and, there was passages under ground to the underworld. They later became known as the Kivas.                   Then there population multiplied then around A.D. 750 they  were beginning to build houses above ground. Then they advanced from pole and adobe to construction and skilful stone masonry. There where cliff dwellers. When local cowboys first reported them the archeologist where pussled in understanding how these people lived. There was no record left of this so there knowledge is a little uncertain. In the season during summer they mainly used the fire place for food. During the winter they lit those fires through out the village they were so cold and damp, uncomfortable and the smoke blacken the walls.In the change of those seasons it was very hard to keep things cool in the summer and keep things warm in the winter with out blacken roofs or fire and ashes every where.                       When the city of Atlantis was found the myths weren't myths anymore they became reality. there have been story's about the lost city in fairy tales with the little mermaid and her father. They are just TV shows every one saw they thought it couldn't be true. Meany people, children seen how beautiful it looked in the TV they wondered if it was real or just imaginary. Parents say ,'oh, That's not real its just to make the kids believe in magic.' They where wrong some explorers found Atlantis beneath the waters off southern Greece.They soon find that it dates back to 5,000 years ago.                     'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr. Jon Henderson. This meant that the myth is now not a myth more than a ledgeden. It date to 2800 to1200BC before Christ there are older sunken cites but none had towns like this one which made it unique.  It went from  30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. They believe that it was consumed around 1000BC. They found it interesting that it Had buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and, religious structures. It was replete with thousands of shared of pottery. These buildings of 9000 square miles took them by surprise this was represented a moment of the past. They still wonder why they sunk this magnificent structure. It has so many beautiful artifacts. This is the first time that a sunken city has been found in ancient Greece. A famos filiosefer said ,' Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.' There are still many things to find down there that cant wait to find us. there will never be nothing to find if you dont find it, it will find you.

The Puebloans were important because they chose there home as Mesa Verde for more than 700 years and then they moved away . The Mesa Verde National Park still preserves their culture.

Discoveries have been found out about the Inca,Puebloans,and the Pavloperti was and still is very important to us because of them we were able to turn their old stuff into a better high tech world for us but using their same exact idea. If you really think about our ancestors you wouldn't really expect them to make any kind of stone pottery or any kind of signs that would show intelligence. I mean they didn't have any tutorial classes about life or inventions and stuff like that! We have parents and internet although the internet mostly always lies, but still we have resources and they didn't. If our ancestors had not came up with any of their inventions I probably wouldn't be typing this article on the computer because without their head-start its like racing that fast kid at your school and you eating a bag of chips before that race. What if they never made crafts then that would mean you have to take your grandma everywhere you go. You are probably thinking oh WOW big difference who cares if we didn't use their ideas ,we would still have everything we have right now, that may be so but everyone says life goes by fast then that means without our ancestor's ideas you would waste basically your whole entire life but a head-start would only waste half of it. If we didn't have their ideas their culture we would start culture from scratch start life from scratch.                        The only way we can know that lost citites actually exisited is by explorers. Explorerers are very big part of history because they explore ancient places. Explorers can tell alot of things just by looking at a ancient piece.Maybe you think there is no lost cities and that the ancient stuff is all fake but with faith and some evidence you will have to belive it. If all this evidence was fake then why would explorers dress up everyday spend about 3hours maybe even 3years who knows just to look for something that is just all fake.

Does'nt finding out about the past make you excited. Well i am going to tell your why first of all finding out about new things is exciting.                 First ,Archeologist are people who study things from the past. Archeologist have found many things to help them learn about the past. before and archeologist can look for things to discover they come up with good questions like for instance, what did people do to communicate with each other , how did their clothes look like, what kind of langage did they speak, did they write and if they did how did their writting look like. then the Archeologist can go out and find things that will make them find the answers to their questions.                In source two it  I read on how the first Ancestral Puenloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D.550. They were really known for theri skill and craft because archeologist found pottery and  bow and arrows. It also says on how the Puenloans lived in pithouses.                The Incas were ancient people of Peru. Archeologist found that Incas had no way of writting ,alphabet. They did not leave any records for us to find but they did leave kots in colored strings that they used to record the calender. Some of the history that we know about the Incas come's from oral stories passed from, generation to generation.                Even myths have gotton these Archeologist to work, like the myth of the sunken city of Atlantis. Archeologist have gone underwater and to try to find remains of this city. they belive that the city has been underwater since 1000 BC.                       These are some of the things that are important. It is really amazing of some of the things you can find out just by some little things that you find . These people left many clues for us and it is very nice to explor and think of what you just might discover. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB DT NN IN NN NNS VBP JJ .

There are many reasons why they are important. Let me explain.           First of all, without these discoveries we would know nothing about the ancient civilizations. With the discovery of the cities we now know the every day lives of these people. We learned what kind of clothing the Incas wore and how they kept records. With the Puebloans we learned that they lived in pithouses. Archeologists also know now what structures Pavelopetri people used. Yet no one could have known that without the discoveries of these cities.            These findings are also important because of the artifacts. According to section 3 archeologists now know when the lost city of Atlantis was enveloped by the sea. All thanks to the artifacts. Also the artifacts connect us to their way of life. Without them no one could know what the Incas wore, or where the Puebloans gathers. Artifacts also are priceless. If they aren't found they could be lost forever.              As one can see, the discovery of these ancient cities are very important. Without them archeologists would not anything about these cities and their history. Ancient civilizations can help us, as humans, become a better society.

During the civilization of the inca from (1438-1532) and they left behind their religon, their art, government, and many other interesting important thing that make an impact on the world today. There were European and Spanish soldier that wrote down about the incans lives in letters to people and in their own diaries, when they arrived in 1532. They incans left behind many things that seemed important to them like stone, pottery, silver, and gold. They have also buried eachother to preseve themselves and they left behind clothing and things, usaully clothes would fade away from the damp but they are in the desert so it is dry. The spanish killed an incan king in 1532 and they took over the place and marked the area for spain. They do not know exactly where because there werent that much artifacts. Some of the incans left there artifacts in caves or very high mountains and cliffs and stuff this helped the preservations because it was very hard to find beacuse they probably knew that if they lived in somewhere very hard to acces the looters could not find the riches so easily. They found bodies of the incans not fully decomposed bodies because the temperature of the andes mountains was very low so when they found the bodies and they wanted to scan them they would have an easier time identifitying them because there was a little bit of flesh still on there body enough to identify them. They could also scan them from how they died maybe they died from old age maybe they got murdered by a sword you can find out from todays technology. The bodies can also be scanned from how they lived in the time they were alive in the caves or one of the pyramid or towers. The incans had an amazing legacy in their lives they left behind many riches and artifacts most of them we probably have never will discover or maybe some of it got looted we may never know fully about the incans and the way they lived but we do know some of the things from the incans. There are many empires for us to discover that the incans left behind maybe one day i will explore all of the riches that the incans have and how amazing this civilization lost in the sand and closed in on caves in the andes mountians.

Inca easy became the spaniards murder that last inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.the inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks many of their sites are in remote, high places Some inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops.At  about 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. Foe more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished heree, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Pithouses people lived in pithouses from about A.D 550 to A.D 750 as settled agriculture begain. The pithouses above festured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground  Four corner timbers supperted the roof. The secrets of lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths- the fable of Atlantis- have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. The site, which staddles 30,000 spuare meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Although discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago,it was only this year that marina archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to peoperly survey the ruins.

You can find how they lived by how they dressed, or by the pottery they used, there household supplies, or by the religous artifacts.Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happend to it.          The ancient inca of peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to recored the calendar to keep a count of livestock.          Some inca textiles and clothing have survived remarkanly well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually desroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on perus coasts or the cold mountions of the anders.          Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the spaniards accounrs of the inca. Sometimes aecheology confirms historical record.         There are so many ways to find out about archerology wether its what the ware or what they eat or any type of writing.

My answer is why not? We should be informed about the people before us and how they lived. We can see how much different we are from them. We can learn from their mistakes.          Learning about past lives can be very beneficial to us. If we learn why that group of people is gone we can be prepared if something similar happens to us. We can also see the growth from people then to the people now. We may be able to even learn something from them. This information can teach us and help us learn. See the differences and similarities. Like how the Pavlopetri and Inca people made pottery and today people are still making pottery. Or maybe the prints of the cloths are similar to the ones we wear now. The Pueblos had kivas which was an early day version of a church. Maybe the Incas found another way to cure a disease, and their way may be better than the one have now. Learning about these different people can approve life.          Why should we learn about all these past things? Why not? They can inform us and teach us ways to survive and what not to do. We can compare how people lived back then and how people live now. Knowing about them can help us in the future. It may even help us now. It's amazing what you could learn from these people. It might not be as bad as you think. 	WRB VBP PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NNP , DT NNP , CC DT NNP NNS : NNS MD NNP NNP NN VBZ WRB RB .

To start off the Inca.They were from Peru and which they had no formal alphabet of system of writing.The way you would know the date is if you spoke thier language and knew what the different colors in the knots meant.That was a way to tell stories too.Life remained there from 1438-1532.The way you would be able to know about the civilzation from thousands of years ago was because clues were left by the Inca portraits of thier religion,art,agiculture,government,and ways of life.      Next up the Pueblons.About 1,400 years ago long before the Europeans explored North America a group of people living in the Four Corners claimed this as thier home.They stayed there for more than 700 years.But in the late A.D 1,200 they moved.Pueblons were called Anasazis which translated to 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'.They are now called Ancestral Pueblons reflecting thier modern descendants.      Last but not least Pavlopetri.The marine geologistists or Anglo-Greek team or archaeologists.They explored the sunken settlement of Atlantis whick sunk about 5,000 years ago.It was known as the most submerged town in the world.The dates went from 2,800-1,200 BC long before the glory days.      In conclusion these people are important to our history  even though they are from the ancient times.For more information look on the internet or in the libary to find facts about the Inca,Pueblons,and the Pavloptris.

People who search for these hidden or undiscovered things in the world are called archaeologist. They go out and try to discover what can be found. Discoveries of what can be ancient cities or civilizations can be and are very important to this worlds history.          For instance, there has been discovery of three different civilizations in the past years. The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. These three ancient civilizations have been dicovered and is being under investigation and study for many years now. Studying these ancient civilization can be very helpful of knowing how these civilizations came to be, how they lived, and how they came to an end. Not only that but finding out these things can be very interesting to not only archaeologist but to anybody in the public world.          By finding out these people's histories they might can help us find out more about our histories. Man does not know about all our past so it would be very helpful and interesting to find out more about our past. These civilizations may be linked to our civilizations in some type of way. Just knowing these people's way of living, culture, families, and religion is all very helpful and interesting. Also seeing the artifacts of these past civilizations can help us date the time periods, know there ways of thinking, and how might these people came to an end.

After Archeologist study these details they can put piece by piece together the Inca's life. A lot of the oral history comes from the story's that have been passed on for generations.       Many of the ancient sites have been have been disturbed by treasue hunters or other people. Some of the aincet treasures were taken long ago. The Archeologists are very carefull to dig up the treasures. Archeologist use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about Inca. They also have to be careful to make sure exactly which people build which site.

They lived in pit houses in small villages with usually on built mesa tops. They learn to make pottery and bow and arrow, usually bow and arrow was made for hunting. The people know as the mesa Verde advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. During classic period, the population reached thousands and villages began to be crowded up. So they built kivas inside the inclosing walls rather than out in the open. Baskets show evidence from back then to show how it was made and made from what. Also the tools they used such as the bow and arrow can also be evidence on how they used that tool to hunt back then.

All people are diffrent and many had so many cultures, many ways of writting, and their styles. Also how they lived. Some examples are the Inca's, the civilization from Mesa Verde, and the lost city of Atlantis. They have all many diffrent ways of being but just small things help archaeologist. They are very simple but very difficult to study. They have to find many research to study their ancient civilization.         One example will be the civilization of Ancient Inca. The way for archeaologist to find all this is to research the place were it was located. The way they know is by the old history and by the way some artifacts are. For example, Incas had a very strange way of writing. Their old writing system is very dificult thet not even today they can figure it out. Their civilization is unique because they lived high up in the Andes Mountains. There it is very cold so some corpse indicate how they lived. For example, they can infer what they wore or how they adapted to that climate. Archaeologist can find the way they lived by clues of where they are from.        Also archaeologist that research the civilization from Mesa Verde can infer the way they lived and how they constructed homes. They can study their way of being by the way some homes were built. Also how some places were built for religious purposes. Archeaologist can also find new things about them by how some wepons were built. Their civilization was also unique because it became very popular in a short time. They can find many things from studying their artifacts and archeitechture.        Some other reasons will be studying how it disapeared. For example the lost city of Atlantis. That civilization was also very popular but sadly it went underwater. There are many myhts about that city. Although it is 30,000 square meters deep in water people can still infer things about Atlantis. Archeaologist also have to study the location and how it might have disapeared. There are myhts about a tsunami, earthquake and other things that might have happened for atlantis to disapear. Archeoalogist still have to research the lost city of Atlantis.         In conclusion, archeaologist find new things by their location, artifacts, and some inventions. They all have to research many new things. Also explore the land and figure out  how they adapted to that climate. There might be myths aabout every civilization but there can only be one fact. The only who know are the ones who expierences it which is long ago. Maybe we wont be able to know what really happened to these great civilizations.

With these proofs we can know more about who we are and where do we originate from. Also we can get more knowelegde of  how did ancient civilaztions live or where. And finally we can better understand the physical and chemical properties of our own bodies.             Starting off with what I said erlier about the curiousity humans have to their origins, to cease that curiousity we can use the ruins and the ancient arifacts and the fossils to figure out where we come from and how the human kind came to be. Not to mention we can also use these ancient discoveries to make great meusseums.                  As I mentioned erlier in the essay these discoveries can help us better understand where they lived and how. Like with the Incas we know that the ran the whole civilization with colored strings. Scientist are still trying to find out how but are sure that this is one of the most extraordinary ways of running a civilization.                 And last but not least they can help us better comprehend the way our body works. Like when the spaniards came to the new world and came with new various new viruses to the indians the viruses killed most of the indians this helped us by telling us that wenever we are exposed to a new virus or bacteria that our body doesn`t recognize we get very sick but with the right treatment we can be nursed back to health.                These reasons are why studying fossils and ancient artifacts is a huge benefit to cociety. In conclusion fossils should be furthered analysed for greater benefits.

I think that this article is important because it gives us a sense of how people back then are very different from people now and it  gives us very unique artifacts that they used for their everday needs.              Some of the artifacts found, that Incas used, was a string colored calendar, called quipus. They were used to keep control of their livestock and records. To this day, know one really knows what the colored strings mean, orhow they work. Incas made almost everything out of silver,gold, stone, or pottery, which made things last longer. Some artifacts are found buried for the dead, so it can be used in the afterlife.            All of this really shows how Incas have left many great artifacts and monuments for us figure out where our ancestors come from, and how they lived in a time of survival. All of this is really improtant because, it gives us a sense of how different people were back then compared to now and that artifacts have trully given us a sense of the kind of people they were back then.                In the other articles, Mesa Verde national Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, and Lost Greek city that may have inspired Alantis myths gives up secrets, have also given us a many interesting artifacts and mysteries as to wether people were there or not. This is also important because, these articles have give us many facts and life styles back then.                   Archaeologists have found that some ofthe artifacts date back some 5,000 years ago or more. This trully shows how important all of this information gives a sense of how people lived and what may have happened to them. It really gives us a thought on the kind of peolpe they were compared to the people we have now. How creative and constructional people were. The ruins and buildings, the artifacts and tools, really put an idea in our heads of how smart they were to use what they had to make the best of it.               To me all of these articles are important, because they show how peole back the like Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, were so creative and had many ideas that have hepled them throughout their lives and the tools they made to make other amazing objects, is something trully unique. All of this really shows how different and the same people were compared to us. Many artifacts and ruins found tell many facts and have tons of stories behind them.

Now as archeologists take a closer look inside the lives of these people, we could learn more about these people than we ever imagined we would.        First, the archaeologists climbed high up into the Rocky Mountains so that they could explore the ruins of the Inca. They found that to keep records they tied complex knots, no one know exactly what they mean though. They also found old cups, bowls and other stone or metal objects like jewelry. These findings help one to try and understand how these items were made and what they might have been used for. They also discovered bodies that are so well preserved that they could use modern medicine to figure out how that individual died.        Then, archeologists traveled to Mesa Verde, the ancient city in which the Puebloans used to exist. They found odd huts, called a pit house. These houses where supported by four corner timbers and had a fire pit with an air deflector. The people then graduated to adobe house, which were stronger. Their pottery also changed, instead of having dull gray pots, they used elaborated black and white drawings.          The archeologists then went to Greece, just off the coast to explore the sunken settlement of the Pavlopetri. It is said that the civilization sunk about five thousand years ago and no one is absolutely sure how it can to be under water. While there, archeologists explore a world of buildings, from courtyards to tombs. This city was covered in shards of broken pottery. This civilization is a wonderful mystery that no one is quite sure about, but if we keep searching we might find an even bigger surprise.        Exploring ancient civilizations like the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlovian is important because it teaches one about the history of these amazingly smart people.

The findings from the Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, give archaeologists an idea of their lives and culture.  The discoveries also show how far in relation we are with our past brethren.  Archaeological findings are doors that lead us into the past.       One civilization was the Incas.  The Incas were natives to Peru, and lived high up in the Andes Mountains.  The artifacts found have allowed us to see the Incas culture.  We learned that they worshiped many gods, practiced blood sacrifices, and had a craving in poetry.  Archaeologists have learned another civilization through the mere discoveries of artifacts.  The Incas however, are considered a lost civilization.  There demise  is apparent through the findings of a hand full of Spanish records.  The Spaniards over all led to the ending of the once great civilization.  This shows the the finally to the the Incas.       The Pavlopetri's town is what must have inspired the myth of Atlantis.  The town is submerged in the waters off the coast of southern Greece.  The city is still intact, as if it was built underwater, and artifacts still remain.  This shows how real life events can be transformed into a well known myth.  There are many theories that surround how this city came to be underwater.  The main theory seems to be that the change in water levels is what lead to the town's condition.  The Pavlopetri were a distant group that inspired the myth of Atlantis.      The Puebloans were a group of native Americans who lived in the Four Corners Region.  The civilization created well designed stone communities in which they could keep cool within their houses.  This shows the innovation within the past humans.   The Puebloan had a huge change within their lifestyle. They went from nomadic to living in small villages.   This shows the major change.       The findings from archaologists help us lead into the past.  The Incas, the Pavlopetris, and the Puebloans all consist of this group.  The inovation of our past can easily compare with the technology of today.  We can better understand the pats through the discovery of acient artifacts.

Without many of these discoveries the life we live in today would be extremely different.              Even though the Incas did not have a formal writing system or alphabet they still found different ways to live there life. They made different colored knots called quipus which recorded the calender to count all for the livestock. Archaeologist found this amazing that the huge empire the Incas lived in was organized by these color strings. Still to this day nobody has figured out what these knots mean. Many other objects where left behind such as, amazing portraits of there religion, art, arcarchitecture, agriculture, government, transportation and also their was of life. There are many different ways to find out about history but one way historians found out about the Incas history is from oral history which is stories passed down for generation to generation. The Incas story and history is an amazing thing to learn about but, they aren't the only group of people that lived around that time.             The ancient Puebloans of Mesa Verde lived 1,400 years ago before Europeans explored North America. Mesa Verde the home of the Puebloans means 'green table' in SSpanish. In 550 A.D the Puebloans where known as Basket makers because the where skilled at a variety of different crafts. This amazingly interesting group of people lived in a home called pit houses these homes featured a living room which sunk a few feet into the ground. In 750 A.D they began to build houses above ground  that had upright walls which where made of poles and mud. The Puebloans built the houses one against another in long and curving rows. They had many different skills that not everybody had.          Beneath the waters of Greece there lays a sunken settlement that inspired the fable Atlantis. Anglo a Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists known as Pavlopetri explored this settlement back 5000 years ago. The most interesting fact about this settlement is that it was a planned city filled with buildings,courtyards and streets. Not too long ago many archaeologist where finally able to explored this sunken settlement.       In conclusion, the Incas, Puebloans and the Pavlopetris had many different skills but without archaeologists finding these amazing objects our world wouldn't be the same today.

But back then for the ancient Inca they had to do things different ways then we do. For instance, their calendars aren't on paper, their calendars are strings that are called quipus to record the count of livestock. Some Inca textiles have been preserved over many years because the Inca lived in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts and the cold mountains of the Andes. Bu some artifacts have been taken by treasure hunters many years ago. Some treasure are still out there for archaeologists to find.Archaeologists are good at keeping records of what they find and where they can find something. Archaeologists have more of a job than just finding artifacts, but they also have to get as much evidence as they cand to get information from the artifact. They lived in houses called pithouses that later evolved into kivas. A kiva is a Hopi word for ceremonial room-- here underground cahmber comparable to later churches. Many people have also discovered the Lost Greek City. They find many artifacts that were covered by the ocean floor. Some of the settlements they found date back to 5,000 years ago. One of the sites they found is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor next to the southern Peloponnese. They also found artifacts that dated bacl to the stone ages. All together many archaeologists have found many artifacts in the past years. But there is still many more out there probably.

One thing in common between them was they had troubles. The Inca were killed off by the Spanirds, the Puebloans ran their resources dry, and the Pavlopetri's community sank to the bottom of the ocean.There are many things we can do to prevent that from happening to us.              The Inca were attacked and killed off by the Spaniards. The passage states that the last Incan ruler was killed in 1532 by the Spaniards. In order to prevent an attack everyone needs to be prepared. The Incans left behind a lot of art and architecture, religion, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. One thing they did not leave behind were a lot of weapons.              The Puebloans used up all of the resources in the area where they were living. The passage states that they had to go to New Mexico and Arizona. They accumulated many skills and traditions, but were not conservative enough with their resources. To prevent this happening to us we need to be more conservative with our natural resources. Just planting one tree for every tree that we cut down prevents the same thing from happening to us.              The Pavlopetri's community sunk to the bottom of the ocean. People belive this was because the sea level changed, there was an earthquake, or there was a tsunami. The way to reduce the risk of an earthquake is to be careful when building a city on a fault line. The way to reduce the risk of a tsunami is to keep cities a fair distance from water. The way to reduce the risk of the water level changing is to kepp buildings near water higher up.              If we do all these things we will reduce the risk of ending up like the Inca, the Puebloans, or the Pavlopetri. These things are not very hard and can save many lives. Many People die of hunger every day. any people also die of drowning every day. Even more people die of natural disasters of all kinds every day though.

There were three different civilizations all in different part of the globe. The Inca in the Andes mountains of Peru. The Greeks in the underwater city of Atlantis.  Each very diverse.           The city of Atlantis has been a myth for as long as time has existed but with new technology they have discovered it is real. Dr Jon Henderson says 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in history.' The underwater town reveals that it was a world of tombs, buildings, courtyards, religious buildings and shards of pottery. The town also has a megaron which it was run by an elite which raised the status of the town. The town was never reoccupied so everything is untouched as if life was frozen in time preserving everything as it was thousands of years ago.       The Inca were another fascinating civilization. Located in the Andes mountains the Inca were able to preserve many of their artifacts because of the desert and the high mountain ranges of the Andes. The Spaniards eventually conquered the Inca and put out the civilization.       In conclusion their are many fascinating lost civilizations. From Greece to Peru   there are keys to the past everywhere.

The Inca's history may of been confusing but it still teaches us what they did back then. Like how they used special strings to tie knots in called quipus to keep track of different things. The Spanish sent soldiers and missionaries over to study them and teach them about christianity. They wrote diaries about what they did and tried to interpret what they said in their language. Now when archaeologists try to go to the sites where are buried they have to be careful of which one they go to because some of them are robbed by looters and other people. There are still many sites that are left unharmed like the ones in the moutains where most of the bodies are well preserved and looters can't get to.        There was another civilization that is gone now but excisted. The archaeologists call them the Anasazi whis is translated from a Navajo term meaning the ancient ones. Now we just call them the Ancentral Puebloans. The first ones lived in a placed called Mesa Verde around A.D. 550. They were famous for their backetry. They were very nomadic before settling at a city they started farming more and hunting less. They also learned to make pottery and made the bow and arrow which was a better hunting tool than their atlatl or spear thrower. In two hundred years they started making their houses above ground instead under ground. These houses were usually made out of sticks and mud. Later they stopped using this method and started using masonry. They made connected houses out of stone with over 50 rooms and 3 stories. When the cowboys told some people that there were houses in the cliffs archaeologists tried to seek the answers about their lifestyles there. When they were building their houses they started using nature to their advantage and built houses in overhaning cliffs.         Finding a city underwater can be unusual but the one that can be linked to the Atlantis myth is an awesome discovery. A team of archaeologists and marine geologists started exploring the old city. One of them said that this was the oldest city ever to be sunken because the remains that date back to 2800 BC to 1200 BC. This is before the days of the famous Greece we know about. This finding finds the possible history of the Mycenaes people. The geologists haven't yet discovered why this city sank but they think it is because of a tsunami.         This is why I think that these findings are important for the world's history so we can learn more about these ancient civilization and what went on there. This also helps us learn more about the real stories behind the myths and less about the stories they tell us.

By containing this interesting information we are able to understand our history and the people in it. We are also able to relate it to our everyday life and see the imporvements we have made. One example of our improvement is that we now know how to build houses that are able to stand strong. These people lived in pithouses that were probably not very good insulators.       There are so many ways we have grown as a world. But by understanding and respecting our past we can move forward and continue to grow and improve our ways.

These very powerful cities soon became deserted or invaded by Spaniards who had a growing greed of wanting to demolish ways of life. We have found the forgotten civilizations on the coast of mexico very intruiging. Some are very hard to learn about due to the fact they speak a completely different language. Some artifacts found let us know how people lived and what they did. In other places it's hard to find artifacts that let us know about a civilizations past because they had been looted. It is still going on today.       Archeologists are constantly running into risks when they excavate and building that is in ruins. They could easily fall and die because of the slippery, or crumbling of the old; still aging building.       For the places that kept articles, like the incas, it is very hard for us to understand exactly what the knots in their quipus. Today, historians are still unsure of what they mean and what they stand for. Trying to understand and gain a little more elaboration from the Inca tribe is like trying to solve an unsolvable mystery.       Clues that have been left behind by citizens are constantly being found and interrogated by historians in order to predict what may have happened to someone or a whole tribe. It is important to know where a civilization came from and most importantly what happed to it. By doing this we know what their cause of scattering or what epidemic swept across the city.       People lived in very simple house structures. Well, they were considered simple unless you were from the Inca's who had very complex structures. In Mesa Verde, adobe and mud, was used to create houses and other needed buildings. From there they went from using pole-and-adobe construction to building something somewhat similar to those of the Incas.       These people have left behind artifacts to a different world we still have yet to discover. There are many things that will sometimes remain hidden until the end of time because we aren't looking hard enough. Or maybe a civilization's secret will stay a secret, leaving us in the pit of our grandest curiousity.

Like pottery and ways to hunt animals and use them for food or clothes. We have discovered a bunch of artifacts. This also teaches us what they used to do in the before time. They didn't have a formal alphabet or system of writing. To keep track of the calendar, they made knots with colorful strings called quipus. But nobody today knows how to use those strings.        For more than 700 years, the puebloans lived here at mesa verde national park. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, they left their homes and moved away. Mesa Verde National Park reminds us a lot about this culture. The first ancestral puebloans settled at Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithoises clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.        By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Pottery also changed, from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D.1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. It was mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open.

Spaniards killed off the Incas so we don't have much knownledge about them. There king was killed in 1532. They lived in peru and had no alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives foe historians. They made objects from stone, gold, and silver some of these materials last a long time.

They have learned many things about these ancient cultures. For instance, they know that the Inca kept records by using quipus, the records the Inca kept by tying knots on a string. The historians also have a basic understanding of some of the stories the Inca told. Another example is the Ancestoral Puebloans, historians understand that they were skillful builders who liked to use stone. They also know that they became skilled basketmakers, and were exeptional at making pottery. Finally, the lost greek city, since their was a large amount of pottery on the ocean floor, people can infer that their art culture focused on pottery. it is also known that the city is exeptionally large, since it stretches 3,000 meters along the ocean floor. Our curiosity to find out how people lived before us has lead us to find some important things.

If we were back in 1438 we would be as advanced as the Inca or alittle behinde them, most of are tools would be made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. We would also be hunters and gathers , our cloths would be made of animal fur. Most of you are probally all grossed out and saying you couldnt live like that , but really its a remarkable thing when you really think about it becuase if they didnt live like that and discover things thats probally how we would be today. Their would be not text messaging the closet to that would be carving a picture of what you werr trying to say on a rock and hoping they understood what you were trying to say, because the Inca had no offical spoken languge, alphabet, or system of writing. Society has really evolved since the Inca and those settlers after them just think, if their were advanced as we are today back then. They would have probablly servive to tell their story, and us today man we wold already be living like the jetsons wouldnt that be neat I mean  really neat, but thtats not how it happened you should thank them though for evoling as much as the did with revolution and such so all we had to do was put the peices together.

Sites like the Inca villages in the Andes Mountains, the cliff dwellers in Mesa Verde, and the sunken city of Pavlopetri all give historians clues to our unknown past and the secrets of yesterday's world. These discoveries are important to us for many reasons, and to feed our natural curiosity, we have traveled the globe, searching for long lost clues to our past.            The artifacts discovered at Inca sites are vital towards finding out the truth of our history. The resources the Incas had at their disposal, such as gold and silver, tells us how they viewed precious metals. The abundance of the metals in Inca society made them less valuable almost, and that viewpoint changes the way historians portray ancient Inca.            The Ancestral Pueblo-ans, who lived in Mesa Verde about 1,400 years ago, originally were nomads, but settled down along canyon walls for about seven centuries. Archaeologists know they flourished, due to the way the soil and ground around the abandoned homes is. The Pueblo-ans show historians how people lived, worked, and died in North America in a portion of the Four Corners.            The Pueblo-ans also resided on cliffs, and soon became known as cliff dwellers. Their advanced masonry told historians that there were some advancements in their society that we did not know were there at all. The remains of both of the Pueblo-ans dwellings exhibit their way for life, the resources they used, how they used those resources, advantages to their territory, and disadvantages to their homes.            Once the lost Greek city of Pavlopetri was found off the coast of southern Greece, archaeologists were all over it, claiming it to be the largest planned submerged city to be discovered so far. The artifacts found on this huge, sunken site are important for our search for the truth. It not only raises more questions on the myth of Atlantis, but it also answers a few too. Archaeologists have been able to date Pavlopetri back to around the time Plato described Atlantis, and the architecture and advancement in buildings and artifacts fits in almost perfectly with Plato's observations of the fabled Atlantis. Some wonder if Pavlopetri is actually the sunken city Plato was referring to, and if it is, what happened? Once again, our natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge takes over and we must know what actually went down at that time in history.           Human beings have a natural hunger for knowledge, and knowing how things happened, why they happened, when the happened, and who they happened to in the past has lead the way for our brains and instincts to find the answers. the discoveries made in the ruins of ancient Inca, the remains of an abandoned civilization in Mesa Verde, and the subterranean mystery in southern Greece all contribute to our understanding of the past and, in some ways, our future.

These civilizations have left clues that have led historians and archeologists to piece together the lifestyles of these three ancient societies.             The ancient Incas had no formal writing system which made it quite difficult for archeologists to study.  Still, archeologists  were able to learn about their culture through the artifacts found such as textiles and clothing that have survived for the long lengths of time. To learn as much information as they do, they need to keep careful records.  To learn more information,  archeologists can compare with other scientists and come up with an explanation.  It is important for scientists to study the history of this civilization so our society can learn from it and not repeat it.            Discoveries from the first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde make it possible to improve our society's skill and craftsmanship.    Archeologists have learned much about their tools and livelihood.  Production factories can make improvements of these tools and therefore advance in technology.             The secrets of the lost city of Atlantis has allowed scientists to research the field of natural disaster and Earth's movement. The myths of the city have sparked archeologist's interest and now they have been able to research the sunken settlement and find that it was once possibly a lively city.  This extraordinary myth has been able to keep underwater exploration going and has given archeologists the opportunity to survey the rest of the ocean floor.           The findings of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have been so important as to exploring the old civilizations and improving new ones.  Archeologists have reasearched artifacts, structures, and stories that allow us citizens to think of our daily lives and work to advance in society.

Through many researches, there are still following discoveries of the past that give a huge impact to the present of today. Like for example, three discoveries that were important was the lifestyle of the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. During their time, there were truely remarkable artifacts that were created and unknown items that some scientists just cannot seem to figure out. In other words, as many people seeked more into the facts they soon discovered a whole lot more to it.   In Source #1, the first lifespan that effected our present today was the civilizations of the Incas. During the Inca past time, it was very much important to learn more about their survival skills. One reason is because the Incas lived in a type of climate that was atleast below room temperature and that there was not that much food on the mountains. Another interesting fact on why they were so important is the way the Incas had left behind several pottery made out of silver or gold. Not only did their artifacts gave the humans something to learn more about, but it got more humans involved in the Inca's past.   Then in Source #2, a second civilization that effected the present was the Puebloans. For example, the Puebloans brought a lot of change to our land by creating beautiful baskets as they were mostly known as Basketmakers. Even though they were skilled craft makers, they would usually farm instead of hunting or gathering like most other culturals did. Mostly the real interesting thing they did was build small houses called kivas. Soon their culture impacted greatly on us, but not like the Pavlopetri have.   At last, a final group that influenced out time period is still the Pavlopetri. The Pavlopetri were a group of researchers that wanted to be more fascinated with the lost city of Atlantis. In other words, Atlantis was a city that sunk under the ocean which was told by legend. From that point, people believed that Atlantis could have been a city as more clues were found when some divers found left behind pottery or other artifacts. Next thing, people start commenting about how Atlantis was either sunked by an earthquake or tsunami. Soon, there was not enough facts to prove that Atlantis was real, but it still remains a legend.   After detailing every fact, it is to now on know there were some very important discoveries that not many people get in to. While people out in the world are just minding their own thing, they do not stop and realize how interesting it would be to know what theses discoveries were. As time goes by, more people will soon see the beauty of what the past could be as they listen to hear the most various stories they have ever heard in their life. So the discoveries that involved the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are just as much important than ignoring the looks of it all. Without these discoveries, there would not be as much for the world to talk about.

This caused for a lot of accidents and mistakes since no one could communicate with each other.            Because they had no system of writing or alphabet the people really did not know the things that surrounded them. They saw the world around them but never knew what they were, this made the people always curious of everything they saw and that is why they tried everything around them.             In addition they had no language which made it difficult to communicate with their freinds or family. Imagine how mad and frustrated you would be trying to talk to your parents or best friends and they couldn't understand what you were trying to say. I know i would get really mad.            In conclusion living a life with no writing or language would not be fun and very frustrating always just hearing a blob of words coming out of someones mouth.

The ancient Inca of Peru didn't leave much history behind, but made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of the livestocks they had. When the Europeans met the Incas they were surprised that they could run a empire using strings to keep records. Another ancient historic event was in Mesa Verde which for the past 700 years they flourished here and built stone comminuties in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls and then later in the generation they moved away. They also built pithouses that were sunk into the ground. The ancient civilization was important and still is to this day.

Inca made knot in colored string called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Also, their artifact might be object made from stone,pottery, gold, or silver. The Puebloan are also important, that we could learn from what they do on their daily life. They lived in pithouses clustered into small village usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. Also, learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting.Their building and wall of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high. Basket show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to the craft.The Pavlopetri are important because of the sunken settlement date back some 5,000 years. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meter of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea. They had founded settlement such as building, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs,and religious structures. Many geologist had theories that the sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquake, or a tsunami.

Well you guys have google so you can always use that. Well I might as well make a good ending. So Prince Charming ended up going on Welfare, the Princess got a HIV and died, and as for Xavier? He got in trouble for not actually writing anything. There are still many civilizations that are still undiscovered. Until we discover them, there presence is still unknown.

Throughout history there have been unknown civilizations that haven't been found yet. That is why lost civilizations are an important key in figuring out about our past. They have helped us figure out how and where these people lived, how they kept historical records,and what type of advances they had during their time period.          One important discovery about the lost civilization of the Inca,Puebloans,and Pavlopetir was where and how they lived. These civilization helped archaeologist find out what types of locations they lived in and how they adapted to the environments. For instance, the Inca lived in the high Andes, the Puebloans lived pueblos(villages) in the dester or cliffs, while the Pavlopetir live near southern Greece. These civilizations would have not been found if people had not left any evidence of historical references.          The second wave of discovery from the three civilization were historical records. Without these artifacts, archaeologist would not be able of find bigger discoveries within the civilization. For example the Spaniards that had vistied the Inca wrote down what they seen or heard in their time with the Inca.As for the Puebloans, they had knotted stings that held record keeping, and or certain events, while the Pavlopetir had ruins that held artifacts that helped prove their new advancements during that time period.           Another important discovery about these civilization was that they had an advancement in technology. For example the Inca used materials that would last for a long time, up untill today. While the Inca had lasting materials, the Puebloans had a new advancement in their way of living, such as creating new homes that would be away from danger. Although they all have an amazing advancement, the pavlopetir civilization had a great advancement in their city.           although lost civilizations may be boring, they can tell us about their way of living, historical events, or maybe even their new way of making daily lives better.

We learned many thing about the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetris by observing everything we find at the sites their town/ cities were at.       In the Incas sites, they did not have any formal alphabet or writing system. 'Some of what we know about the Incas comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation.' Most of the Inca stories were just mythes or legends rather than history. Still, the historians had to be cafeful when they interpret these accounts because the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. 'The rest of our knowledge of the Incas comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found.' Their artifacts were made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Archaeologists use some advanced techniques to discover more about the Incas. 'You'll see how aerial photography can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they cannot see from the ground.' Looters cannot reach some of the sites because they are in high, remote places which helps preserve the sites. That only makes it harder for the archaeologist to his/her job of find information or more artifacts for reseaches. Inca was a great discovory, but there may have been a few bumpy path that led to its discovery.       A group of people, Puebloans,but archeologists call them Anasazi, who lived on North America about 1,400 years ago before Europeans explored it about. They first settled ther about A.D. 550. They were known for their skills of basket making so they were called Basketmakers. They began to make houses with straight walls made out of poles and mud, but instead of in cliff recesses, the house were above ground. ' From here on, these people are know as Puebloans, a spanish worn meaning 'village dwellers'.'They started to advance instead of making pole and adobe construction; they started to do skillful masonry which were walls of thivk, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high. The population reached up to several thousand during the Classic Period which was between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300. ' Baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to craft.' People began to move back in to the cliffs for some unknown reason. Many archeologists thought maybe it was for defense or a religious or psychological reasons. The structures in the cliffs sre evidence of a society that accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. 'By the Classic Period (A.D. 1100 to A.D. 1300), Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America. The findings of the Puebloans was a amazing discovery.       'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths  - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' An Anglo-greek team of archaeologists and amrine geologists explored Pavlopetri, the suken settlement that dated back some 5,000 years ago.The 30,000 square meters site is believed to have been swallowed by the sea around 1,000 BC. It was discovered by the Britian first, in 2009 the marine archaeologists were able to reach to site, but wuth the help of technology. ''We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1.200 years earlier than originally thought,'' Marine geologists still do not know what the cause was that sank the settlement to the ocean floor. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going,'. Atlantis was the most greatest discovers because it keeped the underwater exploration going and it proved one of the myth about Atlantis true.       All of these discoveries were amazing with the Puebloans and why they went back into there cliff and the Incas and the Pavlopetri and why their city sank. These are all good question, but they are not answered yet because the marine geologist and archaeologists still have not figured them out and are pondering just like we are.

Some artifacts such as Incan clothing and textiles show us the type of weather they endured and what resources they had to make their clothing. Also, archeologists have found objects made from gold and silver. This shows us that Incans had these objects which are now found very valueable today.           Many interesting artifacts have been found about the Puebloans that help archeologists learn more about their daily life and how they lived within their communtiy. Puebloans, also 'known as Basketmakers,' as stated in the article 'The First Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde'. They were called Basketmakers because of their skill at making baskets. Because of this archeologists have found baskets and pottery. Basketmakers also lived in pithouses in small villages.

The Incans and the Puebloans and the sunken city near southern Greece have been destroyed either by an earthquake or tornadoes., They do not know for sure that their sources are correct because they speaked a different language. The archaeologists have looked and found many objects and some are really difficult to find. They do not know how the buildings have been destroyed. They have found many objects from the afterlifes.

An archaeolgists  job is very hard that means you have to study a lot and have to carry all their stuff that they pack to head out and discrover about our great ancient civilzations that make our world history.       The Inca that once lived in Peru made lots of great things such as the calender to keep count on their livestalk. they may have a lot of hidden gold treaursers that we can probley find today some achaeolgists may have found some clues that the Inca may left behind .           Mesa Verde long ago more than 700 years a group of europeans explored this spectacular park  the people who lived their were know as the basketmakers for the skill in craft they also built the pithouse it is made of mud and sticks it has a living room that sunk a few feet in the ground.           The people of Mesa Verde had constrution to skillfull stone masonry. the walls are very thick and have stone that often rose two of three stories high and join together.               The lost city of the greeks has inspider many people to go underwater to see it wonderful treaurse that it has it is located off of the Neapolis near Elafonissos Island. the people who are investgating  may have found out how this city got suck into the ocean. Marine geolgist have yet lot's of work to find out how the city could have sank incliding at the sea level or how it must of got sunk by an earthquake or a big tsunami.           Many marine geolgist today are still learing about how and what caues the city to fall and hope to find anwers to tell what the future lies ahead and it will become history for us and other thing in this wonderful world we live in today.

Each piece of evidence fitting into the puzzle. Their discoveries have led them to theories about the civilizations that thrived thousands of years before them.          Each artifact has helped archeologists figure out partly what was happening during those years in our history. Some quipus that were found have led them to think that the knotted string was used for counting something, perhaps livestock,or was used as a calendar. Some artifacts were oral, such as stories and legends that were passed down from generation to generation.Some stories were passed down by being written.They were written down by the Europeans who arrivedin the empire in 1532. Things like that can suggest that the Inca were friends with Europeans.          Archeologists have found some of the early Puebloans' pithouses, their homes. They were known as great basketmakers. Maybe that skill got them making their own homes out of straw. As they learned to make pottery, and learned about the bow and arrow, they made a better weapon for hunting. As the Puebloans learned to build, they started making their homes from poles that stood upright and mud. Later on, some stone homes were found suggesting that the were advancing in technology. It also shows that they were constantly finding something better to make their homes out of.          The lost city of atlantis has been found. Since it was found beneath the waters of southern Greece, archeologists have inferred that the city, when still up, was near southern Greece. The sunken civilization dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. Their are some remains that date from 2800 to 1200 BC. Archeologists have also found that some ceramics date back to the end of the stone age. It suggests that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago. The lost city of Atlantis is definitely one of the most interesting underwater ruins yet.            Of all the artifacts and ruins mentioned in the text above, the lost city of Atlantis is a favorite for archeologists. They have found out many interesting theories and suggestions about a lot of  the amazing stuff found on land and underwater. Each artifact is as fragile as a feather and each tells its own story.

We are grateful for many of the ancient civilizations that have provided us with advice on many different topics but especially on survival. A few of those civilizations such as the Inca, Pueblo and the Pavlopetri, have left many important artifacts from their time behind. These artifacts were very important had have helped or modern society to this day.           For example, The Inca discovered way to survive in the wilderness of modern-day Peru by using nature's materials. They used the quipus ( a string with many knots in it) as a tool to pass messages, record livestock and create a calendar. The quipus was very efficient because they had a very big empire and had to control everyone in it. there was only one capitol and one king but many Incas held a big part in their way of life. They had a very big messenger system that was soon developed using quipus. They used this system to pass quick messages from one end of the empire to the next especially if it was a decree from the king. This system has now led to what we used to call the Pony Express which was postal mail and served exactly like the quipus. This then led to email and text messages that wee use today. If this discovery was made the mail would have taken a long to time be made and now we know the origin of this idea.             Another civilization called the Pueblo were also very important. Their way of living centered on hunting and gathering but they soon started to farm. They had made weapons such as the bow and arrow and spear that have been improved over the years. We don't use weapons like those anymore but in the past wars, they were highly appreciated by soldiers. The were mainly known for their homes, though. Their houses were built of red clay and structured in an organized way. they lived in villages or on cliffs. These architectural structures were beautiful to look at and provided archaeologists with information about the way Pueblos lived. We sometimes build our homes with the same or kind of the material they had. The structure of their homes were so complex that we use the same ones sometimes for own. The Pueblos showed us architecture the nature shows it to us.             The last civilization is a mystery, the underwater civilization of Atlantis. The Pavlopetri found pottery and architectural structures of what seemed like a community that was built underwater. Even though not a lot of information has been found about Atlantis, the sudden discovery of an underwater city build curiosity which keeps up underwater exploration. Through this, we might not find anything about Atlantis but we might know more about the deep blue sea. As we try to keep searching, we have known more things about the sea than we have known before.               All of these ancient civilizations and many more have provided us with history of the past. We have learned from that history and continue to learn, so the many discoveries that were found about each civilization are very important and we should be proud of the archaeologists that use their time to dig up the past and learn from it.

339	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	NR			M	500230	8	11062227	Y	53045	          Archaeologists study historical artifacts in order to learn of Earth's past. By studying ancient artifacts, archaeologists have discovered signs of ancient civilizations. Three major discoveries by paleontologists are the Incas, Puebloans, and the lost Greek city.             The Inca civilization lasted from 1438-1532. The Incas lived in Peru and had no formal alphabet or writing system. The only way we reason we know of their existence is through artifacts and oral history. Archaeologists can piece together details of Inca life by  studying the Inca artifacts left behind. The Inca civilization isn't the only civilization historians know about.            The ancient Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago. They were formerly nomadic, but they began a settled life. Their old hunting and gathering ways were replaced by farming. They lived for more than 700 years in Mesa Verde.  They are known for their skill at the craft of basket making. For an unknown reason, they migrated to cliff alcoves.            Beneath the waters off southern Greece, divers discovered a sunken settlement. The settlement dates back about 5,000 years ago in Homer's heroes time. According to Dr. Jon Henderson, this is the oldest submerged town in the world. The site is 30,000 square meters large, and it is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Many theories of how the city sunk include sea level changes, tsunami, and ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes.             Archaeologists have discovered many artifacts of Earth's past, but there are still numerous more things to be found. For example, less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. The Incas, Puebloans, and the lost Greek city are only a few discoveries in the large Earth.

Knowing about the giant civilizations of our past helps us with the search of our world, and our everyday quest for knowledge. It is only logical that we continue to do so, because the benefits of exploration are astronomical.Many of the great civilization of the world did not have a reading or writing system. They didn't really care if future historians and archaelogists found their ruins. What mattered to them was the state of the empire, and what they could do to benefit it. This is why we know so little of a empire that ruled nearly all of South America, or a gigantic underwater city.           What we know of ancient civilizations changes our world today. we need to learn more to know more. We can learn from them, learn about their way of life, and how that could possibly help us today. What if we were to find a ancient technology that produced 10x more energy than it needed to run? This is why the discoveries we find today of ancient civilizations will help us.

There are many different traits about the daily life of these tribes that archaeologists discovered at different locations. There are lots of differant objects that the archaeologists such as textiles, pottery, gold, and silver. The Incas were one of the three tribes were talked about in the passage.             The Incas were a Peruvian Empire that ruled for almost one hundred years. Archaeologists have found many differant artifacts on Incan land. one artifact that was found was pieces of string with knots in them. the only thing that archaeologists cant tell about these is that the were most likely to have been used for keeping track of the quantity of things like crops. This would have been important for daily incan life. Another tribe talked about in the article were the Puebloans.             The Puebloans were a group of people who lived in Mesa Verde. They were farmers who lived in small homes known as Pithouses. A major population shift showed that some of the Puebloans beganm to move back to the cliff alcoves. archaeologist dont know the reason for this move. the only thing that they can say for sure is that it had a large impact on the life of the Puebloans.The lat tribe talked about were the Pavlopetri.             The place where the Pavlopetri lived is now submerged underwater. The site is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. This is thought of to be like an atlantian city. No one can say for sure if this city is Atlantis or if it is just a city that was submerged over time. The only fact that can be drawn from this is that this a a mistery.             There were three main tribes talked about in the passege and these tribes all had some important artifacts or facts about them that most likely had a large impact on life in these reagons.

We would have no way of life. I think that the discoveries of our ancestors/Native American tribes is important because, it teaches us about what people did before cell phones or any electronics, it gives Americans a history or a past, and it also teach us lessons.           First reason i think the discoveries of our native american or ancestors way of living is important is because, it shows us what people did before cell phones or any electronics. The native Americans didnt have calculators or a phone to see how much they had farmed or shot this week they had to record it somehow on 'strings.' Still today no one knows how to read these 'strings'. The strings back  then were called ''Quipus''. The strings they used were very colorful. Also they were filled with knots that no one knows what for though. Uncovering what these Quipus really mean is an ancient incan mystery.       The second reason i think that this is important is, because it gives americans history or a past. Americans need a history to build on. our ancestors are like the backbone of the U.S.. If there were no ancestors, there would be no backbone, no way of life, or anything. Our past is one of the things we can fall back on when everything else is gone. we were known for the Cherokee who were strong warriors. There would be no sence or intimidation in our wars now if it wasnt for them. There would be no spirit or patriotism in wars today. There would be no support for our troops. We would have no style in how we fight our wars.       The third reason i think its important is because it teaches us lessons. They messed up a few times and we can learn from that. People learn from other peoples mistakes. That can teach us a lesson in dily life too.The ancestors were verry spiritual, we could be as enthusiastic as them. they were also good with making supplies with what they had. we could learn alot.       I think it is important to do these thigs because it teaches us about what people did before cell phones or any electronics,it gives americans today a past to live up to,and it also teaches us lessons.

Well, about the Incas, anyway. We wouldn't have know how the earth was spread, and how it started. We can understand what has happened in the past that made our future like this.       Archaeologists have made discoveries that show us how life used to be many, many years ago. Plus, we would probably have less museums. Those are my thoughts on the finding of the Incas past.           Archaeologists have made discoveries that show us how we used to function ourselves with our surroundings. Cavemen had very different ways of living compared to ours, but they worked everything out. For example, when we don't understand something, we immediately try to figure it out. Well, that's whats I do. And that's probably what the cavemen used to do too.

It had no formal alphabet or system of writing. in order to to keep track of their callender and care for their livestock they made knots in colored strings called quipus. Europeans were amazed that they could run a huge empire useing strings to keep records. Archaeologists have founf many ancient quipus, but today, No one understands what they mean. the civilization lasted for nearly a hundred years (1438-1532).                             Long ago, before Europeans, a group of people living in the four corners region choose Mesa Verde for thier home. Eventualy building elaborate stone communities in the shelterd alcoves of the canyon walls. In the late A.D. 1200s, they left their homes and moved away. Mesa Verde National Park preserves a  spectacular reminder of the ancient civilization. Archeologists call these native people the Anasazi.

All these places have something interesting to be able to learn or know about. Archarologist find variety of information just to let peoples know about their past. When they discover all materials and objects of that place they go back to tell others just so that other people are able to know.                 The discoveries in Inca was so important because it helps people understand what life had been like for the people who lived there. Many wanted to find out what the people in Inca talked because everything was in a knot. Then, they went to discover many things such as civilization and different types of artifacts they had. Many learned about how life was like dealing with the environment people lived in Inca.                Most of the information they give in Pueblo-ans is about the ancestor time for many people. They give information about the tasks that the people in Puebloans did just to make it through life. Many of the are learning so must information about the past which many have discovered. They find many objects that they think are interesting and record it just so they could bring it back to show off their discover. Then that makes many people want to then go out to discover about that place like everyone else have. It also gives off information that people could learn more about Puebloan and how they lived to survive.               In Pavlopetri is mostly about the findings of myths that people believed in at this time. They gave a myth that was called the lost world,so many archaeologist wanted to go out and discover this to see if it was true. Many of them found so must important information on the things they had found underground. It gave most people an idea of how people lived back when they all were alive. They found new findings that could be worth something in this generation and new buildings that we may not believed was here.               Now we know that if it wasn't for archaeologist in our world we wouldn't be able to learn anything about all these special places. They all have something that we should learn about and know about. It gives us background information on the things we should know about many different places. Having many people like archaeologist could help us learn more about all types of places because that's how they spend mostly of there time doing. Not only that many of those archaeologist could become famous for the findings they have and not only that they give us artifacts that we are able to learn a lot more from. Just because people didn't write what happen during their time we have the ability to discover and find out ourselves.

Even thought you can not understand some of the things the incas said  you still know what they have gone through. The way the incas lived is very important because no one new the way they were. For example, the things they had like; pottery, silver, gold. They would make this to have for themselves. In conclusion, this is why the Incas are important.

Archaeologists have been studying how Inca and Puebloans have been discovered from different clues left behind and different kinds of research.  Inca left clues about their art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Puebloans have been famous for their skill at the craft, they were known as Basketmakers.           Ancient Inca used quipus to record calendars to keep a count of livestock.  The world know some stories about Inca from the passing of stories from generation to generation and also because of the old stories written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.  Inca artifacts have been discovered from the ruins of buildings and others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.  Inca textiles and clothing have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.  The Inca sites were disturbed by looters or treasure hunter, who take anything that might be valuable.          Puebloans were also called Anasazi also known as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'.  Like most civilizations, hunting and gathering were their main livelihood until it got replaced with farming.  Puebloans lived in pit houses that were usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. Pithouses didn't last long until A.D. 750 that evolved into kivas.  Puebloans use of baskets declined because of the widespread use of pottery.  A major population shift was when the people began to move back into the cliff alcoves.  Kivas were used for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop.  Mesa Verde was deserted due to drought and crop failures.  Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.          Archaeologists studied these ancient civilizations not only for the enjoyment, but for the history of it.  Today we the people would know nothing about our the past life of how people lived without all this technology and advancement.  Both of the civilizations used their natural resources to uncover their daily life.

The Incas controlled an empire using knots to keep records, and the others did a big thing too. Puebloans were basketmakers, and the Pavlopetri had discovered the underwater city, Atlantis.       Now today, no one knows what the knots mean. If someone could decode it, it would be a huge discovery. Clues left behind from the Inca help archaeologists find out how the Inca lived their life. Some information archaeologists know come from oral history, o stories passed from generation to generation. Passing stories was a very important way to preserve a communities history. Other ways archaeologists know information is from artifacts. Some Inca artifacts may be made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. These materials last for a long time, even if buried for years. They can be found in the ruins of buildings, or in graves for the use of the afterlife. Some information may be hard to identify because of looters. Looters rob the artifacts from places, making it hard for archaeologists to study the life of the Inca.

The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of wrting. That makes it hard for historians, or people like us who want to learn about history, to learn about something you can't read. Archaeologists have found quipas but do not know what they mean. To this day, no one knows what it means. A lot of people want to know how we know anything about Ancient Inca if we cant read anything. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, trancsportation, and way of life. This makes it easy for archaeologists to piece together details of Inca.  Sometimes we learn about things from stories passed down from generation to generation.   What about the civilization Mesa Verde National Park and their world.   About 1,400 years ago, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. They built elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Archaeologists have called these people Anasazi for 'the ancient ones.'

So, how are we suppose to know what they did back then? Historians have discovered thousands of records from past civilizations. Ancient civilization's records have solved multiple problems and given us some of the objects we have today.               The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri have been very beneficial towards how to we have certain objects. The Inca had used different ways to keep track of the days and livestock like quipus (colored string). There has also their records has to us about their enviroment they were in during that time. They do this through stones, pottery, and other artifacts. The Ancestral Puebloans were specially known for their crafting skill. They made pithouses and the bow and arrow which was more advanced than the weapon before it the atlatl. They started to evolve and using stone instead of sticks. The Pavlopetri is known as the most planned town that was sunken to the bottom of the sea. There are other places that are older but not as planned as this. It has more civilized areas than other places under the sea. It is believed that this wa how atlantis started. This finding as further developed our history to settel the claim of atlantis.               In conclusion all these civilizations has helped us get to our present day and learn of how we got to our present day. These findings have also teach us of their locations and religions. We probably wouldnt be where we are today if we didnt have these civilizations.

The reason the discoveries about the Incas is so important is because the archaeologists learned more about the terrain they lived on such as mountains and coasts could damage artifacts. Another reason the discoveries of the Incas are so important are because people start to learn more about how big their empire was and it rivaled the expanse of the roman empire. The final reason that the discoveries about the Incas are important is because we learned how they governed their empire on a system of colored knots.       The discoveries about the Puebloans are important. The reason the discoveries about the Puebloans are important is because we learned that they lived in Mesa Verde. Another reason the discoveries about the Puebloans are so important are because we learned they lived their 1,400 years before European arrived to America. The third reason the discoveries about the Puebloans are important are because archaeologsts   know how the Puebloans built houses.

Some people say that discoveries made about that time are irellevant as now us in the modern era have no need to study these primitive civilization, but these people have not thought to consider the benefits.  These ancient civilizations can help us to piece together the history of our world.  With this information we could improve our world and the lives of the people in it. These civilizations should not be taken for granted because of their major contribution to the world.       An excellent example of a civilization like these is the Inca.  The discoveries about   this civilization  have helped expand the world's knowledge of exploration in South America.  We learned of the type of clothing they wore, what food they ate, and where they lived. Using the knowledge we can figure out what was the lifestyle of the Inca was liek before the Spanish invaded.  Most of what we knwo about the Inca we had learned from spanish accounts as the Inca had no written language and kept track of all their data using colored strings alled quipis.  By cross refrencing the remains of these places with their oral history and written accounts Archeologists have been able to find mout new information about the Inca. These new facts have helped weave together the Inca's part in the tapestry of history.       Two other important civilizations are the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri. These both   provide information about their homelands. The Puebloans are a North American civilization that lived in the the south west deserts. This civilization has helped us learn about the cliff dwelling civilizatioon which are the descendants if the Puebloans. This has solved a mystery people have been trying to answer for years. The Pavlopetri were a Greek civlization which was submerged under the sea. This city can explain the rumors of the mythical city of Atlantis. This also solves a large mystery in recorded history. Both these civlizatiosn have helped to clear the fog of history so that we can see the truth.       All civlizations discovered have donated to historians world wide helping them fill   in the blanks in history. The Inca, Puebloan, and Pavlopetri all have made major contributions to world hsitory. We should protect and study these sites along with others to protect the tales that they hold.

Our knowledge came from the Inca's aritifacts,or objects from what they had left behind. Mostly from the stone,pottery,gold,or silver that they had left behind. Those materials last a very long time. They have been buried for hundred of years. Ruins of buildings were also found. Inca textiles and clothing remarkbly survived. Ancient materials like cloth usually dont survive. Some Inca sites might have been botherd by thieves or hunter. Inca language was not understood by Spaniards. Passing on stories was a great part of Inca history. We know some stories because some were written down by Europeans who came to the empire in 1532. Population grew over some years. Fires were built. Some of the empire are underwater for the Greek. Artifacts we find are usually around thousand years of age. Alantis is a underground city that is a myth. A myth that kept studies going underwater.

And most of the things we learn from ancient civilizations will give us a better understanding of what they ate and did for fun or for military. Knowing their way of life will let us understand their language and other means of transportation and most of that can be used on modern day building and/or transportation systems. Just like knowing their military tactics it can also be used in modern day use.            The Peubloans and Pavlopetri gave us a better under standing of craftsmanship and how we can use their techniques to make our own pottery, weapons, and houses even. It doesn't need to be about how they make the item itself it's how they did it that we might need to know. They also gave a better understanding to growing crops in the deserts and cliffs.            The Incas showed a better understanding to the making and building of bridges from being in high-altitudes. They had also developed their own arrogation channels to work on mountain slopes, and this is very helpful to the use of farms on the sides of mountains. The Incas also helped in the making of houses, pottery, and weapons.            These are the reason why the findings of these ancient ruins are so important and useful to modern day society. Also descendants of these ancient civilizations like to know more about their ancestors. And to most people these findings are invaluable. This is why the finding of these ancient ruins are so important to find.

They use these discoveries to Several of the things we know about our ancestors were learned by the work of archaeologists. Some examples of these civilizations are the Incans, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Artifacts found from the Incans, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri help archaeologists piece together history.       Artifacts left behind by the Inca help archaeologists get an idea of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Archaeologists study the clues left behind and piece them together to find out what the life of these ancient people was like. Things like pottery or clothing that were found tell archaeologists these things. Sites studies give archaeologists a good idea of what life was like in Peru in the time of the Inca. Bodies found in the frozen peaks of the Andes stay in good shape due to the ice. These bodies can be analyzed to found out how the lived and how they died. With all this found, archaeologists know a lot about the Inca 500 years after their civilization ended.       Archaeologists were also able to get a good idea of how the Puebloans lived by analyzing artifacts and structures. We know that they lived in villages. The baskets found show evidence in decline in quality, possibly because of the introduction of pottery. The structures found also show accumlated skills and tradition. Discoveries found by archaeologists helped us find this all out.       By exploring the reamins of the Pavlopetri, archaeoligsts were able to understand what their lives were like. Exploration revealed several buildings, courtyards, and religious places. Evidence also shows that the city was occupied 5,000 years ago. By exploring the remains of the Pavlopetri, not only did we learn how people lived, but the discovery also interested natural scientists.       The information pieced together gave the world a better understanding of our ancestors. It is important to know the history of the past so we can not make the same mistakes made before, and the discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri helped us understand a lot about their civilization.

A team of archaeologists and marine geologists called thissettlement that dates back 5,000 years ago Pavlopetri.                                                     This site stradles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Pavlopetri has believed to been under water around 1000 BC. Even do 40 years a British oceanographer had discovered the site. But only this year that marine archaeologists plus digital technology was able to survey the ruins of Pavlopetri properly.                                                                                                               .                                                 The shifting sands and settlement's enclosure in this protected bay revealed everything buildings, courtyard, main streets, and religious stuctures. This investigation also revealed 9,000 of new buildings. But there was something more surprising, amonumental with a large retangle hall. Pavlopetri might have been elite.                            The theories believed by marine geologists said that Pavlopetri was sunked by an earthquake or a tsunami. But this was a the inspriation for Plato allegorical tale of the lost city of Atlantis.

They were completely forgotten about. They were also almost completely destroyed by spainiards. They also fill in a large gap of human history. Also, at the time they were probably the most advanced civilization obn earth when the started off. Then europe started to advance and sent explorers over to the incan empire, which was preceeded by peubloans and pavlopetri. The spainish were not highly interested in the mexicans culture and mainly just killed them off for their riches.    The ancient civilizations were, however, very interesting. They had made giant temples -for worshipping and giving sacrifices- that were made from perfectly square blocks. The tools theywould have needed for this were not have thought to have been made untill much later. They also had the first recordkeeping system of theirtime time, called the quipus, which used strings for recording.       They were masters of pottery and aiculture. The had made irrigation systems, that were ALSO very advanced. They left behind many artifacts that had been preserved by the damp soil. From these artifacts we have learned that they also had lots of plates bowls and gold. Yes gold.    Now you see that they were very advanced for there time. They were wealthy in gold, compared to Europe. They had made many of the first advancedments of civilization. They were very important.

But, archaeologists can have trouble trying to find the artifacts. Why is that? Possibly because they are underground, underwater, old, and broken. The artifacts we see in meuseams today are not even close to the amount of artifacts you can find in 1 place. The question is: are these artifacts going to be put together and fit to be studied?        In an article from the 'National Geographic', they explaint the Inca and where they lived. Also, in the article, they explain how artifacts can find inscriptions that aren't accurate or find cloth that is destroyed by dampness. Remember these artifacts have been there since possible 1000 years ago, probably longer than that.        Another example is from an article be 'National Parks', the article explains that there were a group of people called 'Puebloans'. These people settled in Mesa Verde, Spanish for green table. In the article they explain that artifacts can be bad quality and dug under the ground.         1 more article explains 'Atlantis'. If you haven't heard of Atlantis, it is a story about a kingdom that is under the ocean and is able to rise back above water. Many believe it is real, many don't . But, this article explains alot about how most artifacts are underwater(too far down) or underground.         Basically, there are many issues to finding artifacts. It is not easy nor are the artifacts in perfect shape. I am not saying you shouldn't be an archaeologist, I am saying that some artifacts can be very hard to find.

The Inca's are so important because some knowledge comes from artifacts or objectes left behind and some Inca textiles and clothing were left behind. The outher thing that makes it important is that archaeologists can compare things to the sites with the Spaniard's. The most important thing that archaeologists discovered when the last king of the Inca was murdered by the Spaniards'. They killed the king in 1532 and took over the empire.              The outher important thing is the Puebloans the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. They are filled with craft and they make baskets and pithouses. The other thing that is important is the potery that they did they made bowls and outher things.

The Inca peoples opened the gateway to modern historical record methods. the Inca used strings with knots on them  to keep records of their calender and to keep track of livestock. This method, called quipus, shocked the first Europeans that they coulld run a huge empire with these colored strings. The final Inca king was murdered in 1532 when the Spaniards took over their empire.             Puebloans were excellent crafters, they were often known as Basketmakers. They formerly were nomadic, but began settling on Mesa tops. They first hunted with spears, that was called atlatl, eventually acquiring the bow and arrow for hunting.              Pavlopetri is the sunken settlement over 5,000 years old. It is believed to have sunk in 1000 BC. there was a world of buildings, rock-cut tombs, main streets, and religiuos structures.             In all, these three ancient peoples and civilization show us many new skills otherwise never know to the modern world.

While I was researching I had to go up into the moutain tops to find some artifacts and I had to go way down to the ocean floor. The undersea city is near Neapolis. I also found the homes that they lived in such as pithouses. A pithouse leter evovled into the Kiva.

It may fill in holes where something was not known, tell about the daily lives of the people that lived there, or it may just contribute to information already known.           The ancient empire of the Incas ruled for almost one-hundred years, but was then overthrown by the Spaniards. The origin of the Incas is completely unknown. Along with where they came from, their daily lifestyles are also not known well. What we know the most about is their stories, tools, and how they were overthrown. When archaeologists found the remains of an ancient Inca civilization, some new things were learned. They had worshiped some of the mountain peaks around them and they found what is called a quipus. It was used to keep track of days and many other things.           An ancient people known as Ancestral Puebloans inhabited an area called Mesa Verde. They had lived there for more than seven-hundred years then left everything they had and moved somewhere else. Where and why they moved is still unknown to archaeologists, but because they left all of their belongings behind, they could still learn about how they lived. They were mostly farmers but they would also hunt. The main weapon they used was the bow and arrow, which was more efficient than the atlatl, a spear thrower. The first lived in dug-out houses but then eventually moved to the cliffs. They only lived in cliffs for about one-hundred years before they disappeared. The only reason that archaeologists think that these people left is because there was a drought at about the same time.            In southern Greece, archaeologists found a sunken settlement that dates back about five-thousand years. It is the oldest submerged town in the world. How this settlement sank is still not known but  it is assumed that it is because of either sea level changes, ground subsidence or both. This settlement is thought to be the one that inspired the Atlantis myth. Not all of it has been searched yet, but entire buildings and courtyards have been discovered.            All of these discoveries are important to history. They give us insight to many ancient civilizations. We learn about the past about the people before us and where some of the myths and legends may have come from. To sum it all up, these discoveries teach us about ancient lifestyles, religions and the origin of legends.

You are thrilled about the topic but you can decide on the information you have to find about. You decide to go to the library. The librarian gives you books to read and search up information. The amazing discoveries about the Incal, the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri. You see the Inca's of Peru which had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock.            The Puebloans are the first people to settle in the Mesa Verde. They where known as Basktetmakers for their skill at the craft. They lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main liveihood. Last but not least the Pavlopetri where people who lived in the Ancient Civilizations. All these things where very important. They all took part of ancient civiliizations by the artifacts and history passed on.

They had there very own language and they had tied up strings to help keep track of the live stock. There also was a lot of clues left behind about them. There were clues about there religion, art, agriculture, government, transpotation, and ways of life. Today the stories of them are still fresh and are passed down from generation to generation.       Next, is the Puebloans. They settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They had a lot of skills like crafts. There farming replaced there hunting. But they lived in a small village so they know how to make pottery and they also know how to shoot a bow and arrow. In A.D. 750 they started to began building houses above ground. When they built them they were all beside each other and they were in a long row.       The Pavlopetri is very important to. They found the city that had sunk. They didn't really tell anyone because they wanted to keep it a secret. But they are stil doing research on that today. It has been a very long time but people are still very curious about it and want to know a lot about it.

Second is that they taught us of many things and they made many things we still use today.       First is they started many things.

Without them making such a big invention like this the writing of languages would be way different and it would be alot harder to learn other languages.       Lastly is that they taught us things and they made things. They made differnet types of architecture and transportation and pottery.

The first of which are the Incas. There isn't much information about the Incas. One of the few things we know is is        they kept track of things by tieing a knot on a string. Archeoligists are confounded on how such a large empire kept track       of things by using simple string. Most of what we know about the Incas is known by oral history.

They are important that treasure hunters or looters look for treasure and valuable things. Archaeologists study sites that can contain treasure or valuable things because they need to learn as much information about it. They take notes, take a picture of the artifacts that they find.          Where it came from and what happened to it, are important things that it should be learned about. Incas lived high in the Andes. Most of the Incas lived in high places. For archaeologists to study these things, there are the high-altitude archaeologists, they climb mountains and high places with their equipment. The things that they find needs to be studied after they climb down the mountain for them to study it, that all makes it harder for them, and harder for the looters to find the Inca sites.           The Puebloans were called Anasazi which is from a Navajo word 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies' from the archaeologists. Now they are called Ancestral Puebloans. Mesa Verda, the place where the first Ancestral Puebloans have settled. The Puebloans lived in pithouses, instead of hunting, they farm.

The way they live what artifacts they used and other things in their culture. All the discoveries about them, like the Inca, have let us know how they lived and where they lived. Clues left behind by the Inca let us know how they keep track of their records lie the calendar are out of string.         Like the Inca, the Greeks had also left clues like their lost city. Which left the theory of Atlantis. The lost city left behind many artifacts that told what the people who lived there used at that time. The city is unique as it has remains dating from 2800 to1200 BC, long before they glory days of classical Greece.         Both of these civilizations are different, but they both give us things to learn from. The Inca were in their area a long time ago. The clues left behind the Inca show their art, government, transportation, religion, and way of life. The lost city also left clues that describe it. How it was, and when it was.        So this is why both this civilizations are important. Because of what we learned from them. It proves that they lived a different way of life than the one we live in now. Every civilization is important and we can always learn from it.

It's exciting too to find out what hey really mean, and it isn't always easy finding out what they mean.The ancient Inca is about the alphabet of writing. They created a different way of writing and letters than we do today. That's how the alphabet became started in our world. The Inca made knots in colored strings and they were called quipus. They recored calanders to keep the counts of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed they could use strings to keep a calander of livestocks or records. Arechaeologists found the quipus. Which are the calanders they kept. No one today can read the colorful strings, so it's hard to find out what they meant back in the long ago past.       Most people don't know about the civilization back then, but that's what scientists and arcaeologists do. They discover where it came from and what it means. 1438-1532 ruled a South American empire that rivaled the ancient Rome. Clues were left behing by Inca froma portriat fromtheir living. The had a portrait from thier religion, art, and especially argicultutre. They were great at argicultutre back then. They kept their livestock well and had plenty of food from farms. By studying all these clues arcaeologists can put together details of the Inca lifestyles.       Some of what people know came from histories form the Inca. That was passed on from generations. Passing on these stories was important to have the community's history. We know some of the old stories from the Europeans. They written them down to be shared in the future. They also described the Inca in their diaries, and letters. Legends also tell what happened in the civilzation.The rest of the knowledge of  Inca came from artifacts that most likley may not be as true as the real stories from thier past.       The arceaologists also found out ways from their past by finding graves and their bodies to test to see what mgiht of lived back then. And what kind of clothing they wore. Some of their clothing has survived damanging weather. They still have peices of textile left that has also survived many things. More than just drawings has survived form the civilization.       Some Inca sites have been bothered by treasure hunters. They take anything they see that could be cherished for a long time, or something that is very strongly rich in their life. Arcaeologists protect them from finding something the might need to find out more about the Inca past. They carefully dig them up with out riping or tearing it. Whatever they find would be worth so much. They find anything form the past and report it to scientists who study on it and make a very well inference on whatis was or what it was used for.       The Inca lived in high mountains in the Andes. In fact, they may have worshiped the mountain peaks. The Andes mounains makes it harder on the arcaaeologists because it's such a highelevation sometmes they need to use oxogeyn for finding out about their past.       Puebloans are important to our history too. They first setteled down in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550 years ago. They are know to make baskets, that is thier skill of craft. They replaced hunting for farming and gathering. They lived in Pithouses which are small houses they would call them, but it looked more like a tipee. Pithouses sunk in to the gournd,a nd they had a living room and a small kithchen for cooking and eating food.They aslo learned how to make pottery and make bowls and arrows for hunting including spears too.       Their popoullation muliplied after A.D. 750. Then they began buliding housese above ground, with walls mad of poles and mud. The made many houses rowing against each other and going down curving along the road. They soon had stone walls as their protection of their house. They also made pottery out of stone.       These people all had an interesting past that scientists and arcaeologists had discovered. Some not yet. They take whatever they find and make it into a reasonable explenation on the civilitzation. The past they found out about has a lot more to it than this, but they will keep making new discoveries for the agriculture, livestock, farming, living, social, and religious views from these old civilizations.

How did the Incans keep track of their livestock? Why did the Puebloans move to caves and alcoves? Is there really and underwater city called Atlantis? Researchers have searched near and far for these answers and now they have the answers.       Despite the fact that the Incans were generally less integent than us modern day humans, they had complex and amazing ways of doing things. They yse a quipus, which were colored knots made into a calender to keep track of livestock. But researchers don't know what the knots were for. Cool right?       Puebloans of Mesa Verde went from pithouses to caves. Why? Archaeologists think it's something that is pychological and might have to do with conditions of the elements and weather.       Atlantis is a myth, but researchers have found some debris of a torn up town under water. How is this? The marine researchers think that a tsunami might've hit or maybe an earthquake shook the town to pieces. But these myths keep underwater exploration going.

Like the pluming how they used that and the way they structured their city and the design of their homes/buildings.  from their farming to their walk way streets and especially the art and agriculture how they kept time by tieing knots in a string to designing rock for symbols.       theses are so important facts that state that learning our history is very important to us.

As we keep discovering artifacts and information about these civilizations, we are able to further understand how they have effected are lives and why they are no longer with us.   To start off, the Inca tribe was a civilization for nearly a hundred years (1438-1532) that ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expansion of ancient Rome. Today we have been able to find artifacts, items that these people have left behind, to piece together a grand picture of the Inca religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. We can also thank the art of story telling for what we know today about this civilization. Stories passed down from generation to generation were an important way to preserve history back then. 'We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.' A quote from Beth Bruber's Acient Inca: Archaeology unlocks the Secrets of the Past. Bruber also states that 'the most importnat things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.' The fall of the Inca tribe was due to the Spaniards murdering the last Inca king in 1532 and taking over the empire. To find out the origin of the Inca, archaeologists use some of the most advanced technigues in the world. Using aerial photography can help them see things such as patterns in ancient monuments,that they cannot see from the ground. This is also a good technique becuase the Inca lived high up in the Andes mountains, making the job of a archarologist much more difficult. From the Inca civilization we are even able to see bodies and learn about how these people lived, and how they died.   Now moving on to the Puebloans. About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the Four Corners  region chose Mesa Verde as their home. For over 700 years these people flourished here, eventually building elaborate communities, but then in the late A.D 1200s, generations left and moved away. Today Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. From the first being known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft to the ancestral Puebloans being kniown as cliff dwellers, as that is where they lived. Through drout and crop failures,socail and political probllems, the people simply wanted to look for new opportunities elssewhere. Today we still do not know the exact story of these people, but 'whatever may have happened,some of today's Pueblo people,andmaybe other tribes, aredescendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.' a quote from Roy Anderson's Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World.    Finally the Lost Greek city. Could this be the city that may have unspired the Atlantis myth? Beneath the water off sourthern Greece there is a site of sunken settlement covering 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. only this year were marine archaeologists able to properly ssurvey the ruins with digital technology. it revealed a wrold of buildings, courtyeards,main streets, rock-cut tombs,and religious stuctures. These artifacts opened up a whole other world of exploration. We could now see this once prospering city come to life again. Marine geologists have yet to work out why this settlement sank. ''It is signifact because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied.'' said elias spondylis, co-directer of the surveyand head of Greece'sunderwater antiquities department. Although there is much more to be found under the water this represents a frozen moment of the past.   Overall, all three of these civilizations that once propered as we do today are very important as each and everyday we are able to extend our knowledge with knew artifacts and information. should we be questioning our fate? what will happen to our mondern world civilization? Is it already crumbling beneath our feet?

Why does it matter how these people lived their everyday lives? This all happened in the past. Well, it matters because the artifacts and ruins of cities left behind shows how ancient peoples lived. All of the items found is history. Archeologists examine these and see what they were used for, what religion they practiced, how their government worked, what clothes they wore, and what foods they ate. Because of these discoveries we see that these peoples were more technologically advanced then we thought.                             Archeologists discovered that the Inca government kept records by the knotting of strings. They also learned by hearing stories told by people passed down from generation to generation and some written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Although, some of these are legends, not real stories. Some Inca textiles and clothing were also found. Archeologists also dug up objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver that have been buried for a hundereds of years. Archaeoligists have discovered many new things thanks to all that they left behind.                                 The Puebloans kept no records. What they did leave behind was their homes that they lived their everyday lives in. Archaeologists found these and learned new information about these people. They were extremely skillfull in building and crafts. The information they have on the puebloans isn't very good. But, as they discover more artifacts they can find out more about them.                      What the archaelogists and scientist found was a city underwater in Greece. Now they can figure out the structures of their cities and what they consisted of. 30,000 square meters of ocean are covered by this city. People go down and examine the ruins. They figure out from the ancient artifacts that the city was extremely important.                       Artifacts of these peoples are extremely important. Without these how else would people today find out the past? They wouldn't. This is why artifacts of the Inca, Puebloans, Pavelotri are so important. Now we know more and more about them. We are learning more each day. It is important to know the past.

They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on Mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. These were fairly prosperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud. Pueblo people, and maybe other tibes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.

For example, in the article Ancient Inca Archaeology Unlocks the secredts of the past  by beth Gruber, Gruber writes,' Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soliders and priests. They described the inca in there diaries.'

We know much about these people and their ways of life, but how? Through discoveries ranging from ceramic pots to sunken cities, we have obtained the knowledge needed to describe these groups.       The Inca had no formal alphabet or writing systems, so how do we know what we know? They left behind clues. Portraits were left behind by the Inca showed of their religion, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Oral stories have also been passed down from generation to generation, preserving a community's culture.   Stories written by early Europeans have also been found. Inca textile and clothing survived remarkably as well, thanks to the Peru's dry deserts.       About 1,400 years ago, the civilization know as the Puebloans chose Mesa Verde as their home. The first Puebloans were leading a 'more settled way of life'. Their first homes, pithouses, were shelters containing a firepit with air deflector, an antechamber containing storage bins or pits, and an entrance the home located at the top. Many of the Puebloans were skilled a weaving baskets and other useful items. By A.D. 1000, these people had advanced from basic construction to skillful stone masonry.       The myth of the Greek city, Atlantis, has been told many times over the years, but all it is is a myth. Marine geologists have used the information, however, to learn about and discover a sunken city. Off the coast of the Greek city Neapolis, the submerged city was discovered and its roots were amazingly traced back to some 1,200 years ago. Ceramic were found dating back to the stone age. This suggested that the settlement was occupied almost 5,000 years ago! The biologists have researched the 9,000 square meter city.

The discovery of the quipus was to keep records like a calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient colored knots known as quipus but even today no one knows what the knots mean. Understanding the ancient Inca is like solving a very big mystery if no one can read the storys of the colored knots.         Peubloans abanded there home, Mesa Verde. Now it is a national park. Peubloans have lived there before the Europeans have came to the Americas. About 1,400 years ago. Puebloans built a elaborate stone community in the sheltered alcoves of the canon walls. They eventually left Mesa Verde in the late 1,200 A.D.

In the ruins, many remains from the Ancient Inca's are found. The Inca's were very knowledgable by instead of creating a writing system they created a string system. They tie knots in the strings as a way of keeping a calendar. Archeaologists found ruins of the Inca architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life.                        Another ancient civilization founded by archaeologist is the Ancestral Puebloans. The Puebloans lived in the Mesa Verde region around A.D. 550-750 and lived in pithouses, later on they built stone communities. They were nomadic, moved around a lot, known as great basketmakers, and learned to make bows and arrows to hunt prey.                                               'The Lost City' is the ruins of a city that must have prospered long ago, but somehow ended up under the sea. Thses remains of the city is what inspired the story of Atlantis. The Lost City was found in the waters of southern Greece and was a setttlement about 5,000 years before it sunk. In the city marine archaeologists found ruins of buildings, streets, courtyards, religious structures, and tombs made of rock. Some marine geologists made theories of how the city sunk including: sea level changes, earthquakes, or tsunamis.

Also some of the old stories have been written years ago! Over 400 years ago! Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.         Some Inca Sites have been distrubed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some tresures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. Or others site would be reported to archeologist, who can dig them up carefully. They provide the best idea of all times about life in Peru before and during Inca rule. archeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and photograph any artifacts that they can even find.         Among the most imortant things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happend to it. The fall of the inca is easy to date because the Spaniards murderded the last Inca king in 1532 and took over all of the empire. The orgins of the inca are more difficult to trace the area where they all lived had long been inhabited by all different peoples and races. Archeologists have to be careful and makesure exactly which people bult which site.         About 1400 years ago, lomg before europeans explored North America a group of people living in he four corners region chose mesa verde for their homes. For more than 700ntears they AND THEIR descendits lived in flourshed here eventually building elaborate stone communities in the shelterd alcoves of the canyon walls.

But with learning so much about them we still do not know why they usd knots and what they mean. This is one of the biggest misteries about the Incas. These callenders are important because we have been able to revise them and use them as par t of are callender.

Inca's would tie together strings and make knots called quipus to keep track of the calendar so to keep count of livestock. When the first Europeans came they were shocked that the Inca's could contain a huge empire just by using string. A hundred of years a go through the years of 1438-1532 a South American empire left behind the artifacts Inca people like their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, and transportation.  Aarcheologists found more artifacts like gold, silver, and pottery.    When archaeologists go study something they write down notes, and take photograph of any artifacts they may find. In the year of 1532 the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in history. Archaeologists must take with the advanced technology in the world to discover the truth. The Inca's lived the Andes where the highest mountain peaks and when Inca's died they were buried in caves, it would make very difficult for looters to get them. It can also make the job of archaeologists even more harder because of the high altitude of the mountains.

The Inca are extinct but yet still 'alive'. I say alive because so many people want to learn as much as they can about them. An interesting fact about them is that they took colored string and tied knots in the string to keep count of livestock and also used the string to record the calendar. They called the string 'quipus'. These people were smart enough to record the calendar, keep count of their livestock, and run a huge empire, with just a piece of colored string that had knots tied in it. That's pretty amazing!          Now the Puebloans. They were also smart. They chose a place called Mesa Verde for their home, and  they flourished there, and eventually built elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of canyon walls. But sadly, they later on in the late A.D. 1200's, they left their homes and moved away in the span of one or two generations.             Last but not least, the Pavlopetri. This place in a sunken settlement that dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heros and because of the size and wealth of details, it is unprecedented. This is the oldest underwater town without a doubt. This town has remains that date back from 2800 to 1200 BC. 40 years ago tis town was discovered by a British oceanographer, we have only resently been able to servey the ruins properly with the aid of digital technology. Due to settlement's enclosure in a protected bay and shifting sands, buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures were all revealed. In addition, thousands of shards of potery repleted the seabed.          That's my essay on why these three undewater towns are inportant.

But are they really important? If you said no i hope to change your mind and prove to you how very important these findings are!            First let's start with the Inca.Archaeologists found that the Inca used the quipus to record the calendar and keep count of the lifestock. This was an important finding because we had no clue on how they kept records. Also they have found many bodies of the Inca, preserved from the cold of the Andes Mountains. This is also an important find because it helps us see the how they died and also how they lived.           Now let's start with the Puebloans. We know, due to archaeologists findings, that the Puebloans main livelihood was farming. Archaeologists found that the people lived in pithouses. We know that as they went on that they changed how they lived, but at a time went back to how their ancestors lived. These are very important because it shows how they evolved and how they still kept a hold to their ancestors life's.            Lastly, let's take a look at the Pavlopetri. Archaeologists found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. This in itself is an amazing finding because this suggested that it was occupied around 5,000 years ago. This was amazing because this was 1,200 years earlier than what they thought!           So as you can see, the findings of archaeologists are not just something you can look past. All of these findings prove something in its own way that we didn't know the day before. And as the saying goes ' you always learn something new each day'.

They lefted many clues behind, starting from the portraits. Scientist used the portraits to see what was the climate in inca of peru. To get information they had to look at these portraits because they could not read inca foreign langauge.       Inca of Peru also was the first european group that had a huge empire.They had a calendar to keep count of their livestock. and without any who could read this the scientists still have no clue what it could possible mean.Inca was a roman city were most of the greeklogy myths come from.

The Incas made their own inventions up such as knots in a colored string, they use this to keep count of livestock. The incas formed a major portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportation, and way of life. Incas believed in many traditions;they killed their pets and buried as mummys too cary them on in after life. They had many other different arrivals in the empire,some of their visitors were spanish soldiers and priest. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. They did not speak Inca language well. They didnt really understand what the Inca told them. The rest of the Inca comes from artifacts anf the things they left behind.   Almost 1,400 years ago,before European discovered North America, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. More then 700 years they lived here and they started building homes and making pottery out of stones. After the late A.D. 1200s, the Europeans left their homes looking for food and a new homes. Way before they left they were known as the Basketmakers for the things they build and made. Later they started to settele here,making a settled easier life.They build Pithouses clustered into small villiages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. The Europeans latered learned how to make bow and arrows,their weapons too kill animals for food and clothing. Thats then later the Europeans populations started to increase so they started killing more animals,their food moved so the Europeans followed their.Leading them to find North America.   The secrets of the lost city Atlantis, this was one of the worlds inspired enduring myths.Atlanntis was a city that had wealth for people and thats when Europeans started traveling to Atlantis.This is what many people believed, but then the city sunk under the sea.THE OCEAN FLOOR. This famous city was discovered by a British underwater photographer 40 years ago. It had revealed a world of buildings,courtyards,main streets,rock-cut tombs and religous structures.The ocean floor was also half covered with thousands of pottery,so this lead to the city of Atlantis   Imagine with out finding none of these results we probaly wont know about the alphabet or calender,also pottery;like what we use today glass bowls.This will also probaly effect our history,we wont know nothing about these things.

They didn't leave any archives for historians to study or do test's on them.   The Incas made knots to record something on the calender and they would send messages by horse .The first Europeans that  first met the Incas thought that they would run a huge empire using string to keep records.The civilization was from (1438-1532) years ago.Some of the Inca's nolage  comes from oral history.   Many of the Europeans had arrived in the 1532 the visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They had described the Incas in diary's . The Incas worshiped many mountain peaks. Many of the Inca's places that they would be a lot in they are very high places so you could tell that the Incas liked high places.Archeologist find body's in good shape that they use modern scanning equipment to find out how they died and what happened to them.   Many Incas were sacrificed to worship there gods and there mountain  places that they have that no one will find them . No one knows what the knots mean yet.Its a mystery trying to solve the knot problem and trying to figure about there past and what had happened back then. There is an important portrait about there religion and how it was used.The Incas passed down many of the phew discoveries they had formal alphabetical system.    They  didn't leave any archives for historians to study or do test's on . Many of the archeologist are trying to unlock the knots nolage and why did they mostly use them for .The Inca's were probably less important than the Aztecs and more important than the Mayan's. More and more archeologist try to look for clues to unlock the secrets of them. Some archeologist think that they were very short but had good weaponry and would be easy to defeat against any one or any thing in the wild they would built there houses out of straws and dirt that they would have more protection.   After (1532 )no one knows what has happened to them or were they are at. More and more time passes people still want to unlock the secrets of the Inca's no matter what happens or what doesn't happened the archeologist will probably unlock at least the knot mystery .   once they unlock it they will tell the world and the world would be more interested and the people would want to hear more about the Incas and how they had lived on from year to year and there religion.The people of the Incas are probably now in our Society and living among us like a normal person like us.Most of us wonder if they could of lasted longer only if the Europeans. Artifacts were found from the Incas and other objects were left behind. Ancient artifacts are usually made out of stone and pottery,gold and silver. Many of the artifacts would last longer than anything else.Such materials last longer if they are made of stone or metal or probably gold,silver .Many of the material had been buried and they will probably had lasted longer.

The Incas are from Peru and they had no formal alphabet or system of writing. The Inca mad knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed thay they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone being able to read the knots the Incas is more like a big mystery.             Many people find lost ruins fascinating. The fact that the ruins are really old many people wanna exlpore how the Inca lived. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. The visitors who met the Inca were Spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts that were left behind by the Inca. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniard's accounts of the Inca. Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.             About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops.             These were fairly prosperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. About A.D. 750 they began building their own houses above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. The people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Pottery also changed, from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before. About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before.              The Cliff Dwellers is next on my list. Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1800s, archaeologists have sought to understand these people's lives. We will never know the whole story: they left no written records and much that was important in their lives has perished. Yet for all their silence, these structures speak with a certain eloquence. The structures are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. Based on modern Pueblo practice, Ancestral Puebloans may have used kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. Kivas were gathering places and sometimes also places to weave. Pilasters supported a beam-and- mud roof. Entry was by ladder through a hole in the center of the roof.               Using nature to advantage, Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction material was sandstone thay they shaped into rectangualar blocks about the size of a loaf of bread. The motar between the blocks was a mix of mud and water. Rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, space enough for two or three persons. Isolated rooms in the rear and on the upper levels were generally used for storing crops. Underground kivas, ceremonial chambers, were built in front of the rooms. The kiva roofs created open courtyards where many daily routines took place. Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. Several theories offer reasons for their migration. We know that the last quarter of the A.D. 1200s saw drought and crop failures but these people had survived earlier droughts. Maybe after hundreds of years of intensive use the land and its resources soils, forests, and animals were depleted. Perhaps there were social and political probles, and the people simply looked for new opportunities elsewhere.                A diver explores the sunken settlement beneath the waters of southern Greece. The diver is exploring a myth called Atlantis. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most largest search. The sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of  Homer's heroes. There is no doubt that Atlantis is the oldest submerged town in the world. The remains are from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. There are other sunken sites in the world but this one seems to be one of the biggest of all time. Atlantis is unique than other sites because its considered to be planned towns. This myth lays about 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese.               What they found in the ruins surpassed all expectations. It revealed a world of  buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. It was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. During this operation they also revealed over 9,000 square meters of  new buildings. More than any underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. Elia Spondylis co-directed the survey as the head of Greece's underwater antiquities department. Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. As the world's oldest submerged city it is truly amazing. It not only shows how people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists.              Locals in the nearby town of Neapolis are delighted. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.

Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.Nearly a hunderd years (1432-1532) ruled a south american empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient rome. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life.We know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. We know some old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were spanish solders and preiest they described the Inca in letters and diaries.Some of the Inca stories were lengends rather than history. As in many ancient civilization,Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone pottery, gold, and silver. some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today.The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.The origins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived  had long been inhabited by diffrent peoples.The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshipped some mountain peak. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, on mountain tops. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountains for study. The cold mountains act like giant freezer. Bodies found  in icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived.        About 1,400 years ago, long before europeans explored north america,a group of people living in the Four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. Then in A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away. Mesa Verde national park preserves a spectacular rminder of this of this ancient culture.archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or ancient enemies'.

The way they lived inspires many archeologist today, the way they lived, ate, survived, and got there resources.   For many people that doesn't mean much but others would pay a fortune to go to the Andes mountains and see the Incas artifacts. in  other words many archeologist find it fascinating how the Incas would keep track of weather. The Incas had a colored string called quipus and where used to record the calendar and keep a count of the livestock. Europeans had come into this country at the time of the Incas and they were surprised that such a powerful Empire was run by colored strings to keep records.   Then theirs Mesa Verde around 1,400 Years ago, Before any European came to explore North America. There many Incas there living for more than 700 years were there descendants lived and flourished there.   Then around the late A.D. 1200s, during the Spanish generations or two, they left their homes and moved away. To this day Mesa Verde preserves a spectacular view in reminder of the ancient culture.       For the first Ancestral Puebloans that settles in Mesa Verde in A.D. 550. They were know as Basket makers for their talented skill in crafting.   Soon they were leading a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages build on mesa tops but other times built in cliff recesses.       Then their were cliff dwellers a local cowboy first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, archeologists have sought to understand these people's lives.   Sadly decades of excavation, analysis, classification, and comparison, and scientific knowledge remains sketchy. The reason why scientist find it so hard its because the cliff dweller left no written records and everything that was important in their live perished. The structures are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. By the classical period (A.D. 1100 to A.D. 1300) Ancestral Puebloans.

By studying on how they mainly did objectives. This teaches us on ways to potentially change or alter on our everyday lives in a more healthy or positive way.       They may have there pros and faults but when we have data collected from them, We can benefit from this by learning from there potential mistakes and be more careful about particular dangers to society.       One way to do this is by going back to old ways of eating, cleaning, and traveling to our needs for the Earth. By doing this, we will not only persevere, but our planet will survive and be more pleasant for our sake.       Though it will certainly take time, each empire had an effect or impact on how we live today! Without them, we may have never developed certain traits or inventions for our beneficial. We can make similar inventions to what they did so we can do more work yet seemingly more helpful to everyone.       We will never know everything that occured in the past, however this is not to discourage us. If we all become unified as people and our technology becomes great enough, we can do what the ancient civilizations never thought could happen. Our ideas and perspectives are certainly different from people several hundred years ago, but we have certainly changed for the better, and you may be one who will change our lifestyles forever.

I think that the ancient inca is very insterting and is really cool and I think that you willl enjoy this paper on the ancient  inca. So around 1438  nearly hundreds and huindreds of years ago the inca ruled a south american empire that rivaled the exanse of ancient Rome. Cules oleft behind by the inca from an amazing portrait of thier religion, art and architecture, goverment and transportatipon. By studtying these cule and other can pieces together details of inca life. Some of what we know about the inca comes from oral history or stories passed from genaration to genaration passing on the stories  was an important way to preserve a communitys history. We know some of the old stroies because they were written down by the eroupeans who arrived in the empirer  in 1532. The vistors were spanish soldiers and priests. They described the inca in  letters and diaries. And that was abolut the ancient ince hoped you enjoyecd. 	NN NNP NNP VBP PRP VB IN JJ NN .

The article lost civilizations is about the Incas, pueblos, and the Greeks.the Incas were so important because they had no formal alphabetic or system of writing. they did not leave archives for historians to study. the Inca had different ways that hey communicated, and only the people that were part of their tribe could figure it out. they made knots in colored strings called quips to record cleaner to keep a count of livestock. since then many or all have died and archaeologists have found many of the quips but cant find anybody who can read the stories that are tied into the colorful strings. civilization lasted from (1438-1532). civilization ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. some clues that were left behind when the Incas died were art, religion, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. since the Incas didn't leave much behind, and the things they did leave Americans couldn't read the archaeologists finds out information from the Incas by their oral history and stories that were passed down from generation to generation. since the Incas spoke in different languages the Europeans had came and written down some of their stories. the visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. they wrote down the Incas description in letters and diaries. the Spaniards did not speak Inca language well and some descriptions may have been inaccurate but they tried their best. another way they found out the Incas way of live is by their artifacts or objects they left behind. some artifacts they they mostly found was gold, silver, stone, or pottery. the Spaniards had murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.the Incas lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. some Incas were buried in caves in cliff faces. or on mountain tops.       the second article ( Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebla and Their World)   this article is about a group of people living in the Four Corners region in Mesa Verde about 1,400 years ago before the Europeans had even explored North America. more than 700 years them and their descendants lived and flourished there. in the late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved away. Archaeologists have called those people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as the ' ancient ones ' or'ancient enemies '. the first ancestral Pueblos settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. they were known as the basket makers. for their skills at crafts. farming replaced hunting. they lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on top of mesa tops but sometimes in cliffs. they learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a better weapon for hunting than spear thrower. by A.D. 1000 people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole- and - adobe construction to very skillful stone masonry, pottery also changed, and farming. between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 during the classic period the population may have reached several thousand. people mostly lived in compact villages of many rooms often with eh kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. ( kiva- church or ceremonial room). fires were built in the summer mainly for cooking. in winter when the rooms were damp and uncomfortable people burned fires throughout the village. the smoke blackened walls and ceilings are reminders of how cold it was for several months a year.               the third article   ( lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secret)   this article is about a diver who has discovered an sunken settlement beneath the waters of southern Greece. the sunken settlement date was back some 5000 years ago, to the time of homers heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. archaeologists say that it is the oldest submerged town in the world. it has remains from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the days of classical Greece. it straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, and it is believed to be consumed by the sea around `1000 BC. under the shifting sands and the settlements enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock- cut tombs, and religious structures. the archaeologists revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. but what surprised the archaeologists the most was the discovery of possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, which also suggests that the town had been used by an elite. ( a person of high authority). marine geologists have yet to find out the reason why the settlement sank. they believe that it could've been cause by sea level changes, ground subsidence, earthquake, or tsunami. the settlement is now known as the worlds oldest submerged city.

So this is why they came up with the perfect solution . They a made knots in colored string called Quipus the string is used to keep records.They left behind many of things like parts of there Religion, and Architecture archaeologists found any of Ancient Quipus they say its not history its legendary they use Some of The Most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about the Inca predecessors. Greeks and Ancient Inca left no trace for historians to find. The civilization that for nearly hundred of years (1438-1532) ruled the South America empire that rivaled the expanse of Ancient Rome. The only clues where left behind where their Religion , architecture,Art, Transportation, and Agriculture. Archaeologists, Government, a Portrait, and their way of life.   some of what we know about Inca comes from oral history , or somewhat passed down from generation to generation passing on the stories as An important Way to preserve a community's history.

Archaeologists have made many important discoveries about these ancient discoveries. They have found evidence in Peru, Mesa Verde, and beneath the waters off southern Greece. Finding these artifacts are very important to finding about our past.              The Inca lived in Peru. They had a prosperous land until the Spanish came and conquered them. Because of the Spanish conquering the Inca, we know little about this lost civilization. It is very hard to learn the Inca's ways because they had no formal writing system. They made knots in colored strings called quipas to keep count of livestock  and to record a calender. No one knows what these knots mean so it is hard to learn about this lost city. Much of what the Spanish recorded could be inaccurate. Archaeologists have found many artifacts but a lot of the artifacts have been looted. We don't know much about the Inca, but over time we will find out more about this lost civilization.              A group known as the Ancestral Puebloans settled in a place called Mesa Verde. They lived in Mesa Verde for 700 years. They are known as Basketmakers because they were very skilled at it. They farmed and settled in pithouses. As time went on their population rose. Because of the population rose they moved into the cliff alcoves. Nobody knows why they moved and hopefully archaeologists find out in the future.             Alantis was a city in southern Greece that disapered underwater. This inspired one of the largest myths. The ocean has presereved many artifacts that we have today. Investigations revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. Marine geologists have yet to find out what happened to this lost civilization. Many think it was a tsunami or an earthquake.              Many of these civilizations we at there peak when they disapered. There are many theories of why these people disapered. hopefully we find out what really happened to the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri soon.

What they have discoverd in the Inca are every many things. Like they did not have a aphelbet so they dident have a way of writing either. So when the Spaniards came over they translated what they were saying (or the best they could) and wrote it in their language. The archaeologist have tried to uderstand what the spaniards have written down but some of it is unaudible. Understaniding the Ancient Inca is like solving a mystery.       Some people may ask how we know what peoples life was like almost a hundered years ago. Well we dont know exactly what it was like but we get clues from their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. some of what we know comes from oral history or stories passed down from generation. Passing on stories was very important in the Inca because it was a way to preserve a community's history. The Inca had lived high in the Andes may have even have worshiped some mountain peeks. Some of the people died in the mountains that their body's have been frozen and experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how people died.           From there they went to the peubloans which settled in Mesa Verde about 550 A.D. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming had replaced hunting to lead a more settled way of life. They lived in these things called pithouses from about 550 A.D. to 750 A.D. as settled agriculter began. By 1000 A.D. the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. By the 1880's archeologist have sought to understand these peoples lives. We will never know the whole story: they left no written records and much of that was important in their lives has perished. Whatever may have happend, some of today's peublo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.           The lost city off of southern Greece is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. It has remaines that date back to 2800 to 1200 BC, long befor the glory days of classical Greese. They have found things dating back to the end of the stone age. It ws significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied. Atlantis was a myth but it keeps underwater exploring going. Only 1 percent of the ocean floor hasve ever been surveyed. there is still tons of stuff to be found.       This is only a few discoverys that have been found and discoverd, and they still have tons to find.

Some we have found and some still need to be discovered. One of them was the ancient Inca of Peru. They had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They made knots in colored string in order to record the calender to keep count of the livestock. They were called quipus. the first Europeans that they meet were amazed that they could run a huge empire just by keeping colored knots in strings as records. But still today no one really knows what the knots mean. the Inca and there knots are still a mystery.            Another example is The Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and their World. Around 1400 years ago, a group of people living in t he four corners region choose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years tey livied and flourished there. They even built elaborate stone communites in the shelter of the canyon walls. But in the late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved away. They left us there building to look and and tons of other stuff.       There were also Cliff Dwellers. They made kivas. Kivas are another word for cerimonal rooms. They were underground chambers. Many Ancestral Puebloans may have used these kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, a good crop, or even luck in hunting. Pilasters supported a beam and a mud roof. The entry way was by a ladder in the center of the roof . Then the small hole in the floor is a sipapu, or also know as a symbolic entrace to the underworld.

Learning about the past and how they ran their city is very different and unique to the way we do it now. People believe that ancient civilizations have a lot of history behind it, that's why every discovery archaeologists make about these civilizations is important.                 The Incas ran their empire using colored strings to keep records. These colored strings were called quipus, the Inca made knots on them and also used them to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists found clues left behind by the Inca that form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. With these clues archaeologists can put together details of Inca life. Some of the old stories we know of the Inca are because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532, and also because of letters and diaries that described the Inca that Spanish soldiers had left behind. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind. The Inca artifacts might be objects made form stone, pottery, gold, or silver, these materials last a long time. Even if these things have been buried for hundreds of years, some turn up in the ruins of buildings, and others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.               The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They lived in pithouses usually built on mesa tops. The Puebloans began building houses above ground, from here on these people are known as Puebloans. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 the population reached several thousand, that is when they started to improve their houses. Instead of pole and adobe they started using stone masonry, walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. The Puebloans are known for there magnificence buildings and stones.               The secrets of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths, the fable of Atlantis has been brought to light form under the waters of southern Greece. What archaeologists found surpassed all expectations. The shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. They say the city sank in the sea around 1000 BC, and that the settlement dates back 5,000 years. Yet marine geologist have yet to find out why the settlement sank, theories say that it might be because of sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. This is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.              Don't all these civilizations have a lot of history behind them? Well they have more, and every discovery more that is made, they get even more history, that is why these civilizations are important. People find them important when they read their history, they become fascinated and begin to read more about them. With out knowing all the the things they did and built, we might assume that their government and cultures were just like ours, when in reality they did things different and unique. Now you know why all these different type of discoveries archaeologists or scientists make about lost city's, ancient tribes, and many different civilizations are so important.

The first people to meet the Incas were Europeans. They were amazed that they could run a huge civilization with just using strings to keep record. Understanding the Ancient Inca is still a mystery to some people till this day.       We know about this civilization that ruled South American empire for almost a hundred years beacuse some clues or artifacts were left behind by the Inca tribe. The clues show how there agriculture,government,transportation and their way of life was.       One of the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happen to it. The Inca civilization ended in 1532 because some Spaniards murdered the king and took over the empire.

It helps us learn about their religion, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and just everything about how they lived. Archaeologist find amazing artifacts that teach us about all these things about that time and place.        First off, the Inca, they ruled a South American empire for almost a hundred years. The question is though, how does historians know this? The answer is clues that have been left behind and studied by archaeologist. Some of what we know come from when the Europeans arrived in 1532 and wrote in letters and diaries about the Inca. Archaeologist have found bodies well preserved  thanks to the cold mountains.         Now, the Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde around A.D. 550.They are inportant to history because they began to have a more settled way of living. They farmed, lived in pit houses, learned to make pottery, started using bow and arrows and spears. The Puebloans built underground chambers that are comparable to churches called Kivas. In about A.D. 1300 they left and went to New Mexico.         Last, the Pavlopetri, their settlement sunk around 5,000 years ago. The bay was protected and left a whole city undisturbedm like everything was frozen in time. No one knows why it sank but it be sea level changes or a tsunami. These were all great discovers in history.

We can find out how they cooked?How they got there food?How did the laws work etc.?There's many question on what  Atlantis looked like back then or how they  even made such a big city did they made by hand or how?Also find out who was kind or ruler of that place.What kind of money did they use to buy or trade stuff.           We also may want to know what language did they speak in did they speak Latin or what kind of animals did they eat back then or what kind of stuff would they use to go places.No date for sure but it said that it 1200 BC years old.It's also 30,000 square meters.

We can learn things from these groups like how they lived their everyday life, how they built structures or homes, how they lived with no technology.      The discoveres found by archeologist of the Inca is that they had no actuall alphabet. The way that they took notes on how their crops grew or how much cattle they had was by using colorful string to keep records. The Inca was a South American empire that ruled during 1438-1532. Since some of the Puebloans liked to live in the desserts, some of their clothing has stayed tact because of the heat from the sun. With this we can learn what they used to make this type of clothing and how they made it. Since people have entered Inca sites some of the valuables have been taken, and we may never know what they were. Archeologists can easily predict when it was that the Inca empire fell, beause the Spaniards killed their king around 1532.      The Puebloans lived in the Four Corners region at Mesa Verde. In Spanish Puebloans means 'village dwellers' but the first Puebloans are known as Basketmakers because of their skill in craft. Since Puebloans were nomadic the only lived in this area for about 700 years. While they were there they flourished and expanded in family. Now Mesa Verde is a park that people can go visit to see how it was that these people lived. Their first homes were called pithouses.The Puebloans were very smart and knew a lot about architecture so by A.D. 1000 they went from buillding pole-and-adobe constuction to stone masonry. Most of their buildings went as high as two to three stories high.

They also show how old the things they used are to show how they used them and for what.   Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records, they write down and photograph any artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. They need to learn as much information as they can form every single piece of evidence.

They also belive that the architectuall design were workings of the Mycenaean society. Because this site was submerged, it hasn't been reaoccupied for a very long time.

The Incas where able to maintain an empire while not even having a written communication. While the Puebloans maintained a healthy economy through farming and agriculture. Pavlopetri opens a new field of discovery to archaeologists because only one percent of the ocean floor has been excavated and this was found underwater.                                                      Incas existed from 1438-1532. This is a time before many technological advancements and the discovery of these artifacts help historians determine the lives that the Incas lived ,what diseases there where, what kind of farming and hunting they did and how they lived there life overall. The Puebloans where some of the first people to live a more settled way of life with farming and basket making being to of there main resources. Finding and researching there artifacts help us discover what where there ideas on religion, hunting and everything else that mattered to them at that time. The Pavlopetri find was extravagant in itself but the idea of there being a sunken city is way beyond one discovery. One percent of the ocean has been explored and we have found a city in it. If archaeologists were to explore the ocean more who knows what we would find! It also gives some sort of validation of the myth of the underwater city Atlantis.       In conclusion these discoveries and explorations open up a whole new era of archaeology and help us discover more about the past.

The lost greek city that archaeologists have found covered 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. This discovery is important because there are other sunken citys but none have been as large and as amazing remains of a town as this one. Because of shifting sands archaeologists have found a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock cut tombs, and religous symbols.       Scientists believe that the city was consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Archaeologists have found over 30,000 remains and shards of pottery scattered arond the underwater city. The artifacts that scientists have found dates back to 780 BC to 1200 BC. No one fully understands how the city sunk yet. Less than 1% of the ocean has been searched, this was the first time a sunken city has been founded near greece. I think people are fascinated because the citys artifacts are different than what we have today and its interesting to learn what people used to live their lives back then.

First off is facts. Facts are important to discover things about the interesting ancaient civilizations. Plus there important to find out everyones past ancestors. So this is quite important for everyone in the worlds help for these discoveries of the ancient world.                  Second is it helps for knowladge. These discoveries help with us finding out important facts.Plus without these dicoveries we couldnt find out much about the earths whole past, which wouldnt help us atol in history class.               Lastly, histoical artifacts play a huge role in our history. Such as having historical artifacts help by solving mysteries about clothes, pottery, money value, and minerals. It also helps with having museums to cherrish these woderful and magnificent artifacts.              All in all, having ancient civilizations are imperitive to our world history.

They tell us how we came up with many of the ways we use today. They tell us what our ancestors were like and how they lived and how it was different from how we live today. From discovering the artifacts of the Incans, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri they tell us how difficult there life was and how they used what they had. One example is that they didn't have a system of writing but they formed knots in string to keep track of records. They were amazed that they could run a whole empire by useing knots. They made their own baskets and houses by whatever they could find.

From those artifacts or buildings, historians are able to determine what happened to that civilization and why it fell.       The Inca Empire did not have any writing system, but their old tools and buildings clue the archaeologists on how they lived. Finding frozen bodies in an Inca civilization says that some deaths were caused from the climate. Arcaeologists were also able to figure that the Spainish wiped to the Inca from Spanish records. Those records also contained data on what they observed of the Inca themsleves. After the Spanish killed the Inca king, then came the fall of the rest of the empire showing that the rest of the civilization was dependent on a leader for survival.       When historians found the lost city of Atlantis underwater, they found that Earth's oceans used to be at a lower water level, leading to many theories about the Earth and how it changed over time.       Not only was these discoveries important to find out how the empires lived and died, it also clued us in to some scientific theories we may never have realized without it.

Discovering ancient cities can help researchers gain knowledge of the past. It could show us the story of how the city came and how it was in government and why the city fell. In these articles the cities they researched they found things such as art,writings, and even found the  agriculture. The information researchers found was how the houses looked like in Mesa Verde the people lived in pit houses which had a roof to protect from the sun and a fire-pit with a air deflector. This means the people were smart to create this type of place and had knowledge of doing so. In the article about the search of Atlanta is very Important also because know one never really knew if the city of Atlantas even existed because the only person to write about it was Plato. Iinformation that Plato gave was that is was a utopian city with a good government that fell because it sank to the bottom of the ocean. Rreligion is an important subject to find when discovering new places because ewe can learn of what they worshiped or what they believed in to see if it has a connection to our modern religion. In the search of new city's and exploring the history of it is a very important thing researchers must know now in days. This is because of the great discoveries archaeologists find at the once city of the past.

You may think you know it well. The Acient civilization are far more unpredictable than you know. The truth is we have only uncovered ten percent of the ancient world that was once surrounding us. 'Less than one percent of the worlds ocean floors have ever been surveyed.' Question still remain about the Ancient world like: What were the Inca doing in the Andie's higher than any civilization? How did the mythology city Atlantis get burred under the ocean these question can be answered though the Artifacts they left behind. Archaeologist are going high into the cold Andies and below the ocean floor to figure answer the Limited Question.  Why do the discovers we learn about them and the mistakes matter about our destiny tomorrow?                                                 INCA          High in the Andie's a civilization once know as the Inca is being uncovered bit by bit. Although the Inca lasted for only 100 years there are many artifacts that can help provided eveidents about how the Inca lived there lives.   art weapons dairies from the Spaniards portraits architecture textiles  bodies                        Every artifact every coin and every bodies, Archaeologist finds matters in studying the past. The Inca left few records about themselves so, how do learn about the past? The answer is artifacts every artifact counts in learning the pieces of the past that can lead to the future. Artifacts fill in the pieces.                                     The lost city of Atlantis             Deep beneath the waters of the Mediterranean sea lies a myth uncovered into Reality. For years Atlantis seemed to by a myth right out of homers story book. Once found the city opened new doors for Archaeologists and lifted up there hopes on the ocean floor.                  History may not seem important but live may never excites if we don't answer the question of the past so we can learn from the mistakes in the future.

One reasons why these were such important finds was because theses ancient societies had many helpful inventions to our community today. The Inca helped us with the idea of the calendar to keep count of the days, they also left many artifacts for researchers to study to learn more about there civilization. The Puebloans were the first ancestral community to live in mesa Verde. They were known for their skills at basket weaving, but they also had made pottery, bow and arrows, and more efficient weapons.               Another reason why these societies were such an important find was because how old they were and some being a mythical legend. The Inca society was found to be hundreds of years old from 1438-1532 ruling the South American empire. The Puebloans had settled in the year A.D. 550. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages.          In conclusion, The discovery of these ancient empires is a great discovery and helps archeologists with their studies to find more and more historical information.

They all have on thing in common though, they are ancient civilizations. Three out of these many civilizations are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.       To begin, the Inca was an ancient civilization that ruled a South American empire for about a hundred years(1438-1532). Archaeologists found that trying to piece together this civilization wasn't going to be easy. They discovered a system of knots made with colored strings, called quipus, which was used to record the calendar and keep count of the livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus, but no one today knows what the knots mean. The Inca did however leave behind clues that helped give us a better understanding of what their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life was back then. The Inca lived high up in the Andes and they may have worshiped some mountain peaks. The sites were in remote, high areas, which made it difficult to reach them. Some of what we know came from oral history, but the rest came from the amzing artifacts that the Inca left behind.       Next, a group called the Puebloans, for more than 700 years, they and their descendents lived and flourished in Mesa Verde. The first Puebloans to settle in Mesa Verde were known as Basketmakers for their skill at craft. Farming then replaced hunting and gathering and became their main livelihood. These people live in pithouses which were cramped into small villages. Puebloans learned to make pottery and discovered the bow and arrow. They became 'smarter' and began to build houses above ground. Sadly though, the Puebloans left no written records and much of what was important has perished. Eventually the cliff dwellers left and traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona. Some of the Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of this interesting group.       Finally, the secrets of the lost city. Dr Jon Henderson once stated,' There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' Living in this town many years ago were people known as the Pavlopetri. This town was believed to have been consumed around 1000BC. Henderson found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, but what really took him by surprise was the discovery of a possible megaron. Now you might ask what a megaron is, well its a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall. This is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. This city has inspired one of the greatest myths of all time and to actually of found it was even better.       In conclusion, these three ancient civilizaions are very fascinating to archaeologists. Maybe one day you might discover something like this. It would be an interesting discovery dont you think? Maybe even one day, a hundred years from now, people will be learining about us and wondering what life was like when we lived.

As for the Natives we problemly have the least amount of infomation out of all of them because there are signs of any infomation the only things that can help the us are the buildings and possibly if there is any pottery.So there is not that much how or why those natives are not there.       Lastly for the underwater city it problemly has the most infomation because it has signs of buildings,main streets,tombs,pottery,and temples.This place is fulled with almost allthe infomation thatweneed except that right now archeologists have not found any documents beforeor after the city went underwater, but to me i think its shows alot of potentional.       As you can those were some reasons why and how with todays tecnology we can find out more stuff thatwe never knew about.

The past offers history that can be found no where else.  In all three of these civilizations: the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, history of all kind roams the areas.  Each of these locations lived in a different time, and had things that made them different, some better than others.       The Incans had a unique way of doing things that made them different.  Such as quipi which stood as calenders and planers for them.  Other places had different types of calenders , but they were all similar.  Incans were different from all of the other civilizations at the time, which is a huge reason arceologists took such a huge likeing to their civilization.  They also had good clothing and textiles that have lasted throughout the years. This shows that the Incans were good at making clothing and showed promising techneque. The Incans lived back in a time when there was not much technology, but the ways that they lived their lived make them a great civilization to study.        The Puebloans lived life in a way that made them different from others.  Their most known inventions are their buildings.  They started off with the pithouses, and got more advanced and made kivas.  Each of these places had different areas that were dedicated to certain things in their culture.  Including a hole that they said led to the undergrounds which is where they came from.  Each time something was built they became more advanced, showing that the Puebloans constantly grew as a group of people in technology and beliefs.  They were an interesting group of people who sent ideas and teachings into the future generations that have been shaped into how everyone lives now.        The Pavlopetri people lived the longest back, and now their towns and remains are under water.  Historians have found peices from their past time which has helped them to understand these amasing group of humans.  They had a possible megaron which supprised historians because that would automatically raise the status of the city.  This discovery has caused scientists to want to roam the seas more to try and find more underwater civilizations.  Everyone was really thrilled that history is really this old, and are glad that we can keep learning from it.        Finding old peices if history is important for all of mankind to continue to strive to improve.  Not only has the history from the past been interesting to study, but it has also shaped all of the countries into what they are.  Without the mistakes and great discovories from the past none of the countries in the world would be able to know what and what not to do.  Therefore, studying the past is important for the world to function and teaches us interesting things that shape who we are.

The uncovering of the Inca, Puebloan, and Pavlovian civilizations were crucial for the understanding of the past. Each civilization has unique customs and traditions, some of which we still use today. They also created many useful inventions that we've elaborated on and use on a very frequent basis.       For example, the Inca tied knots in colorful strings called the quipu, which is a device for keeping track of things, such as livestock and calendar dates. No one knows exactly what the knots mean. This invention helped to create the idea of calendars, calculators, and public records.        One other important discovery was that of the pithouses and kivas. Pithouses were homes set into the ground with a covering overhead and they were about the size of a living room. These later became kivas, which were places used for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or good crops. These are present-day churches and houses.        These inventions were very important to the development of present-day technology. They shaped the way we live today.

With the Puebloans, we can learn about them from their baskets, pithouses,pottery, and weapons that they have left behind.  through these things we can learn about their culture and their way of life.In the underwater city of the Pavlopetri we have found many structures and pottery.

Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or cold morticians of the Andes.   some Incas have been distributed by hunters or looters, who take anything might  be valuable. some centuries were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today.   The puebloans setteled in mesa verde about A.D. 550 they are known as basketmakers for their skill  at the craft. formely nomadic, they were beggining to lead a more settled way of life.

We, as humans, can also infer about our mistakes and how we have a solution now.         We can also know how they lived through the stuff they left behind such as their artifacts. Some artifacts the Incas left behind were objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver.         We aslo learn alot of them through their legends passed down from generation to generation. We might know how they think they got created and how they dissapered.         We also learn how they were organized and if they planned to create somthing or it happend accidentally. An example is that the city underwater was prepared and was created by people.

The ancient civilizations of the Incas, Anasazi, and Greeks teach us what their lives were like back then and inevitably where we came from and evolved.       The Incas used a quipus in order to keep track of their lifestock. this shows us that even though they didn't have an alphabet, they had the brain power to count and record their number of lifestock.       The Puebloans built highly advanced buildings and were highly skillful when it came to stone masonry. as time goes on the people begin to evolve more and more, becoming more intelligent.       The ancient Greeks built huge sophisticated cities, but as time drew on most of these cities fell subject to a changing enviroment and inevitably sunk into the ocean.This helped preserve the town and showed how people lived at the time, and is of great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow.       ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Incans, and Puebloans showed intelligent life and has showed us where we came from and how much we have evolved.

The Lost City of Atlantis.  Archeologists have been searching for it for years, but have found little to no evidence of its existence.  The little evidence that they have found shows that the inhabitants of the city were much more advanced than previously thought.  The city being so far ahead of its time makes th discovery of the city even more desierable.        Atlantis sinking is very similar to the dissapearence of the Inca.  Like Atlantis, the Inca vanished in one day leaving little evidence of there existence behind, apart from their city ruins.  Strange fenominones such as these have happened a few other times.  For example, the Puebloans who had lived in the Four Corners for more than  700 years left their homes and moved away in the span of a generation or two.

The Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are all societies that failed brutally. We must discover as much as we can about them so we do not make the same mistakes they did.       For example, in the passage 'Ancient India: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past', it states 'Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate.' If we were not precise in discovering this historical significance, our society could have easily failed. The Spaniards were revolutionary conquerers. If we didn't know that the Incas were conquered, we might not have been as well-prepared for people trying to wage war or take over our society.       Also, in a later passage, known as 'Mesa Verde National Park ancestral Puebloans and Their World', it states 'when the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there.' Had historians not found this out, Americans might not have known about the vast ancestral differences in their country, which could have led to major social differences. This could completely change how we look at society today!       Even furthermore; in the article 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets,' it is addressed that 'Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlemtn dates back 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say.' Therefore, if we did not discover 'this site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor,' we might not be as a ware of natural disasters and have the protection we need when a storm or flood comes.       Thanks to these historical evidences though, we can now live in a much, safer, well-protected, better inferred, and all-around happier society.

Then you are probably a very intelligent person because they are. There are many reasons to disagree if you have never seen one but for those of us who have; we believe.        Unicorns are mainly believed to be a 'made-up fairytale character'but, in truth, if they werent real, we would not have evidence to prove their existence. They are a very intereresting animal in fact and i can very well describe them to you. they are very light in color, almost white but more of a shiny salmon/pink color. Now not all of them are this particular color though. many are lavender aswell and even blue but blue ones are very rare. Only very very very very cool people, like myslef, are allowed to own blue unicorns. yes i do in fact own a unicorn but no one must know about bashfyej (thats his name and its pronounced CHAD). some people just call hiim bluesker though for a nickname because, for some reason, they cant seem to remeber his full name. i have ridden my unicorn before and believe that he is very calm and easy to sit upon. i hope that you get to meet him in the future.        so back to the unicorns in general. their tales always have to be darker tha their skin. for example, if the unicorn is lavender then it has to hae a puple tail. theres no if ands or buts about it. chad (ill use his pronunciation so u understand) is light blue with a navy blue tail. i braid his mane and tail alot and put bows and stuff in it. i think he like me a lot because he has never tried to bite me before. wen a unicorn bites somebody it turns all different colors. thats where people get bruises from. they just blame it on somebosy else because they are too stupid to realize that a unicorn ewas actually bitning them. they are usually a very gentle creaure but only to prople who really truly belive in them, like me of course.        so, in conclusion, and yes i know theres only 4 paragraphhs, unicorns are my life and i absolutely love them. to whoever is reading this, ium sorry, and i hope this made you laugh because i am actaulkly a straight a student  with a gpa of 4.00 (as high as we can go) and i know exactly what i am doing and this test is not better then pen and paper. my friend did the same thing and i hope many other students did as well.

The clothing you would think to get weathered away do to the dampness, nut these have been preserved int he dry desert on Peru's coast or the cold mountains of the Andes.                     Mesa Verde was found about 1400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, the Mesa Verde lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. the pithouse featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four coner timbers suppirted the roof. The firepit an air defector. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground, with up right walls made of poles and mud.They built the houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in front. In A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.                      The Lost Greek city. The secrets of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring  myths &mdash;the fable of Atlantis&mdash; have been brought to light from beneath the water off southern Greece. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Although discovered by British oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this yeah that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins.                        Thanks to the shifting sand and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a word of building, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.                         Marin geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level change, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.                         It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical table of the sunken continent of Atlantis.

Most of these differences included if one city, the city of Atlantis, was a long told myth or an actual city sunken underwater. As for the Incas, their language and lifestyle was different then most others. They tallied up their livestock and the days that went by with an artifact called quipus. Also, in the Mesa Verde National Park, they were mostly based on their amazing agriculture. Overall, each long lost city was different in their own ways compared to one another and in today's society.

The things that we have discovered over the past time is Incas, also mesa Verde national park. About 1,400 years ago a group of people were living in the four corners region chose mesa Verde for their living home. Also some what we know about the Inca comes for oral history. Our knowledge about the Incas comes from the artifacts. The fall of the Inca was easy to date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and then took over the empire. When the Spaniards took over the Incas home they went to live in the high Andes and worshiped some of the mountain peaks. Many of the Incas were buried in caves in cliff faces, for an example mountain tops. Anything that we find today about the Inca has to be carried down the mountain to study the ancient artifact.

It is very important for archeologists not only to find these pieces of history, but also learn about ancient civilizations that have an impact on our world. Other civilizations like the atlantians and puebalans also had a big impact on our civilizations and technology.  Without these civilizations and the work that the archeaologists have done, we could live in a very different world.

They made knots in colored strings and called them quipus to record the calender. Also to keep count of livestock. the europians that were first to meet them were amazed that they were able to run a large empire using just string to keep records. Many quipus were found by archaeologists but today, no one knows what the knots mean or how to tie them. reading these knots is alot like solving a very twisted mystery. there aer clues left behind by the incas. they form an incredible art and architecture, agriculture, government, tranportation, adn the way of life. archielogists study these clues and peice details togather.        somw of the stuff we know about the incan life comes from oral history, or stories that were passes from generation to generation. passing on these stories was an important way to save history. we know these stories becausethey were written my empires that arrived in 1532. the people that visited were spanish preists and soldiers. they described the incas by diaries and letters.   among the most important things to learn about this civilization are      What happened rto it and where did it come form? the origins are more difficult to trace. they lived in a nomadic life style and in caves that are yet to be discovered.   these were very hard times for these awesome basket makers. theire population multiplyed and got larger.           The site, which it straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern pelopennese is beleived to have been concumed by the sea around 1000 BC all thought he poeple were british and archieologists, aided by digital technology were able to properly survey the ruins. what they found really suprised them and exceded all expectations. thanks to he shiftingsands and settlement's.         in addition the seabed was replete with thousands a shards and broekn pottery. they found ceramics all the way in the time of the stone age.

During this exploration these archeologists found many intresting artifacts of these ancient people.This city is the oldest submerged town in the world followed by the fact it is very unique in many ways.In October 16, 2009, archeologists went into the sea to explore this submerged city.In this exploration they found some qualities of these people.These people thought of the future when building this incredible city.They went above and beyond anything that has been created in the past because they built buildings that were meant to last for a long time.As you can tell these people were very smart and had a very unified society.Besides being very unified, this society was very large and were very wealthy.People can tell this because of the way they built their buildings.         The fact that the people from Atlantis thought of the future and strived to built this perfect society is a very smart idea.These people reached their goal but unfortunatley they never thought of the idea of creating a system to protect their land from natural resources. The city of Atlantis still remains under the sea 5,ooo years later. The interesting fact is that all the artifacts are still found today. By this fact  people can tell how skilled these civilized people were.         Dr jon Henderson stated 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world...'.Archeologists thank technology because it played a major roll in the discovery of this town. Even though the people from Atlantis did not have the advaced technology we have now they could still be able to construct sturdy buildings so they can last as they planned. The most important artifact they could have left for the future generation is the tools they used to construct their buildings. I support my thought by stating that if we did not watse so much money providing machines to build structures in todays life and used ancient tools, then we could use the money not spent on the machines to create a system securing our nation from the powerful forces of nature.The same thing that happened to Atlantis could happen to our nation.         When the archeologists explored the city of Atlantis they found a whole world of buildings. It is unimaginable how large this city was. Many people might have moved to this town thinking it is powerful and will never be destroyed.The fact that the people went ahead and thought of the future shows they were blinded and did not worry for the present. Due to this they were not prepared and were consumed by the sea. In my opinion if the town had not been consumed by the sea  the city would still be standing on ground today.The lost city of Atlantis is an important find because it shows it would have been a utopian society if they did not worry too much of the future. It is was a good move to think of the future but at the same time realize that the present could destroy what they had in mind for the furture.         The people from Atlantis are a good precident for our generation because it opens the people's minds and gives us a wake up call. It brings the question in mind 'Are we prepared for a natural disaster or any kind of desruction?'Our leaders should focus on the civilians safety and prepare us for a destruction. The people should be like the people in the city and become united in this plan of safety.I admire the people in this city because they did a beautiful job on creating this city. Peoplehave a glimpse of what they believed in thanks to technology. The technology may not be what the poeple now a days  consider technology but it is very helpful. We can know many intresting fats of these people due to the fact they worked hard on creating this city.People should worry about the present and future and should not get too carried away so we can have a united society.

But as technology improves, we discover many artifacts, buildings, and sometimes even a whole city! We have recently discovered many civilizations, but the most important ones are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations.       The Inca Empire has been known for many years, but some people do not know much about them. The Incas were very interesting people. They built their empire on the Andes mountains because they wanted their enemies to have a hard time reaching them. There are many places in the Andes mountains that are Inca sites for artifacts, but most of them have been disturbed. They have been disturbed by looters because the Incas people had many valuable artifacts.       The civilization that was once in Mesa Verde was known as Puebloan. The Puebloans were also very interesting people because they were very skilled people. The archaeologists who study artifacts from Puebloans have found many pottery. The shape of the pottery varies in different shapes and sizes. The archaeologists have also noticed that most pottery have paintings on them. The paintings are very detailed and precise. this is evidence that the Puebloans were very talented and patient.       There has recently been a new civilization discovered by British and Greek archaeologists. Its name is Pavlopetri. This civilization is so unique because it is completely underwater. Archaeologists have studied many artifacts from here. They have discovered that it is very well preserved. It is well preserved because the shifting sands and protected bay protect the city from much damage. The archaeologists have also discovered that the city was filled with shards of pottery. This it evidence that the people of Palvopetri were also very skilled at crafting.       These civilizations were very important to discover and study because they teach us about what ancient civilization was like. People are very interested in ancient civilization because it is very different from what society is today. It is also very interesting because as society changes, so does technology. People want to know what technology was like in ancient times. 	NNP NNP CC NNPS NNP NN VBZ VBN IN , JJ NNS VBP VBN VBN RP CC NNP CC IN NN NNS , PRP RB JJ NNS , NNS , CC RB RB DT JJ NN .

The way we all live today came from the way they used to live. Think about this, have you ever thought what it would be like to not have your cell phones or internet. They never had Google to find out if they were doing something the right way, they had to hope for the best and go with it.             The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing so what they did was use colorful string. You probably are wondering how this worked for them, what the did was for an important event they would tie a new piece of string. They had certain colors for certain events. The Inca were very religious.               Clues left behind from the Inca from an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others were able to put things together and figure out there past.              The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') about A.D. 550. They are also known as the basket-makers. because they have such high skills in arts and crafts. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for the help for hunting. At about A.D. 750 their population increased by a lot! Some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.               In my opinion people are fascinated by civilizations from the past because they are interested by how things have changed or how far we have come sense then. Maybe to know what they do or there way of living. The lost city is a very important find because now we have places to explore and there might be better resources on the city that we need. Its something new to study. Good things to study would be things that help us move forward such as, weapons, things to help find what race they are.               As i said, imagine living without the things we have now. Try thinking about what it would have been like living with them. The sicknesses that they most likely had and the way they mad a living. They didnt pay for the things they had. There was no money. There wasnt much to eat or drink. They had to fight for life. There are many more things that i didnt mention in this that they found. The way we live now is a blessing. They would have loved to be able to watch TV after a long days job. 	NNP PRP DT VBN WRB NNP NN VBZ RB JJ .

There were many things we never knew about the Incas but there's more than you think. People who never heared about the Incas just think there a bunch of indian's or savages but they were more than just that. They were a civilized people and hade a lot to show for it. The Incas hade there own specilized calender that only they understood and they had an empire that lasted from (1438-1532).           Anothor Tribe that lasted many years was the Puebloans. They settled in Mesa Verde at about A.D 550. They were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They were Formerly nomadic, they were brginning to lead a more settled way of life. They weren't big on hunting but mostly farming, that was there main livelihood. They lived in Pithouses most were usually clustered together and were built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff revesses. By A.D 1000 th epeople of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole- and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between A.D 1100 and A.D 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. About A.D 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before.

Just imagein that one day you are walikng through the woods and then you come to this weird place and you dont even kniw what this place is and then you are on your way home and then some weird people stop you and asked you 'So what did you find in the woods today when you went for a walk?' and then you try to hide and not say what you saw and then you come up with some stuppid thing and then you say 'Oh well i had just found a lot of trash and then i had aslo got to see an abandon house and it was really weird.'. Well then you go home that night and you are sitting in your frontroom and then people are just like i love the woods, and then when they go then they find out that it was really weird and that there was a thing call use to like and still liking and then you had just found out that you dont like the woods anymore and then you are thinking that you dont want to go back to that place. But then again you really want to see what that thing was and you want to tell some boday, but then the problem with that is that they wount belive you on what you had just told them.          The your friend tell you that they want to go in the woods with yo and just walk around and then you say somthing about this weird place that you had found the other night and then they dont belive you on what you are trying to tell them and then you do and then that just makes it kind of worse and then you just tell your friend not to tell anybody and then they go to school and tell almost every body that they know and than that make the problem worse because then people know about what it is now and then that make them want to go in the woods and see what you are talking about.

There are certain discovery's however that I find very important. The discoveries in Inca, Pauebloans, and the Pavlopetri discoveries are so important. People might think that things found here on this Earth are not as interesting as things up in the sky. However, we as humans did not just get here on this Earth. Finding discoveries of our for-fathers are what is so important, discovery's that show us the way of life and living before we even thought that time existed. Clues that were left behind by the Inca form the ideas of their religion; culture, art, and architecture.Culture's pass down information and ideas from generation to generation. Finding these different dicovery's in vast regions shows us how we came to be who we are today. If artifacts and objects from times long ago were not found then we would have no clue or ideas of how people lived befor us.

Geologist are now trying to find out why and how these civilizations were losted. The three main lost civilizations were going to talk abbout is the Ancient Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and the lost city of Atlantis. These three things will grab your attention and hopefully get you thinking about the world! There are also there type of people, which is the Inca the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.          The first thing were going to talk about is the Ancient Incas, the geologist that have studied all that happened in the past know that the Inca had no alphabet or system of writting. We know that the Inca used some type of system to keep a Calender for there live stock. 'The Inca made knots colored string called quipus' (Sorce 1) Geologist find many quipus but, since we have no one who can read the knots, their language is a mystery. The Inca lived in the high Andes, many of the Inca sites were in relativly high places. The Inca went so high up so they could avoid the looters.          The next type of people were going to visit is the Ancestral Puebloans, 'About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Coners region chose Mesa Verde for thier home.'(Sorce 2)  You could say that these people are natives who needed there own place to live. In the late A.D 1200's within the span of a couple genarations they left theit homes and moved away. The park preserved a reminder of the culture the Eurapeans had. The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde at about A.D 550.(They were know as the Basketmakers)As they settled they began to liver more of the human life we live now. They stopped hunting so often and farmed there food. They lived in things called Pithouses. Puebloans built their dwellings beneath over hanging cliffs. The way they would keep their homes together was a mix of mud and water. These people were so important becasue they helped create some of the frist civilization.           Last, is the Pavlopertri, the suken settlement. This settlement dates all the way back 5,000 yuears ago durring the Homer's heros time. This is one of the oldesdt suken settlements. This dates all the way back to 2800 to 1200 BC. What geologist found prooved that there was a suken city. They found: Buildings, courtyards, main streets ETC.  There is a chance that this is the lost city of Atlantis. This is so important because it is dating back and showing us how our ancestiors lived.

The Inca people had no formal alphabet and they made nots in colorful pieces of string to record information, and these colorful pieces of string are called quipus. The Inca used these qiupus to record the calender and to keep track of livestock. The only written information that archaeologists could find was the journal entries of the Spanish Soldiers and priests that came to Europe in 1532.       The Puebloans of Mesa Verde lived in pithouses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. The pithouses had a living room that was sunk a few feet in the ground and had timbers to support the roof. At about A.D. 750 the Puebloans started building their houses above ground, with upright walls made with mud and wooden poles. The Puebloans then started making these homes in long curving rows,( often having a couple pithouses in the front) and these homes gave the Puebloans their name.

By studying these clues, archaeologist and others can piece together details of there life's. With some of these things we must be careful because some people could not speak there languages well, so they may not be accurate. Most of the information was from left be hind artifacts. Such as gold, silver, stone, houses, even towns that were left behind.That give use clues about how they worked. Some do not leave anything  not even written records and much that was important in there life's had perished. Said Anderson NPS/Roy from the National Parks Service. Skills and tradition were passed on by generation to generation . These subjects are very important to do with what we have learned because f we did not know about others, and the way that they lived there life's then we may not have very many things that would help. they way they built houses and all the different things they mad help us today. If the Cliff Dwellers did not leave they structures then some of use may be living different. The way that they lived there life's help use lean how hard it was back then, and how we can help move up from the past on making different things, such as religions   and different ways of language, or even the art.

They made color strings called quipus to keep track of their livestock. it was kind of like a calendar. the first people to meet the Incas were very amazed of how they ran their empire. But today no one knows what the knots mean.                           clues left behind by the Incas form amazing things. it tells their way of life, transtransportation. Gov., and how they grew their crops. other people arrived in the empire in 1532. and they did not speak Inca language very well. some of the Incas storing were legends.                           most of our knowledge comes from artifacts. things that the Incas left behind for us to find. some of the things the left behind are with the people that died and they buried. other show up in the ruins of an old city. most people lived in pit houses from 550 A.D. to 750 A.D.. when they built a fire in the summer it was mainly for cooking. they smoke blacked the roof.                                                   well i hope you learned a lot about the Incas. and how they lived and survived. if you find this interesting then maybe one day you will be the person who discovers a lot more about the Incas than most people do these day. this is the end of my article and i hoped you enjoyed it.

With the little things they left behind people wonder how archeologest are finding the information we do have. People say its just like solving a mystery, or even a puzzle. So lets s if we can finish the puzzle. :)                Some things we do kno is that they did rule the south america empire. They told many storys and tales that have been passed adown by generstions. Resarches have found diarys of other people visiting the incas. We cant nessisarly go by every thing in their jornels tho because they most likely did not speek the language of the incas but what we cn belive is how the incas dressed and what they made.           The rest of the inormation we get just comes from old artifacts. Foun in several places such as: Building ruins, under ground, in graves, and other weird stranges places. Archeologest keep records by writing in a jornel where and when and what is the object and found. In 1532 the Spaniards killed the inca king at took over.:( After that incas where had to find and they just kinda dissapeared.          Its sad as you can see how the incas lest. There is no more incas around and people are still tryig tpo get more knolledge of them. they are most pop ular for their famous inca calender. Its kinda like voodo ey say some thing bad is gonna happen that year and it dose. I feel that it it totally strange and weird. I dnt belive they can see the futer but others do.                Some of the first houses they built was pit houses. they where made out of mudgrass sticks dirt and leaves. these pit hoses becam villages and towns of inca people. People lived in pit hoses from 550 AD to 750 AD. Late on they moved up grades. many people have been findinf stuff for years. One diver found remains under water. Others have found stuff onn land off thand in stuff out of stuff buried covered almost any where.            Architecs find things in the weirdest places No one knoews i just what looks like a little simple cloth was from the incas. Imagine being in a destert and finding a random cloth. That cloth could have been threw so much. It could be from any culture. Its strange how thins wor pout. Archeologists are dpoing thewre best tryig to get more information about the incas.          Some times its hard to disipher what is what. Yeah you might know a pies of clothing is acient but who said it was the incas? It could be some solders or empires who went to their empire to fight or visit. Thats why archeologists are so  hesitant to just relise that ya thats from the incas and they made that and so and so wore it. No it takes more time then that. If it waas like that then most of our history would be fake and we would be learning for no reson. Some times something tey find isnt even an artifact. It migt seem old but it could just be from the present day contry and some one barried it you never know. dont get to exited cus it most likely isnt an artifact its just a pies of unk.           You see all thius is important cus if we didnt know about the past we couldnt change the same things from happening. We now relise they messed up and we need to go a different rout. Thats why we have a different goverment and we dont have kings and queens any more. Its also an up grade because we could not know about this amazing cloth thats super obsorbant and then we explor and find some and then end up finding out where they got and and use it in america.

The  Incas were important because they were very well known for their homes and great arcutectures. They were often found in the Andes and may have worshiped mountain peaks. They lived in high remote places like in caves in cliff faces or on mountain tops. The icy cold mountains acted like a gianted freezer by preserving their bodies for pber 5,000 years. Scienctists use modern medical scanning equipment to reaveal how they had lived and died.          The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were known as Basketmakers because they had good craft skills. They farmed instead of hunting and gathering. The first Puebloans live in pithouses, which included a living room and a sink a few feet in the ground, a four corner timber suppoted roofm a firepit and storage bins or pits clustered into small villages usually built on Mesa tops but also sometimes in cliffs. They learned how to make pottery, bow and arrows, and a spear thrower. They soon multiplied, about A.D. 750.          All of the ancient civilizations were very important for their agriculture and their way of living.

After the Spaniards arrived to South America, they recorded their days in their diaries. Here they wrote about their experiences and stories they heard as of every day. Although inaccurate, archeologists have used these writings to record Inca history and myths. This is due that Incas had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Inca artifacts and objects are used to find clues on Inca daily-life. Inca artifacts might be made of stone, pottery, gold or silver. Some of these are found in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. Inca sites provide the best idea of all about life in Peru before and during Inca rule.       The Pavlopetri city, recently found underwater near Neapolis, is about 5,000 years old. The find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. It is significant, because as a submerged site, it was never reoccupied. Theories of how this ciy sank include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquekes, or a tsunami. It is very likely a combination of the first two. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plate wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.       The Puebloans first settled about 1,400 years ago in the region of Mesa Verde. Here, they began constructing homes and farms. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill in crafting. They lived in pithouses and they learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground. By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 the population may have reached several thousand. About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors before.

During this discoveried archaeologists found very important artifacts in this places while studying and exploring the lands. In the Inca archaeologists found artifacts that potrayed early life in the Inca. Mesa Verde National Park is now a great part of ancient culture. Finally they discovered the Lost Greek city which can mean their was life underwater that has no inspired the myth of the underwater world Atlantis.           As archaeologists discoveried this amazing artifacts they went through alot of problems but collected alot of artifacts that we can now know what was happening during those periods of time. We also know in what kind of places they lived and stayed in there time. With this artifacts we found out what they made for a living and what kinds of hobbied they had. Archaeologists also discovered their religions with potraits they have. Lastly archaeologists know about their cultures with the search of the tombs and death.            There are so many reasons why this discoveries are important. We now know what was happening during the period they were living in. We can now understand what cultures they had and what did they do as hobbies. In conclusion we now know where they lived and what kind of houses they had. Finally it is important because some myths we all believe in can now be answered if it was true or false. This is why these discoveries are important to ancient history.

The inca made knots in colored called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first europeans to meet inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Some of what we know about inca comes from oral history , or stories  passed from generation to generation.               Archaelologists have found many acient quips but today no one knows what the knota mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorgul strings, understanding the acient inca is alot liek solving a mystery . We all know some of the old stories because they were writtewn down by the europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The vistitors were spanish soliers and priests . They decribed the inca letters and diaries. The spaniards did not speak the launguge that inca spoke. They may not have understood what the inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate . And some of the inca stories were legends .                     When the cliff dwellers of mesa verde left , they traveled south into New Mexico  and Arizona , settling among their kin who were already there. Whatever may have happened , some of today's Puebloe people , and maybe other tribes , are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of mesa verde.The structures are evidence of a society that , over centuries , accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation . By the classic Period A.D 1100 TO A.D. 1300 , Ancestral Pueblans were heirs of a vigorous civilzation , whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.

Incas made knots in colored strings which were called quipus in which they used to record the calendar to keep track of their livestock. Some knowledge of the Incas came from artifacts, or some objects that they had left behind. Incas have lived high in the Andes &amp; had worshiped some mountain peaks. Incas had mostly lived in high places or caves &amp; the faces of cliffs.        The Puebloans chose Mesa Verde for their homes. Archaeologists have called the Puebloans as the Anasazi, which means, 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies. Puebloans lives in pithouses clustered into small villages. The Ancestral Puebloans learned to make pottery &amp; use weapons such as a bow &amp; arrow, and a spear. Puebloans have used Kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain for their luck in hunting, or to have a good crop.        Pavlopetri was a sunken settlement dates back over 5,000 years ago. Archaeologists believe that Pavlopetri is one of the most oldest submerged town in the whole world. The exploration of Palvopetri revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, &amp; religious structures.

That is very impressive! They left behind artifacts that clued to their daily lifes. They had a government and religions too. They are important because they made a society without having many advanced things to work with.         Second,  the discoveries about the Puebloans are also very important. They lived in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were basketmakers. It is important to know about their society because they had skills and traditions that passed along from generation to generation.         Last, the Pavelpetri were also very important. They lived in Greece. Their city is now underwater. They are important because their city was very wealthy and grand. It is also one of the world's oldest submegerd cities.         As one can see these ancient civilizations are very important to learn about. Without knowing about them, we might not have learned about some of the things we have today.

The Inca            Although the ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing, they did make knots in colored string to keep record of livestock. If not for the clues left behind by the Inca , we would not known about this civilization that ruled the South American empire that rivaled the expense of ancient Rome for nearly a hundred years. These clues that the Inca left behind showed their way of life, transportation, government, religion, agriculture, and art and agriculture and with the knowledge of this, archaeologists pieced together the details of the Inca lifestyle.                                                All of what archaeologists know not only comes from artifacts of this civilization, but from the passing of stories from generation to generation.       The Puebloans              The first Puebloans were Ancestral and were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages that were sometimes built on mesa tops or cliff recesses. Since they didn't hunt or gather as much, farming became their main way to food. They also took the time to make pottery and developed a more efficient weapon for hunting by replacing the atlatl with the bow and arrow.       The Pavlopetri           The Pavlopetri were explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. The settlement was sunken and dated back to the time of Homer's heroes about 5,000 years ago, and in terms of wealth and size of detail is unprecedented.           Said to be the oldest submerged town in the world, Pavlopetri has remains dating back to 2800 to 1200 BC, years before the days of classical Greece. Archaeologists know that there are older, undiscovered sites in the world, but none can really be considered a planned town such as the Pavlopetri.           Lost Civilizations (cont.)           The discoveries of these lost civilizations are very important in history back then, and even today's history. Most of what archaeologists know about today's history comes from the discoveries of these lost civilizations, so before you think to yourself how boring early civilizations are to you, remember that these lost civilizations play a big role in our way of life.

These cities had they own language, alphabet, and writing system.It is very inportant that we know about the past.     For example the Inca's used a string system to keep records.This string was colored and then people put knots in them to keep the record of livestock. This was used throughout the whole Empire by everyone.The Inca's called them quipus.   We know about civilization's that date back past for as long as   man has been created. This infomation has been found from the clues that have been left behind. The things you find may be portait of religion, art, government and ways of lfe.   The art you may find is very old,but will have a big in what the civilization is all about. You may find government records that may have been left and can tell you what the system of order was for that civilization. If you find money that can tell you how they spent money, the prize of the goods they sold and more.   The information in ancient civilization's are very valueable. This is why ancient civilization are being looked for today. The ways of life back then would not have been able to be compaired to the life now if it was not for the findings of civilization's.

The Incas lived high in the Andes and may evem have worshiped some peaks.  Most of the Incas sites are in high places.  Living in high places preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them.  The rest of our knowledge of  Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found.  Some Inca Textile and clothing survived remarkably well.  Ancient material like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these survived, because it has been preserved in the dry desert of Peru.       The Puebloans:       The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (green table) about A.D 550.  The Puebloan are known as Basketmakers for their skill and craft.  The Puebloans lived in Pithouses from about A.D 550 to A.D 750, as settled agriculture began.  Pithouses have a living room sunk a few feet in the ground.  Four corner timbers the roof.  The firepit had an air deflector.  Pithouse will later on evolve to Kivas.  From here on these people are known as Puebloans meaning 'village dwellers.'  The Puebloans never left any written record and that was important in their lives perished.  The Puebloans has turned pithouses into kiva's.  Kiva is a Hopi word for ceremonial room.  The Puebloans were able to build and evolve/change pithouses into a Kiva throughout their lives.       The Pavlopetri:       The fable Atlantis have been brought into light from beneath the waters of Southern Greece.  The secrects of the lost city has been explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist known as Pavolopetri.  The site so far offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaen society.  The Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank.  Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going, said Sakellariou.  The myth of Atlantis has the archaeologists and geologists searching and trying to figure out why it even sank.       Having artifacts would make it easier or would at least give the scientists, archaeologist, and geologist a clue of what has been there.  Potteries, tools ect could help by telling how long they have been their and what sort of materials were used in order to build anything or make anything.

They want the people to know because they can compare the old technoloy with the new technology.There alot of differences because they got newer stuff.They also heve secrets that alot of the people dont know about the technology.Theres archeaology people that know and some dont know anything about technology.       They had ancient quipus alot of people didnt know what they were.The quipus are something to do with a knot.They know that it was nearly 100 years old the years were (1438-1532). The quipus were all from South Amercian Empire.The spaniards murdered the Incas last king from 1532 the took most of the impire.The photography helped them find patterens in the ancient monuments.Most of the Incas lived far in the mountians and they worshiped some mountian peaks.       The Greece was beneath the water. They were explored by an anglo-greek team and marine geologists. It was 30,000 square meter of the ocean and to the floor.Thry took potos of all the wierd creatures that were there.It was also the first sunken city to be found.

Well i'm going to tell you how important the Incas, the Peubloans, and the Pavlopetri are to our modern society.The Incas the Peubloans, and the Pavlopetri are all ancient society's from Peru, we dont speak their language but use clues to find out about their everyday life.Some of these discoveries have changed our modern day life.              First i'll start with the Incas, they are an ancient society from Peru that had a lot of influence with things we use and do. The Incas kept a calendar, and made knots called quipids to keep track of it and to count live stock.clues left behind from the Incas are art, architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportation, and way life.The incas used cloth preserved by the vast dryness of the desert.The inca buried their dead also like us.this is the Inca civilization.              Next i'm going to talk about the Puebloans.Known as basketmakers,for their skill at the craft, the puebloans lived in pit houses which are like tents.They made pots and aquired the weapon the bow and arrow.The Puebloans farmed, and lived in compact villages, they hgad some houses on cliffs and had churches.               The people called the pavlopetri lived in a place which is now underwater, we dont know exactly how it ended up underwater , but people think because a tsunami or maybe ground subsistence do to earthquakes.there were ceramics that dated back to the end of the stone age,about 5,000 years ago.Some investigations also revealed about 9,000 square meters of new buildings.This underwateer city is what had started myths like antlantis.                All of these different people(Incas,Puebloans,and Pavlopetri) have helped modern civilization.Without the discoveries we have made about these people the world may be different then it is today.

Every finding is important, it helps learn more about their way of life. Some of the most importanat findings archaeologits have made are about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Each one showed archeologits many different things about how the ancient people lived. Each one has its own meaning in the rare discoveries of archaeologits.           The Inca left behind many clues as to how they lived life. Due to the passing down of storeis and myths, archaeologists have found out their 'history'. Also, with the 'clues' the Inca left behind, we may be able to find out their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. For example, their way of keeping records was to tie knots in colored strings. Though no one knows what they mean now, it is proof that they kept records, and didnt' have a writing language or alphabet. What they also left behing was ruins of old buildings, textiles, and clothing, which in another way of figuring out how they lived. Archaeologoists have also found bodies in the ice of the Andes. With these bodies, which are well presevered, scientist have somewhat figured out how the person lived and died. The Inca discovery was very important because it not only showed how the people lived in their 'houses' and that they hunted and gathered, it showed they they kept recoreds, and they had stories and even history.           The Puebloans were/are known as basketmakers. They are also known for their houses, known as pithouses, and as they evolved into better structures, kivas. Puebloans were also one of the first tribes to also evolve from hunting and gathering to farming and having weapons for both. As they evolved into better structuers and better at farming, they learned to make pottery and more efficient weapons for hunting, like a bow and arrow. As they kept evolving, the houses evolved along. With the population growing, they startin making their pithouses above ground. They built houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in the front. Then they started making the houses of thick stone, often two or three stories high. Pithouses were now called Kiva. Now, this source was very important because it explained their living. Not just they lived in something called a pithouse or a hut, etc. This explained how the houses were build and how they evolved from underground made of dirt or above ground made of stone.           The Pavlopetir was dated from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the 'glory days' of Greece. Now this city is underwater. The site covers 30,000 square meters of ocean floor, and contains many artifacts. It has revealed building, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. Due to it being underwater it was presevered some iteams, and has shown different iteams of pottery. It not only showes ruins and what is left of the city unlike the other two, but it actually shows a city with has been dived underwater due to a natural cause. That's why it's important. It shows how the city was structured and placed, and how the streets looked. It was also a great finding because it is of the few underwater.           These places that archaeologists find are all important. They show a bit of history and something new in all of them. These three places were important because they went and explained a litte more than any other one of the ruins did.

520	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	NR			M	561249	8	11062509	Y	53045	 There have been many ancient discoveries in the past couple of years, namely Incas, Puebla, and Greek. These have all been made quite recently and shed insight on some of these cultures. More importantly however, it shows the ancient ways of life and tools of these groups, and may even develop our government even further than it is right now.       These groups may all be ancient, but what they lived in and where they lived was most certainly unique. Puebla Kivas might give us information about their past. These kivas obviously show us that the Puebla were religious, enhanced by the fact that they contained an 'entrance to the underworld'. As we can see from the Greeks, some chose to live in towns. Some of the Incas preferred more privacy, and chose to live in the mountains. Possibly more important than the shape or community these civilizations chose to live in are the locations. The Greeks lived near water. This means that they probably were not as worried about war, and might have lived off of seafood and foreign trade. In sharp contrast, the Incas lived in the Andes mountaintops and the deserts surrounding. Having the higher ground is an unmistakable advantage, which means they might have feared war more than starvation or running out of water.       Some of the tools made in each of these communities are still used today. The Greeks developed beautiful pottery, which has evolved into the plates and cups we eat and drink out of every day. The Puebla evolved the atlatl into a more complex, yet easier weapon to use, the bow and arrow. Archery was a typical war factor all the way until medieval times. and is still practiced for recreation and food today. Perhaps one of the most unique items developed in this time period was the Quipus. The quipus was developed by the Incas and was a way of keeping records by simple knots in string.       Can you imagine how much simpler life might be for government officials if we just did records in string? They would not have to worry about foreign countries seeing them, and we could put less time into preventing computer hackers and more time into working Obama's sixteen trillion dollar deficit down. This isn't the only thing we could learn, as we excavated the Incas, we learned that dry weather and freezing work very well for preservation. This has lead to more advanced coffins and chryrostasis. We could learn from their houses, for all the homeless people in the world. The ancient houses might be a good, affordable substitute for a modern house.       These advancements have all came from history, quite great accomplishments for people living in what we might consider the stone age. It is time for us to finally recognize that these ancient achievements are important; that they do really matter.

I think there important we wouldn't know the hitory of what happened there. I also think its important, because without the hitory we wouldn' t know of are ansestor. I also like how they made colorful clothing, clothes and other designs. They also wrote stories that were passed from generation to generation. I think they wqere realy smart because they made beautiful poetry, also made gold and silver. They were also creative and had a really good writing system.

For years, the have studied the lost civilizations of the world; the Inca, the Greek, and the Anasazi. The archaeoligists are exploring many sights to link the past to the present. It hasn't been easy though.           The Incas were all wiped out by Spanish conquistadors in the 1500's. Extremely wealthy, everything in their society had a lot of value, so it was taken by the Spanish and looters. This makes it hard to find objects to deduct what happened. When an archaeoligist does find something, it is photographed and documented, dusted off, but not moved. The location is essential to proving historical accounts true and to deducting what the item was used for. The mountainous terrain and dangerous jungles also make it hard to access. Event though most artifacts were stolen, the Incans left more clues behind then the Anasazi.            The Anasazi were a group of Native Americans living in the southwestern USA. The only clue left behind from this group were many structures and some hunting weapons. The structures indicate that they were a religious and creative group of builders. One such structure is called a kiva, a ceremonial room for religion. is Little is known about the Anasazi. With Greek society, we have a lot more to go off of.           The Greeks were a prosperous empire until the Romans came and took over, destroying most of their culture. A Greek city said to have inspired the myth of Atlantis is currently underwater. The city is called Pavlopetri and it's the oldest submerged town in the world. It has many artifacts because being covered in water makes it hard to loot. The shifting of sand in the currents has revealed a huge planned city with streets and everything. Marine geoligists and archaeoligists are using the latest digital technology in exploring Pavlopetri.            The Incas, Anasazi, and ancient Greeks are cultures that are lost to us. We can still explore the buildings that survived what the people did not. Geography has gotten in the way and often, things have been stolen from the site. Though it's been no cup of tea, archaeologists will not stop until they have put the lost pieces of time back into the puzzle. 	NNP PRP VB WP VBN CD NNS RB . CD . CD . CD .

Each uncovery holds a peice of information.         The discovery of the Inca village is very important. By discovering the ropes with nots we learned that the Inca had no writing or aphabet system. Some of what we know about the Inca is within stories passed down or told with nots. Some stories were writin down by Europeans that arrived. But Spaniards did not speak the same launguage though. The discovry of the Inca has help us understand many things about them and their lives.        Mesa verde, now a national park, was home to a group of people living in the Four Corners region about 1,400 years ago. They were often callled basket makers. They built strong houses and had  many techniecs. they also changed pottery. Without these people many things would be different and people would not have learned from their skills and ways.           Though atlantis is a fake story sciantis may have found what inspired the tall tale. Right off the coast of Greeca a sunken city was found. It was the oldest city ever found. Ceramics were found dating back about 5000 years ago. With out this discovery who knows how long the myth wouyld have kept people digging.

Around 1400 years ago, a people called the Puebloans lived.  Around 5000 years ago, a people called the Pavlopetri lived.  I find it amazing that we even know this, but I find it even more amazing that we can know all their ways of life.  Without discoveries by archaeologists, however, we wouldn't.  They are the ones who search through ruins of ancient communities, looking for artifacts.  Without their work, history class would be a lot more boring and pointless because there would be no information that was more than 100 years old.  Without the discoveries that have been made about the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, we would have no knowledge of what happened in South America and elsewhere long ago.        Some of the people who lived long ago were more technologically advanced than we think, and we can learn and use some of their ideas because archaeologists study artifacts and ruins.  Some of the discoveries made gave us valuable bits of information that are interesting to know.  For example, the Inca made their items out of materials like gold and silver, and we had yet to discover gold in 1800.  Also, the Inca ruled South America for around 100 years.  For this information, archaeologists had to find written records, and more importantly, interpret them.  It is harder than you think to understand ancient languages, especially the ones that are not in use today.         Without the discovered information, there would be gaps in our history of the world that would be awkward and strange.  But archaeologists are here to fill these holes with their discoveries of ancient civilizations.  These discoveries are some of the most important things to ever happen, so that people now can draw conclusions about what happened long ago and see the similarities and differences between their lifestyle and ours.  It is important to know about the way of life of civilizations long ago and also very interesting to know about civilizations long ago.

The world wouldn't be how it is if we never made any discoveries. We'd never know how people used to fed for them self and create better ways to live based on that knowledge. Here are some other reasons why archaeologist's discoveries are important.               In the first source 'Ancient Inca' archaeologists learned what happened in their every day life from letters and diaries. To archaeologists this is amazing, you achingly get to learn what happened to people thousands of years ago. And they learned what happened with the records they keep thousands of years ago. To archaeologists this is the key on live thousands of years ago.              In source two archaeologists were amazed by the sight of the home the Mesa Verde had built. They learned so much of their old religion by these buildings. It also show how simple their life style was as well for looking at these designs. With out these designs they may have ever know some of the facts they do.              As you can see I clearly explained why the discoveries archaeologists are important. Without these things some people will never know their true heritage.

The Incas used nots and colored string called quipus to recorded the calendar and to keep a count of there lifestock. The Puebloans learned to make potty and acquired the bow ans arrow, a more efficeny weapon for hunting tan the Atlanta. The Pavlopetri lived in a under water city called Atlantis but people to this day cant find it or know where it is at.   In conclusion that why it is important that they have records of the past.

Some people go out and try to find stuff from the past that had been digged in for like over 1oo years or less. Once they find that they go to the musseums and try to get money out of it , it all depends on what it is or was. Eventually the people that work there dont really take the stuff. BUt if they do they give out money and might even put it in their museum or just sell it to other museums to try and put it in other places.

They had absoutly not sytem of writing or and alphabet but they could still comunicate with one and other. One of their ways to comunicate was they would tie knots in strings that were different colors. The Europeans found in extremly amazing how they were able to have a huge site and be able to use just strings to keep track of things. No man on this Earth know what these knots mean today though. They say that understanding the acient Incas is just like solving a mystery. These people have left behind many clues such as buildings, pots, houses, etc. The archaeologist study these things still trying to put together the Incas way of life a hundred years ago. Stories about these people have been passing from generation to generation. Passing on these stories has made the Incas still alive today meaning we know that they once existed on our earth. The Europeans have written stories about them in 1532. The Spanish and priests also wrote about the Incas these stories about these people are a important way to know how they survived back then. Some of the Incas sites have been completely destroyed by the treasure hunters and the looters. People who take anything that might be valuable today. This still goes on to this very day. These people are basically taking away out history and making it a mystery by stealing things that might help to solve this puzzle. The Incas would live on high mountain tops and cliff faces which makes it harder for the looters to take things but it also makes it harder for the looters to take things but it also makes it harder for the archaeologists to get all of their equiptment up to the sites. The acient Incas are a very important part of our history and they always will be.               About 1,400 years ago is when the Puebloans were still around. These people chose Mes Verde as their home. For many years (more than 700) these people stayed here they built stone communites and lived in them. Houses of stone and much more.

And they were also used as stories in agent history scientist think its like a puzzle you have to figer it out.In (1438-1532) ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome?Their where alot of clues left behind from the inca but not just clues from their religion on they way they lived life! some of the scientist know that some of the old stories were  written down by the Europeans  who arrived in the empire in (1532).The visitors were Spanish soldiers and prist.The artifacts that were left was like Stones, Gold, or Siliver.Most of the atifacts are barried with in graves for the dead to use in thir after lifethe ARCHAEOLOGISTS  keeps record of everything they see, touch and find even herd from all over the web!The fall of  of the inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last king in 1532 and took over the empire.

A discovery that was made by the inca was that hundreds of years ago they had a diffrent type of writing system . So that made it hard for us to understand what they were saying. These are the reasons on why i think discoverys are imnportant to us.

Learning about the incas help us understand how the weather was back in 1532 and how the weather is now.

If nothing is never found then how do we know what happened back in the olden days. Like in Inca, Peru had know alphabet or system or writing . But some stories were passed from generation to generation. And some more knowledge of the Inca comes from their artifacts or objects that they left behind. Many artifacts were made from stone, pottery, gold or silver. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may have worshiped some mountain peaks.       The Puebloans were a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. Their were known as Basket-makers or their skill at the craft. Their population multiplied in A.D. 750 and started building their homes above ground made of poles and mud. By A.D. 1000 the people had advanced construction to skillful stone masonry. Their pottery also changed from simply designs to black drawings on white backgrounds. They used nature to their advantage building their homes beneath overhanging cliffs.       The Pavlopetri a sunken settlement that dates back some 5000 years to the time Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. Their village is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to be consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C. Palvlopetri was once a thriving city but now, its at the bottom of the sea being eroded away.

We have found out about a civilization  nearly a hundred years ago in 1438-1532 ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome by archaeologist searching on mountains like evidence or found bodies on undergrounds so the archaeologist looks for evidence and takes it to study it then the archaeologists check the bodies how long ago we they been alive, how old we they and then looks for places were they leave and how they lived. For example'Archaeologists have to be careful to make sure exactly which people built which sit. Archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about Inca's predecessors'. 'But it is also makes the job of the archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountain to study'.

I also strongly believe that electronics can make it easier to find answers faster and more clearer. Scientists have proven that some people at any age can focus better if they are listening to music at the appropiate times. For example like when the teacher is not talking or when your doing something indpendent and at those types of times. So, these are my reasons for getting electronics more involved in school and saying that they can help some people focus a lot better no matter what age you are.                 If I was allowed I would start my own petition to get kids and maybe even parents to change Theirs and others minds about the rules for electronics. But if I got a lot of signatures would it actually change their minds about electronic usage in school. But now in our school we have a program called 'BYOT' which means that kids are allowed to bring in their electronics and use them on the schools guest inernet. Such as phones, laptops and other devices but they can see if your on the things that you shouldn't be on. So I thank the people that had the idea of program and allowing BYOT exist.                 But another thing is that I think we should be allowed to text in school when we are at a time like lunch or when it is okay too. One reason for this is because if it is an emergency then you should be able to text back to whoever your talking to. Another thought is for some reason your gaurdian texts you then I think you should be able to reply back to them because they are the people that take care of the kids. So, this is just another reason for more usage for electronics in school.                 This is for at home it is easier for me to focus and get my work done while listening to music so why not at school. Is it because I could distract other students. For that I could just turn it down so they can't hear it. Or maybe because I won't focus on the teacher, if thats the case then I would only play music at appropiate times. So now that I have reasons maybe this will change peoples minds for electronic usage. If you are reading this then I thank you for actually taking the time to read and listen to what I have to say. So all the things I talked about in the end wrap up to the whole point in writing this passage.

The Incas were very skilled with stone and pottery as well as gold and silver. If it hadn't been for these found artifact the history of the Incas wouldn't be as accurate due to the fact that many of the oral tales are in-accurate.       With the discoveries of Pueblanos scientist learned that this civilization was known for its basket making and that as they evolved hunting and gathering was replaced with farming.       Pevlopetri was a settlement that was once above ground but that was some 5000 years ago. Nowadays the city is underwater much like the mythical city of Atlantis. Many of the articles are ' significances because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied'. Less than 1% of the worlds ocean floors have been explored, according to Sakellariou, which only continues the search for sunken cities.

They all provided what kind of buildings they lived in, the clothes they wore, the weapons they used, and what they did to survive.      The Inca was a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a Southern American that rivaled the expanse of Ancient Rome. The Inca used a piece of string called a quipu. The Inca weren't very known, so the very first Europeans to discover them were amazed at how they could run an empire just by using a piece of string.      The Puebolans settled in Mesa verde in A.D. 550. They are known for making baskets, pots, and used the bow and arrow at their time. They lived in what was called pithouses that sunk a few feet in the ground. Many generations have lived in Mesa Verde from around A.D. 550 to A.D. 1300.      The Pavlopetri was a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. The settlement dates back to 5000 years ago to the time of homers heroes. It's no doubt that its the oldest submerged town In the world with remains dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC. The empire contained a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets,  rock-cut tombs and religious structures. Archaeologists still aren't sure why the city sunk.

But we still want to learn about them, so i am going to tell you a little about them all.       The ancient inca started in about 1438 and ended about 1532. they were first founded by the europeans. they made many things like colored strings called quipus. this is how the kept their records. then years later south americans arived and were also very amazed. we only know these things because they were writen down by the spaniards. when we were digging we had found many artifacts from them silver gold clothing, they were all preserved by the desert. some of the inca sites were disturbed by treasure hunters. the inca fall was easy to date because the spaniards had just killed their last king and had taken over. that was the end of the ancient inca of peru.       the ancient puebloans lived about 1400 years ago. long before the europeans started exploring north america. for more than 700 years they had many decendants who lived and flourished there. they had a park anmed after them called the mesa verde national park. they farmed more than the hunted and they also weaved baskets. they had created a spear thrower that was called atlatl. they lived in pint houses they looked like a small tent with one side coverd. they were made of mud and poles. then after a while they were called cliff dwellers because they started living in the cliffs. no one really knows what has happened to the pueblo people now. that is what i read for the puebloans.       the lost greek city was found by marine biolagists. they had been diving and found land under water. it was weard because it was in pretty shallow water. where normally they are in very deep water. it is about 5000 years old experts say. it is no doubt the oldest submerged island ever found. it was dicoverd by a british oceanographer some 40 years ago. atlantis was amyth but a myth that keeps under water exploration going. their is still alot to be found under the great big ocean, so lets hope we keep it going.

Why do people take their time to find out what people did before we were alive? These are some of the questions that came up into my mind when i was reading this article. You may be asking yourself what I am talking about, so here it goes. I think that the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important to the nations history. My reasons for this are as follows. They were alive on our planet and influenced something or another, They came up with the Pithouses, as well as kiva.       These religions all had something in common. But what was it? Archaeologist found that they all lived in the same region and all had almost the same religious views. However, they did not come in contact with each other often. The Pueobloans invented the pithouses were called pithouses because they sank a coupple feet into the ground and they were quite small. The pithouses later envolved into a kiva though. This statement shows that if Archaeologist wouldn't have done research then we would have had no clue on anything that happened in our history. 	WP VBZ RB JJ .

Where would I be today if I didnt know where to put my shotgun. another invention they made was the church I dont know how they invented a church but I uess they did acording to this. They also inented traps where they could catch food.       They found a lost city at the botom of the ocean which is a huge acomplishment. There houses were very impressive because they didnt let rain in. They wernt really that advanced of people. But yet we still use some of there tactics today. Like the water ways thats right they invented that along with the fire place where you going to get your heat without them. Thats write your not. Some of their games were spear throwing and bow and arrow hunting.       They used the bow and arrow for hunting and killing animals. We use the bow and arrow for sports like in the olimpics. Speaking of the olimpics did you know that the united states took home gold in archery. Now that I think of it other than them eating dirt our civilizations are not that different. I wonder what it would be like to live avk in there time.

Knowledge of the past world helps us better understand the world of today. Take, for example, the Inca quipus. It was a tool of string used to record the population of a Inca empire. It helped the rulers in understanding just who it was, and how many it was, they ruled over.        Ancient sites also tell us what the world was like at that period in time. Graveyards housing the dead show us how long Incas lived on average, which can help us determine fatality rates for generations after. They also show us diseases that may have killed off many civilizations, which we may link to some diseases today, and in turn ay help us find cures for those said diseases. Buried sites also show us what weather patterns may have been like, which may aid us in figuring out how civilizations may have effected the environment around them.        Discovering these ancient empires also shows u the mistakes they've made so we can learn from them.          Some mistakes may include improper civilization placement. Civilizations built high up in the Andes Mountains were prone to rockslides. The cave that many lived in were susceptible to collapse. Another mistake would be abuse of the land. The Puebloans faced this problem.        The over use of land led to less fertile soil. Improper use of water led to droughts. These are thing one must avoid when part of a rapidly growing empire.        These are several things that the world has built on or improved Without the important discoveries of past societies, what would our be like today?

If we find out more about the ancient civilizations then we will be able to know about the things that they did and if they had an amazing idea then we could use it in our society and to make life better.       Also instead taking the good things that they did, we can find out what mistakes they made and other things that they didn't do right and we can avoid making those mistakes again.       Even if we help ourselves from the ancient civilizations it is still interesting to know what life was like in thease civilizations and also how their lifestyle was like.       So finding out information about ancient civilizations is important because we can use something that they did, learn from their mistakes and also it is just interesting learning about what life was like in those civilizations.

Discoveries of the inca civilization where important. one detail talkes of how the inca had no formal alphabet, but instead, used colored strings to comunicate the calender dates and keep track of livestock. this fact helps us understnd the complexity and orginization of earlier societys. other evedence found is paintings left behind by incan people, wich helped understand the start of the incan empire, and the information left by the spaniards dating the end of the incan rule with the murder of the last incan king in 1532.Understanding a full veiw of the incan timeline will help understand a full history of Peru.       Discoveries of the mesa verde and ancestral puebloans was also very important, because it perserved a reminder of acient culture. this soceity developed greatly over its time peirod, it was shown through the evolution of homes called pithouses, to pole and adobe constuction, to skillfull stone masonary.       lastly, a lost greek city found close to Neapolis believed to be atlantis helpes us understnd much more about earths history. with this citys complex organization of buldings and evedence of a very early beginning date of about 6,200 years ago shows that intellegence of human civilzations could have started earlier than believed.       the discoveries that have been made about acient civilizations such as the inca, puebloanss, and the pavlopetri where very important. because they helped us understand things like, perus history, a better look at the full veiw of earths history, the intelegence of aceint civilizations and the evoltution of humans and their societys.

The Inca's did not leave archives for historians to study. The inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the caledar to keep a count fo livestock.The Inca's had many recordings that they made and all the recording that the Inca's made were put in a calender.       The Inca's lived in Pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, as settled agruculture began. The pithouse featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbets supported the roof. The firepit had an air deflector. An antechaber might contain storage bins or pits. The sipapu was a hole for passage to the underworld, from whick the people had come. Pithouses later evolved into kicvas.       Using nature to advantage, ancestral puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhaging cliffs. Thier basic construction meaterial was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size fo a loaf of bread. The mortar between the blocks was a mix of mud and water. Rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, space enough for two or three persons.       The secrets fo a lost city that may have inspired on of the world most enduring myths the fable fo the atlantis have been brought to light from beneath the water off southern Greece.       The found creamics dating back to the end of the stonage. Which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5000 years ago, at least 1200 years earlier than originally though.Who codirected the underwater suvey was a man named Henderson.

The incas also started building shelter that would protect us from weather, intruders and animals. Some of the construction used by incas gave us good ideas for the tools used today.             The life people lived back in the 1500s was a base for how we live today. People built shelters for protection, they gathered plants for medicine, animal leather for clothing, and sharpened sticks and stones for weapons. Now we improved our ways and now use cotton or wool for clothing, framed wood for houses, and projectiled type weapons.             We usually find these artifacts in caves up in mountains, called dwellings, which tell us that people lived here in these conditions, where it was cold. It makes it hard to get these artifacts because people would have to climb these mountains which was hard thing to do, especially back then. People built something like churches. They were called Kivas. Kivas were used for healing rites, luck on hunting, good crops, or praying for rain. People built fires in summer for cooking. In the winter, they were built for warming up the cold villages.               The worlds oldest. City lies under water known as the sunken settlement in Greece and it had been here since 1500 B.C. Many ancient structures were found here and were worth so much money at this time. No one knows how this city shrank, but theories have suggested that it were sea level changes, and ground subsidence as a result of earthquakes or tsunamis.                 Today, people know so much of what happened a long time ago because of primary sources, ancient artifacts and homes left behind. But there is a lot of evidence that is unanswered about these artifacts and resources. It is quite interesting in my opinion. That is how some of the things from ancient times could help us out.

As fascinating as these time periods were, there was scattered information. Sometimes, archaeologists would have more information on one subject than the other. This made it difficult to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle.       Archaeologists had a really difficult time deciphering the Inca's language, as they barely had any written information or records. Something that was an astounding breakthrough however was a quipu. This was a 'device' that the Incas made and used. This wasn't any particular was of writing or keeping track of events, but it was a number system. A quipu had a bunch of different colored strings that symbolized many different numbers. The quipu was extremely vital and important because it showed that the Incans were capable of inventing their own number system.       In Mesa Verde, Puebloans were shown as intelligent by the important findings made by archaeologists and historians, as well as scientists. The Ancestral Puebloans found out their own unique way of building huts, or 'Pithouses'. These living spaces were extremely important findings because it showed how the Puebloans lived. Soon, Pithouses became even more complex when they evolved into 'Kivas'. Kivas were made of a more solid, almost stone-like, clay. Not everyone lived in a Kiva as they were used as a ceremonial room and often held rituals for healing or praying. Shortly after Kivas were made, people called Cliff Dwellings started appearing. As their name states, they lived in cliffs. The first reports of Cliff Dwellings were made by cowboys in the 1880's, and this is when archaeologists started getting interested. These cliff homes were very sturdy and provided excellent protection from weather and other dangers such as enemy tribes or wild animals.       If you've ever heard of an ancient civilization called Atlantis, you might recall hearing somewhere that it had been submerged into the ocean and renamed 'The Lost City'. For years on end, divers and archaeologists have been trying to uncover secrets and other information about this sunken city. Though it still remains a mystery, the finding that have been made so far are extremely important to uncovering a truth. In source #3, 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets', the author states that a monumental structure consisting of a rectangular hall called a megaron was discovered. This means, that the settlements status was raised because these were usually used by an elite. Not only was a megaron found, but ceramics dating back to at least 5000 years ago were uncovered as well. This means that Atlantis would have been submerged a full 1200 years earlier than scientists originally hypothesized.       As mentioned thoroughly in all 3 sources, archaeologists made some extremely important findings that helped historians and other experts find out the real truths along the way.

Have you ever thought about the myths in our and about how,well what if they arent myths? Well im here to tell you about the great Ancient Inca! Im here to tell you about the secrects and facts of Inca, and how much Archaeologists have found. Historians have been very careful when they interpres these things in Inca. The knowledge from Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that the people of Inca left behind. Also some of the knowledge comes from sites where some of he artifacts were found.       Inca of Peru had no formal alphanet or a way of writing. They didnt leave archives for historians to study either, it was their home. Inca used strings to keep records of things and the first Europeans to meet them were amazed by it. Some of the imformation that comes about Inca is from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. The Spanish soldiers and priests thsat met Inca people described them in letter and diaries. Some clothing and textiles have also sruvied as a part of the Inca history.       Archaeologists are afraid that treasure hunters have taken some valuable things left from the Inca people. Though the things that were left provied some quiet eye grabbing attention to you. Archeologists have to study real hard on the detail of the sites and who they were built by. We learn about the past of Inca with the help of Archaeolgists, without them we wouldnt know half the facts and resouces we have to stand up from the myths. All in all discovers about places like Inca, the Puebloans, and Atlantis may all seem as myths to you but, in this world all these myths have came true by the help of Archaeologists.

Clues were left behind by the Inca for a portrait of religion art agriculture, etc. that's a way for archeologists to find out how the inca lived. Some things that we know are mainly from the Inca. Like for history for example, Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532, wrote them down.            Most of the history of the Inca comes from the knowledge of how archeologists discovered the artifacts and etc. such as stone gold pottery silver clothes also still exist from that time most was destroyed by dampness.       Puebloans History:             The first Puebloan settled in Mesa Verde, in 550 A.D. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, to use for hunting.When they settled they began creating their shelters known as Pithouses.             In A.D. 750 they began making houses above ground, for there on they were known as the village Dwellers. Between A.D. 1100 &amp; A.D.1300 during the classic period the Puebloans population grew, their was about several thousand. About A.D. 1200 some people began  moving back to the cliff alcoves. The alcoves were a more safe place to live away from the elements.           Local cliff dwellers were reported by local cowboys in the 1800's.           Lost Greek City History:        The Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists back 5000 years ago. The Greek city was 30,000 sq meters of the ocean floor off the Southern Peloponnese.A British Oceanographer 40 some years ago, discovered it.  Atlantis was a myth that keeps under water explorers going.

Pavlopetri is important because.The sunken settlement dates back some 5000 years ago homers heros terms an ealth. an  now there is no doubt that is the oldies submerged town in the world an the un iversity remains dating 2800 to 1200 bc the long  befor glory an the last thing is that the sunken city has been found in greece that predates the time that plato wrote on his allegorical that is the suken continent of Atlantis.

The answer to that question is that, they would have lived with everything.  These ancients would live with everything they got. They would build monuments and statues to honor those how would have opposed it. And for afterward the people would have gone to live on with their own lives and do what they have as a routine. So they would have done everything in their live to survive this all.                          The same would have gone for the Lost Greek and they would have been in a good world. But they had mostly focused on finding the lost world of Atlantis. They would have done everything in order to prevent the from finding it. Then they would go out and find themselves a good way to discover this for the archaeologists and make themselves useful to this theory. They would have even the Mesa Verde to find and talk about. Make a lot of theories in how all of this was made.                        Mesa Verde was a national park that had inspired the people to go to. The people would love ths park and would make it their place to have a good time. Mesa Verde was a popular park in which people can go out and have a great time with their families and friends. The people who made this park had good things going on in the past. They would have to start with little shacks to build up with and then they would have to make open area to make a safe play area.

These ancient civilizations have provided sufficient information about how life was lived beofore modern times.        The Incans had no sort of system of writing or alphabet, but they did have a kind of number dvice called a quipus. This device was used by tying knots onto a rope, and using that to keep track of numbers. keep track of livestock and to record their calendar. This early system of record keeping was useful in the Incan empire, and showed us how advenced they were. Humans today have still never decoded the system, this shows how advenced they must have been to be able to come up with a complex code that only they could understand.        A group of people called the Puebloans were very helpful in understanding the weather and way of life these people had. They lived in 550 A.D. and were well known for being amazing basketmakers. This shows us that they had makings and certain plants that allowed for this. They also were very early farmers, instead of being hunters and gatherers. They were very advanced and built pithouses gathered in small villages on mesa tops. They were amazing engineers in the way they mastered making houses and basketweaving. Their techiniques of basketweaving are still used, and since they were so durable we have some today!        There is a legend of an underwater city off the coast of Greece. It is the oldest submerged city in the world, it is 30,000 meters of ocean floor. Though some people want to believe it was built underwater, it was really just sumberged much later after it was built, caused by earthquakes. Archaeologists ahve found ceramics and ruins, believed to have belonged to an ancient group of people called the Pavlopetri. We have learned taht they had pottery and an advanced social hierarcy, which is amazing.

The ancient civilizations that used to occupy the land we live in today we have little knowledge of. Part in because of the inaccurate records and geographical difficulties. So archeologists go back to where it all originated from to see what happened and how these people lived.            The Inca who lived in present Peru did not use a letter system but instead used pictures and specially designed calendars. Some knowledge we have today comes from the oral stories that have been passed down through the generations. However many of the things we know about ancient civilizations comes from artifacts found in the cities of origin.            The people who lived in all these tribes lived in special ways unlike each other and constantly changing. Many archeologists are still learning and gathering information about these lost cities in ruin. They can determine how many people lived in the city, the conditions, and how they lived their everyday lives. Many old Spanish records are inaccurate due to the difficulty of having to learn the language of the people and not always understanding what they were saying.           Thanks to archeologists we have learned many things about the past and all the things that happened.

One of the biggest things we look at in their unique civilizations are the buildings. We study how they were built, and what they are made of. Sometimes these buildings have writings on them that state certain beliefs and/or cultural differences.       Many archeologists study cultural systems such as religions, the arts, clothing, and rituals (if any). Every society has their own culutural differences making them unique, like how the Inca used colorful rings as an alphabet, or the Navajo and their pottery. Most of the native civilizations also had interests in the arts wether it be the musical art, theatrical art, the written word, or even as basic as a drawing on a wall.

Well, there are three recently discovered civilizations. There are the Inca's, the Puebloans, and the Palvopetris. These three cities are such an important find, because it links us with the lost past and inspires archaeologists to search for more lost lands. The Inca's used no form of writing, nor did they have an alphabet.     First, the Incas were a civilization that lived in the Andes. The Inca's were a civilization that had no alphabet or writing. The Inca's us quipus, or colored string, to record their calendar to keep count of their livestock. Noone still knows what the knots mean. We discovered about the ancient Incas by their clues left behind with architecture and paintings. We also know some about the Incas from stories past down from many generations, and Europeans wrote down about them. Since the Inca lived high in the Andes the dead bodies were frozen which helps us learn about how they died and lived.     Next, the Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde. They lived there for about 700 years until they left their homes and moved away. The Puebloans were very skilled at basketmaking and they were formally Nomadic, until they began to lead a more settled way of life. They farmed more than they hunt for food. They lived in pithouses that were clustered into small villages. By A.D. 1000, the Puebloans used stone masonry. In A.D. 1200 the population began to shift and they moved back towards the cliffs. They lived in these cliff dwellings for about 100 years until they they left.     Finally, the Palvopetris werew found in the ocean. They sank 5,000 years ago. It is the biggest submerged town in the world. It straddles 30,000 meters of the ocean floor. They had buildings, courtyards, mainstreets, and rock cut tombs. They had ceramics dating back from the end of the stone age. They had a town hall and the city was never reoccupied.     These civilations help archaeologists figure out about the past and inspire them to find more. the Incas, the Puebloans, and thePalvopetris were such an important find for archaeologists and helped ancient discoveries.

And then most of the people dont even get credit for finding the titanic or the lockness monster even no she or he is not real and thats the thing people who think the lockness monster is real they go look for it maybe say some 37 year old man found the monster of course like an idiot hes going to run around saying ' i found the monster i found the monster she or he is at the bottom of the pacific ocean.'' yeah okay there going to get someone to go down there for at least 7 to 15 hours of their life and say '' do you see it yet and then about 15 hours later your going to surface and then the monster is going to come out and thats the one reason belive that the lockness monster isnt real and it may be but i dont think it is because someone would have got killed by it all ready and other stuff, but what im trying to say is that people do find things in the bottom of the sea and why not be one of them go live your life nbe free and enjoy it why you still have time and stay out and never be someone your not going to want to be in the future and thats the story of the night the best one on the test and your welcome for this perfect all most perfect theres actually a lot wrong with it but ill be the first to admet to that .

Archeologists have found many things but understanding them is like solving a mystery.          They have pieced together information from these clues that have been left behind. The Inca lived high in the Andes and are thought to have worshipped some mountain peaks. Bodies found in the Andes were so preserved scientists scan the bodies with modern day technology.          The first ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde. They were skilled in crafts. They farmed and hunted. their homes were called pithouses and the villages were small.          Atlantis was a lost city that has sunk underwater. It is one of the oldest lost cities.         All these places and groups of people are thought to be interesting because people are intruiged by the things that have been found and the information that has been collected from the past.

They were all very old civilization that we discover a lot about. Maybe not all history is that interesting but this is.                     The Inca was one of the largest ancient civilization. They did not leave anything written behind so we learned everything we know about them by looking at their artifacts. If you read more about the Inca would definitely find it remarkable too.                      Another very interesting civilization are the Puebloans. They built great pithouses and amazing churches. Some of them were also cliff dwellers.                    Then we get to the Pavlopetri civilization which I find the most interesting becuase we found it underwater.

They used Quipus or colored strings to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. They also kept a portrait of their religion. They also had art and archetecture, agriculture, government, and their way of life. They also passed stories from generation to genaration. They know a little about Ancient Inca.       Ancient Puebloans lived like the Incas but, they had a different culture. Before the Puebloanss were hunters and gatherers.Then they became successful and changed their culture. They made baskets and pottery. One day the Puebloans moved, maybe for defence or religious reasons. Their homes were small, and inside holes back then, and they were called pithouses. Then they started making houses above ground. The houses were made out of poles and mud. They built houses agaist another in long, curving rows.  When they joined the houses together, they had at least 50 rooms or more.

It straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Atlantis was discoverd by a British oceanographer 40 years ago. What they found surpassed all expectations. Shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the ploration revealed a world of buldings, courtyards main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.

The inca are important because the form an amazijng portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. Archeologist can compare what they learn from arifacts and sites with the spaniards accounts to confirm historical records. They find out where it came from and what happened to it and how did the civilazation came to an end.             The pueblanos are very important too. The mesa verde national park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. We can learn of how they started making their homes out  of poles and mud. Them moving gave rise to the cliff dwelling for which mesa verde is most famous. Their lives is very intresting but we will never know thw whole story. Some of today's pueblo people, and maybe other tribes are descendants of the ancestral puebloans of mesa verde.                  Lastly, theres the pavlopetri, that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths. The site was believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Thanks to the shifting sands and the settlements enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, ruck cut tombs and religious structures. Eventhough alot of this civilization still remains a mystery it has become an very important and intresting place to keep discovering.

LOL...  anyway, its very important to know what customs other people had before us so that we can learn from them and that we can also take in things from other cultures and make better of them.

There are things in the past that arent here today or that have got us where we are by new writing or languages that werent known things before. Its important because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied. Which means it was a one time deal. People lived there and made lives there and as it sunk there was no life to be found. Nothing existed there anymore and maybe someone would like to know why.            The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. It not only shows how people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow. Meaning there must have been life there. They would like to know all about it at one point. How it got there and why it sunk. If they can figure that out than the importance would be finding more and more.               Older generations always knew it was there but they had no idea about the extent of it. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. So with them finding it so late in time they had even less time to really study it before it was washed away by sand and water. Less than one percent of the worlds ocean floors have been surveyed so there must be more but they wont know till they look. Atlantis is an extraordinary find but there is still lot more down there that has to be found. Other artifacts and places may be down there and Atlantis will help find them. With them finding Atlantis it may lead to more submerged towns if they can study this one to full extent and find its all true values.            They say it remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. This is before christ and some say nothing existed before christ so with this there is proof that things existed. There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is so unique. It is also said to be the oldest Submerged town in the world which makes it very important to our world history and how we came to be. Maybe its not the real important parts of history but we wont know that until they actually fully investigate it.            In the future i think it would be good for people to know about the past and things that took place in the past. They might want to know about the past places and past people, but in my opinion i think it would be amazing to know about a sunken place such as the lost city of Atlantis. There might be more to Atlantis than we know and have found but we they will never known because of the never ending amount of sea levels and ocean floors. The importance is the past and how it effects the future.

The discovery of the Inca and The Puebloan's are very important, because many important and fasanating facts were revealed. We learn about how the people lived in the ancient civilized times. How they survived. And what they went through. It show's us the Uniqueness in these towns. There different cultures. In some cases you can even see what kind of diseases and illnesses where in the town if theres human remains. Lots of things get discovered. Thats why there important. These towns are important to our history. All these facts discovered helps us understand how kife was back then. It also helps us value what we have, because they didnt have what we have back then.       In the 'Ancient Inca' they found many artifacts such as preserved clothing. Clothing usually is destroyed by all the dampness but these clothing were preserved. It's very odd and fasanating. Some Inca artifacts are made of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. Pottery is a very good artifact, because they probably wrote stories on them and there pattern designs are fasanating, there awsome. They even found bodies in the icy Andes. They ran medical scanning to see how the people died. It also revealed to them how the people lived.       In 'Mesa Verde(Puebloan's)' they found out how people lived and what they lived in. The mesa verde peole lived in pithouses. Pithouses are small houses that have a sunk living room about a few feet in the ground. And it has a four corner tombers supported roof. But then later on pithouses evolved in to Kivas. Kivas were a gathering place, much like a church. Pilasters supported a beam and mud roof. And the entry was a ladder through a hole in the center of the roof. You see that it shows us that they had different entries then now. Now we have doors, we dont have to climb a ladder just to get in a building through a small hole in the roof.       Now the discovery of Atlantis was inspired, because of all the other discoveris that had been made. Atlantis is a unique town. It also has different cultures. They found many pottery and religous buildings in it. Which is great. Atlantis is found in southern greece underwater. Atlantis was discovered 40 years ago. But is older than 40 years. Atlantis straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Atlantis is the oldest sumereged town. It has so many secrets. All those secrets need to be revealed. Atlantis is a myth                 Imagine if  we wouldnt of found these towns. We wouldn't of known all the facts that we know now. We wouldnt know that even existed. That wouldnt be good at all. All those extrodinary facts unknown.       	NNP NNP .

They help teach us about the past and what people did to survive in ancient times. The Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri all help support the information we use to teach kids all over the world today.       In ancient Inca, there was no alphabet or system of writing. The times have changed from way back then until today. Imagine your life today without the alphabet, it would be pretty hard. There definitely would not be texting. How did they survive? Archaeologists believe that they used knots on colored string to record the calendar and keep count of livestock. This seemed to work for them at the time, but without any other real form of recording things, understanding the Incans is like solving a mystery.       The Puebloans were very skilled. They invented many types of houses and are considered very good basketmakers. They also created farming to replace hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. Life would be very hard these days without the help of the Inca. We would not even know how to produce our own food. How would we have adapted to the old lifestyle?       Without the devastating blow to the Pavlopetri society, we probably would bot know how to predict disasters such as the weather. We also wouldn't know how to react to things such as earthquakes and tsunamis. This ancient ruin has greatly helped influence our warning system to help avoid people in the way of danger.       All of these ancient discoveries helped us gain the knowledge we have today. It has helped us to invent things such as computers and cars. Without the knowledge of how these things worked in the past, we gain no skill of building things for the future. So, thank the people who made these discoveries, because without them who knows where we would be today.

It is very important to understand how another people lived a long time ago because someday we may find something that is very helpful and important to us.

The inca were people with a huge empire that could be compared to the empire of the romans. The incas had no written language and didnt leave any archives we could study. The incas made colorful knots to record things but till now we can not 'interpret' any strings with knots from the incas.We have oviously made discoveries of the incas for a reason and that reason is to find out their daily life plans.                 The puebloans are people that lived in caves 'cave dwellers'. And we really want to know how their daily life in a cave was during all the four seasons were.Another thing is that why did they all die and didnt leave any interesting artifacts behind.What we do know about them is that they had skill in makeing pottery.               The pavlopetri were people in a city that is known as atlantis and that city is under the water.Atlantis was used to thuoght a myth but know that we found it we can find artifacts about them.We also have a question how did the city end up in the sea?,and where were the people when it fell?And we probably cant find out if they had a written language because their are under water.

Nobody can treally understand what there knots means. They made some object from, prottery gold or silver. They whorshiped some mountian peaks. They were buried in caves in cliff faces.    In North Amereica long before Eurpoens explored there, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for there home. Mese Verde is spanish for Green Table. Farming replaced Hunting and Gathering as their main livelihood. they lived in pithouses.   In Southern Greece the fable of the lost city or as we know Atlantis, Have been brought to light from beneath the waters of southern Greece. They have found ceramtics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago.

The discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri can show this.       The Inca kept track of multiple things using nothing more than tied knots called quipus. They used these for everything from calendars to keeping track of their livestock. The Inca ruled South America for about 100 years, and their expanse rivaled that of Rome. While many sites have been looted for valuable items, many remained hidden. This is partially because many Inca cities were built up high on mountain tops. This keeps the looters from getting to them, so archaeologists have been able to find them undisturbed. They find many artifacts to show the history of the Incas and how they lived. These range from scraps of cloth to diaries that Spaniards kept when they visited them. All of these things contrubute to seeing the rise and fall of the Incas.       The ancient Puebloans are still shrouded in mystery. While much is known about them, such as the homes the lived in, there are still a few questions. However, scientists have learned much about them. They adopted an agricultural lifestyle at Mesa Verde. While there, the quality of their homes increased until they were building multiple-story buildings with intricate stonework. They were also know as great basketweavers, and archaeologists have found examples of changing the way the made pottery. Eventually, they moved to the space under the cliffs where they lived and learned for a while. Then, they went off south, to families in new Mexico and Arizona. The reason is still unknown, but there are theories. One is that after hundreds of years the land was depleted. This may still be in speculation, but there is a great many things known about the ancient Puebloans, and they were a great race.       The secrets of the sunken city have been partially brought to life, thanks to a team of Anglo-Greek archaeologists and geologists. For a long time, people have been told the myth of the lost city of Atlantis, and they may now be revealed as true. Protection form the elements has revealed a large city, full of buildings, and even shards of pottery all over the seafloor. These ruins date back to possibly 5,000 years ago, 1,200 years farther back than scientists previously thought. While these ruins were discovered 40 years ago, not until recently were they showed in such detail. Scientists think that it may have once been above ground, but sunk due to rising sea levels, earthquakes, and other natural events. Thanks to the astonishing discoveries of archaeologists, the myth of Atlantis may no longer be a myth.     In conclusion, many of us have a fascination with the people that lived long before us. The hard work of archaeologists have uncovered many secrets of the past that have quenched our thirst for knowledge. There are still many things to be learned, and one day we may finally learn all we want to know about those who lived in the past, such as the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.

In the writing to the left, it talks about many different discoveries that they have either dug up and found, stories past down  from the Inca people in the past, or just simply looked around for items left behind.           For example, ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing, so because of this they made knots in colored strings called Quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many of these ancient quipus, but today no one knows what the knots mean. Since nobody knows how to read or interpret what the colorful strings and knots are or stand for, it is very much like a mystery to the archaeologists.           Also, clues left behind  by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of  life. By studying these clues that they left behind, archaeologists can put pieces and details together to form what the Inca life was like.           Some of the Inca's history came from stories past down from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was a super important way to preserve a community's history. Archaeologists say that some of what we know are from stories that were written down by the Europeans in the 1530's. They wrote the Inca's stories down in diaries or in letters. But some of the Inca's history may be thought of as legends, because the Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language very well so some of the stories may not be true.          What we know today are very important facts about the Inca history found by are Archaeologists that work very hard to discover them. We now know their way of  the Inca living and life styles that are very important to history. The Inca people lived a interesting life and are still remebered to this day.

Therefore , they keep records on lost civilizations so they can study about them in the future. That is a very important thing , too keep track of their health &amp; their stabilization. Without keeping track of their things , we would probably not know one thing about them. Keeping track of them , is actually very very important. It shows how they are,what they have been doing. Its just simply their records. The record is imporant though. Say if they were too get stolen or ripped or anything. That would be a very bad thing. You would probably have too pay a fee or serve some time for doing something like that too it. Lost civilizations are usually what people learn in history about. Archaeology unlocks secrets of the past. The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding ther Anicent Inca is alot like soloving a mystery. So how do we know about a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a South American empire that rivaled the exspanse of ancient Rome? Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, argriculture,goverment,transportation,and the way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca Life. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history,or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and preists. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate. And some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found. As in many ancient civilizations,Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone,pottery,gold, or silver. Such materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundereds of years. Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness,but these have been Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archaeologists very much. Other sites are reported to Archaeologists, who can dig them up ccarefully. They provide the bestidea of all about life in Peru before and during Inca rule. Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down Photograph any artifacts they find, and note the exact positionin which they find them. They need too learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards accounts of the Inca. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record. Amoung the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happen too it. The fall of the Inca is easyto date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the empire. The orgins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived had been inhabited by diffrent people's. Archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world too discover more about the Inca's predecessors. You'll see how aerial photogrtrapghy can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they connot see from the ground. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped too preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult. High-altitude archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equiment up a mountain for study. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equitment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived .     	NNS IN RB JJ IN IN NN NNS .

624	AI-XC	20131218113507	1000	1000	H	N	N	F	593998	8	11062706	Y	53045	           Lost Civilizations                                 There have been many ancient civilizations that have dispersed or have been lost in modern society. In this article there will be information about three different lost civilizations, the ancient Inca tribe, the ancestral Puebloans, and the lost city of Atlantis. They were all once great communities, but they all were lost.               The Inca were once very powerful, they, at one time, controlled most of South America. The Inca tribe had no real way of writing, there was nothing left behind for the archaeologists to study. There was a colored knot system that kept record of the calender to keep count of the animals. There have been archaeologists that have found this ancient knots, but have never been able to understand what the knots mean. Since nobody can read the stories left in the colorful strings, figuring out the way that the Incas lived is much like solving a mystery with no clues. There are still clues left behind by them, like portraits of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Using these clues many archaeologist are able to interpret what some of their daily life routines were like. Some things that historians know comes from oral history, and stories that had been passed down from generation to generation. Europeans, who had arrived in 1532, had written some of the stories down and had described the Inca in letters an diaries. It is hard for historians to really know what to understand, because the Europeans did not understand the European language well. Their descriptions of them probably would not be accurate either. Everything else the archaeologist know comes from the artifacts that they find in excavations. Many of the artifacts are mad out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver, and many of them are found in ruin of the building, or in a grave for the dead to use in the afterlife. There are som sites that do not help the archaeologists, because of looter, or treasure hunters, that had gotten the artifacts first. But many other sites are first found by the historians who find artifacts and may be take to different museums. The historians can differentiate the differences between the artifacts and the Spainards descriptions of them.               A long time before the Europeans explored North America, there was a group of people living in the Four Corners region, who chose Mesa Verde as their new home. For over 700 years generations lived and made their lives there. But in the late 1200s the moved away. The first Ancestral Peuebloans that lived in Mesa Verdewere known as Basketmakers, for their superb skill at the craft. They had begun to live off farming instead of hunting and gathering. There was a time that their population had multiplied, and houses had begun to be built above ground. After this occured, they had begun to be known as Publoans. Back to the former statement claimed, the Puebloans had begun to move from Mesa Verde, and go to the cliffs around the late 1200s. Nobody knows exactly why they had done that, but all that is known is that there was a drought towaards the end of the 1200s, and that they would not be able to do anymore farming. Nobdy will ever know the whole story and the Puebloans because most of what was important to them perished long ago. When the moved to the cliffs, they used them to their advantage, they had begun to make their homes under the overhanging cliffs. But they only lived there for around 100 years.               There are many stories to a submerged city, and about 40 years ago, it may have been found. The lost city of ATlantis was just a myth, but because of that myth many people kept searching the bottom of the oceanfloor for this grand city. It is believed that this city had been under water for about 5000 years, many experts say that in terms of size and wealth the amount is unforseable. There are other sunken cities around the world, but none seem to be as modern as this city, which is what makes it so unique. The reason that historians believe it was submerged 5000 years ago, is because some of the ceramics found dated back to the end of the stone age, this was over 1200 earlier than they had once thought. This city is very significant because as a submerged site, it had never been reoccupied, unless by fish. Many marine geologists still wonder why the city sank, and they are still trying to figure out why and how. It is a theory that the sea levels had changed, or ground subsidence, which could have had and outcome of a series of earthquakes or tsunami.                   There are many different reasons why archaeologists would be so interested in the past. All that we know is what they have figured out.

Other reasons are because some things might have an explanation for something. I think that some of the discoveries that they make are very important and have a significant meaning to people and are also fun to look at. There a lot of reasons why some of these discoveries are important and mean a lot to some people in the world.           For example some things that they find are historic things that are over hundreds of years ago and are interesting to look at. There have been cases where  archaeologists have discovered things from the dinosaur era to the era of the Mayans. Some of the discoveries they make sometimes have meanings to many cultures and religions. they might have a meaning to one of the gods they believe in or something to do with their religion. Other discoveries have things to do with ancestors of people and how they used to live back then or what they would were.            Archaeologist have been making lots of discoveries for over many years. Discoveries sometimes have an explanation to something like why something occurred, how someone became a ruler, or maybe how something was invented. In my opinion I think that's how information is gathered from the past events and how they occurred is from the discoveries archaeologists make that support the event. Archaeologists discover things that have symbols and pictures that represent something but are written in many types of languages that people used to communicate in. The languages or symbols are hard for them to understand and sometimes miss out on things that might be important or interesting.          Some discoveries that are found by archaeologists are fun and entertaining to look at. Archaeologists sometimes find statues, paintings, cloths, utilities, and sometimes toys that kids used to entertain each other with.  Statues are interesting to watch because you get to see there artistic view and the details they put into them. Their paintings were also a pleasure to see because you would get to see the portraits they painted and wonder who it was. They would also paint symbols that represented their tribes or cultures.The toys that the kids used to entertain each other with are also interesting to look at because you would get to see how their toys were back then.Another thing is that you would get to see how artistic they can get when it comes to entertaining each other. They would use anything they could find and build a toy. They would sometimes even play with rocks and sticks.          Archaeologists work very hard to discover new things and to entertain us with the things they discover. They have made a lot of amazing discoveries that amaze people. Today they are still out in the desserts, mountains, and oceans hunting for new discoveries. Some archaeologists have to survive any type of weather that hits them because they wont give up until they find what they are looking for.

Over the past years,     we have come apond many ancient civilizations. Three in particular are the Inca, Mesa Verde,  and the lost city nicknamed Atlantis. Now the question is what have we learned from them.       First up we have the Inca. When studing the Inca civilization, we have discoved that this small place has been surviving for around a 100 years based on a system called quipus. This is their way of keeping records and making calenders. The incas also used this method of recording for counting cattle and for keeping a diary. So far after many years of studing them we still havent figured out what the colored notes on the quipus represnts, making this civilization more interesting and mysterious. I doesnt really help either that its on top of a dangerous mountain       Next is the MEsa Verde. THe thing about there little world is that it was astablished in AD 550. When claering the sight, arcutecs found many ancient tools, writings, pottery and weapons. They also learned that these ancient people lived in structed pithouses that were clustered together like a community. the mesa verde people lived roughly for 200 years but why. scientist found that they lived so long because of there variety of weapons they have to kill. they taught them selfes to use a bow and arrow and how to throw spears creating a longer civilization.       Lastly we have the alantic city. It was said to be a myth but it turns out it was true. although there isnt any mermaids discovered, there was a discovery of structures  and pottery. Why this ancient greek city sank to the ocen? we might never know, but with the knowlege and technology we have  we might dicove why and be ably to ee why.       All in all, history is something we learn from. It also helps us learn from our past history. So next time you think history is stupid, remember this.     	WRB VBP PRP RB NN .

Like the Incas invented the quipus that is made of knotted colored string calendar to keep count of the live stock. When the Europeans found that the Incas had their own calendar they where amazed that they could keep control of their large city by keep records with the calender.            Also, the Pueloans where a very important find because they where the first people to settle in houses with poles to hold the building up write and mud to make the walls. The why they built their technology help us under stand the way to make a simple house. Like in the present we have house with metal poles to hold the building up right like the Pueloans and make the walls out of cement. We took their good ideas on how to build house we just made it modern. Without the Pueloans we would know how to build houses.              The Pavlopetri people built the largest city that was later sunken under water that is almost built how we have our cities today. The Pavlopetri people had a period of exploration they started to build buildings, courtyards, main streets and religious structures. This find was very important because it helped us find a way to build a city.           The Pueloans, Inca and Pavlopetri people was a very important find to help us advance in technology today. We look at their technology and made it modern.

Every past or future ruin can teach incredible amounts of information to archaeologists. In the Inc-an civilization, bodies and artifacts were skillfully preserved, providing awaiting knowledge. Another civilization, the Pueblo-ans, are from thousands and thousands of years ago. The Pavlopetri show insight on the Earth's past geological structure. Whether it be satisfying curiosity, discovering the human roots, or tracing back past landscapes, ancient civilizations contain the necessary pieces to complete history's puzzle.        The Incas were helpful to have kept their civilization in such a condition that benefited archaeologists. Much of there clothing, bodies, and architecture was buries by vast snow up in the mountains. Their clothing speaks of past weather patterns and perhaps extinct animals. Their technology used to produce such may have been more advanced than others around the world. Their ruins inform archaeologists of neighboring regions that left behind nothing. Medical advancements can only be displayed in the form of performed bodies or documents. Their success attempts and past living population helps calculate the number of people today with Inc-an roots. In general, art tells us about their lifestyle; entertainment, responsibility, agriculture, etc. The study of their preserved culture fits the Spaniard and Inc-an puzzle pieces.        As with the Incas, the Pueblo-ans and Pavlopetri were vital to tracing back human roots and evolution. As these civilization began to break tradition and begin new, nomadic lifestyles, archaeologists can further understand the technology advancements of mankind. Rocks used for weapons and other household items hint towards common rock features of the past. The number of bodies and artifacts discovered help historians study the growth of the human population. However, most importantly, is what the Pavlopetri civilization was able to teach. Never had archaeologist been able to discover underwater civilizations, but they did. This drastically changed views of the changing water level in the world. Scientists were now able to study more geographical features and access the climate of the areas. Unlike the Incas, who provided a cultural view, the Pueblo-ans and Pavlopetri informed archeologists and geologists of past climate, weather, landscape, and rocks.        The puzzle is yet to be completed. Upon more advanced technology, the puzzle will continue to grow, as will our history. What will future civilizations think about today? What artifacts of ours will be used? The Incas, Pueblo-ans, and Pavlopetri preserved their culture and way of life for geologists and archaeologist to discover thousands of years later.

Architecture, economic system, government, clothing, entertainment are some of the many things that people examine in the past. People evolve and become more efficient when studying and understanding the past. In the three following sources, Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, Mesa Verde National Park Puebloans and Their World, and Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets archeologists learn about ancient civilizations and in these sources its extremely apparent that the discoveries made by these archeologists are important to human society.           In the first source written by Beth Gruber archaeologists in Peru learn more about Inca culture which is very important. For instance, Inca's managed to produce textiles and clothing that were very sturdy. This is important because it allows humans to see how their ancestors dressed in the past as well as give modern day cloth makers techniques on how to make more durable clothing. Another example that leads people to believe the archeologists discoveries in Peru were important is that they found preserved bodies in the Andes mountains. This is important because it allowed scientists to learn how people died back then and prevent it from happening now.           In the second source that was illustrated by NPS and Roy Anderson archeologists learn many things about the Puebloans past which are very important today. For example archeologists found that the Puebloans and their descendants lived for seven hundred years building elaborate stone communities in canyon walls. This is important because it allows people to witness how people can settle virtually any environment if they try hard enough. Another instance of archeologists findings in an ancient civilization being important is when they found the kivas. Kivas were very important in Peuoblan culture and it lets people of today see how intelligent the Peubloans were because they were able to create rooms dedicated to worship.            In the third source by Helena Smith archeologists divers explore the ruins of a sunken settlement in Greece which is very important. One reason its important is that the whole settlement which was once on dry land is now underwater. This is important because it inspires more people to explore the sea and believe in myths such as Atlantis. Another reason why this settlement is important is because it lets scientists observe how water could be so dangerous and lead to destruction of entire cities. The settlement for very large so seeing that the whole thing was under water makes scientists want to know how and why.           These discoveries in Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, Mesa Verde National Park Puebloans and Their World, and Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets are very important to human society. They allow people to understand the past and make improvements for the future. Which is the reason why people look study human history and look for signs of the past.

These findings are important because it reveals the way of thinking that these people had. Everybody has a different perspective and way of thinking. By discovering these civilizations, everyone is able to explore their cultures and have a different way of looking at ideas.   These civilizations had very basic architecture. Architects have   now evolved their ways of creating complex, stable structures.Not only were their buildings basic, but their building materials were also low-tech. Building materials have converted from weak substances like adobe to more sturdier materials like metals, stone, and asphalt. Many advances in architecture have been made since the fall of these ancient civilizations.   The ancient civilizations had created a different religion based   on things they depended on to survive. By finding artifacts of the past, explorers can tell or come up with something to explain some of their religion. If Catholicsm were to end now, one could find a rosary or a cross and assume that they believed in the story of Jesus Christ. If Judeoism were to end now, people could find religious objects like jewish stars or manorahs that help determine what someone's religion was, what they celebrated, and what they believed in. Finding artifacts of these civilizations are important so that people can learn about someone else's views on things such as religion besides themselves.   Finding these artifacts have helped for people to look at things   differently and create thoughts of their own. If humanity was never able to find any of these objects, there could be a chance that everybody would have basic beliefs thoughts and ways of thinking.

Many archeologists study past civilizations like the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.  When we study these civilizations we get to learn many about our past life.      Many artifacts found at these sites can tell us a lot about ways of life back then.  They can tell us whether ancient people had a religion or certain traditions.  The Inca's had a different life style.  They had a complex language and advanced agriculture.  Since the Inca's lived in the high Andes they had a different way of farming. The Inca's had a very interesting culture and the things we learn about it gives us an idea on how things advanced.      The Puebloans also had a unique culture.  The lived in small communities with elaborate buildings.  They did many things like hunting and making necessities like tools and home goods.  They lived in huts called pit-houses, which had the floor sunken in a few feet deep.  Because of there good works with their architecture they were called Basketmakers.  Like most ancient civilizations, the Puebloans had a religion.  They practiced their rituals in temples with chambers for certain things.  Many would go in certian rooms to pray for luck, healing, rain, or a good crop.  The Puebloans with their great architecture and ideas influenced many things from buildings to life skills.      Another important civilization was the Pavloperti.  They were believed to have come from the ancient myth of the sunken city of Atlantis.  Greek mythology says that there was a city that was consumed by the ocean.  Many people today are searching for an answer to see if this legend is true.  So far they have said that they think they might of found the ''lost city of Atlantis''.  Off the coast of Neapolis oceanologists have found ruins of what might be from the sunken city.  The Pavlopeti are believed to be the citizens of the ''sunken city''.      All of these civilizations may not seem that important. But once you discover the secrets and ancient stories you learn about how life was before our time.  Many artifacts show how much we've advanced in our technology and our cultures.   Learning about previous civilizations is very important for everybody to know about where they came from.

These discoveries have been very important for many reasons.                  From source one,about the Inca civilizations, it explains how they have found many quipus which were used to record calendars and count livestock. This is an important find because it shows how even back then they would keep track of things. Clues that the Inca have left tell us of their life, religion, art, agriculture, and more. This information lets us know how they were before and what kinds of things they did, like if they did any rituals or how they built. We also find out more about the Inca from oral history that is passed on, that can tell us things we don't know and also preserves its history. Artifacts and any other objects they left behind tells us more like objects that they buried in their graves. Finding bodies from the Inca that are in good shape can be scanned and reveal how they died along with how they lived.                In source two, about Ancestral Puebloans, Mesa Verde National Park preserves this ancient culture. This helps so that we will always have that reminder since it's being preserved. They lived in pit houses, which were usually built on mesa tops or cliff recesses. This shows how they built and maybe their reasons why they built it. The Ancestral Puebloans made pottery, baskets and used the bow and arrow to hunt. This shows that they are artistic and good at making crafts. The structures show evidence of a society  that learned different ways to do things, different traditions, and that they are skillful at building. We also find out other things, like how we know that they had to deal with very cold winters because they had blackened walls because the smoke.                          Source number three tells the reader about  a lost Greek city, and archaeologists amazing discoveries. It has remains from 2800 to 1200 BC, and 'We found ceramics dating back from the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 500 years ago...........' said Henderson. The settlement was preserved because it is in a protected bay, and because of shifting sands. There have been many buildings, courtyards , religious structures, pottery, and maybe a megaron, in the sunken Greek city that have been found. This lost Greek city is thought to be Atlantis, and even if it's a myth it is what encourages underwater searches.                        The sunken city, the Inca finds, and the Ancestral Puebloans finds have all been important. They all give us more information about the past to learn about and be amazed of. They Inca discovery told us more about their life religion, and more. The Ancestral Puebloans lets us know more about where they lived and what they made. Lastly, the lost Greek city is a great discovery since it was a planned town, and it had artifacts that let us know when it was occupied.

The Inca did not have a formal alphabet or system of writing. They also made knots in colored string to record the calender. Inca comes from oral history and the stories are passed from generation to generation.The Spaniards visited, but did not speak the Inca language very well. Some materials lasted a long time and some artifacts were in buildings or buried in graves with the dead people. Clothes were usually found and some were in perfect condition but some were water.        The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde means 'green table'. Puebloans means 'Village dwellers'. The are know as basket makers. While they were traveling they would hunt instead of farm. They also learned to make pottery and bows and arrows. They also learned to make a spear. In A.D. 750 Puebloans built houses above ground. A.D. 1000 they advanced in adobes. They also advanced in pottery because when they verily started it, the designs were simple. Now they were so detailed.         The Pavlopetri also known as marine geologist have discovered the lost city of Atlantis. This is probably one of the oldest cities to be discovered. Its 30,000 square meters of ocean floor that is taken up by this city. The Pavlopetri has discovered building, courtyards, main streets, tombs, churches, and some pottery. They think an earthquake or a tsunami occurred Atlantis to fall.Atlantis is still a myth, but people are still trying to discover it.          There was a source about the Incas, about the Puebloans, and about the Pavlopetri. I learned that the Inca made some of the stuff that we now useful today. The Puebloans learned how to make houses above ground. The Pavlopetri are still trying to discover the long lost city of Atlantis.

Artifacts, written languages, and textiles have provided us with knowledge about these ancient civilizations.? Archeologists keep careful records, and get as much information out of the evidence as they can.                                           The Inca of Peru had no form of writing, thus not allowing archeologists to study. By finding out clues from artifacts and their way of life, maybe the archeologists can piece the Inca life together. The Inca artifacts left behind might be objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or sliver, and may be found in buried graves for the dead. This allowed us to research the life style of the Inca.                          The Puebloans chose Masa Verde for their home in A.D. 550. Their skill at craft gave them the name, Bastketmakers. They learned to make pottery, and a more efficient way of hunting, the bow and arrow. Around A.D. 750, they began to build their houses above ground. These homes were build out of poles and mud, often with pit houses. They soon evolved into fifty rooms of stone masonry. The architecture was not the only thing changing. The pottery developed into more intrecut, black designs on a white background. Using the landscape, Puebloans built their dwellings beneath overhanging cliffs. They lived underneath the cliffs for less than one hundred years. They then left Masa Verde and traveled south, leaving their ancient civilization behind.                         The Puebloans society may have been abandoned, but a city has been sunken underwater for a some five thousand years. The secrets hidden in this lost city have inspired the myth of Atlantis.This city was found beneath southern Greece, covering at leas thirty thousand square meters of the ocean floor. The seabed held thousands of shards of pottery and a whole settlement of buildings, courtyards, streets, tombs, and religious structures were discovered.Many of these artifacts date back to the stone age. ''Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.''-Sakellariou                         The three civilizations have played an important role in keeping our history alive. It provided us with information on life in the past, letting us know what life was like. The ancient artifacts held within are the key to new explorations and discoveries.

Like say ancient chins they created the wheel barrel and know with that creation we have wheel barrels. Many people may not be interesting to most and quit frankly I'm not so enthusiastic about this subject ether. With out any ancient civilization to create any of the ir technology we would have never been inspired to created what we have today.            Also studying ancient civilization can help us learn if they had a written language, and if they did could it have inspired other types of written language. With this study we can also learn their language to say read any markings or signs that tell of their past history.               Another reason for research on ancient civilization is so we can know if they had a money currency, or if they had a government or even perhaps a king or dictator. Many questions can be asked but we will never know until we learn, observe, and study the ancient traditions of past civilizations.

There was the Inca, Puebloans   and the Palvopetri.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              First, the Inca made knots in quipus, which was the first 'counting of livestock.' The Incas left clues behind which helped shape their religion &amp; culture. So the scientist can piece together how their life was. Most of what we know comes from oral history or stories passed down through generations.Most Spaniards that found the Inca civilization could not understand them. Inca's main artifacts were stone, pottery, gold, or silver. The Inca had lived in the high Andes which protected them from other civilization.       Next, Mesa Verde National Park preserves some of the areas where the Puebloans had once lived. The first Puebloans settled there in about 550 A.D. They were best known for their basket making and incredible craft skills. Most of them lived in pit houses. These were house that sank into the ground that were built using mud, wood, and other supplies. In 1000 A.D. they finally started building better structures. Also there were cliff dwellers which lived in the side of a cliff.       Finally, the Palvopetri lived in Southern Greece. They once lived where there is now an ocean. Scientists are still trying to find artifacts to complete there research. There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged city in history. This site of where they lived straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. They have found buildings which help them find more artifacts about this civilization.

They find notes or dairies that they have discovered.They find out what it was like back then and how it effected them and what we can do to not have history repeat it self.                To begin, in ancient Inca of Peru they discovered that they didn't have formal alphabet or a system of writing. The Inca recorded records by using knots in colored string which were called quipus. We've know some of their old stories because the Europeans wrote them down. They also revealed that the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language very well. Our best knowledge on them comes from artifacts and objects left behind like textiles, clothing, and ruins of buildings. Most Inca sites were disturbed by treasure hunters and looters who took anything that they thought was most valuable.              Then, the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde and that's Spanish for 'green table'. Their skill of craftsman ship brought theme the name Basketmakers. The people who lived there changed pole-and-adobe to stone masonry by the time of A.D 1000. The most famous were the cliff dwellings. Cliff dwellers left no records but they also were very skillful at making a living from a difficult environment they were in. Their structure, skill, and traditions were past from generation to generation.             In addition, the secrets of the lost city enhanced myths. There was shiffting sands and the settlement enclosed. This revealed buildings, courtyards,and tombs. There's also thousands of shards of pottery. This Atlantis myth is located near Neapolis in Greece. We still do not understand why this settlement sank but they are still researching it and trying to discover new things.            All and all, these different amazing sites have many different artifacts they found and still looking for. Maybe the Lost City of Atlantis isn't true but we still have yet to find out. In a matter of time we'll know more about this planet and what used to be here. 	NNP PRP VB WRB TO VB IN DT JJ .

People dedicate their whole lives to learn about them. These people look for, and find, ancient sites in the most remote places and make important discoveries.         The ancient Inca people settled in the Andes mountains, it most of their history was recorded only orally, so historians weren't sure if they were true or not. According to Beth Gruber, 'The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts.' These objects tell us how the Inca lived, what they believed, and how they survived. Without these important archeological finds, we may have only known what happened to the Inca by false tales.            Another ancient civilization, the Puebloans, strived in Mesa Verde. When scientists discovered the remains of their living arrangements and other buildings, they were amazed at their 'advanced...pole-and adobe construction [and] skillful stone masonry,' according to the National Parks Service. From these sites, archeologists were able to determine the Puebloans were skilled basket makers and potters. They dug up beautiful ceramics created by these ancient people and were amazed at their ability to make these amazing artworks. The Puebloans left no written records, but scientists were able to piece the puzzle together one step at a time, thanks to archaeological sites.              One of the most lasting of all Greek myths, the story of Atlantis has intrigued many. Therefore, archaeologists were delighted when a sparkling city was found underneath the waves of Greece. What they found amazed them. The city was much older then Plato's Atlantis myth! The city was extremely advanced for the time it was built, and made scientists reconsider the intelligence of ancient peoples. 'We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.' says Dr. Jon Henson, co-director of the underwater survey. This suggests that the people of the past were much more advanced than historians originally believed.

The discoveries at the Inca cites are important to measure the development of the Americas when they were separated from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Though the Incas didn't have a formal writing system, they were very advanced for their time period with a huge empire.         The Puebloans were also very advanced for their time period, while also being cut off from the eastern part of the world. They had complex architecture, an advanced religion, and developed weapons like the bow.         The Greek city ids probably the most advanced of all, it had courtyards and tombs and streets all long before the golden age of Greek culture.         The findings at these sites all display how advanced a culture could be, even when it wasn't expected that they would be.

Finding artifacts of these ancient civilizations is very important. We could learn about there history and coulture. For example, if we found leftovers of there food, we could see what they hunted or gathered.       When people discorverd these ancient civilizations, we could find out new things about our past, or where we came from. In other words, our ansisters. finding out our own history is can be important to someone.       We also can learn things that could help us in the future. Such as, not making the same mistake twice.

The Inca were a civilization of people that lived about a hundred years ago. Puebloans were a group of people that moved to Mesa Verde long before the Europeans explored North America. The Pavlopetri was the name for the sunken city explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archeologists and marine geologist           Discovering the Inca society helped us learn about them more and about their way of life compared to ours. We know about them by artifacts that they left behind. The Inca lived high up in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountains peaks. Inca lived high up in mountains some even lived in caves, and this helps to preserve sites because looters cant get to them because they are high up in the mountain. The Inca fell in in 1532 when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the empire.           The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as basket makers for their skill to craft. Formerly nomadic they began to settle down and started farming which then they didn't have to gather and hunt. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages sometimes built on mesa tops, but mostly on cliff recesses. The population had multiplied, and by about A.D. 750 they began making houses above ground with upright walls. By A.D. 1000 the people from Mesa Verde had advanced in their skill of construction. They began making more villages, but by A.D. 1200 the puebloans moved back into the cliffs we still don't know why but the archeologists are still looking for the answer.           The pavlopetri was a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. This settlement dates back to 5,000 years to the time of homers hero. '...this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr. Jon Henderson. The theories made by marine geologists include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.        These discoveries helped shape history and show what is still there from billions of years ago. The Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are examples of what show people the past. History has a lot in its past.

One reason it is good to know about your history is that so it does not repeat itself and we make the same mistakes. We could even get some ideas from them. They have learned to adopt just like modern day people.          Some things that we have learned about the Incas are that the clues they left behind form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life. The things you will learn will fascinate you.          Some of what we know from Inca history is from oral history. Europeans who arrived in their empire in 1532 described the Inca in their letters and diaries. The rest come from artifacts that could be made from gold, silver, or pottery even if they were buried for hundreds of years. Archaeologists who study these site keep careful records. Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.            About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verda for their home. For more than 700 years this civilization occurred and archaeologists have the artifacts to prove it. We have learned what kind of houses they had, what weapons they used, what they learned to make all from the stuff that people find.           Over the years civilizations begin to change and adopt to their surroundings. One example of this is the Puebloans who change their houses and their scenery. They made new houses that were more stable and livable. They went to the cliff dwellings and then they completely deserted it. Archaeologists are unsure as to why. We will never know the whole story, but we do know that they adopted to whats around them.           An incredible discovery that was made by archaeologists was a city that was submerged completely in water. It is off the coast of Neapolis. They have found ceramics that date back to the end of the stone age, which suggests that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought. The marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Because of the conditions around it the city is basically a frozen moment of the past.            So as you can see history is very important to the modern world. In a very long time from now people will be learning about you in the same way. Clearly, people need to kno what happened years and years ago.

Well, archaeologists can do that job for people who just like to learn about them. Archaeologists search the earth for history that could change our minds about the continent we live on, people, or perhaps the whole world. Archaeologists go from the bottom of the sea to the very top of the earth like the worlds tallest mountain or something you think that is the tallest land form you've ever seen. When you look at the earth you step on, do you ever get the urge to know what happened here 5,ooo years ago? I sure do! You can find out if you keep reading on.       I am going to talk about the Inca first. The ancient Inca came from Peru. The Inca had one of the biggest empires of the world. The Europeans were so amazed at that sight. The ancient Inca's left behind clues that archaeologists can study from and see what the Inca's form of religion was, their way of art and architecture, way of agriculture, how they managed their govenrment, how they transported, and finally, their way of life. We know some old stories because they get passed on from generation to generation.           No I'm going to talk about the Puebloans. Puebloans were from Mesa Verde. The Puebloans are 1,400 years old. They even lived before the Europeans explored North America! For about 700 years, maybe more, the descendants lived and flourished in Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde means green table in the Spanish language. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops and sometimes built on cliff recesses.       Finally, I'm going to talk about the Pavlopetri. People have secrets passed on that the Pavlopetri are from Atlantis. Atlantis is supposed to be sunken from many, many years ago. It's located in the waters of southern Greece. It is 30,000 square meters ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It was descended from 1000 BC.       Well, I hope you enjoyed my little article. I hoped I somewhat inspired you to look up these places. And I hope your interested in the whole archaeologist thing. I actually would have a lot of fun being an archaeologist when I grow up. Maybe that's what I'll be! 	NNS IN DT NNP , NNP , CC NNP NNP NNP , NNP , CC NNP DT NN NN NNS , RB , WRB VBP PRP VB RB RB IN PRP .

Today the only was Archaeologyes cane learn about the Inca is by stoies we got from the Spaniards and artifacts they find. Inca artifacts were made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver and that made it so the artifacts last long. We also find there cothes. the only reason we can still find some of there clothes is because they lived in desrts or cold mountains. Some of the artifacts have been taken by treasure hunter or looters that take stuff that might be of value. The way the Inca people die off was the Spaniards killed the last Inca king in 1532.   The Mesa Verde people were some of the first people to live in North America. The Mesa are mostly known as basketmakers because they had great crafting skilles. With that skill they didnt hunt as much they farmed and gatherd mostly everything they needed.the people population multiplied over and over agen for some reason we dont really under stand. The people lived on cliffes or mounton tops.but the Mesa Verde left to travel south to New Mexico and Arizona were they soon die off.   The greek whad made the oldest town known to man the bad part is its under water.the greeks were some great people that made many things we us today.We do not know why this great city has went under water or what mad it go under yet.   many Archaeologyes go diving to look and pull back up some of the things left behind by the greeks.

But, really, history is extremely important to our future. The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important because it shows us how ancient civilizations used to be.   From the Incas, we have learned how they kept their records, with knotted string. These knots of string were called quipus. Though, not many can read the colored string, we know that they were used to keep the calender and keep count of livestock. We have learned that many artifacts that have been found were buried with the deceased, these have provided the best idea of the life in Peru before and during the Inca rule. We have also learned how many of them died, due to preservation in the icy Andes. The bodies of the Inca were preserved in caves in cliff faces mainly, so looters could not get to them. The mountains, with their icy cold weather, can act as a freezer, leaving the bodies of the Inca in such good shape that experts may use modern medical scanning.   From the Puebloans, we have found how they lived in places called pithouses, a living room suck a few feet in the ground with four corner timbers supporting the roof. Later, around A.D. 750, the Puebloans began constructing houses above ground. The houses were built wall to wall in long, curving rows, often with a couple pithouses out front. The walls of the houses/buildings are known as the finest built in Mesa Verde because of the straight edges of the carefully shaped stones. For a time, the Puebloans were known as the Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Later on, pottery became more popular and baskets made a decline in quality. Mesa Verde had two major population shifts, one between A.D. 1100, and A.D. 1300, the other in A.D. 1200. The latter caused people to move back into cliff alcoves, though the sure reason is unknown.   The discoveries of the Pavlopetri are also significant. Evidence has been found on the 'oldest submerged town in the world,' and it's still the most well preserved. This town is expected to be the home of an elite, which raises the status of it exponentially. The submerged 'frozen moment of the past' has baffled archaeologists with how much information has been preserved. Only just recently have we been able to survey the ruins of the ancient city. Ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age suggests the settlement was occupied around 5,000 years ago. Many discoveries offer information about when the settlement was above water, and tells of possible other groups, for example, the Mycenaean Society. Not only is this underwater city an intrest because it reveals how people lived back then but it also intrigues natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow. Also fascinating, this area predates Plato's writing of the sunken continent Atlantis.   In conclusion, all of these discoveries are extrememly important by telling us of the past. By learning from the past, people can predict more about the future. All of these ancient civilizations failed in some shape or form and we could avoid these same mistakes by studying them.

It is important to learn about all of the ancient civilizations because when we learn more about the ancient civilization we can understand more about how we came to be or how they lived.                  When we find out more about about how the people of the ancient time lived we can put the pieces together so to speak and discover how our ancestors came to be and how the minds of people changed. In source one the Ancient Inca used string to record days and any kind of counting. The string was knotted to count days or to just keep track of counting for math. So in this ancient civilization math grew and prospered.                   In source number two archaeologists discovered buildings called Pithouses. Pithouses featured a living room, some might have contained storage bins or pits. The sipapu was a hole for a way to the underworld, from which people had once come from. Later on a Kivas was built, the Kivas was a ceremonial room which was built as underground chambers that later where churches.Ancient Puebloans might have practiced healing rights or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or for a good crop. The religion and buildings where what prospered.                   In source three the thing that prospered was findings that helped rebuild a city. The ancient Greek city that had submerged beneath the Atlantic Ocean. The city is said to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. The city was well kept by shifting sands, and the protected bay help archaeologists find buildings and roads and all kinds of structure along with many shards of pottery. The site had 'potential insights into the working of the Mycenaean society.' 'It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied.' So the city was never reoccupied was sea life or any life at all. Marine geologists still do not know how the city sank. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.'                     In this passage I have explained what prospered in different ancient times and how each of the civilizations prospered. But also how the civilizations affected us or our time.Each time before our own has a story and that story can be lost but could also be found. History affects us even today, what ever happened long ago still has effect today. 	NNP NNP NNP VBZ PRP RB JJ TO VB IN DT NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP .

If it wouldn't be for the artifacts found from people many years ago, we probaby wouldn't know as much as we know now. Artifacts from the past life, tell us how people lived. Scientists studied artifacts found, for a very long time to learn as much as they could about it. We've learned about how people hunted, and lived just from buildings, clothes, bowls, and even journals found. Journals have told us stories about peoples lives and stuff they made, but sometimes it was in a language that nobody could understand. We have learned a lot more about the alphabet and who has started many things like pottery, bows, and arrows. If it wasn't for the people before, leaving their stuff beind, we wouldn't know anything about history and there would most likely be a lot more world problems. There were artifacts from farming left behind, that probably taught more and more people how to farm. Legends were passed on, which makes you wonder what is true, ad what is added on everytime someone tells the legend. People from the past have taught scientists many things and caused many mysteries that may never be figured out, but they're all very important. I believe that just knowing about history and civiliazations is just a good thing to know about.

Why do I say this? well without the discovery of these civilizations there would be a huge gap in history. The discoveries may have filled in those gaps of time. These civilizations helped us understand more about them. They could also possibaly help us learn more for future discoveries.        The Inca lived High in the mountains and prosbered. They lived so high in the Andes that the bodies could be preserved by the cold conditions, and looters could not reach the bodies so the bodies were undisturbed. Most of the Inca civilization was left undisterebed and that means that todays archaeologists could observe how the people lived. This means that they can learn about past history and things created to help every day live.   The Puebloans also showed us how they lived. The information and objects they left behind showed us a lot about them. By the information given from the article 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World' we know that the were nomadic people. The were nomadic for a little bit, but then they were trying a more settled way of life. They built Pithouses to support them selfs in their enviroment, these Pithouses later became Kivas. So without the Puebloans Kivas would never have been made. They learned how to make pottery and soon made weapons that we all know today such as bows and arrows.        These are reasons why the discovery of these civilizations were important. These civilizations helped with todays tools and weapons. They also help identify different ways to look at how people prosbered and lived. 	PRP VBP IN DT NNS VBD NNP NNP VBP PRP VB DT .

The Inca's left many ancient artifacts such as stone, pottery, gold, or silver that last a long time even if they been buried. Archeologist have found bodies in the icy Andes that are in good state that they can learn how the people lived, and how they died. Incas left many interesting items for archeologist like art, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way they lived this tells you on what they had, and how there culture may of been. The Incas made a quip's that records a calendar to keep count of there livestock no one really uses one today since no one may know what the knots mean.Though it seems like it could be a regular calendar only without the livestock and colorful strings.   The discoveries that the Puebloans made were on how they made things or buit them. Puebloans built houses out of mud and poles that were up against each other. Later on by A.D. one thousand people started to advance on how they built there houses. They used stone masonry, and wall that were thick, double coursed stone that were often up to two or three stories high. Though something changed in A.D. twelve hundred people started to move back into the cliffs that sheltered their ancestors before. We don't know why they moved for any reason but it did make the Mesa Verde most famous.

In this article will be information on three very important human civilizations; the Inca, the Puebloans, and what many think could have been what inspired Homer to create his lost city of Atlantis.          One of the three ancient civilizations is the Inca. The Inca were important because they were a giant civilization that according to the article 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past' by Beth Gruber on paragraph 2 'For nearly a hundred years (1438-1532) Ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome'. The end of the Inca empire is easy to date because the Spaniards killed the last Inca king but the beginnings are harder to date. In that time period the Inca lived high in the Andes so many of the artifacts are well preserved and we can learn many things from them.          Another ancient civilization were the Ancestral Puebloans who left great reminders of their civilization in Mesa Verde. The Puebloans started out in little cliff alcoves but little by little they started developing pithouses that changed to kivas eventually. The Ancestral Puebloans were skilled basket makers and created great houses on the Mesa Verde. At about A.D. 1200, for reasons unknown, the people moved to the cliff alcoves that had sheltered their ancestors before.          The lost city of Atlantis may be fake but one thing we know for sure is that it could be based off of a real city that sunk. The city Pavlopetri has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 B.C. and is off of the coast of southern Peloponnese. The city is believed to have sunken at about 1000 B.C. and was never reoccupied so the houses and everything else is frozen at that time.          All of these societies are important because they all have something that they can contribute to our world history. these cities can show us what life was like back then and can help us understand the world around us.

I think that because we don't know much about their civilizations. The artifacts help us know: how they lived, what they hunted/ate,and maybe how they died.       By finding the Inca and Mesa Verde civilizations we can learn where they lived,and how their houses were built. The artifacts found help us greatly to learn about the people of Mesa Verde, or the life of the Inca. That is why the artifacts found in the ancient ruins of the Inca and Mesa Verde are important.       Some of the major artifacts we have found about the Inca are: Textiles and clothing, and knots in string for counting livestock or used as calenders.       Some stuff we found in the Mesa Verde places are: The baskets that made them known as 'basket weavers', pottery, bow and arrow, and the atlatl (spear thrower).       Another ancient civilization is the Ancestral Puebloans or 'Cliff Dwellers'. They left no written records and much that was important to their lives has perished. We have however found their structures that have helped us learn about their lives.       Kivas were the ancient Puebloans ceremonial rooms or churches, they used them to:   pray for rain, used them for healings, Prayed for luck in hunting, or a good crop. These structures help us know a little about their daily life.       The artifacts we find are very important in learning about the Inca, Mesa Verde, and Puebloans are the only things we can use to learn about them. These people left no written records, so how else are we to learn about them? The artifacts they left behind are all we have in learning about them.

They created our language and created our religion. Without ancient civilizations we might be the ones to have to create everything. I don't even know if we'd be living had it not been for ancient civilizations. In this article I'm going to be talking about 3 important ancient civilizations: the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.        Would you ever like to live on a mountain with a very cold climate? I didn't think so, but the Inca thought differently. The Inca lived in the mountains of the Andes, and that's how we know so much about them. The freezing weather has preserved artifacts and even bodies really well- so well that we can use modern medical scanners to learn how the people died or even how they lived. Some of what we know, though, has come from stories passed from generation to generation. Since they didn't have any archives or even an alphabet for that matter, historians don't really know much about their civilization except for what's in stories and what the artifacts show.        The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. But, now, nobody knows the Inca language so nobody knows what the knot means and nobody can read the stories tied into the colorful strings. Ince artifacts might be objects made from stone, gold, or silver. Some archaeologists have found artifacts in the ruins of buildings but, others were found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. That is important because it gives historians an insight on their religion, and what kind of lives the Inca might have lived to be able to make things out of gold and silver.        The Puebloans of Mesa Verde, were very good at basketmaking. They also replaced hunting and gathering with farming. This is very important because it tells us a little bit about how they lived, or what their lives were like. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops. Puebloans also learned to make pottery and they acquired the bow and arrow, which was a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. That is important because it shows that they don't spread out, and they were all just one big heard of people- they were nomadic afterall. Some historians might also find their pithouses important, because their was a hole for passage to the underworld called that 'sipapu.' That gives insight on their religion and on, once again, how they lived.        The findings of the Pavlopetri are very important. Geologists have found a megaron, which is a monumental strucure with a large rectangular hall, which means that the town might have been used by an elite. That tells us that the people who lived their were probably high status or were rich in some way. Geologists have found ceramics which dated back to the end of the stone age, and from that we can learn in what era these people lived.  That gives us an idea of how their life was like or how they lived.

The ancient civilization helped improve on how we live, starting with where is the right place to build your house. You couldn't just make a house where ever you want. You have to have the right level and far enough from water. if your hows was too close to the water your house would be flooded every time it rain. Us today didn't discover that. People in the ancient civilization discovered that. The Inca lived high in the Andes and worshiped some mountain peaks. Most of their sites are in remote high places. The Inca lived in high places because it was harder for enemies to get to their houses and attack their families.   On the other hand, the Pueblians were an amazing discovery. The Puebloans learned to make pottery and the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than a spear. The Puebloans made a house called the pithouses. The pithouses, people lived in pithouses from A.D. 550 to A.D 750. The living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbers supported the roof. There was a fire pit had an air deflector. The people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and -adobe construction to skillful stone. The walls were thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stores high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, the population may have reached several thousands. ABout A.D. 1200, another major population came, and people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Archarologists still don't know why they moved, they thing it could of been for defense; or it was for religious or pshychological reasons; perhaps alcoves offered better protection from the elements.

Through reading these excerpts, I havae come to the conclusion that the discoveries are not only fascinating, but also very important to learn more about the history of ancient civilizations and how their ways of doing things can benefit us.                Back in the times of the Incans, history was often communicated through stories pasted down generation after generation. Source #1 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past', goes on to say that, ' Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history.' I still think that it is important to tell stories because, like what happen to the Inca's, your language could eventually be lost and all you have to go off of is the stories that have been past down ' from generation to generation'.                From Source #2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World',  I found that ancient Puebloans lived in pithouses. Without archaeologists finding  evidence that led them to the conclusion that Puebloans lived in pithouses, perhaps many of the modern day architecture could not have been built. A lot of people would like to find out who their ancesctors are, without the discoveries found about the Pueabloans, many of today's Puebloans wouldn't know why they live where they do, how their ancesctors lived, or how to preserve many of the things they did, such as being able to construct ' skillful stone masonry', and their pithouses.

Learning about these discoveries will tell us how and who lived before us. These will help us in the future and past.       Learning thing like ancient Inca didn't have a formal alphabet or that they didn't have a system of writing is important because we know now that our alphabet didn't come from them. It shows how things became how it is now, and that is why history is so important.       Finding out how they lived in there houses and why they had there houses like that, shows us why we do or dont have our houses like that. Every thing they did helped shape us and our future and wee willl do te same with our future.        Learning about how they found the lost city and how they discovered it and how long it took them to discover it will help us discoverthing in the future.

For one the Inca has no system of writing unlike us today. Let me explain the ancients to you in my multi-paragraph article which i did NOT volunteer for.                 The Inca was a very interesting civilization which suprisingly survived for a time without a written language. The inca did not have an alphabet or written languague which is crucial in life for us today. I could just imaginge how hard it must have been for the civilization to communicate with each other if they weren't in the same area (such as letter or any other kind of distant communication). We know alot from the civilizations by artifacts or other thing left behind. It tells us what kind of people they were and from other documented journals from europeans that invaded them we can tell there history. The Inca is a great civilization but what else can we tell from them besides language.                Archaeologists can learn and compare from artifacts and sites with the spaniards accounts of the Inca. Such artifacts can help determine the origins of the Inca and the area where they are from. The landscapes and stuff left behind can tell us what kind fo farming technique they used and if they were farmers or hunters and gathers. The Inca were high up on the mountains in the andes so archaeologists must climb high mountains with all there stuff.                   Archaelogists must be both fit and smart to do there work.   Above all they must be very carefull with there artifacts and fossils because they could break. I think archaeologists have to do work that are harder for modern people to handle. That is my multi paragraph essay explaining the article hope u liked it hugs and kisses H4 &lt;3.

They continue to dicscover new things every day. Their discoveries lead them into the lives of the people that lived tousands of years ago. Each discovery opening a passage to a different time.       Each discovery had an importance of their own. For example, the discovery of of the ancient quipus helped archaeologists know the way the Incas keept records and count of things.Inca sites have been distributed by hunters and looters taking any thing that might be of value. Looted sites often do not tell much to archaeologist.. Another example is the Mesa Verde National Park, which is a spetacular reminder of the ancient culture of the Puebloans. The Puebloans left no written records and most of their life has perished. There is also the discovery of the underwater city of atlantas that has brought some light on the ways of  the people that lived there, how they lived and what they lived in. In the city of atlantas they have found ceramics dating back to the end of the stoneage, which suggests that the settlement was occuppied some 5,000 years ago. There are many reasons why the discoveries of archaeologists are so important.       There are many reasons why the discoveries are so important to the history of the world.Each discover opens a passage into a different time. It leads archaeologists to find more out about our ansestors.those are the reasons why those discoveries are important to society.

It also helps us understand the culture and some of the culture they used we may have used today. These tribes were all important for a lot of reasons like showing stories of ancient battles or of a harvest that blossumed. We will never stop learning about them archeologists keep studying and keep finding something new about the civilizations as long.

A quipus  is a long rope with knots in it that is used as a calender. they left behind many things for us to discover such as their art and architecture. it is important to us today because we can learn from them and use their techniques that we have found from these ancient ruins in our lives today.       the things that we have discovered from the puebloans were their homes. there were the pithouses which were houses that were living rooms that were underground and it only had four corners. it also had air deflectors. it had a sipapu which was a hole for passage to the underworld. it is important to us because we can take these techniques and built our houses underground too.       the Pavlopetri is the one with the city underground. it was an amazing discovery because our archaeologists have found many interesting things such as courtyards and streets. it is important because we have taken these ideas and now we have streets and courtyards too.

Things that we as a civilization may have never thought of until years from now. These findings gathered by scientists are very significant to the human race.           Some the findings are the way thery lived. Some of the civilizations lived high on plateaus and some in villages. Anothr is what they bulit. Like pyramids. That stunds you how they built them especially with not much technology. Their stories passed on genertation to genertatiom. Now we know some stories and have made movies out of them. Finally the way they all fell. We can learn from that so that that will not happen to us. We can do it by more protection.           We learn alot from back then and learn from it. If their was no history, then we would not have the technology or the things we have today. The reason we do is becuase of history, The first peoples that were here very much helped us. Now we know when a bad weather will come. Obviously if the greeks had known they probaly would have been prepared. But becuase of advances and history we are very thankful of that.

Archeologists wanted to know more about them and find how they died, how they lived, and even how their system worked. They searched in various places and by different ways. They mainly looked for things from the Ancient Incas, Ancestral Puebloans, and the Lost Greece City.        The Ancient Incas were the a bit different then the other civilizations. For example, they didn't have a written language , they lived high in the mountains , and used colorful knots to keep track of dates. Bodies of the Incas were also found in large ice caps because of the weather. Archeologists used modern scanning equipment to learn how they died. In addition , bodies were not the only things found, they have gathered some of Incas textiles and clothing that have survived extremely well.        On the other hand Ancesternal Publoans were from Mesa Verde 'green table' and lived in a deserted area. Also , they found that they have had traditions and had been accumalating many different skills. They also lived about 1,400 years ago. Their homes were pithouses and they usually began to do agriculture.         Lastly, the Greeks, gathering things to know about the greeks is different. The reaserchers have to go under the sea to look for different things. They have found ceramics that date back to the stone ages. Also, without a doubt it is the oldest submerged town in the world. Sadly, we now know that their is no such thing as Atlantis but the great myth still holds. In conclution, The three civilizations greately differ but archeologists and many people have managed to find different ways to look back into the past and see how they lived.

The Inca did not have an actual way of writing, they would make knots in colored strings called quipus to keep count of the livestock. Archeologist are able to know what years the Inca ruled because they were able to find information such as religion, art, transportationa, and other things too. Understanding the language of the Inca was difficult becasue the Spaniards didn't understand the language very well, which made it hard for the archeologist to know what it ment. Materials such as clothing and textiles helped archeologist know what type of clothes they would wear. The weather helped to preserve many of these objects. In mountains, bodies were found in well shape because caves worked like freezers that kept everything as it is. Any object that archeologists would find helped to find out any information about the Incas.                 For instance, Puebloans were the first to settle in Mesa Verde. The discoveries that archeologist found in Mesa Verde are important because it shows how things used to work out back in time. Pithouses were the places were the people lived. Pithouses consisted of  a living room sunk a few feet  in the ground, four corner timbers to support a roof, a firepit, and a sipapu that was a passage to the underworld. Kivas were Hopi word for ceremonial room. Kivas were gathering places and sometimes also places to weave. Fires were built in the summer were mainly for cooking. Cliff dwellers left no written records so it was a little difficult to find a lot of things.                 Pavlopetri was explored by  an Anglo-Greek team of archeologist. It is 30,000 square meters and it was consumed around 1000 BC. Archeologists were able to find buildings which was a way of knowing how and what way they lived. The bulidings helped to find out the stucture of how they would build their buildings. Marine geologist are still tring to figure out wht the town sank. Some reasons archeologist thought that the town sanl was because of the cange in sea level, earthquakes, and tsunamies. Under thet sea there are many things that are yet to be found,but archeologists are tring there best t try and figure out why the towns, cities fell.

Also, I think might helps us understand their way of living. This is important because we can learn more about them and  understand them and their traditions. This can help us not judge them because maybe this was there way of living in peace with themselves and their ancestors. Therefore, this discoveries are important to everyone.                 From Source #3 we learned about the way of living of the ancient civilizations. For example, we learned how they build their structures and their cities. this helped us by knowing their advancements in technology. This was a great accomplishment towards our society too.Also, some believe this inspired the legend of the lost city, Atlantis. Maybe this was the lost city Atlantis or another of the many underwater cities.                 And last but not least we also learned many useful information from Source #1. For instance, the ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet and no way of writing. This is why they didn't leave any written records about their lives or calendars. Even though they made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar. As this may be weird to you our system of keeping track of the days may be weird to them. Most of what we know is because of the Europeans who wrote down letters and diaries.

Their was clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion. Some what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an importantt way to preserve a community's history. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found.

As such, several civilizations have existed that now are gone.  These civilizations had existed mostly without contact from other groups of people.  The rediscovery of these unfamiliar tribes had shaken the way that scientists think about the past.  The discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have shown us the past itself.   From studying the Inca, archeologists have learned that they lived in different climates, from the desert to the jungle or mountains.  Scientists have found out that Incan tribes kept records with string, as they had no alphabet.  The archeologists who have studied the Inca have found out the Spanish conquerors killed the last king of the Inca's, leading to the destruction of the empire.  To the north of the Inca, the Puebloans had lived for nearly as long, and for hundreds of years before North America was colonized by Europe.   The discovery that the Puebloans had been living in the side of a cliff had shown scientists how people without the 'modern' knowledge had lived.  Based on what was left in the cliff dwellings, archeologists have made several discoveries.  One is that they both hunted farmed for their food.  The pottery depicted the everyday life ofthe Puebloan.  One last discovery was that the Puebloans moved several times in their history.  One century, they lived in undergound house, the next was above ground, a few centuries later they lived in a cliff.  The next civiliation has had a major relocation, more so then the Puebloans.   The discovery was a huge discovery for underwater explorers.  This sunken Greek town has given light to how the culture lived before there was knowledge of the Greece known today.  Pieces of pottery, tons of building and more have caught the eye of many explorers.  Scientists believe that a large earthquake or tsunami sunk and/or flooded the city.  The discovery of this city has gotten scientists thinking of cenarios of what happened.  Hopefully scientists will continue to explore and discover the past.

Three prominent civilizations that archaeologist have been collecting information about, are the Incas, the Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.  These discoveries made about the civilizatons, are important because they help archaeologist learn more about the past world.            Incan artifacts perserve really well, thanks to the freezing temperatures in which they were buried in. 'Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well.' (Source 1) Through these clothes we can see what the climates of the past were. We can also see when certain kinds of materials were discovered. ' As such it represents a frozen moment of the past.' ( Source 3). All of these artifacts help them. Since thee Incans lived up high in the Andes, some bodies have been perserved. these bodies can help them know how they lived. (Source1 ) ' ...are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation' ( Source 2) When archaeologist found puebloans houses, they compared them and found that the houses were increasing in stability. through this we can see how skills were passed on.            As  you can see, these ancient artifacts have taught us alot about the people who handled them and the they lived in.  We can learn about how they lived, the climate, and much more.

The Inca, the puebloans, and the pavlopetri. I believe that the ancient civilizations were important because it helped explain to humanity how life and the culture was back the in the past.         The Inca were a proud civilization and lived in harsh climates in the mountains. Many of its artifacts have been found high in the andeas mountains where the incas used to live. Matierials such as gold and silver were looted by grave theifs. the last inca king was killed and the inca civilization was extinct.         The Puebloans were called Anasazi. They were modern descendents now call ancestral. They were known for basket making and very skilled. They lived in small villages and small clusters of people. Puebloans were hunter gatherer societies and their advancements in life taught them how to make bows and arrows and pottery.          The Pavlopetri were Greeks who lived in this great city that was believed to sink to the bottom of the coast of was is southern greece. The city was near Neapolis and was very wealthy. The seabed of the ocean was scatterd with pottery and graves.           In conclusion the Ancient civilizations helped us make our techonological advancements.

About 1,400 years ago long before europeans explored north america,a group of people living in the four corners region chose mesa verde for their home.For more then 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in theltered alcoves of the canyon walls. then, in the late A.D 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left thir homes and moved away.      the pavlopia is a sunkin settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented,experts say.   there is now doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr jon Henderson, associate professor of under water archaelogy at the university of nottingham. 'It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical greece.

The archeaologists unlocks the secret of the Incas past by obseving and examining the buried body.   The First ancestral puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550.

One of the main reasons is to learn what our ancestor did and use it in our daily lives. Some ancient civilizations that has made an impact in our lives are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. We learn what they have done and try to fix their way of living into our lives. During the time we try to discover these civilizations, we also need to edit what we do to handle the situation. Discoveries like these can help us determine our understanding and thinking of our ancestors.       Our ancestors have always had an reason in order to do something. For example, the Inca never really had a formal alphabet or system of writing, but instead they used knots to keep track of stuff. And still, they could run a big empire. But why knots? They could have used anything else but they chose knots as their communication. Also, how did they ever become a big empire without the use of words. If archaeologist had known the reason why our ancestors did this, we can use it to also have a big strong community or country. Another example are the Puebolans in Mesa Verde. They left for a strange reason in 1300 A.D. There are many theories why they left, like a drought and crop failures; but they have already survived many droughts. Maybe the soil depleted and they had to leave. Whatever the reason we can still learn from their mistake. If the soil had depleted, we can tell scientists to find ways for the soil we have now not to deplete too. We can prepare for a drought and crop failures. There is so many things to learn about our ancestors, but we can never learn it completely. Like for the discovery of the Pavlopetri. Though they made huge discoveries, archaeologists still haven't discovered even 1% of the ocean floor. Because of this, people are more eager to discover more about our world. To do that they need the technology. We now have scuba divers and submarine to explore the vast ocean. So as the demand for new discoveries increase, our technology will also dramatically increase. So curiosity has driven our world forward.       For now, we literally don't know anything about our ancestors. We can only guess what they did.  So, we need the technology so we can be most accurate as we can be in our theories. The discoveries we make can ultimately determines what our society will be like. If we had not even bothered in finding out about our ancestors, we wouldn't know a lot of our basic methods until we have to find the solution ourselves. So why are our discoveries of ancient civilization so important? It is because we can learn from them and use them in our daily life. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB PRP VBP NN IN PRP$ NN .

Almost every history section you learn about you can make connections with your own life. That's what makes history so exiting!       The Inca is a well known ancient civilization. They are known for living in the harsh climate of the Andes. But unfotaintly we don't know much about this tribe. Mostly because when white settlers came there the killed their whole tribe. Most things we know about them is though the word of mouth. Which is always bended and stretched. But recently we discovered many things about the Inca. The Inca ran a whole tribe ran by knots in colorful stings. That is how they counted and kept track of everything. They also praised and looked to the mountain peaks as a religious symbol. For important rulers they made graves and buried them high in the mountains. This makes it hard for grave robbers to reach and destroy.       The Peubloans lived in the Mesa Verde and made their lives there. They were known as Basket makers, because of their skill at the craft. They lived in Pithouses in crowed villages on the top of mesas. The bow and arrow was their main weapon and hunted skillfully with. The Peubloans were a very strong tribe that their story will live on.       Finlay the Pavlopetri. The lost city of Atlantis is a myth that many people know about. But its just a myth, right? Well maybe not. Recently explorers found a underwater city off the coast of Greece. With stone walk ways, churches, pots, and more maybe they really did find a lost city. They say that a high tide or a tinimi submerged the city under. This is a big find and  I'm sure this isn't it.       All this history and we are just scratching the surface. In the future we will lear more and more about the Earth's history. It's very extincting learning about all this.

Archaeologists know about the Inca from oral history and stories that have been passed down through the generations.        The Spaniards did not speak the Inca languagethat well.

The Incans rivaled the expantion of Rome, one of the largest anchient empires ever. Publoeans first, not the indians. Lost Greek city swallowed by the sea. What happened to these lost civilizations?               The Incans had a giant empire and how conquistadors took them out so easily? Noboy really knows because they never had a real form of writing they just used colorful strings. This amazes archieologists, because they think it would be virtully imposible to do this. Archieologists still discovered  many things about the Incans way of life because all of their things were so well preserved. Everyday textiles, clothes and potery.                The Anchient Puebloans at Mesa Verde why did they leave. Possibly it was because the resources were depleted, or religous resons no one knows for sure. But in the hieght of the civilization is crazy. As they evolved as people the weapons got stronger and there were more people to fed so maybe all the animals had gone away to repopulate. There are millons of possibilities.                The sunken city that sparked the myth of Atlantis, the actual name is Pavlopetri and it really did sink in the ocean. It could have sunk because of a tsunami or a sinkhole. Only the people that were there knew what happened and they aren't around to tell us. But it is facinating how a hole city just sunk into the ocean out of no where. There have been other towns like this but none are as old or as big as this one.                  Great things always come to an end and unfortunatly that happened with these civilizations. The fall of the Incans was significent for Spain because it marked a great victory over  a huge empire. Mesa Verde still stands as a landmark almost a thousand years afterwards. The sunken city uncovered, no more searching for Atlantis. Who knows though less than one percent of the ocean floor has been searched, it may be real and still out there.

Archeologists have had to find many clues and peices of materials to determine how they lived. The Incas lived in pithouses and kivas, that were found in peices by archeologists who determined what they looked like. The Puebloans lived in the cliffs and later evidence was found that they lived in villages before. Paveloptri civilizations were sunken underwater and rubble and fragments of buildings were found but archeologists do not yet know why it was sunken. All of this information was given by materials found by archeologists and studied to determine how theese civilizations lived.       The Incas were a very sophisticated civilization. The used colored rope to tell time, as calacalanders, and as a language of history.  Other Europeans wrote about theese peoples stories and some ways of living in diaries. Most of our knowledge of the Incas is from artifacts. The artifact that are most common are stone, pottery, gold, and silver, sometimes found in graves buries whith the dead for afterlife.  Some clothing has survived dampness in the dry desserts of Peru. Also, archeologists have uncovered frozen, well preserved bodies in the Andes mountains and can use medical equiptment to learn how they died.       Puebloans are a little different. They built homes in pits called pithouses, that later became kivas. Their ways of living were not entirely based on hunting at first, but later they used bows and arrows. They also used a spear called a atlatl. Most of their land was cleared for crops. Later, theese people built buildings made of stone with up to fifty rooms. MOst archeologist cannot figure out why but later theese people moved to the cliffs and later left there to new homes elsewhere,       Pavelopetri civilization was sunken in water. Archeologists do not know why. But with new technology they can explore this civilization. Rubble Shows where buildings were built and there is a monumental structure. Ceramics were found from the stone age and up to 5,000 years back. This civilization is a start of underwater discoveries of lost cities.

The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about that time. Their main craft was as basket makers. They started of nomadic, but as they grew and their culture matured they begin to lead a more settled life. A lot of  other things changed also including their means to get food. Farming replaced hunting and gathers their main source. They learned to make pottery and the bow an arrow replaced their signature tool of a spear thrower to hunt the atlatl. Most of their houses and living areas were found in cliff recesses, but sometimees mesa tops clustered with small pint house villages.       In times like these they lived a fairly prosperous and decent life as basket makers. Their population multiplied and their living resources expanded. They began building houses above ground with supported upright walls made out of poles and mud. the houses were built right next to each other. From here on these people are known as puebloans, a Spanish word meaning'village dwellers.'       As with and group or walk of like the only thing left to do was to succeed in more growth. Between A.D. 1100 and 1300 which was known as ' The Classic Period' the population increases to the thousands, and a more advanced home was created. It consisted of compact villages of many room, with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls instead of out in the open. The stone walls of the large pueblos are  regarded as some of the finest.       since the beginning of times we as a people have known what to do in order  to survive , what to in order for our world to become the great one that it is today. We have done nothing more than what we set out to do in ways that is good and others that are not. All we must do, out common goal as a people is to grow and prosper in life.

They have made dicoveries such as a system using rope to tell of history and dates, housing used by ancient civilizations, and even a lost city. These discoveries have been made by archaeologists traveling the world to find the artifacts needed.   While exploring the area where the ancient Inca lived, archaeologists discovered some amazing things. They discovered that since the Inca did not have a language or writing system, they made knots in colored strings to keep a count on livestock. The Inca also left behind clues as to how they lived. Textiles and clothing survived by being perserved in dry deserts and the cold mountains of the Andes. Even though some artifacts have been stolen by treasure hunters or looters, archaeologists still managed to find these clues to the ancient Inca.   The ancient Puebloans lived 1,400 years ago. They were mainly basketmakers. They lived in structures called pithouses. These structures had four corner timbers that supported the roof. They eventually advanced to skillful stone masonry instead of pole-and-adobe construction.   There have always been many cities n Greece, but when archaeologists dove under the surface of the water, they found something that no one had ever seen before. They discovered a lost city! This lost city was probably the exact city that inspired the Atlantis stories that people tell over and over again. The site of the city is about 30,000 square meters. It is located off the southern Peloponnese. Archaeologists believe it was consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Marine archaeologists had to find help in technology to survey the city. This may be a huge discovery, but there is still about 99% of the ocean floor to explore.   Archaeologists traveling the world have found so many discoveries. They travel from the tips of the Andes to the bottom of the ocean floor. The clues that these civilizations left behind are going to be giving us glimpses into the past for years to come.

There writing was inportant and many other thing .           One thing the Incas are inportant for is the way they wrote. They worte a very different way than we do now. Some people who have studied it think they may have known what it ment. Alot of things they did to keep up with stuff is very different that have it where sometimes no one knows what they tried doing.             The Incas made knots in different colored strings called quipus to record there calendar to keep count of there live stock. They had a big group well empire and they were amazed at home they could make knots in different color strings and keep up the records of everyone. Still today no one knows what the knots in the string ment but they know understanding the Incas is alot like solving a mystery because of how they did things.               We know that about how they the civilization ruled for hundard years beacause of the ethings they left behind. Clues the Incas left behind that we know how long they were there was art, architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportation all for there religon. Many studied these things for awhile and they all put it together and found out the life of the Incas. The Europeans then came to the empire in 1532. They put the Incas in letters and diaries. They dont know if that they said about the Incas is right because they did not speak there language but they thought they understood them.                  These are some of the reasons that they are so important to us now. And we still dont know everything about them because to this day we still dont know what they did everyday and what they wrote.

There were many civilizations that were formed thousands of years ago. The main three ones were studied by archaeologists.These places have so much history that you would wanna know more about the discoveries about them. So I am gonna tell you how important they are and how they survived.          The first reason why Inca's are so important because they have a lot of legends left behind.The Inca's were very working people; they would built stuff, make stuff and were very good at some stuff and not a lot of other people could do. The Inca lives high in the Andes and they might of owned one of the mountain peaks.Europeans were the first people to discover them. The Europeans arrived in the empire in 1532. They described the Inca's in letters and diaries.          The second reason why Puebloans are important because they had an interesting life.   Archeologists called these people Anasazi, it means the 'ancient enemies'. But we all call them Ancestral Puebloans because of their modern descendants. They first settled in Mesa Verde; and they are known as basket makers because of their skills at the craft. Farming was replaced for hunting and gathering as their main live hood. They lived in small villages, usually would built stuff. Puebloans use to built their houses under ground and from there on theses people were known as Puebloans, which means 'village dwellers'.         The last reason why Pavlopetri are important is because there were a lot of secrets left and you would wanna know how those secrets inspired many people. Secrets under water were found; dates back from 5,000 years ago. Archaeologists found many stuff from the past. Marine geologists have been working out there to know why the settlement sank. This was the first time a city has sunken and has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical story of the sunken continent of Atlantis.         Now you know why the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important. As you can tell they had a ruff life and it wasn't easy. All of these places are still important specially to the people that had family members or have lived there before.

The Inca lived high in the andes and many worshiped some mountain peaks. many of their sites are in remote high places. Some of them had to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they could start work. The origins of the Inca are more difficult to trace.

For example the ancient Inca helped by creating a different type of culture than anywhere else. Also they have helped archaeologists understand the ways of the people who first made the land livable. Also the ancient city found near greece is helping scintists to see how long we were actually here and where the first people lived.   These ancient civilizations are often looked over by the most famous ones. they may not be as appealing than the ancint maya,but they are just as important. The inca's ruins are treacherous to climb but without a sense of adventure an expidition would'nt be half as fun. Also since the inca didn't have a written language, archaeologists need anything they can find about the ancient inca so they can understand what they were like.   The site discovered in greece is helping marine geoligists figure out how the world may have been all those years ago and how the earth we are living on may have changed from its original posistion.

But on this article I've learned about things they encounter before they get what they want. I also learned about the past.        On the article, 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secret of the Past' that ancient Inca of peru had no formanl alphabet or systemk of writing. They did not leave us archives for historians to study. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts of Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Archaeologists who study sites keep careful records. They write down and photgraph any artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. they need to learn as much information as they can from every single piece of evidence.        On the second article, 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' the discover that about 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde abput A.D. 550. However, by A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole and adobe construction to skilful stone masonry.        The last artuicle was 'Lost Greek City that may have Inspired Atlantis Myth Gives Up Secrets,' the secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths is the fable of Atlantis. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.        These articles have been proof that a lot of archaeologist have encounter a lot of problems but they didn't stop to find all they want. They must have been suffer but they put their heads up and continue to finish what they started.

The Inca, Puebloans, and the Palvopetri discoveries were no exception. They were also important discoveries.           Discovering the Incas was a very important discovery. The Incas lived in Peru. They had a very big empire. This was an important discovery because it tells us about how life in Peru used to be. It also gives us ideas about why some of the traditions in Peru are like that. The other reason that it was an important discovery is that it tells us that sometimes the simplest things can be used to tell are story. We see this because the Incas kept all of there records by tying knots.           The discovery of the Puebloans was very important. They lived in Mesa Verde. They were good at making baskets. They really started the idea of settling. They had better weapons like spears. They started to grow there own food. They built pithoses and Kivas. They built there towns on the sides of cliffs. These were new ideas to most people.           The most important discovery was the Palvoperti discovery. Polvoperti was a town that was sunken in Greece. This discovery was very important. It sparked the myth of Atlantis, the sunken city. It was sunken due to change in the sand. Everything was well preserved. Looking at the items found we could tell what Greece was like.

Here they examine artifacts and/or ruins to find out how ancient civilizations lived.       The Inca was a Native American tribe that resided in the Andes mountains in South America. Archeologists have asked people with Inca blood to tell stories about their traditions. By doing this, they have learned a lot about the Inca's ways. Second, archeologists have examined ancient artifacts and belongings. This suggests that they can learn about what the Indians used as tools. Finally, archeologists use satellite imaging to look at ancient ruins. Like the Inca, the puebloans have some archeologists of their own.       The Puebloans lived in the Southwest in places called cliff dwellings. Cowboys first stumbled upon these ruins  in the late 19th century. The puebloans had ladders to reach their homes, which held a couple thousand residents. Pottery was also beautiful, with lots of drawings and decorative designs. The homes also had chimneys and air vents, which were very advanced at the time. In the next paragraph, archeologists may be on the brink of uncovering Atlantis.       Atlantis is a lost Greek city buried beneath the water. Taken by the sea in 1,000 BCE by an earthquake or tsunami, it is the oldest lost city in the ocean.  Archeologists flocked to the area when ruins were found by an oceanographer making depth charts. The tides, which caused sand to shift, revealed many artifacts and city ruins. There was even pottery which dated from 5000 BCE, a lot earlier than the archeologists thought. Today, the exploration is still going on, and there is a lot more to uncover.       The Inca, Puebloans, and Atlantis all keep archeologists busy. Whether it's exploring underwater temples, looking at graves, or exploring homes in cliffs, archeologists are digging more clues every day!

However clues left behind allow archaeologist and others piece together details of ancient life.           Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. The rest of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from sites where artifacts are found. Inca artifacts include objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and photograph and artifacts they find, and note the exact position in which they find them. Sometimes archeology confirms historical record, only making fact, more true.           About 1,400 years ago, the Puebloans chose Mesa Verde as their home. They flourished here, and eventually built elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, they left their homes and moved away. Puebloans are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. Archaeologists and others have been able identify all these attributes due to artifacts left behind and preserved.           About 5,000 years ago, a group of people know as the Pavlopetri strove. They lived in an area of about 30,000 square meters in southern Peloponnese. Today that sight has been found underwater, and has allowed marine geologists to study the ancient civilization.           Discoveries about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because it has allowed people to understand how civilization has evolved. Civilization started small, but grew and grew until what it is today. These ancient civilizations show that and tell a tale of how they lived.

Lost Greek city the lost greek city is under water and way have inspired the city of Atlantis it was only truly discovered 40 yeares ago but is giving lots of good information because the sand and water preserved all the ancient artafacts.

Without them, we probably wouldn't have an alphabet, or a money system, or be able to communicate. Not to mention that learning about how they survived in rough terrain and circumstances is very interesting.       Lets start with the Inca, shall we? They kept records using string, called quipus. This could be to record tradings, or anything else, no one really knows.       The Puebloans were basket makers. They lived in pit houses, and came up with the bow and arrow, a much more efficient way of hunting thank the atlatl, a spear thrower. Some lived in cliff dwellings, and it was super cold. So, to keep warm, they lit fires in their places, in return, making the walls blacken with smoke.       The lost city of Atlantis.... There is tons of stuff down there! Marine biologists haven't quite figures out why it sank, but rest assured, it did. Thats an entire, thriving city people!

It is also a very scary thing to do because going out there trying to find lost civilizations can be scary because of how dnagerous it can be. You never know what can be out there.

Then we said that we wanted to let the whole world know about our language thats when we created our system of writting. Thats why its important to know about the Inca.       The reason that we needed to know about the Puebloans is because we wanted to know about our past agriculture. You could say that we were taking notes off of them becasue they were one of the few groups of Europeans that started agriculture so we wanted to get all the information we could off of them.       We didn't neccesarily need to know about the Pavlopetri we were just intrested when we heard that the whole city was underwater. we just wanted to see what the deal was with this place which was later known as the lost city of Atlantis.

They have given us insight on how certain myths and legends came to be, and they introduced many innovative inventions and customs into our world.       Every child has been told myths and legends before. Hercules, David and Goliath,    and another important one is the 'Lost City of Atlantis'! All these stories must come from somewhere and a team of Archeologists and Divers think they have uncovered the origin of this story. Explored by an Anglo-Greek team known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement is assumed to be dated back about 5000 years ago. in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. Dr Jon Henderson claims, 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' whom is associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham. 'It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, which is odd because that dates back long before the illustrious days of classical Greece. The site straddles 30,000 square meters on the ocean floor just off the southern Peloponnese, archaeologists assume that the town was submerged around 1000 BC. It was not until this year that researchers have been able to study the town despite it being discovered some 40 years ago simply by chance by an Oceanographer.

How they were formed, what it was like to live there. But one of the main questions is: What happened to it? The Incas, the Ancestral Puebloans, and the city of Atlantis (Pavlopetri) are a few of the lost civilizations that have yet to be fully discovered. The discoveries about the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important.            The discoveries of these civilizations are important because it increases our knowledge of ancient history. The Incas where a civilization in Peru. They had no alphabet or system of writing, and they used strings to keep records. No one today knows what the knots mean, so we do not know what really happened. But, we do have clues. There is history passed down orally from generation to generation, and there are stories written down by the Europeans. The rest of our knowledge comes from artifacts, such as objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Inca textile and clothing has been preserved because of the deserts in Peru. These clues can help us compare the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca.            The discoveries of these civilizations are very important. Archaeologists have aqquired artifacts and information about these settlements, and are learning more and more about it everyday. There are some issues when it comes to searching for clues, like people stealing artifacts, weather conditions, and even geopgraphical conditions. In the future, we will probably discover more and more lost civilizations and will discover more and more about them.

With these finding are what archeologists use to find out what it was like for people a long time ago and see how much it has changed.        In Source #1 it was about how in a desert there were findings of all sorts. They we preserved because of the desert. The desert was able to keep the things dried out and well preserved. this was a crustal part of their discovery, because the archeologists were then able to use these items to help them with putting together the past.        In Source #2 was the discovery of buildings. People found different things that are bigger. They found things like there homes. This was an important finding because it helped astronomers see what it would be like back then. They were able to then see what the mothers and the fathers did, how their house was set up.        In Source #3 was under the ocean. Trained scobadivers went under to see what they could find. It turns out that there was an under sea city. They were able to find a lot of things. The bad thing was however that some of the stuff got rusted out, because of all the salt water. This under water city was found just near Neapolis, Greece.         There has been a lot found, but there still is a lot of undiscovered things that may or may not change the way that they have thought of the time back then. I just wonder what else is still here that nobody has found yet.

The discoveries of the Inca's are important because they let us know about how they keep track of everything and how early inventions was made. They used knots in colored strings called Quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The Inca's used stone, pottery, gold, or silver to make artifacts. Archaeologists had been told about the life before and during Inca rule by the different artifacts that they all found.In the first source I read called 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secret of the Past' it states that it's important to know the discoveries of the Inca's because we should know about how a civilization formed and what happened to it.        The discoveries of the Puebloans that I read about are also important to know about because we should learn about how they lived and how difficult things were back then. The source that I read about the Puebloans stated that the Puebloans lived in hand-made homes called Pithouses which was later made into Kivas. Kivas are named by a Hopi word meaning Ceremonial Room. Underground chambers was turned into churches. Puebloans used Kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. The sipapu hole would allow them to go to the underworld. They mostly built sandstones as big as a loaf of bread to make a building. Fires would burn throughout the village during winter, leaving the Puebloans suffering in the cold. The way Puebloans lived was terrible compared to the present day.        It is important to know about the Pavlopetri because it is good to know about how cites are lost at sea. The city that I read about was the city of 'Atlantis'. The myth was sort of true but wasn't exactly accurate. The settlement sank by possible earthquakes and tsunamis. Because of the shifting sand, the remains of the city was roaming around the sea which sort of makes it harder for archaeologists. The city of Atlantis are yet to be fully discovered.        In conclusion, the discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri because we should know about how the ancient people back in the days lived and how we are trying to find answers about lost things. So basically, the history of the past is very important to present day.

We need to discover things about them because they can show us things that are bad in history. We don't want to make the same mistakes.           Firstly, the Incas tried to fight people with better technology. This meant instant death. If we went to war with some people with laser guns and antimatter rays, we would be dead in seconds. The Incan story is just a way to tell us what not to do. If we don't bother, then we could become just like the Incans and die out. But if we try to be smart, and look at the past, we can actually live for our full life.       Secondly, the Puebloans. They lived in a cliffside manner. This meant that they could be easy target, because they are already cornered. If you lived in a cliff, then you are impossible to sneak up on, but then you will be easily killed. This means that if we can find more strategic, safe places to dwell, then we will not be repeating history. Also, the Pavlopetri are a good example of geographical placement. If they had decided to live on some dirt, not sand, then they would not have drowned. This is a good example of geography playing a part in history. If they had been higher up, they would have a city full of people and a bunch of descendants.       Some may say that there is no way that there is any place more advanced then America, and that cities nowadays don't fight each other. But Hitler in world war one is a great example of history's part in modern time. If Hitler had read about Napoleon's march to Russia, and how it failed, then he would not have repeated the history and been defeated. He could have tried a different way, and probably succeeded.       These are all examples of history being useful. If we didn't listen to these 3 stories, then we would be part of England, or not exist at all. If history is useless, then why do people still listen? It can be interesting, and it can save lives. Where would we be without history?

These colored strings were called quipus. Archeologists also found artifacts that were made up of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. These objects lasted a long time which is why its still in good condition. They found other objects buried in graves so the dead could use it in it's afterlife. Inca clothing were still in good shape, although it should've been damaged by dampness it was preserved in cold mountains or in dry deserts. When Inca people passed away they would be buried in caves or on mountain tops. The bodies would be buried on mountain tops because the temperature helps preserve them, they act like giant freezers.       Discoveries made about the Puebloans is important because they are known for their skillful basket making art. They farmed instead of hunting and gathering. Farming also counted for their diet. They created the bow and arrow which was more useful than the atlatl which was a spear thrower. They built houses above ground with upright walls made up of poles and mud. There houses were built mostly by cliffs.There named after the spanish word which means, village dwellers. Their pottery upgraded from simple and easy designs on a dull background to black drawings on a white background. As the population grew, their houses and homes were being downgraded because there were more pottery which meant less work for the crafty work. Although, as centuries went by skills and traditions were being used and passed on from generation to generation.       Discoveries made about the Pavlopetri is important because it shows that this was how the fable of Atlantis began. This is the oldest sucken town in the world. The underwater discovery is 30,00 square meters off the southern Peloponnese. It was underwater since 1000 BC. Because of shifting sands and being in a protected bay area, archeologists dsicovered buildings, courtyards, main streets, tombs and religious structures made up of rock. There was also alot of broken pottery. The town was used by an elite, they think this because they found a monument with a large rectangular hall. It is believed that this town was part of the Mycenaean society. This was the first time that sunken city has been founded in Greece, they think that this was how Plato wrote the tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.

They told old stories about the europeans that couldv'e been passed down from generation to generation. The story about the Incas were more like legends rather than back in history at  the time. Clothing was remarkably well and ancient materials were destroyed by dampness.       Incas had lived in high in the mountains and worshiped moutain peaks and had a amazing portrait of their religion, art and argiculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. Some of the things that we know about the Inca come from our oral history. Passing on the different stories was an important way to perserve the community's history.The europeans were arriving in 1532 and vistitors had been spanish soldiers and some were priests.         Historians had to be careful when they interpret accounts. Some of their knowledge had come from artifacts from the differnt sites where are the artifacts could have been more than a hunndred years old. In ancient times the Inca artifacts could have been made of gold, different kinds of pottery, or just plain silver. Archaeologists wanted to compare what they had learned from the ancient artifacts an dthe sites with the group called the Spaniards. The spanidards had murdered one of the last Inca kings in the year of 1532and then took over the whole entire empire.       The different origins of the Incas are more and more difficult to trace. The area in where they lived had been long inhabited by the different people. Archaeologists had some of the most techiques in the world which they had discoverd more about the different Inca predecessors. The archaeologists that were High-Altitude were experts on mountaineers. They would have to carry every single thing of equipment up the mountain before they could start their work. Sometimes the type of archelogy had to be confirmed for historical records.

Also, sometimes history repeats itself and if we know how it was ended or fixed in the past then we have experience to do it now. Another reason is that if something unusual or uncommon appears to exist then scientists can conduct more research and find out more about it which can bring up myths and legends that didn't appear to exist before.       Among the years history can repeat itself. For instance, the blizzard that occurred about 35 years ago had the most snow and no one thought it would happen again. However, in January we had Superstorm Nemo. About 35 inches of snow came down. However, the precautions used back in around 1978 were suggested again because that's how that got through it and since we had experience with events like that we know what to do. In the article archaeologists are researching the existences of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri before they have been taken over by different peoples. They didn't leave any archives for historians to study and learn from so now we know to write archives and leave behind photos so just in case our civilization goes extinct another can find our clues and learn from our mistakes and keep their civilization healthy.       If something unusual or uncommon appears to exist, then surely scientists can research it and see if it's true or false. For example, the undersea city found beneath the waters off southern Greece. It dates back some 5,000 years that it hasn't yet been discovered until about 40 years ago. Now scientists are testing the proof of Atlantis, a city that supposedly sunk decades or centuries ago. Maybe scientists will find proof of fictional characters as well. There will always be mysteries in our world, it just takes patience and dedication to solve it.       Discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because it helps us learn about the world's history and what is true and what isn't. I think this because many lies, rumors, myths, legends, and fables are passed down from generation to generation. Nobody knows for sure if they are real or made up unless it's proven by scientists. The expression, ' seeing is believing,' really takes place in my generation. Photographs can be edited by a computer to make it seem real, or photoshopped.       The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important to us because it helps us learn about our world's history and what exists and what doesn't. In addition to this, history tends to repeat itself among the years and if we have experience which we can learn from history then we know how to fix the issue or move on through it. Lastly, if something seems unusual or out of the contrary, scientists can research it and find out more about it which can bring up myths and legends that didn't seem to exist earlier.

They were around to about 1438-1532 and lived in the Andes and where a lot of their artifacts were found and recovered.       Also the Ancestral Puebloan lived in North America around 1,400 years ago they lived in the caved over walls of a canyon lived in homes that where very elaborate and helped them survive.       The Lost Greek city has been the so-called Atlantis but it is a lot older and predated to over 5,000 years ago. Large buildings were they could have lived this city wasn't built over again when it was so it was in very good condition.

The people in ancient Greek will be the first topic of the paper. The Greeks where among the might yest of all the anchinet civilization do to all of the great thinker that was in their empire. the anichent Greeks had so many great thinks in their time and most lived right in the empire so it was hard not to become a great and might nation of feared warriors, Great thinker, and some of the most influential people in history.              The sunken city off the coast of Greece is the oldest sunken city in the world and historians think that the city sunk about 5,000 years ago.

It is very good to learn about it in school and see the things they had to use and the clothes they wore. How they made there clothes and and from what. When the archaeologists talked about the Inca of Peru and said the didnt write anything the tied knots in a string to keep track of the dates and livestock. It is amazing how the ancient civilized people mad things last for so long and did things the way they did its really cool to learn about it and see how we do things way different.                  Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans lived in North America 1,400 years ago. Its cool how they made things out of stone and now the archaeologists discovered it and get to tell the story of  how they lived and we get to learn about it and see things in museums that was discovered about them. They are know as Basketmakers for their skill of craft. The archaeologists discoverd the houses they lived in (Pithouses). They learned to make things for hunting and pottery. They built there houses together in a big round curved shape.                   The divers went beneath the water to find a cresease in the sand and inside this crease they found a town of buildings and main streets with halls and cemetaries. They believe the town they have found is Atlantis. It is cool how the earths movements helped archaeologists discover things like this. When archaeologists discover things like this its cool to learn about it myself.

All historians have to be careful, because when they interpret these accounts. Many ancient civilizations, the Inca people artifacts are found somewhere in Inca.

Many archaeologists have found them. But even trying to find them has taken them years and years of hard work. These are extremely major findings in archaeological history.       Lets start out with the Inca tribe. This was tribe that lived near the Andes mountain range. There was lost until about 6 years ago in 2007, the ruins hold great mysteries. The ruins have been sculpted so finely. These Incas were masters of building and architecture.       Now to the Puebloans. Puebloans created the first pit houses. These houses were rather small in today's world, but back then they were huge for their standards. The Kivas were at least four times bigger than the pit houses.       Greeks made a huge archaeological discovery as well. Apparently off the coast of Southern Greece, there appears to be a sunken civilization. As said by Doctor Jon Henderson, 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world'. There were ceramics dating back to the stone age. This is probably where the myth of Atlantis came from.   Well, that myth is now officially one hundred percent true. There is more to be found down in the city of Atlantis.       In conclusion, the lost civilizations are not lost anymore. There are major findings in human history. All this came from years and years of hard work. These lost civilizations will never be lost again.

We can see if they lived differently than us or if they lived about the same. They all lived in different places, but they all lived way back then and had to survive the same way.       The ancient Inca of Peru are hard to study because they left no archives for historians to study because they had no writing system or alphabet. They lived up in the Andes where it is really cold, but they managed to live. They also had a huge empire using strings to keep records. Their civilization lived for nearly a hundred years, but later was taken over my Spaniards.       The Puebloans were people who made it on terrible land, but were the best basketweavers and house builders of their time. They learned how to plant and grow food, and they invented the bow and arrow, and easier way to hunt than the throwing spear. They had to figure out how to live on such bad land and they lived there for about 800 years. No one knows why they moved, but they think that the land was probably stripped of all the nutrients and they just deserted the area.       The Pavlopetri were the people who lived in the unknown underwater world called Atlantis. Archaeologists studied the settlement where they found new buildings and ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. Atlantis is still a mystery and we need to still study to learn more about this mysterious underwater place.       The discovery of these people are very important because we are learning more about how the people used to live. We are still studying the sites and their settlements and trying to figure out more. But now we can see how they lived compared to how we live today. The archaeologists are doing the best they can and as fast as they can so that we can learn more about these people and how they survived and what happened to their settlements or empires. This is why the discovery of the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important to us.

These discoveries can help us understand how life for them was like back then, and it also helps us know what we can do today to make like better or easier for today's people.  The Inca survived for many, many years in the cold Indie Mountains.  How did they do it?  By studying their houses and their way of life we can figure it out.       With the help of these former civilizations we can figure out what will happen to civilizations today.  In the case of land movements or even political problems, such as what might have happened with the Puebloans.  Also, like the Pavlopetri, land masses with civilizations on them might move or sink, which would make that place uninhabitable.  All of these reasons are reason enough for me to research these topics.       With the help of these former people, we can find out what we are doing wrong and what we are doing right.  With everything that they did, we can add onto it and make it something of our own, and you never know, it could just be the thing that changes our lives forever.

Is a very wide school it has over 500 students and over 30 teachers . It to some people is know as a bad school but from an inside view I have came to know that it is not a bad school it. They teachers are nice and most of them are understanding if you need the help they'll help you. The students are nice well most of them anyway and if you come prepared every day to school you'll be just find  stay out of trouble know one will have any thing bad to say to you. An their are plenty of loyal people in the school you can count on if you are having any problem with any one in the school. You can just go talk to the administrator, the principle or a teacher and I know many of you have heard this before if your having any problems to go talk to these people but honestly. The people here really do help you they don't mess around if you have a problem they got down to the point and make it to we're you don't have problem any more. Also in the  morning they have announcements there sometimes funny but other times there just like ( what am I watching ).

The discoveries made from these once-empires are crucial for many reasons. By studying these civilizations, archeaoligists have figured out where many things we do originate from, how the different lifestyles differ from our own, and how these civilizations coped with life.               The discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetry have helped scientists to know exactly where things came from.  It is important we know this type of information because we can see the changes that were made. Everyday activities such as hunting with spears have evolved drastically and we are able to connect these two.               How these civilizations coped with life, may help us learn how to deal with certain things we have difficulty with. Houses and shelters had a specific structure to deal with things, like heat, rain, cold, and critters. By lthe discoveries made, we are able to intergrate them into our everyday lives.                  Each empire had a different lifestyles. By learning about this, we learn how they differed from ours. Because of the location of their homelands, many important inventions were made. Today many of our modern day technology is based off of this.                   The discoveries made from the Inca, the Puebloans and the Pavlopetry are important. They give us ideas on how to improve our everyday society and to not make the same mistakes they may have commited.

The Incans left behind the massive ruins of their civilization, the Puebloans left behind their small villages upon cliffs, and the Pavlopetri discovered the ancient Greek settlement entombed in water. The Incan civilization possesed no kind of writing system, but instead, a complex form of communication through an object called, a 'Quipu'. These were strings ordered in special fashion, and were basically a way of conveying a message without speaking.       Today, many archaeologists understand more about the Incans not only because of the Quipu, but becuase of the many ruins they left behind, an example the kingdom of Cuzco. The Puebloans left behind many small ruins of villages. Formally a nomadic people, they began to settel on cliffsides and hills. They learned how to create pottery sculptures, and they learned how to efficeintly utilize the bow and arrow, so that they would be able to hunt and kill their prey much easier. The Puebloans resided in the area of 'Mesa Verde', spanish for 'green table'. They were also skillful basketweavers. And third, the ancient sunken settlement off the coast of Greece. These ruins reveal to modern day citizens the elaborate architecture and the vast number of people the ancient Greek possesed. The settlement, now completely sumberged underwater, may have very well inspired the legend of Atlantis. This ancient settlement is nearly 5,000 years old, and has been well preserved under the water.

The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus-but today no one knows what the knots mean. without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery. By clues left behind by the Inca archeologists and others can piece together details of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. We know the some old stories because they were written by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Some Inca and clothing have also  survived remarkably  well. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looter,  who take  anything that might be valuable. Archaeologists who study these sites keep carful records.

When we think of a lost civilization, we think of the Lost City of Atlantis, the mythical city that was sucked under the ocean in 'The Odyssey ' by Homer, a Greek philosopher. This is not always the case.           Let's take the Inca empire of Peru. They had no sort of alphabet or writing system.  They used colored and knotted string to keep records of goings on in their Empire. In fact, the first Europeans to meet the Inca were astounded that they could run an Empire rivaling the Roman empire just through knotted pieces of string. However, not much is known about the Inca empire. They left behind no archives or writings for historians to study. But, we mad with what we had. Clues left behind by the Inca put together a puzzle revealing the complex art, history and culture behind this great empire.           Atlantis was a city in the Greek 'Odyssey' that was swallowed by the ocean in one night. Now scientists believe it wasn't solely myth. A team of divers has discovered an underwater settlement that dates back 5000 years, back to the times of the Greek empire. The size and wealth of this city was supposedly phenomenal. 'There is no doubt that this is the largest submerged city in the world' said Doctor Jon Henderson, professor of underwater archaeology at the University of NoNottingham. It's oldest remains date back to 2800 to 1200 B.C, Long before the days of classical Greece. There are, however, older sunken sites, but none can be matched to a planned city such as this one.            An idea of lost civilizations filled with ancient undiscovered technology has excited humans since the first reading of the Odyssey. However, not all lost cities are as exciting as Atlantis. And not all can be found.

Take for example the Inca, or Puebloans, or Pavlopetri. They all have secrets to be discovered and most of it could explain alot.             The Inca didnt have an alphabet or system of writing so there were no archives for historians to study. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that the Inca could run a big empire with colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. What the Inca left were clues like portraits explaining their religion and way of life. Since the Inca lived high in the Andes mountains they probably worshiped som mountain peaks. Some Inca were buried incliff faces or mountain tops so that helped to perserve the sites. the bodies that are found in the icy Andes are in real good shape. Eperts can use our modern medical technology to learn how these people died it also reveals information on how they lived!             The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde which in spanish means 'green table'. They are known for good Basketmakes because of their skill and the craft. They used to be nomadic but over the years Puebloans replaced hunting and gathering with Farming. Puebloans population multiplied about A.D.750 and they began building houses above ground. The population decreased after a while and began moving back into cliff alcoves. They used nature to their advantage and built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. They built 'Kiva' which were like ceremonial places you could think of it as a church in these times.             Have you ever heard of The Lost City of Atlantis? Well something similar was found and that could of started the whole Atlantis fable. explorers discovered a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. It is know as the oldest found settlement. Local people in the nearby town of Neapolis are amazed. 'Older generations always knew something was there but we had no idea about the extent of it' said Neapolis`s mayer, Yiannis Kousoulis.            Now think about what would our world be like without these ancient civilization influences? Im sure it wouldnt be like it is now. We probably wouldnt have much fun without the fairy tale of Atlantis and we wouldnt be able to keep up with days without calendars. Thats why I beleive these civilizations were and always will be important to us.

The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. The Incas made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep a count of livestolks. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of there religon. The falls of the Incas easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.       The spainards did not speak the Inca language. So the historians have to be careful when they interpert these acounts. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness. The area were they lived had long been inhabited by different people. The Incas may have worshiped some mountain peaks. This is what archaeologys can find by studying the things they studty.                   Ancestral Puebloans help us find out more about peoples life.       For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and florished here. By A.D 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonory. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before and much mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture.       Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwelling in the 1880s archelologests have sought to understand these peoples lifes. The structures are evidence of a society that over centuries accumulated skills and traitions and passed them on. Using nature ro advantage Ancestral Purbloans built their dwelling beneath the overhanging cliffs.

So they used those hyrogliphics to explain stuff.  Now when other people so those in like places such as museums thye see those pictures an most of the time there is a narrator to explain it to them.  Those hyrogliphics basicly explain how the Incas lived there lifestyles an what they did during that period of time.  Those words how they wrote to people an they understood what they ment because they where apart of that cultour an they knew how to read it an write it off the back.

The Incan artifacts are found in the high mountains of the andes and thats what makes it hard for them to find ancient incan artifacts. Then the plueblos partuicullarly in the meso verda is such an important artifact too becuse these cities in the mmeso verdo are foun basically in the middle of no where in the deserts of the southwest. the cities in the meso verda are so unique because the houses go up to 3 stories high each house block can fit about 50 people in it. making it so important and unique. Now Pavlopetri is such an important find because itis found under the seas just south of the greek peninsula. and this also makes it hard to study the aritfatcs. and it took so long to find the city. it has houses, streets, and temples, fragment of pottery. and this could have been the city that many people have told legends and stories about for many centuries called atlantis.

The Roman time period left behind clues from the Inca to form and amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their very way of life. When archaeologists piece together every detail of the Inca life.         Historians have to be very careful when studying these artifacts because a blue vase might mean a little more than just something to put water or food in. The historians that study the artifacts are specialized on the Inca people, therefore they know what would make sense or not. They know how the weather was because of how things have weathered over the tens of thousands of years. They have read ancient poeples dairies, to see how other people felt about the wars, what they ate, how they got it, how they lived, where they lived.          They also found out that the last Inca king, in 1532, and took over the empire. They have to be careful to make sure that the site they are uncovering belonged to the right people or-else the information would be wrong. Therefore there are still mysteries of the Inca people that will hopefully be uncovered.

To record in history or to find out thing we never new and want to learn so that is what archaeology is and how it is done.

So that is why archaelogy is here so we can learn and discover new and old things and to help us if it happens to us one day.       Like myths like the one about atlantis being underwater many peolpe go underwater to find this city but find old towns or citys or ships underwater that no ones seen and to now why how and when it happened.

If we don't learn about our past and history, then we are either bound to repeat it, or if we went through an economic crisis, we wouldn't know how to restart or where to begin. By researching the ways of life of these different cultures helps our knowledge and understanding of survival and how civilizations came to be. My theory is that there are still thousands of civilizations that we still know nothing about. The Inca were a great civilization. Clues left behind from the Inca helped to form a better understanding of how they lived, such as religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, and transportation. Little of what we know about the Inca comes from stories passed down through the centuries, but some of the information given were from the Spaniards, who did not speak the Inca language well, so it is not a completely reliable source. Some of what we know are from letters and diaries from the Spaniards, describing what they were like. Most of our knowledge, however, comes from ancient artifacts, like objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver, which last a long time, even if they had been buried. Some clothing and textiles have been surprisingly preserved over time, mostly because of the dry desert environment. One of the main reasons that their civilization had been preserved so well was from their location. The Inca lived in the Andes, and many of their sites are in high locations that are hard to get to. The cold mountains acted as a freezer to Inca bodies, making it easier for experts to examine and learn about how they lived, the health conditions they had, and maybe even how they died. It is hard to tell some details, however, because of their location being hard to reach. The Mesa Verde National Park preserves an immense amount of reminders from this ancient civilization. At one point, archeologists called these people Anasazi, meaning 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies,' but we now call them Ancestral Puebloans. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde at about 550 A.D. They led a more settled way of life, like farming instead of hunting and gathering. They lived in built pithouses built on mesa tops or in cliff recesses. They learned pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. They were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They were fairly prosperous, and population multiplied. At about 750 A.D. they began building houses above the ground with upright wals made of poles and mud. Population continued to grow, and so did their technology and knowledge. Eventually, fires were built for cooking, houses became more comfortable, but they realized their living conditions were unsatisfactory, and around 1300 A.D., Mesa Verde was deserted. The last civilization is one that had been named a myth for thousands of years-- the sunken city of Atlantis. After researching the abandoned city on the ocean floor, archeologists found several clues preserved from the shifting sands in the ocean. The city had been planned out; a world of buildings, courtyards, streets, tombs and religious structure, along with many shards of pottery. Marine geologists still have yet to find out why the civilizations sand, and theories include many sea leven changes, ground subsidence as a result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have been discovereed, and there may still be a lot more down there that is waiting to be found.

Without this information given on previous civilizations we would not have the knowledge we have today.  We would lack the knowledge of our ancestry, world creation, and past life and explanations on earth.          From all the research done on the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri we have gained knowledge on how the world was made. Also, from this research, many myths and tales were made up giving those with superstitions and questions an answer to our world today.  Additionally, some of these myths were created to shelter those who were young of knowing the harsh truth of civilizations falls to destruction.  Without this research we would have lacked the protection of harshness and cruelty that keeps children happy, good, safe, and pure.          Additionally, our lives have been greater knowledge by the truth and reason behind the worlds marks.  By finding the lost civilizations , sunken cities, and ancient ruins we have found the home of the generations from before us and where they came from.  Also, the sight of what their knowledge was from their time has also been shared with archaeologist of whom has passed down their wisdom to us.           Without the research of all of the architects our history would be gone and our intelligence shrunken. As, it is only the problems of the past that grow our future so we could push on to our future.          With result to all of this research, the investigation of these civilizations has held our world and level of intelligence.  Also, this will continue to help explain our world and history for years to come.

Their achievements captivate people to this day.  Three of these ancient civilizations stand out from the others.  They are the Incas, Puebloans, and the lost city of the Greeks.           The first is the ancient Inca of Peru.  The Incas were a great people with an empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome.  Archaeologists have discovered amazing clues left behind like their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.  They were able to thrive in their unforgiving land.  These artifacts left behind are amazing because are the only things that are left of the once great empire that rivaled the Romans.           The second in the Ancestral Puebloans.  They were once a nomadic people who made great baskets, but traded that life for a one of farming and permanent settlements built on high place like a mesa.  Their population prospered, so at about A.D.750 they began to build houses with upright walls made of pole and mud.  Between A.D 1100 and A.D. 1300 their population reached the thousands.  They built compact villages to house the growing population.  These buildings were carefully crafted with well cut stones.  In A.D 1200 another population shift occurred.  They moved back to the cliffs for unknown reasons like maybe the alcoves provide better protection from elements, religious reasons, or even psychological reasons.  Whatever the reason it gave rise to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is most famous.  This is important discovery because the shows a group of people who were once excellent basket makers and became a great group of people who lived on high mesas and alcoves.            The third is the lost Greek city.  This ancient city is covered with great amount of ocean water.  This might of been the city that inspired the myth about Atlantis.  It is not the oldest town, but it was the first to be planed.  The underwater city holds great submerged buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.  In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. This is an amazing discovery because less than 1% of the ocean floor has been surveyed.  This find was like finding a needle in a hay stack.  Also, the relics are in good condition and haven't have been looted.  This just adds to the great find.           These three ancient civilizations are important discoveries because they give great glimpses of the past.  These discoveries could lead to an idea or invention that that we could only dream of.  The people may not be alive any more, but their items from their daily lives on and serve a reminder of those whose time has passed on this Earth.

These civilizations have provided new knowledge to archaeologists about their rich culture and history.       In the article, 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past', written by Beth Gruber, Gruber exposes how the Incas are a very mysterious civilization that archaeologists yet have much knowledge about. The Inca 'made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock'. These colorful artifacts are of no meaning to archaeologists. They have no clue about it, but these knots yield the answers to all of the Inca's history because the quipu was their only form of records. The Inca history archaeologists know about comes from 'oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation'. This means that the Inca remain mysterious to this day. The human race may never find out the Inca's culture. Yet, the desire for knowledge keeps archaeologists searching for more Incan artifacts.       In the article, 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and their World', it is revealed to the reader that the Puebloans are very significant at keeping archaeologists doing their job. The Puebloans built 'stone walls of large pueblos that are regarded as the finest built in Mesa Verde'. The Puebloans must have been very creative people because their constructing methods are elegant. Archaeologists have discovered their beautiful building and have learned that they are great builders from just looking and examining their architecture. The Puebloans later 'traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there'. The Puebloans remain one of the most fascinationg civiliations ever to have lived, and having living descendants of them today gives archaeologists a huge help in finding out more about this unique ancient civilization.       In the article 'Lost Greek city that may have inspred Atlantis myth gives up secrets', by Helena Smith in Athens, Smith describes how the Pavlopetri might have been the people living in the famed 'Lost City of Atlantis'. This lost city found beneath the waters off of Greece may have inspire that infamous myth. Even if this city is not the genuine Atlantis, it still remains 'the oldest submerged town in the world'. This city, doubtless of being Atlantis, is still a huge archaeology discovery. This city provides new information about what kind of culture the Pavlopetri people had. In addition, this city may be the city of Atlantis, but regardless of that, Atlantis 'is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going'. Whether or not this city is Atlantis, the town just pushes underwater archaeologists to push harder to try and find more artifacts and more knowledge. To find out that a myth truly is real by using hard facts would be amazing. It would feed some of the human desire to gain more and more knowledge. The Pavlopetri people, having have lived in Atlantis or not, have provided a huge find for archaeologists everyewhere.       The ancient Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have given archaologists around the world so much to study and so much more knowledge. These ancient civilizations have given the us their rich culture and history to examine, and the human race is both grateful and thankful for the huge amount of knowledge that they have recieved about these mysterious people.

Do you think that civilization today may have been the same without the discoveries made by the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri? There are a few reasons why civilization wouldn't be the same if the Inca, the Puebloans, Pavlopetri. The reason why I say that mankind would not be the same without the ideas made by the ancient people is because most of there ideas are used by us today. For example for our Army and Navy, we learned from ancient civilizations and we looked at what they're army was like and we actually used ideas from ancient civilizations and we use them today. So without ancient civilizations the Army and Navy would not be the same. Are alphabet wouldn't be the same either because we took ideas from ancient civilizations to create are alphabet that is used today. We also might not have bowls and plates because bowls and plates come from the category of pottery which ancient civilization came up with so we also might've  not had bowls and plates if it wheren't for old civilization. All in all civiliation today would not have been the same without ancient civilization.                            	MD PRP VB DT NNS VBN IN DT NNP NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP VBD JJ .

In the article, many archaeologist have found the remain of quipus which helped the Incas keep records and another way to keep tack of what day it is. As of today, no one know what those colored knots mean. To know more about the past of the Incas, they left clues behind such as their religion, art, aarchitecture, argiculture, government, and transportation. Other ways archaeologist find out about the past of the Incas is stories past from generation to generation. When serching for artifacts about the past, archeologist  also have many geographical promblem like when serching for dead bodies to see what people put in their grave for their afterlife, archeologist may have to chance to freeze because it is so cold in the mountains.                   In the article, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World is about how the puebloans live their life and their agriculture. The publoans settled in Mesa Verde about     A.D. 550. , they were as know as Basketmakers because of their skills as craft makers. Hunting and gathering were their main livelihood. They live in houses called pithouses. Puebloans learned how to make pottery, acquired a bow and arrow, and make a weapon more efficient for hunting. In about A.D. 750 they began to built houses with walls of poles and mud. In A.D 1000 people of Mesa Verde started changing their way in life by things more stronger. By the A.D 1100 the population of the Pubebloans started to grow. When cowboys can into the cliff dwellings, archeologist began to understand the peoples' life.                  In the articile, Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets by Helena Smith is about how marine geologist are trying to find the remains of a lost city called Atlantis.

The discoveries found from ancient civilizations are important, they are important  because we can use them to understand the past, and how much we have advanced in technology today. Some ancient artifacts that help us understand the past of ancient civilizations include the quipu from the Inca empire, the pit houses from the Puebloans, and lost sunken Greek city believed to be Athens.         Quipu used in the Inca civilization helps us today understand how the Incans kept track of numbers without an established number or writing system. The quipu was a long colorful string attached to a stick with knots in it. Each knot was used to keep track of anything from money, to food, to cattle.         Pit houses from the Mesa Verde community were being occupied by Puebloans from the year A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 when people began to ditch hunting and gathering to a settled farming community. The pit houses were held up by timbers in each of the four corners of the structure. The pit house also contained a living room which was sunken in a few feet from the ground. A fire pit was also included in the pit house and had an air shaft to release smoke from the fire.         The sunken city in Greece, believed to be Athens, tells modern day archeologist and scientist much about the ancient civilization. Since it was so well preserved by the sand in the bay, Anglo-Greek scientist can survey through to find main streets, buildings courtyards, and even religious structures. This sunken city helps us today by showing us how technologically advanced the ancient Greeks were.         Quipus, pit houses, and sunken cities all are important to the discovery of our past. All of these artifacts help us conclude information to the development of our ancestors in the advancing civilizations they called home.             	WRB VBP DT NNS IN JJ NNS IN JJ .

One of these civillizations was ancient greece and athens. ancient athens was said to have an ancient submerged city. About 40 years ago an underwater archiologyst had seen the submerged city but till now there have been many under water expiditions throught the world                                             there have been many ancient cities discovered  like the incas, and the ancient puebloans of mexico, and they all have stories of thier treasures an architectural tools an technology. They might have even left behind astronomical tools and callenders or even their ways of life for people to study and learn from them                                             These examples show how advanced and complex ancient cultures were in the past. In conclusion these were the ways of the ancient cultures and their technology will always effect un now and forever in our ways of life and others lives all around the world for a long time.

The ancient Inca civilization was a very important discovery because we could see how advanced they were during their time compared to the other civilizations. Incas have taught us by leaving artifacts behind that they showed us what games they played and what kind of tools they used to cook and the weapons they used to hunt with. They also showed us how they kept records with quipos. The Inca left many clues behind including religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and a unique way of life. The bodies scientist find can tell how they died because the bodies are in good shape which allow scientist to use modern medical scanning equipment.                 The Mesa Verde Puebleans are another ancient civilization that we have discovered. The Mesa Verde people lived long before explored North America. The Mesa Verde people lived and flourished here and built elaborate stone communities.First Puebloans were known as basket-makers for their skill in craft. Farming began to replace their nomadic way of hunting and gathering food. They lived in small villages made of clustered pit houses. Pit houses were like tents only made of wood and had four support timbers that held the whole thing up. The pit houses later in time evolved and became known as kivas. By A.D. 750 they began to build houses above the ground. These houses had upright walls made of poles and mud. The houses were built right next to each other in long curving rows. The Mesa Verde people, due to their new housing methods, started to be known as Puebloans.                    The ancient underwater city of Atlantis was a huge discovery to  all the people around the world. Some of the remains found were dated long before the glory, golden age, days of Greece. The famous city takes as much as 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It is believed that the city was consumed by the sea around 1,000 BC. Atlantis was found with buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. The sunken city of Atlantis dates as far back as Homer's heroes and as far as to when Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Experts say that the knowing of size and wealth of detail is unprecedent. The city of Atlantis also provides potential insights to the workings of a Mycenaean society. That is why the discoveries of the ancient Inca society, the Mesa Verde Puebloans, and the discovery of the ancient myth of the sunken underwater city of Atlantis were a great discovery and influenced us in many ways. The Incas left behind their quipos as calenders, the Mesa Verde Puebloans left the houses they built above ground that sound a lot like an apartment complex, and the underwater society of Atlantis left their buildings and many other important artifacts to show us how advanced they were during and before their time before being underwater.

There way of life in history was amazing and we would have never of known if they didn't keep any of their records, documents, and structures of how they lived. This helps and gives us our history that we wright down and what we study in school, we have history so we don't make the same mistakes as our kind has done in the past. Their artifacts help us understand them more and see how smart they were with technology and other things we would have never known about if there was nothing left from their time period. This helps our way of society to understand each other and bring us into one union.          In the book, Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, by Beth Gruber, explains how the Incas lived their way of life. The Incas were hard to learn about because they didn't leave any archives, which made it a little more difficult to understand their way of life. They did leave knots on a string and that was their calendar, they were called quipus. To this day scientist still don't know what the different colors on the knots represent. Later in years we were provided with amazing discoveries they had left behind like, portraits of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. From the left over artifacts, scientist are able to identify their way of life.          In the book, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, by Roy Anderson, explains how the Ancestral Puebloans lived their life. The Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table'), they had settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were very skilled at crafting and were called Basketmakers. They were formerly nomadic, beginning to settle in their lives normally, civilized. Instead of hunting and gathering, they took over farming, they also lived built their homes on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses in pithouses. They had also discovered pottery and making arrows for hunting in stead of the atlatl (a spear thrower).          In the book, Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets, by Helena Smith in Athens, explains how the Pavlopetri lived their way of life. The Pavlopetri lived in the lost city of Atlantis, on the southern side of Greece.

They are artifacts from along time ago around 1000 years. Inca came from South America that rivaled the exanse of Ancient Rome.           Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They left no archives to historains can study. Inca made knots to keep count of livestock. The first Europeans were amazed that they run a huge empire. Today no one knows what the knots means. Inca left clues behind that formed an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, transportation, and way of life.           Old stories have been told by Europeans. Reset of the the knowledge we know of the Inca is the artifacts. Most artifacts survived well. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that mgiht be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but still looting goes on today. Looted sites do not have much to tell.           The Inca lived in high in the Andes and may worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces. This helped the perserve, because is was harder for the looters to get to them. It also made the job difficult for archaeologist. But it was good for them as well. They cold mountain top made the dead bodies in good shape. That made it easier to learn how the people died.             There are no more Inca living in the present time. Most Inca sites have been cleaned out from looters, archaeologist, and treasure hunters. But most artifacts are cept nice in a museum, locked away from looters and hunters. Inca will be remembered in history about how they lived.

I believe  that the findings are important, because it is how we learn about our early history. If  we didn't find the things we have we most likely wouldn't even know about the existence of the Incas. We know so little as it is we need to be able to find things so we can learn as much as we can about the early civilizations. If we hadn't been looking or didn't care we would have no idea that the puebloan city ever existed. We would be totally ignorant the other people who lived on the land before we did!                                                                                                                                                             Some people may think that we don't need to learn about early civilizations because they are dead, right? We need to learn about them because they are what mad us who we are today. if it weren't for them developing things such as pottery, languages, stories, currency we would still be stuck in the stone ages. without them we would not be as technologically advanced as we are today. We would not have big cities like we do today if it wasn't for our early foundation, like the puebloans they were the earliest planned civilization kown to man.       We also wouldnt know how to do alot of the things we know how to do today, like alot of the architectural styling many people enjoy today. History would also repeat itself, because we wouldnt learn from any of the mistakes that were made, like when the last incan king was murdered and taken over by spain. After everyone forgot another country could do the exact same thing. 	NNS VBP JJ NN VBZ RB VBN RP NN NN VBD IN NN PRP VBP VBP WRB VBP JJ NNS JJ .

They are very important because they could have started the whole human race. We don't know that for sure yet but that could be true. I don't even have a thought about it.         We have found many artifacts frm them and the most commonly known ones are the calendars. Yes, I know they don't sound very interesting at all but the are. he Aztec calendars are what some people think is the countdown to the 'end of the world.'       The Inca lived high in the Andes Mountain Range. Some think they worshipped the mountains thinking they were gods and goddesses.They even buried the dead in caves or at the top so looters couldn't get to them. That just made the job harder for the archeoligist. We scan and anylize the bodies for information about how they lived.         Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde in pithouses, 'houses in the ground.' They went from building with pole-and-adobe building to masterful stone masonry. They would join together alot of units that had more than 50 rooms.         They had churches or Kivas.This is where they worshipped and weaved. They would make fires in summer mainly for cooking and in winter mainly for warmth. They then made a city that is now under water. That may be where we got the idea for Atlantis, but I still think Atlantis is real.      Well I hope that you enjoyed my article about ancient civilizations. I have always loved learning about this stuff because of the mystery behind it. Well this raps up my presentation so until next time.

We can't craft a completely new invention without having a basis to aid us create something else. Contributing from the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavopetri, we have upgraded from what they have made. The Inca and their quipus, we use that everyday. To us, it's now known as a calendar to record and remind us of important events. The Puebloans used their archiectual skills to create homes within their villages, which is what we still do, just more advanced and modern. The Pavopetri have contrubuted us having the technology that allow us to travel underwater and discover foriegn cities like Atlantis. Overall, we have upgraded these discoveries to our aid us in our way of life.

All this precious history is preserved by nature. In this article I will be telling you about the well preserved artifacts that were left by the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.       First, the Incan empire ruled from 1438-1532. Although some Incan tablets have been looted, we still have learned a great deal about the Incan life from other Incan tablets. From these tablets we have learned that the Inca lived high in the Andes mountains, and that they may have worshiped some mountains.  We have also learned that the Inca sometimes buried tablets with the dead. Although the Incan ruins had many records looted, they wrote such thorough that we still learned a lot about their lives.       Secondly, the Puebloans ruled from 550-1200 a.d.. They ruled for over 700 years. The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verda, in North America. From records, we learned that they Puebloans created the bow and arrow, and pithouses. The bow and arrow was a weapon, this  weapon was a long piece of wood that had a string that ran from the top to the bottom of the wood. Pithouses were created when the Puebloans settled. These were holes dug a few feet into the ground with four corners of wood that provided shelter. Altogether, the Puebloans were people that adapted quickly to their envirement.       Third, the lost city, also known as Atlantis, ruled from 2800-1200 BC. This city is located 30,000 square meters away from Southern Peloponnese. This lost city was preserved by shifting sands. These shifting sands covered up the city, therefore preserving it. Some believe that Plato, a very famous Greek writer, wrote about this city in his tale called'The sunken continent of Atlantis.' We will never really know if his writing was based off of this lost city. Furthermore, this lost city has been one very big mystery.       Lastly, these empires and cities have left many written records. Through these records, we have been able to see through the eyes of the people of the past.

There have been many discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri that reveal most of the answers to your questions about their lives back then.               One of the first discoveries that were found was about the Inca. They lived in the years 1438-1532 in a South American empire. What clues did they leave behind for us to study how they lived? Researchers pieced together amazing puzzles of their religion, government systems, art and architecture, and many details of the Inca life style. Their stories were also passed down through generations and generations by oral history and important stories. However, most of these stories were legends rather than historical facts about their past. Another part of our knowledge comes from the Inca's well preserved clothing and some bodies found in the mountaions from the Andes. Even though some sites were raided by treasure hunters long ago, archaeologists can still uncover some truths about their past.               Another reason why we can learn from ancient civilizations is through the Pluebloans. This group of people lived in Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. They lived sunken houses a few feet in the ground called pit-houses.They were known for making baskets and were very nomadic people too. We can learn from this because it shows how much we have changed from back then. Also,when they built fires inside their houses to cook and keep warm, they cut a hole in their roofs to let the smoke out. This reveals that they were not only good at doing things, but they were also smart too. Eventually they figured out how to make potery and better houses made out of stones. There population may have reached around several thousand during the classic period which led to bigger towns and cities.               There were also many discoveries made about the Pavlopetri. The only thing different about this ancient civilization is that is was underwater in southern Greese. The water really helped preserved the 30,000 square meter city considering it has remains dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC. In this sunken city they have also found many artifacts buildings, rock-cut tombs, and religios structures. This reaveals a whole new world of exploration for archaeologists.              ? Do you now know why ancient civilizations are so importatnt? It is because of some groups like the Inca, Pueloans, and the Pavlopetri that we now have less questions to answer about life back then.

Archaeology Helps Discover Lost Civilizations                                      Many historians  have contributed to discovering and studying objects obtained from areas where ancient civilizations once prospered.This practice is called Archaeology.Archaeology has led to the discovery of several lost civilizations.                In ancient Inca of Peru, archaeologists discovered that the people did not have a written record system during this time period. Instead, the people of Inca made knots in colored string called Quipus to record dates and to keep track of the amount of livestock.They also discovered stories written by Spanish soldiers and priests telling about the Inca when they arrived at the empire in 1532. However, most Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language and could have misunderstood the culture.Most of what archaeologists learn from the lost civilization of Inca is from the artifacts discovered .Some of these artifacts include, clothing, pottery, building ruins, bodies, and weapons.Bodies have been found in the Andes mountains and are in such good condition they can be studied with modern medical equipment to show how they died and how they lived.                Another society archaeology helped us discover was the ancestral Puebloans. They lived in Mesa Verde,Mexico(now a national park).Archaeologists discovered remains from homes that were called pithouses, these houses consisted of a living room sunk a few feet in the ground and four corner timbers supporting the roof.People lived in these houses until A.D. 550 to A.D. 750.The people who lived during this time are referred to as Basketmakers for their skill in weaving baskets . In the year A.D. 1000, people's homes had evolved from pole supported homes to walls of stone holding fifty or so rooms.The populations continued to grow and in some of the artifacts observed from this time a noticeable decline in quality is seen. The people appeared to be moving into cliff alcoves that had previously sheltered their ancestors. These people became known as the cliff dwellers. They built their homes under overhanging cliffs with sandstone shaped into rectangle blocks.However, ancestral Pueblans only lived in the cliffs for less than a hundred years.Several theories were made about their migration. For example, crop failures, drought,or land resource depletion may have caused the people to migrate. Studies from archaeologists have shown when the cliff dwellers left they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona.               Archaeologists have also discovered a submerged city that was  off the southern coast of Greece. This lost city  could have inspired one of the world's most legendary myths,the fable of Atlantis. The sunken settlement was explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists .They discovered the settlement was as old as 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes.The site covers 30,000 square meter of the ocean floor and is believed to be consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.Arcaeologists  have studied building structures, pottery, rock-cut tombs, and religious a monuments. By finding the lost city Arcaeologists have allowed historians to discover how many people lived in this time and what their religious beliefs were.They  also can use this information to compare modern day lifestyles to the ones our ancestors lived by before.                As you can see, Archaeologist work has allowed the world to discover and better understand how different our lives are from lost ancient civilizations.                                 	.

Well with today's advances in technology you can. Archeologists have discovered many things about living conditions in the past from 3 main civilizations.            One of the civilizations is the Inca. The Inca had portraits that left behind amazing accounts of their religion, art, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Also archeologists have learned many things about the Inca from reading accounts of Spaniards that were left behind. We have been able to piece together enough data to know what happened to the Inca up until they were slaughtered by the Spanish.            Another civilization was the Puebloans. They used many advanced things for their time period. Some of these thing were basket weaving, bow and arrow hunting tools, and pit houses. They also lived in cliff dwellings. All of this archeologists were able to learn by careful studying, and meticulous deciphering.            The Pavlopetri civilization was found submerged by using modern day sonar. This ancient civilization is the oldest submerged city currently found. It was also thought to inspire the myth of Atlantis. Due to shifting sands and a protective bay most of this civilizations artifacts are still intact today. Archeologists have been able to discover many interesting facts about this civilization because of this.            As you can see archeologists have been able to uncover many helpful things about the Inca, Puebloans, And the Pavlopetri due to modern advances in techology.

About 1400 years ago a group of people lived in mesa Verde for nearly 700 years them and their descendents lived and flourished there.about ad 550 Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde, they had a skill in craft and made a much better hunting weapon then the Atlatl known as the bow and arrow about ad 750 they began building houses above ground,these were prosperous time for basket makers.                           The Inca lived in the high Andes mountains and worshiped some mountain peaks. many of their sites are in high remote places . some Incas were buried in the caves of cliff faces,this helped preserve artifact;however it makes archeologists jobs harder.they have to carry all their equipment up a hill before they can do their work.bodies found in the Andes are commonly found in good shape due to the preservation of the cold weather.

They searched at the Incan civilization, the Pueboloans, and the Pavlopetri's civilizations.    As they looked around the Incan civilization, archeaologists discovered that Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and controlled to empire. They believe that this is important to know because it tells us how the empire ended. But discovering its origin is more difficult to know. Archeaologists need to know why did they build their civilization on the mountains, but the area where they settled had been long inhabited by other people.   When arhceaologists were at the Puebloans society they discovered that the people who lived there were mostly basketmakers.They think that it's important to know why they were basketmakers because it can show us that they were skilled craft workers.   Finally the arhceaologists discovered that the Pavlopetri's had a society underwater. As they studied their sunken city, they discovered that the people who lived there regular ancient citizens that regularly had courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures in their civilization. But the main reason archeologists investigate the society is because they wnat to find out how the city sank.   Some people think that searching around ancient cities is a waste of time. But archaeologists discovered new things around the civilization that can introduce new secerts in human life.

The pueblans had built a society based on hunting and gathering, and quickly moved to building with stone. Pavlopeti was an elite town in classical Greece that was hit with a natural disaster and was lost to the world for many years and was only thought to be a story. Those are some of the reasons why they were so important.   They were also important becouse. Like I stated before the city that they think is Atlantis was thought to be lost and a story, but we found it and can now review it with sonar. The Inca had manidged so much and was nearly completly wiped out by the Europeans and lost all of there records and systems wich nobody knows abought. While all of this happend it was very interesting to learn that civilization can grow fast, but can be wiped out even faster.

She asked me if i wanted anything to eat while not even looking at me. I just wanted to go upstairs and close my door.  There was no way i could go there, i hate lizards. I still went in there though. When i went in my room. I felt like i was sweating and all red. i sat in the corner , my sister asked if i wanted to pet it. i was scared. but mom told me along time ago,. let your fers go away. i didnt know what to do anymore. i pull my hnd out slowly and touch it slowly .

Some of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, transportation, and ways of their lifes had helped us figure out why Inca ruled South American empire for over a 100 years. From generation to generation stories have been passed down, but since the Spaniards counldn't speak the Inca language well it was very difficult to pass on the stories. They were very talented people for their time, they made thinks out of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. These artifacts helps us discover Inca past history, as well as weather and other natural conditions. When archaeologists go to a site sometimes they discover tht stealers and looters have been their and have disturbed them. As archaeologists go to site the most important things on their mind is to fine out what happened to a civilization and where it had came from. These are the importances of the discovery of Inca and how.        The Puebloans lived in stone houses for over 700 years. Archaeologists call these people Anasazi, which is a Navajo word meaning 'The Ancient Ones or Enemies.' They were also known as basketmakers, for thier good skills at crafts. They were settled back people, after many years they lived in pit houses. Their population had been multipling quickly, so they began making houses of uprights walls made of poles and mud. Fromm generation to generation over centuries structure skills had changed, they started to built their dwelligns beneath the overhanging cliffs. They had lived in them for less than 100 years. These are the importances of the discovery of the Puebloans and how.        The Lost City may have inspired one od the worlds most enduring myths, this is the oldest submerged town in the world. Do to weather and shifting sands the bay was protected where the Lost City was. They had found 9,000 square meters of new buildings, all under water. This is very different because a sa submerged site it was not reoccupied. They think it was a combination of two towns at the start, this is the first time a sunken city had been found in greece.

The Incas were an amazing discovery for archaeologist it was a little hard though because they didn't there language.

Ancient greece includes my favorite, Atlantis. It is the oldest submerged city. It was thouroly researched by divers last year because the technology would finally allow it. It was discovered poetry and many other facinating things. Theese discoveries of pithouses, the kiva and more have been very important to us as a society. I would be able to go into more depth with all of my research but sadly this is only a article with so much room. I hope my insight has made you want to go in depth on your own.       Mesa verde pithouses-  People lives in theese from 550 to 750 AD. They featured a living room a roof a firepit and a underworld passage. This innovation led to kiva and many more archetechtual structures.       The Kiva- It is a ceremonial room and or church. Puebloeans practiced modern religons at that time. Older generations used it for healing rooms or to pray for rain. Also luck in hunting crop growing or anything that could result in life or death.       One amazing thing about the inca is they comunacated without a writing system. If you think of today we rely so much on other people and things we would be no where without a system of communication. That gives you a idea of just how intelligent theese people were, just in a different way.       I enjoy theese places and i hope you do to. I incourage you to do some research on your own so you can back me up or prove me wrong. well just kidding im always right. coming to you from Tacoma, washington this is billy dingle with historys latest.

First im gonna start off with the Inca becuase they are intresting and have a lot of lessons.The Inca made the quipus that keep a count of livestock.The first Europeans to meet the inca were amazed that that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records.The Inca left behind an amazing portrait of their religion,art and               architecture,agriculture,government,transportation,and way of life.The Inca comes frome oral history,or stories passed frome generation to generation.                The second civilaization the  Puebloans in mesa verde.The first ancestral Puebloans settled in mesa verde in A.D.550.Their know as basketmakers form their skills of craftmanship.They lived in a pithouses that were in small villages that were built on mesa tops but somtimes in cliffs.They how to make weapons like the bow an arrow to hunt the atlatl and to make pottery too.Their population increased  alot in the A.D.750.There name the Puebloans means 'village dwellers'.There societys were big and they were cliff swellers and others.                 The last civilaization that im write about is lost greek city that may have inspired atlantis myth gives up secrets.It about people that found a town under the southern Greece.The town was round the 1000BC because it was old .They found buildings,courtyards,main streets,rock-cut tombz and religious structures.There is alot of stories about Atlantis that there a lot of teasure and stuff.But no one knows what happen to atlantics.

They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first europeans to meet the inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records.                                                                                                                                         Ancient Rome left clues behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together detail of the Inca life. The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the Spainards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.            Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on peru`s coasts or the cold mountains or the andes. Some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, Who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. looted sites often do not tell archaeologists, who can dig them up carefully. They provide the best idea of all about life in peru before and during Inca rule.               Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this acient culture. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as ''the acient ones'' or ''ancient enemies.'' We now call them Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descents. The first Ancestral puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for ''green table'') about A.D. 550. They are know as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled wayof life.              The structers are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. By the classic Period, Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a virgorous civilization, whos accomplishment in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America using nature to advantage, Ancestral Pueblanos built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction  material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread.                    The secret of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world`s  most enduring myths the fable of Atlantis have been brought to light from beneath the waters off  southern Greece. Explored by an Anglo Greek team of archealogists and marine geologists and known as pavlopetri, the sunken settlment dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer`s heroes and in term of size and wealth of detail is unexprecedented, experts say.                There is now a doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. Inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths. Atlantis was a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. said Sakellariou. Less than 1 percent of the worlds ocean floor have ever been surveyed.

The enclosure in a protected buy, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. The lost city is important find because its very big and very old. It's also been there for many years. It was very replete with thousands of shards of pottery. The fable of Atlantis have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.       The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It was revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. THe sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of details is unprecedented, experts say. There was many things found in the lost city like old tools, weapons, money, coins and old pottery. There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considerd to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the working of Mycenaean society. 40 years ago it was only the year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or tsunami.       The Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. Greece was the first time that a sunken city has been found that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. One percent of the world's ocean floors have ever been tested. The lost cities extraordinary found is still a lot more down there that has no been found yet.

These cities were all found by archaeologists. The lost cities we found were called the Inca, Puebloans, and Peru. these cities are very old they are about 5,000 thousand years old.        Also the Inca city did not leave any alphabet or systems for use to study on now. The Inca city made knots with colors on them so they could recorded the calendar and keep a count of the livestock. The first Europeans that meat the Incas were so amazed that they could run a huge empire with just using strings. But we still don't know what the knots mean or the colors that go with them. Also the Spaniards did not speak any of the Inca language. Also some of the Incas stories were rather legends than history. The Inca artifacts were objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or sometimes silver. These materials that they used last a very long time even if they have been bared for a hundred years.        The second city we are gonna talk about is the puebloans, this city was long before the Europeans explored north America. Also the first ancestral puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They are known as a basketmarkers they are known by that because of there skills at the craft. They learned how to make a lot of stuff like pottery, bow and arrow, and more efficient weapons. They started building houses in A.D. 750. but from here on they are now known as the puebloans. In the A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 the population reached several thousand. In 1880 archeologists started finding our how these people lived.                                                                                                      Also these cities were frozen and they started to unfreeze when it hit the water because the sand was helping it dissolve.Also our investigation revealed that 9,000 square meters or new buildings were built.We also found out that when earthquakes and tsunami's hit.That the cities would sink in deeper. Also our older generations always knew something was there but we had no idea about it.These are the first cities that we found of Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent.Finally this was an extraordinary thing we have found under water but we still have more things to discover that have not been found.                                                                                                                                    The third city I want to talk about is called the lost Greek city. this city has been found under water by a diver. The city that the diver found was about 5,000 thousand years old, it was there before Christ. Also the city was frozen, but every time there would be an earthquake or a tsunami it would sink and some of it would devolve into the sand. This city is the biggest city we have ever had it is 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. we also found a lot of things we found buildings, main streets,  houses,  courtyards, and a lot of culture things we think this city was very rouges. as so we think. Our investigation also revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. This is one extraordinary city we have found. but we still have a lot more in the ocean to find out about.       finally the cities we have found gave use a lot of things about our old Coulter's. And gave use more historical things to learn about. These cities are very interesting to learn about because, we get to find out what people did before we had technology.

Archeologists found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.Wich suggested that the settlement was occupied soem 5,00 years ago, at tghe least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought.Then other investigations revealed 9,000 square meters of new buildings. What really took the, by surprise was the discovery of a possible megaron,a monumental structure witha large rectangular hall.       While marine geologists have to yet work out why thesettlement sank.Some theories include sea level changes,ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes,or a tsunami.Its very likely a combination of the first two,' said Dimitris Sakellariou,at the Greek institute of oceanography.'As the worlds oldest submerged city it is truly amazing.It doesnt only show how peolpe live at the time is to has a great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow.       It is the first time a sunken city has been found in over 5,000 years in Greece.It predates the time that Plato wrote his allegrical  tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors havre been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.

The didn't have archives for historians to study. They would make knots in colored strings called quipus to help record the calendar. The first Europeans to meet the Incas were very amazed at what they used to keep a calendar running.       This civilization has ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of Ancient Rome. Clues were left behind from there religion and there culture. Also some paintings were left as clues. Those paintings also showed how their transportation was before.

First the Inca they used color strings to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. The first Europeans were astonished how the Inca could run a large empire using strings to keep records. Some of what we know is from oral history. We also know them because the Europeans that arrived in 1532 wrote them down.        Next the Pueblo-ans. They settled in Mesa Verde in about A.D. 500. They were skilled at making baskets so they were known as basket makers. The types of houses they lived in were pit houses which were clustered into small villages. The cliff dwellers left and settled in New Mexico and Arizona settling with their kin who was already there.        Finally the Pavlopetris. They are a Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. There investigation led to a discovery of over 9,000 square feet of buildings.

They were also known as the Basketmakers for their skill of crafting. They didn't hunt of gather food, they just farmed and grown their food. The Puebloans were very skilled artists. The were so talented that they can create any art out of the difficult land they were living on. The Pueblons also used nature as an advange.       Their has been alot of discoveries about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. The Incan, Puebloans, and Pavloptri had left many artifacts and art behind. Archeaologists know that by discovering artifacts of the Puebloans are very sinnificant because it can tell what their life was like. By discovering the tools worked with, Archeaologists can tell that Puebloans had a farming and crafting lifestyle. This data is very special because its gives us imformation about the Puebloans and the land of where the Puebloans settled at.       Archeaologists and marie geologists says that the sunken settlement was in 5,000 years ago.

It recorded the calender to keep count of the livestock . The Europeans were impressed . Archaeologists found a lot  of the colored strings , but to this day no one know what they mean . Some clues were left behind by Inca's amazing portraits of their religions , art , architecture , agriculture , government , transportation , and way of life . That's how we know about the civilization that ruled a South American empire that revealed the ancient Rome .               Stories from Inca were passed from generation to generation and it was important so we can learn about our communtiy's history in the future . We know them today because Europeans wrote them down in 1532 . They were described as Inca letters and diaries . The discriptions might not be accurate and some of the history were legends . The rest that we haved learned are from sites where artifacrts are found . They might made of stone, pottery , gold . or silver . Many are found for the graves for dead people and ruins of the buildings . Some of the sites were disturbed by treasure hunters or looters ,  and they take anything that might be valuable .            The Spaniards murdered the last king in 1532 and that is when they took over the empire and the fall of the Inca . Archaeologists were really careful to make sure who built each site . They used the most advanced technology in the world to discover more on Inca's precedecessors . We can see how the photos and can help us find the patterns in the ancient monuments . The Inca lived in the Andes and worshiped mountain peaks . Many of their sites are in high places , some of the Inca were buried in caves in the cliffs , mountain tops . This helped the archaeologists perserve the sites , so looters won't get them so easily . It also makes a a little diffucult for the archaeologist because it's a high altitude . They have to carry equipment before they start to go up the mountain . It's really freezing cold up there . The studies of the bodies revealed information about how the Inca lived .

Its very difficult to find things from a centuries ago.          Most of the ancient art are usually dusted or crushed.We know some of the old stories today becuase they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.Many of the discoveries that we have found in the past are possibly still used today, of the way eat,teach,talk,speak,play, and survive.Old clothing was even found, it kinda gave us a sense of style and the way we make clothes today so it can survive longer.Most of the object we find are hidden in the caves, under ground, or up in the high andes mountaines.Sadly the object are ruined except materials that last long like types of metals.         We even found the lost city that was possibly made 1,400 years ago! the town goes up to 30,000 square meters. this discovery had gave up all its secrets,stories and myths from the past.This city have sunked down to the bottom of the ocean.There is no doubt this is the oldest submerged town in the world.There  are older sunken sites in the world ,but non can be considered to be planned towns such as this city becuase its so unique.

'How do we know we learn what we know about the past?' That little part was about 'Archaeology Unlock the Secrets of the Past' by Beth  Gruber.  The Incas were once a powerful civilization and rules but yet member once your on the top, you have to go down. Some of what  we know right know about the Inca comes from their pass generations. This ways were important to our community's history. In 1532 the Europeans came to the empire and written these stories down, the Europeans didn't speak their language as well. so this civilization  has been around for almost a hundred years rule but the Southern Americans. Studying  these clues and data can piece together so we know what goes on in Inca's life. Understanding the Inca's life can be trouble and difficult its like a puzzle you have to go. ''Mesa Verda Natoinal Park Ancestral Puebloans and their World'  another civilization  that also was during somewhat of their time period. A group of people lived in the Four Corners region and have chosen to made Mesa Verde their home. The First Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verda about A.D 550. They learned to make all kinds of objects such as; pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for hunting. Soon later they found put that farming was way better and easier that hunting for food.'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secret.'  So people may say that Atlantis may exist but well how really know that? Divers explore the sunken settlement beneath the waters of Greece.  Scientist try to find this lost city we don't really know what city it is but, it could be the lost city of Atlantis. Locations are near about, soon we will know but i just wanna ask do we really want to know about this lost city/ so many people believe it could just be a  be another joke.'Less than 1% of the ocean floor have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary fin but there is still a lot more down there  that has to be found.'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the most enduring myths.  This myths  can be just myths or they can be a great story to tell your kids or mainly anyone. Maybe soon we can find the truth about one of this stories. Are they stories? Or are they just  a fairytale that could just past the time?     	NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD NNS CC NN PRP RB VBD CC RB TO NNP NNP VBP PRP VB PRP VB WP PRP VBP IN DT JJ .

The question is how did the archaeologists know about the civilization, what made there civilization fall, and how they kept record of livestock?  I'll explain that just continue reading.                     First of all how did the archealogists find about the civilization their were clues left by them like the portrait of their religon.  So how did the lnca kept track of livestock and used as a calendar?  Although  the Inca also had no formal alphabet or writing system.  They used something called a quipus which was a colored strings with knots that indicated the value of the number.  The archaeologists have found many quipus they still don't know what it means (what it was used for).                     Archaeologists need any information they find to study the Inca.  Every single artifact hey find is very important, they have to photograph the artifact and note the exact position.  They need to learn as much information from every piece of evidence/artifact.  The mountains act like a freezer that keep the bodies in such good shape so experts can research them and find the cause of their death.                 The fall of the Inca was on 1532, archaeologists know that because thats when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the Inca empire.  For the archaeologists finding the origins of the Inca is harder because the area they lived in was inhabited by many different people.  The Inca lived high in the Andes and have worshiped many of their sites in high places.  They made pottery, artifacts made of gold, silver, and stone which they found.                 I hope that answered your questions about the Inca and how archaeologists find that out.  I hope that you learned some thing about the Inca by reading this.  so did this help?  did you learn about lost civilizations and how archseologists find that out, by using my Inca example.

Inca artifacts could help with our nation by      turning up in the ruins of buildings. some of the Inca's ancient supply are valuable and   people like to treasure hunters. most important things you lean about is leaning about the civilization are where it comes from and what happened to it.some of the ancient artifacts are really harsh to find out information about our canisters.many archeologists   have called these people Anasazi form Navajo translated to the ancient ones.   we could learn how the people used to hunt, pit-house clustered, make pottery, and acquired the bow and arrow, and weapons for hunting down there prey.the ancient people   could built a home to 50 rooms of units that were together an high rows like two or three.   during the 1100 and the 1300 the population may had reached several thousand. many of the villages had a high number of rooms in there homes.they had built walls with large pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in the mesa Verde. how did they make a baskets? evidence show that the decline tranquility possibly because widespread used of pottery meant less population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. their skills had been past on to generation to generation . throw out the accomplishment in community living and the arts rank among   the finest expressions of the human culture in north America. in the ancient days the people could built tower as like cliffs by hand an mud dirt and wood, water.   they had built firers for cooking warming . in there home they had a hole at the top so that  the fires air of ashes could fly out. many tribes are descendantts of the ancestral pueblo ans of mesa Verde.                                    the lost city of at antis   this city they say that the city had sunken under water off southern Greece.   the myths of the city is that know as the Pavlovian, the sunken settlement that goes back to 5,000 years ago. somee people had information that its in Greece   under the sea. scientists say its hollow water and has a great interest to natural .   its the first time the nearby town of Minneapolis are delighted. the first time e a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that plateau wrote his allegorical   tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Atlantis was a myth but is a myth that keeps   underwater exploration going. less than 1%of the world ocean floor have eve been surveyed.this is extraordinary find but there is still lots more down there that has to be see found.people are fascinated by the ancient artifacts i know i by the Atlantic   city and the Inca's. the lost city makes people see that there is more in the world   .the civilization from the past keeps people thinking.where could it be? the sea level   changes the ground subsidence as the result of earth quakes or a tsunami.as such it represents a frozen moment of the past.

Finding the Lost Greek city was very important because it tells you that people lived long ago. Finding it shows you how they built their walls, how they made their homes. Finding that city tells us how life was for those people in their everyday lives                          Studying the Incas shows us how they recorded data, how they communicated, and lived their lives everyday. Finding artifacts will tells us what they used to cook, hunt, bathe, and use the restroom. Studying the Incas shows us how we improved, how they improved, how they survived, and how they lived. Studying their lives may show us how they worked, what kind of jobs they had, what kind of buildings they lived in, what their homes were like.                         Mesa Verde National Pak Ancestral Puebloans and their world is very important too. Finding this tells us how long people were in North America before Europeans. Finding and studying their lives tells us how they lived and worked to improve their lives. Studying their lives tells us they lived in pithouse from A.D 550 to A.D 750.

If we had questions about their government. we would go back 5,000 years and see who ran the civilization and what did they do to run it.        The discovery of the Inca's civilization was important, because of they way they live, like for example they had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They didn't leave any archives for historians to study. They kept track of the days, by tying knots in colored string to keep track of the date.

Many people could learn from them and see how we humans have evolved throughout the years.  I am going to explain why it is important using the Inca and the Puebloans as examples.            The Inca of Peru, were known to rule a South American empire for almost a hundred years.  They do amazing art work and are very imaginative.  For example, the Inca have created a record calendar using colorful strings to help keep count of livestock called quipus.  You can also see by the way they do their architecture, agriculture, and government.  Some of what scientists know about them have come from stories that have been passed down each generation to generation.  They are still trying to uncover their past by looking at the many artifacts that have been left behind, though some have been stolen, because of its value, by treasure hunters and looters.            The first ancestral Puebloans, meaning 'village dwellers' in Spanish, were found in Mesa Verde at around A.D. 550.  They were known as skilled basket makers that lived in pit houses.  These people have been evolving themselves by changing the way they do things over time.  For example, the thing that they have changed the most might have been their houses and how they would build them differently to make more efficient for living.  They went from the pit house when they first started out, to the kivas in A.D 750, back to the cliff alcoves in A.D 1200.  We can look at them as an example to try and make our lives better by evolving in our own lives and not having to do the same thing over and over again.            History isn't just reading about the things people have done in the past.  I have been hearing students say over and over again, why we have to take it as a class.  It is so we can learn about those people and try not to follow their mistakes if they have one any.  Anyway, history can be fun and see what kinds of things have been improved over time.  Everyday, people have been thinking of great ideas on how to make our life easier, safer, and, and more efficient.  For example, the Inca were smart and imaginative group of humans that used things in a way that we wouldn't have, like the knots of string.  We can see all around us that we can be just like those people that we have learned today to make our future generation better than what we might have now.

Or how they lived, how civilized were they? Well archaeologist have studied many different tribes. One of them were the ancient Inca of  Peru. They are kind of  a mystery archaeologist were very interested in their history. The Inca once ruled an South America empire. The Inca left many clues of their art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their ways to live. Most of what found came from stories they left.                            Archaeologist found many clues that the Inca left behind. One of the were quipus. Quipus knotted colored strings used to keep a record of livestock. One of the first Europeans to them were shocked that they used strings to keep their empire going. They also found letters and diaries from Spanish soldiers and priest who went to visit them in 1532. The archaeologist had to be careful when they read them because they had to remember that the Europeans did not speak the Inca language nor did the Spaniards. Also most of the stories were more like stories then history. Archaeologist found a lot about their religion. They say that they left a beautiful portrait of their god. Some also say that they lived in areas so that could worship they may have praised some mountain peaks.                            The Inca live high up in Andes. They were buried in caves in cliff faces. Some Inca's were buried with their treasure. Some of the Inca believed that what ever they buried them with would go with them to heaven. Many tomb did not fall apart. Most of their thing were in good condition because of the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or maybe because of the cold mountains of the Andes. Archaeologists got most other studies from artifacts. Inca's made most of their artifact out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver like most ancient civilizations archaeologist think. Now it come to the end of the Inca fall.Although they were not able to find the origins of the Inca archaeologist found the fall of the Inca's empire date easily. The Inca empire ended in 1532 because the Spaniards killed the last king of the empire and took over.                               I learned lots about the Inca empire. How t e lived.

It was called quipus, and it was made out of knots of colored strings. The Inca left behind clues of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. Sorties were also passed along down generations of families from the Inca. We also know about earth's past because the Europeans would write down notes and stories in their diaries. Some Inca textiles and clothing have been found too. The Mesa Verde also left clues behind that could have lead to our modern life today. They used to live in these structures called pit houses. The past had people called cliff dwellers because they lived in the sides of cliffs. Fires built in the summer were mainy used for cooking.

Three of these 'lost civilizations' include the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. These three civilizations are significant because they all contributed something important to the human race and proof is rare.        The Inca worked well with things normally used for a simple task such as string. This was very important because this enabled them to make knowledge of a simple resource and use it to their advantage. This civilization was able to keep count of livestock by placing a colored string on them. The Inca also left pottery, stone, silver, and gold behind. This showed that they were skilled enough to find valuable materials, create art to trade, and hide their important things. Inca people were often buried with their belongings. This helped prevent stealing to a certain extent as well as confusion and fighting amongst the other Inca members.        The Puebloans were very skilled builders who built very detailed stone communities. This allowed them to stay safe from outside attacks and were able to move easily and resettle. Having this skill might be important because in case of emergency, they might have had to know an easy way to save themselves. This was also very helpful in the sense of outdoor materials. This lead them to know what they could or could not make a community out of, how well it would work, and how durable it would be. Puebloans produced the finest of expressions of the human race and that made them well known and admired. Kivas might helped the citizens to find an easy place for hunting/fishing which made it easy to feed their community and families. These members were able to make fir which was important because it allowed them to stay warm and welcome the village (source #2).        Finally, the Pavlopetri were skilled in areas such as ceramics and monument structures. Source #3 states: ''We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought,'' This, to me, means that this civilization was very experienced in trade and elegant forms of art from that time frame. This was important because that meant the Pavlopetris were able to trade and move around as much as they wanted. Since the 'ceramics' were found in the sea, that obviously meant they were strong, durable, and hefty which was important for carrying and transporting goods.       For these reasons and many others, I believe the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were important civilizations.

You might say that no these things will not affect me and will not change my everyday life. But you will soon see that this is not true in the following paragraphs. So here is your explanation.            In source number 1, you saw that the Inca's were a powerful nation that even rivaled Rome and lived through many years of prosparity. But you also now think that this will not change everyday life, but in truth it does. If we were able to understand there knotted ropes it cold help explain things like their religion and why the did things and sacrifices the way that they did. In source 2 you saw how the puebloans built architecture and that it has even affected the way we built something today. and finally in source 3 the falling of that village could explain hoe the lost city of Atlantis got started.            These are just some of the ways that history is still affecting us down to this day and why that is important that we study it and understand it. You now probably understand that things of the past still matter today. That is all I have to say for now so until next time, bye.

They have so many similarities and differences. Learning about the past could help you with your life today. The Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are three very interesting groups and I'm glad I got to learn about them.                                                                                                                                  The Inca were very interesting people. They did not have a formal alphabet or system of writing. They kept records with knots called quipus. They made a lot of pottery and art decorated with pictures and colors. The Fall of the Inca was in the year 1532 when Spaniards murdered the last Inca King and took over. The Inca lived high in the Andes and worshiped some mountain peaks. Most of their sites were in remote, high places. This helped preserve the sites because it was more difficult for looters to get to them. It makes it difficult for archaeologists to get to it though. They have to carry their equipment up and down the mountain, and they have to carry artifacts down the mountain for study. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape, the archaeologists could even figure out how the person died!                                                                                                                                                 The Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago, dating long before Europeans explored North America. Puebloans chose Mesa Verde for their home at around A.D. 550 and lived there for more than 700 years. They made elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. They made pithouses In the late A.D. 1200's, they left their homes and moved away. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood.

Why do they even bother trying to uncover ancient secrets about people living in the past? Is it really that important?                 During the A.D period things were both physically and mentally challenging for the Inca's and the puebloans because they didn't have the advanced technology we have today. During their period of time they had to rely more on nature and outdoor resources versus the food markets and clothing stores we use. The reason archaeologists want to know about their past is because they want to uncover how they lived and what life was like for them.                 First, to discover more about the Inca's or Puebloans land they might visit their ancient homelands to discover what kind of terrain they lived on, how good the soil was for farming or they might even try to find any old ruins they left behind long ago. Just from one visit from their lands archaeologists can discover a whole lifetime of unknown secrets .                 Next, archaeologists find it important to discover the past because they want to know the tools they used or to see what materials they used for houses, clothes, and art such as pottery. Again by visiting their homelands if they find any broken pieces of pottery or any tattered cloth they can learn all the materials they used and how advanced their economy really was.                 In the end an archaeologists job is very important because without them we would not know anything about the past and its people. Although, archaeologists have uncovered a lifetimes worth of secrets, their is still so much that needs to be learned.

Another reason the Inca's are important is because they were a very very old ancient civilization which made them fascinating and interesting. Also the Inca's were important because they were able to run a huge empire using strings with knots in them to keep records.          The Puebloans we also an important ancient civiliazation.

The Puebloans are alos impotant because they were the first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde. the Puebloans were a very important ancient civilization.          Another important group was the Pavlopetri. The pavlopetri were an important ancient civilization group because they had lived in a town that has now sunken into the sea of southern greece. they are impotant because they lived in the oldest submerged town in the world.

They play a huge role in discoveries of ancient civilization. The Incas had no formal alphabet system or system of writing. Puebloans are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. The marine geologists that studied the Lost City of Atlantis are known as Pavlopetri.            The Incas did not leave archives for historians to study. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life. Passing on stories was an important way to perserve a community's history. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where the artifacts are found.            This was a very important time for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. They began to built houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud. From here on these people are known as Puebloans, the spanish word for 'village dwellers.' By A.D. 1000 the peopole of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful masonry. walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more.            Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say.

The Inca left clues behind that form an amzing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportaion, and a way of life. Archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life by studying these clues. Some of the stuff we know about them, comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. We know some of the stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1852. The rest of our knowledege comes from artifacts and from the sites where they found. The artifacts were made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Such materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Some of the textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well. Usually they would have been destroyed by dampness, but they were preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.             About 1,400 years ago, before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from the Navajo word sometimes translated as ' the  ancient ones' or ' ancient enemies.' The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were known as the Basketmakers for their skill at the Craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usuall built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff reccess. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl. About A.D 750 they began building houses above gorund,with upright walls made of poles and mud. By A.D 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.             The site straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the Southern Pelloponnesse, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Although discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins     	NNP IN DT NNP VBZ NNP VBP PRP VB IN DT NN WDT IN RB DT CD NNS VBD DT NNP NNP NN WDT VBD DT NN IN NN NNP .

They can help us learn about how people lived in the past, learn about what they wore and how they lived, and they can see where they lived. The discovery of these Ancient Civilizations will help us learn more about them.       The Incas were a civilization that lasted from 1438-1532. They lived in the high mountain tops of the Andes. They also did not have a writing system, but made knots in colored string called quipus. Their ancient clothes have been preserved by the dry deserts and the cold mountains.       The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde and lived in pithouses. The puebloans were very skilled basketmakers. They were formely nomadic, but began to have a settled way of life. They used farming a lot more than hunting. They also aquired the bow and arrow, which was more efficient than the atlal, a spear thrower.       The Peloponnese people live in southern Peloponnese. They lived in a world filled with courtyards, main streets, buildings, rock-cut tombs, and religious. They also found many shards of pottery. They from around 2800 to 1200 BC. The city was then submerged around 1000 BC.

The reason number 2 is so they can get all of the stuff that is educational and will be able to teach everybody how they used to live and there reliogions.

Because of those findings we have gotten pieces or starting points for the basis of our technology. Without some of the Incan's highway system we would not have long highways or messaging systems, and without the Puebloans we would not know how to make sandstone or adobe bricks with a unique morder. History has gave us many reference points and examples to show us how to live our lives and advance beyond our technology.   In 1438 to 1532, the Incans ruled most of what is now South America. They made different veriatys of textiles, pottery, jewelry, and buildings. Later in 1532, when the Spaniards arrived, most of the Incans' stuff where looted or disposed of. Now when archaeologists find these, they can understand more about the Incan life styles. Even now we not only get information about the Incan from their stuff, we also get it from Spanish journals or letters. Thanks to the Incans we got a base for our technology that we have now.\   About 1400 years ago, before North America was discovered and explored, people known as the Puebloans inhabited the four corners. They lived in an area known as Mesa Verde (now Mesa Verde National Park). They mostly specialized and are known for their building methods. They built huge walls, diverse housings, and different types of bricks. When a cowboy discovered these structures, study began on it. Now we understand how they made these bricks and what they used them for.   Poeple form all over the world spend their lives searching and studying different artifacts from different civilizations, trying to unlock their pasts. Most of those findings served as a basis for our technology we have now. Without some of the Incan's highway system we would not have long highways or messaging systems, and without the Puebloans we would not know how to make sandstone or adobe bricks with a unique morder. Thanks to the past we have a better view of the future.

They were very creative they made knots in strings called quipus to keep count of livestock and to keep many records. When the europeans  went over to their land they were surprised with what they can do. Also they left alot of stuff behind like stone, pottery, gold, or silver. The inca found alot of valuable things and wherever the found it and they need some more they go back to that place.Some of those people where disturbed by gold hunters or looters and they would steal and take anything that look valueable to them. People reported to the archaeologists so they can dig it up carefully. The archaeologists studied what they found cause they didnt know what it was or it could be valuable. the inca people live in the hig andes and if one of them die they get buried in a mountains or clif faces the mountains are like a giant freezer so when they put the bodies in there the modern medical can work on them and see how they died. Later in time they settled in mesa verde. people called the puebloans live in mesa verde and they lived in a house called a pithouse clutered into a small village. Also they learned to make pottery, and a bow and arrow to hunt for them some food. People live in pithouses for a long time the pit house contain a storage for many things. After that they build houses that was made out of stone  and they could hold 50 rooms or more. they had a place called the kiva where people would pray for good crops, rain, or luck also they had meeting or gatherings there. there was this othe place called the lost greek city that is now underwater this man go and dive to look for stuff and he can bring stuff back from 5,000 years ago.

The discoveries had also showed us about old fashined pottery and about the clothes they had worn.   They had also discovered some court yards and buildings and tombs and bridges in the bottom of the ocean.

They write down and photograph any artifacts/things they find, and write the exact position they found them in. One of the most important things to learn about civilizatoin are where it came from, when, and what happended to it. This reveals how intelligent people lived along with what they did and how...A few examples are, how they built things such as houses ect. and how things are different from todays world and how things happened back there. Also about their history so we don't make their mistakes again.                The lost city is one of the hardest things to find because it is a myth and its the oldest submerged town (in the world). We have been looking for the lost city for a long while now. And it is one of the WORLDS LARGEST myths.

They show us many diffrent things in many diffrent ways. Here are three examples on how the world has changed and how they have with the ruins and artifacts of ancient cities.                      The ancient Inca city is very important to show what we have evolved from doing and how we have changed. First there from the same place were are in North America. So they show us a lot about ourselves. They were an ancient city that was conqured and vanished into thin air. They left behind many ruins and artifacts about what they did. It gives us history and facts about what they did and how they did things. They sacrficed people for the gods and they worshiped the gods. They showed us how skillful they were and how they made beautiful crafts and showed us languages they spoke and how there everyday lives were.                     They Peubloas showed us a lot too. They were an indian tribe in North America. They lived in buildings know as pithouses. They traveled a lot and hunted for food. They hunted with a bow and arrow. Which is where we get it from today in our lives. They also gathered food. They were skilled pottery makers and still have art in our lives today. They left no written records but there structures are still meaningful and shows there skillful crafts and how they lived on the difficult land. There are still descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde in todays life.                       The ancient lost city of Atlantis still haunts many archeologist. They found an under water city and still today they think its Atlantis but are not 100 percent sure. They do however learn a lot from the culture. They have many things like artifacts and crafts that show the life before us and show what and how they did things. They left behind buildings, paintings, documents and many other things that are useful to ourselves in todays life. They also showed daily life and how to not make mistakes twice. As you can see there are a lot of things we learn from other ancient cities that aren't even here anymore. All you have to do is open your eyes and look for them.

There are a million reasons why we should find artifacts so we can see some that was in the old ages like : mammoths, tools and many many more stuff.We all ways wonder why artifact are important because it helps us to know, how old something is or who made it? Was it humans or animals we will never know what it was.

They are important because they are very amazing finds. In Inca they found very old cloth preserved by the cold mountains of the Andes. It was a very go find sense most of the stuff from the Incas was lost, stolen, or destroyed by the weather.They have found these things called quipus that are made out of knots and strings.There calenders made for keeping track of livestock.     The Puebloans started farming and they lived in penthouse that were clustered into villages. They made pottery and bow and arrows. They lived under cliffs sometimes. They drew paintings on pottery in black and white.   The Palopertri was important because we found Atlantis and people thought it was a myth. Most people didn't look for it because they didn't have the technology.It covers 30,000 square feet of ocean floor.   In the city they found pottery and things with told us things about the civilization.     That's why these discoveries are important.Thank you for reading this article.

It was also places that were there but not here now because maybe it got tour down or destroyed and back then was when they started building thing on top of ground which some or here now and now and then we have different populations.

They didn't have a writen laungage. The Europeans that had came for rthe first time were amazed how this empire could run of nots in string. The important clues that they had left behind are very important because then we have some kind of an idea how these people lived and goverened themselves. The Inca had lived in the high tops of the Andes mountains in very remote places, making it hard to find and have excavation camps. bbut the good thing is that in the colder climates helps presever people that have died and artifacs.      The ancestral Puebloans where masketmakes and very good craftsmen. They lived in Mesa Verde by the four corners. they lived in pithouses and much smaller villages than the Inca did. These people had reached in population to several thousand between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 they than bagan to make bigger houses because of the so many people they had in a village.      In the 1880's many local cowboys had reported cliff dwellers. Archeologists have wanted to better understand these people but the remains are alittle sketchy. Many say that we will never truely know why, and how they lived there, but people still today are looking of answers.

They didnt leave any archives for historians to study. One of the things the Incas did was they tied knots in coloresd strings called quipus, This is the what they used as a calender and they also used it to keep track of their livestock. someof the first people to meet the Incas were Europeans and they were amazed at how huge their empire was and all they did was use strings to keep track of the days and their livestalk. the quipus have been found by many archaeologists but they still to this day don tknow what the knots mean. The reason why is because there is no one that can read how the knots and colorful strings are used to keep the track of time.   A lot of what we have learned about the Inca have come from stories passed on thropugh generation. Some say that the passing of the stories was a way they think that kept the communtiys history. Other then the stories a lot of other things we know about the Inca is from the artifacts that they left behind. Lot of what we have found they think is made of stone.   High in the Andes is where most of the Incas lived. IF not located there then they are located in other remote high cliffs. They found many bodies of them burried in cliff faces. The only bad thing is this brings the job of the archeaeologist up to a more dificult level. The reason why is because they have to carry all of their equipment up the mountain with them making it more dificult to climb.

They help us to figure out where we came from and how it all started in different areas of the world. Archeoligist studied the way of life for the Incas and where they lived and what they wore etc. Archeoligist studied in the high Andes because that is where the incas lived. It is very cold there which makes the bodies that are found icy and in very good shape easier to learn about how they died.        Mesa Verde National Park is where ancestrial puebloans lived.   They lived in pithouses. They quickly advanced in their farming skills and other inventions. There was a problem with the population and by A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted.       The lost greek city was explored by a group of archeoligist and geoligist. These people may want to learn more about the history of these places to learn how we got to where we are now in life.

Livivng in the high Andes Mountain in Peru was a smart idea because no one could get to them and they were isolated until the Spaniards came and took over the empire. The Inca were very smart when in came to keeping track and keeping a good empire; which is why archaeologists are so interested in their civilization.        The reason archaeologists do what they do is because they love finding more out about the past because we can repeat the past but under certain cercumstances we don't because it could put the United States in trouble. The Inca ran a well organized empire and thats what  make them so interesting because they didn't use techniques like other civilizations used in that time period. The Inca tied knots in string to keep track of cattle, crops, food supply, money and many other things, but archaeologists dont know what the knots mean. No one today has any thing to do with the Inca or have any Incan blood in them to help find out more about them.       The Incas aren't the only civilization that archaeologists are interested in finding more about. There are the Puebloans are also another civilization that archeologists are still finding more and more about eveyday. The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde, which means green table, in about A.D 550. They were also known as Basketmakers for their skills and craftsmanship. They did the usual, farming, hunting and gathering as their everyday routine; they lived a more settle way of life. They lived in villages and in those villages were their homes that they called pithouses. They're called pithouses becasue their living room sunk in a few feet into the ground and four corners supported the roof. The firepit had air deflectors and the house alose had antechambers.       These civilizations are all important to archaeologists to uncover the past and the help see what we have in store for the future.

By understanding the ancient cities and looking at their articrafts, we have unlocked so many secrets from our past. Whether its finding temples or lost articrafts, to finding out  how our past generations lived in this world.                One of the biggest purposes of finding ancient civilizations is by learning the ways of our past generations.In the past the Incas knots in colored strings called quips. It was a calendar to keep records of events. By investigating our ancestors methods of living a daily life, we have figured out how we have evolved from that and how we have changed our world.The same with human evolution. We got from apes to educated humans.                 Another reason for finding civilizations from the past is for learning the techniques they once used. The ancientt humans back then didn't have any technology. Today, all we rely on is on technology. For having cars, phones, computers, and you may even be using technology when you don't realize it. But back then how did they survive without using any technology. They used baskets for getting food, spears for weapons, ropes for specific use, and gold for treasure. In Mesa Verde the puebloans used pit houses for relaxing. It was more of a living room for most of them.                  So as we know more about our past, we know more about ourselves and how we evolved from that. Revealing the past is like uncovering the secrets of humanity, and yet humanity is still evolving each day.

Each ancient civilization played a very important key role in the change we have had in technology over time.             The ancient Inca of Peru lived high in the Andes mountain range where the climate would get extremely cold. Each civilization had their own ways of worshiping and had their own beliefs of what one should do with a dead body, whether they believed in the concept of the afterlife or not. In the Inca's case, dead bodies were simply buried in the surface of the mountains where they were well-preserved. When experts discovered these bodies in such good condition, their first question was how these people died and were able to use modern medical scanning equipment to figure it out. This way, medical experts can discover what diseases may have hit the Incas.             The First Ancestral Pueblos of Mesa Verde were formally nomadic but began to lead a more settled lifestyle. They were originally hunters, but evolved to farmers. As they settled, they began to adapt to their new lifestyle and started to build houses called pit houses in small villages and got more crafty since that they had one place to be. They were known for their skills in basket making, making pottery, and acquiring the bow and arrow and spear. By archeologists discovering these ancient artifacts, we piece together how we got the structures of our homes today; where they evolved from and maybe even where we got the idea from to make the modern weapons we use today.            The discovery of Pavlovian, the sunken city beneath the seas off of southern Greece also know for the fable of Atlantis, dates back to at least five thousand years ago. This once lively city takes up 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor and is thought to have sunken around 1000 BC. While marine archeologists dove down to search this city for any lost items that may still be in good enough condition to study, they found roads, thousands of broken pieces of pottery, religious structures, ceramics, and courtyards. These findings can help us understand the religion that the ancient people followed and the use of technology that they already had before us.            Our discoveries of the ancient Inca, the first ancestral Pueblos, and the Pavlovian helps us to figure out where all of our modern day technology started from. Without our findings of all the ancient artifacts, we would be lost in thought about where it all came from. From the way that dead bodies were buried to how their architecture influenced our modern architecture today, the ancient people really did play a key role in history.

How is it thats archeologists make these predictions about the past? First, archeologists are people who study ancient artifacts. Know that you know this, archeologists get sent to a specific location where ancient civilisations were located at. Now they dig up objects that give them clues about how that specific civilisation lived. They look at the material they are made out of, how they are made, and why they are made. Once, they obatain this information they will get how they lived.             Let's take a look at how the ancient Incas lived. Some of these civilisations were located at the mountains or at the coasts of Peru. Knowing the location of the civilisation will give up information about what they coulod've eaten or harvested. also this can explain how they got their materials to creat their clothes and pottery.            Also, another great ancient civilisation was the Puebloans. This civilisation was known for its hunting skills and because they were nomadic. They created an efficient weapon for hunting called the atlatl. This weapon was also know as a spear thrower, which made catching their pray easier.             Finally, an important civilisation thought of as a myth is Atlantis. this civilisation was thought of as a myth due to the fact that people thought cities couln't be floating water. But scientists have found walls and even buildings under the deep, deep ocean. This has many people amazed at how this city was created there, how did they live there and what did they do, and why it end up in the bottom of the ocean.              To sum up, archeologists are making new discoveries on ancient civilisations and will keep finding more. Archeologists might even end up lokking on how our culture worked and what our life styles were like. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB VBP PRP VB RB RB IN DT JJ . WRB VBZ PRP VBZ NNS VBP DT NNS IN DT JJ .

The discovery of the ancient Inca, Puebloan, and Pavlopetri civilizations are important because they provide a look at our past and how people lived thousands of years ago.       The Inca civilization is important because from it, archaeologists can learn about why they lived in the Andes mountains and how they used to adapt to life. The incans were good farmers and weapon builders. Archaeologists have found well preserved bodies, artifacts, weapons, and evidence of crops and farms. From this, the world can learn about how the past used to be and how different we are today.       The Puebloan civilization is a unique discovery and is important because it used to be a well developed and successful society. Puebloans had great arcitectural achievments and tools. Archaeologists have found many artifacts and clues to allow them to be able to solve the mysteries of other civilizations.       The Pavlopetri civilization is a huge deal because it proves that there may be other underwater cities and societies. The civilization is still preserved and allows a look at an old Greek way of life. Archaeologists can relate this civilization to other Greek civilizations and solve clues that they were unable to do before.       The Inca, Puebloan, and Pavlopetri civilizations have allowed archaeologists and the world to know more about our past and what we can do to make our future better.

We have wasted another week of learning for this test that is not helping us with what we should be learning. The state has already taken away two whole weeks of school because of budget cuts. Taking another week out of school because of the test is sending us downhill.   We are the people that are going to be running this country and we are taking a week out of school for taking a test on the computer. We could be learning very important things in English right now. Maybe not English skills, but having open discussions about our world around us, our economy, and different decisions the government has made for our country. How do they expect us to be leaders of the next generation when we are not even learning. We are looking at questions on the computer that are not helping us with what we will need in the future.   We are not getting anything valuable out of taking a thirty question test on a computer. We are wasting precious minutes of learning time. Giving tests to see were the country stands in education is fine, but we are still not one of top countries in education. Other countries dominate us in education. Soon, we are going to be taken over by bigger, smarter, and more equipped governments. And what are we doing about that? We are sitting at a computer taking a test. Good job.

Artifacts founded by archaeolgoists have greatly impacted our society today. As we look back on past civilizations that have come before us, we can identify that some of things that we do to this day have originated from such societies as the Incas, the Puobelans, and the Pavloetries. For example, Incans made knots in colored strings to record the calender and keep count of their. Little dow e know, we could have been using the exact same stuff as them, but in a more advanced and technological way.         In addition, in the article 'The First Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde' the author states that, 'They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow.' We have taken some of the Puebloans' ideas and ways of life and used it in our own lives in a more advanced way that can be more beneficial towards us and what our society consists of.         Another way that we, as Americans have accustomed some of the tools and crafts made by past civilazations are things like houses. In about 750 A.D., Incans began to construct houses of their own by building them above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. Becoming more and more advanced, the civilazations' homes were constructed in a similar way as ours are today. Meaning that we most likely have used their ideas and ways of life and have gone based on that but more advanced in new ways.         All in all, the fact that Historians and Archaeologists have been continually discovering more artifacts and past civilazations is a beneficial thing for our socitey so we become more aware and knowledgable on where we jhave accustomed some tings that we still use today.

As for the Ancient Incan civilization, they contributed so things we use today in the U.S. today and all around the world such as their farming sys. and their art even including their potery. By their ancient tombs and preserved clothes they showed us what material they used to build the structures and what type of cloth they used to make their cloths.But most of all the anicent civilization passed down to us their bizarre myths and legends telling us about their origins,gods, and etc.       The puebloans also showed us many  many thngs we use today. The puebloans shoed us how they made their homes and what type of material it was made out of. Most of their famous work was facinating many people today by their leftover inventions such as the Riva and cliff dwellers. Another is their underground cerimonial chambers wher they buried their dead.       Finally the ancient Greeks of Atlantis.

The Inca civilization gives clues about life today. They had many different artifacts such as quipus that are important because we have evolved from that and developed a number system to keep track. However, the ancient Inca's did not had an alphabet or a number system.         The ancient Puebloans built houses that probaly have influenced todays house building. Todays homes are made up of several differeent materials, but they used to be made up of poles and mud. We may not have shelters today if the Puebloans hadn't began making these houses.        The Pavloperti was an extraordinary towm with buildings, courtryards, tombs, streets, religious structures, and pottery.

Ancient buildings, pottery, and clothes can help us learn about the religion and life of those times. When archaeologists discover artifacts and ruins, they can find their depth in the ground to see their age. The deeper the object, the more time dirt and sand have to cover it. Therefore, the object is older. This is called carbon dating.        Ancient artifacts and ruins help us learn the lifestyle of the people who lived in them. Archaeologists can learn about the general life of people, their government, religion, and the roles of different classes of people.        Ancient ruins may help humans in the future, as we can learn from the mistakes of past civilizations. We may learn both the actions we should make, and how they may help or hurt society.
