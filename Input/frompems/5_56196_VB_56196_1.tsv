He needed to hire somebody cause his boss said that he needed another clown to intertain the kids on Saturday for the big Circus play. If he did hire somebody, all of the other clowns would have to teach the clown to do tricks and everything. That might take a while, so Freddy thought he needed to hire one almost right away.            So, Freddy took a walk down to the park. He took a glance at the park from around the corner. He didn't see anybody from around the corner, but he needed glasses because he had bad eyesight. So he walked farther, until he finally got there. Freddy saw two 2 year-olds, two 5 year-olds, three 13 year-olds, and 1, just one, 18 year-old. The perfect age to become a circus clown. Freddy thought. Even more perfect that there's only one. Fred let out some humour. (if you couldn't notice, sometimes Fred had a bad sense of humour. Fred is short for Freddy so you don't have to say FREDDY. As the other circus clowns said.)   'Hi, what's your name?' Fred went up to the girl that was 18.   'Hi, my name is Meg, do I know you?' The girl replied.   'No, I don't think so, but I was going to ask you something.'   'What was that sir?' Meg said.   'I was wondering if you would like to come work for me at the circus?'   'I would have to know what time and what days it would be on.'   'It would be the whole week. Some days you would be working for long hours but other days short hours.' Fred inquired.   'Yeah, I would be okay with that,' Meg said happily.   'Awesome! The one thing I would have to know from you is what your talent is, if that's okay with you.' Fred announced.   ' Oh, sure. My talent is that I LOVE gymnastics, and I go to practice in Iowa Falls. Crowds of people come to watch me do my fancy trick called THE SPIN. One time Taylor Swift came and watched me. It was the best day of my life!' Meg was excited talking about that.   'Sounds fun, do you want to go home and talk to your parents about it real fast?' Fred said.   'Yeah, be right back.' Meg replied.   'Okay,' Fred responded.            As soon as she got back, she said her parents said yes. Freddy was happy. Then they got to right back to the circus and practice.            Meg was so good at gymnastics that she mastered the new moves she had to learn in no time. Circus clowns were so proud of her and she did great at the big play!                 And all of the circus clowns lived happily ever after!!!!!

If you are in the circus you dont get paid you just do it for fun!        If you are in the circus you get to be a clown and were funny clothes. If you are in the circus you have to be away from home a long time and, you dont see family and, you are always moving to different locations across your country.        I would not be in the circus because I have alot of family and friends it would be hard for me to be without them. I like to watch the circus when it is in town because i see knife jugglers and alot of other cool things. Being in the circus has its upsides and the people in the circus are very lucky.

You have to have lots of skill and talent to live in a circus. Even if your a kid you still go to bed about at twelve o'clock a.m. You have to give up absaloutly everything to become a circus preformer. We interviewed nine year old Loki about how she liked the circus life.        'It's fun but not the easiest job. And you might think you get to skip school because you joined the circus, but you still have to read, write, and do math in a one classroom trailer that comes with us where ever we go. I started doing gymnastics when I was five years old so I am rather good at being a trapize artist. My trick to not being scared even though i'm so high up is to just look at my mom on the other side. My whole family is in the circus but we do not all do the same thing. My brother, Tio, is an assintant clown. He gets to ride unicycles. My dad is the lion tamer. At dinner time we dont get to get to much because we are performing in a little while. We do ten shows a week so when the show is over I am very tired. The show goes to ten thirty p.m. and I go to bed at 12:00 a.m. In a couple of days we head to a different town. You may think it's exciting going from place to place but sometimes I wish that we could just settle in one spot that I can call home.'             As you can see it is not an easy life. You have to do many things to become a circus performer. With the crowd going wild and clapping their hands, you think it would be wonderfull, but ask yourself, do you think that you would want to swich lives with a circus performer?

12	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	H	N	N	M	394958	5	11073886	Y	56196	     Life in a Circus   By: Diego        April 11, 2013                    Things that happen in a circus is crazy like when people perform on tight ropes they have to walk on the rope trying not to fall of the rope. If they fall then everyone will laugh at the person who is doing that trick so that is just one thing and there are more tricks that are harder than that so it is hard. When people perform it is hard because they have to practice lots of times so they don't fail that is why when they do tricks they practice lots of times so they don't fail so practice makes perfect.                     My first reason that you should practice is that when you are on a balance beam you don't fall and get caught in the net when they fall off they get laughed at when they fall. Also when you fall off you might get injured when you mess up or maybe the net is to long and you still hit the ground a little hard. Some people that are on the balance beam they are sometimes blind and have a large stick that is about 10 or 15 or 20 feet long. They have to carry that all the way across the rope blinded. One person did that and fell on the rope which made him sit down on the rope and again he fell off this time. That is why you need to practice all the time so you can master it.                      My second reason is that when elephants go on bouncy balls they have to train them to stand on the balls and they train them to hold each other so they don't fall. They have to keep them skinny so that when they get on the balls the ball doesn't pop right when they are in the middle of doing their trick. The balls that they use to put the elephant on are strong so that when they get on the ball won't pop. The elephants hold on to each other because the elephants can't hold their balance they don't fall on their back or slip to their side. That is another reason why you should practice all the time.                      My Third reason why you should practice is that when clowns fold and twist balloons they have to practice folding and twisting the balloon. When people become clowns they practice before they go out and give kids balloon animals he has to know how to make them and how to do it without popping the balloon in the kids face. When clowns do tricks like the flower that shoots out water when you try to smell it they have to know where he should shoot it. If he shoots it anywhere then he might get the person in the eye. That is another reason why you should practice before you so your act on stage.                                                                                                                                                            Those are reasons why when you go to a circus and sign up for it then you have to practice all the time so that you won't fall or get hurt. Practicing make perfect because if you try to be a juggler them you have to learn how to juggle about five which should be a maximum amount of rings to juggle. So if you mess up them some people will laugh about how you failed or boo at you. That is why you should practice all the time when you try to join a circus.

I jump out of bed and throw on my clothes.       I run to the Pie Car for breakfast. They are serving Pancakes and Bacon. After breakfast I run to the ringmaster for instruction, He tells me I need to feed the animals then practice shooting out of a cannon!   After feeding the animals I slowly shuffled over to the cannon, I was to afraid to get in it.       I walk back to the bedrooms lay down to read a book before I knew it I dozed off, I awaked to the ring masters voice 'Show starts in 5 minutes!' I jumped up and ran to my position. The crowd ran in voices filled the room. The ring master did a flip and landed on the elephant he yelled 'Are you ready?!?!' The crowed roared back 'YES!' Clowns came petaling in and started there act lions roared horns beeped, When it was finally my act I realized I had never practiced for the cannon.       I stared at the huge cannon in fear I approched it and the clowns picked me up without notice and stuffed me in the cannon, The ring master fired and I went flying out of the circus tent screaming. Then I woke up from my dream.                 	PRP RB JJ PRP$ NNS PRP VBP WRB PRP VBP , PRP VBP RB JJR PRP VBD DT NN .

At 9aM you have to go to go to school. At three school is over, and you have a quick break. At three thrity you have to do chores or you have to practice. At six its dinner but they dont get much to eat because they perform after. The show is at seven to ten thrity. We have to do ten shows a week after tooring season they get to go home to their family. You have to travel for 20,000 miles and they visit one hundred and fifty cities, and work from sunup to sundown. Ever dreamed of running away from home and joining the circus. Think do you have what it takes to be an acrobat to treapaze artist. Well if you do than join. Not just ever one can join the circus and become a acbat or trapeze artist. You need to have a specail talent the right body type verydetermined. Thats what you need to be a circus performer and the schele.

I live with a circus group called Magic Wonders Circus. I live all over the world, because we never stay in one place for long. I've been to all the continents, including Australia, my favorite one. I travel every week for 7 months and 14 days. I work from 5:00am to 11:00pm.                Here is a normal day at Magic Wonders Circus:            5:00am I wake, get dressed in uniform and head to pie car for breakfast. The crew at this time is setting up tents, lights, and music for todays show. I have time before school, so I normally go to see Giggles and Bunny-Hunn the clown. They let me play around with their bowling pins and trinkets. We usually, to get excersize, play tag.             8:00am I go to school with the other boys and girls. we learn everything that normal kids learn and how to do some circus acts. Many of us speak English, but all of us now every language there is. It helps us with our travels.              2:30pm School is over. Now we get a 30 minute break. I play with my friends, Ayessha and Herbert. We usually play games with the clowns for awhile. Then we just play our own.              3:00pm practicing and dishes. My daily activities. I am an acrobat. I practice on a trampoline and do tricks on horses. One time my mother fell off one and onto a trampoline. She was not hurt.             6:30pm It is now dinnertime. We don't eat alot before a show. We do 14 shows each week. 2 on each day.              10:30pm The show is over. I am sooooo pooped out! Usually we dont do very long shows. oh well.              11:00pm Good night.

Worried that someone would see my face, (which was covered with bright makeup) looking at them, I quickly ducked back be hind the curtain. As soon as the audience gave one last cheer, I knew that I would have to go on. 'don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be sacared,' I told myself.                    I am Kathrine, and I spend my life at the circus. I work as a acrobat. Every week we have to preform. Every day, we have to practice. I had known I wanted to be in the circus when I was only about four years old. My family and I were at our very first circus together. A clown with a bright smile came up to me and handed me a polka dot flower. I smiled big too and laughed so hard. Then I saw the acrobats. I begged my parents to take gymnastics class. When they had heard enough of my whining and complaints, they finally let me.                    That is how I became an acrobat. I worked very hard, in fact a little too hard. I guess my legs were too straight, or my toes were too pointed, or I was too shakey. It was tough, but when I FINALLY got everything right, my toes were perfectly pointed, my legs were perfectly straight, and I was perfectly still, I was so proud. I congragulated myself and was hoping that that would be my start as a professinal acrobat.                     That was my start as a professional acrobat. Because of that now I am on posters and huge billboards with me spinning on thin ropes wearing sparkly and colorful costumes. And like I told you before, my face had bright makeup all over. 'Thats me!' I think every time we go past one. I fell in love with all this circus buisiness. Everytime it is my turn to be on stage, though I am nervous, I try my very best, and it is absolutly worth it. When I am backstage I always say to my self, 'What am I doing?!' But after, I always say, 'That's so fun, I want to go again!'                     As I carefully and gently walked on to stage, with the bright lights shining on my face, I wasn't scared anymore because I because I believed that I could really do it as long as I try my very best. Trying my very best is hard, but once again it is absolutly woth it. Being in the circus can be tough, but it is also very enjoyable. This is what life is like  at the circus.

I hear Charlie calling as he advertises. My name is Eliza. I'm nine years old and work in the circus with my mother and father. I being love in a circus but sometimes its hard and time consuming.                        The downside is that you have to get up nice an early.... EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS! Another thing is I get homesick a lot of times! It takes me a very long time to do a lot of things. Its like my whole life is circus, circus, CIRCUS! Thats the downside of working in a circus.                            But the upside is I get to work with my mother and father ALL THE TIME! Plus when become 18 years old I get to move out of the circus and live a normal life. But thats my option..... I'm pretty sure I want to move out. Just to see whats it like. I also get to try the concession stand treats all the time. Whenever and wherever.                                           Today is meet the cast day. I'm very excited! Our fans get to meet me and my family and friends. Sometimes fans are mean and sometimes fans are nice. I just have to deal with the mean ones.

37	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	399523	5	11073941	Y	56196	 Hi my name is Alanya.  I work in a circus.  Let me tell you its not an easy task to do.  Well I love to preform and practice gymnastics to help me with my acrobatic performance in the circus.  I wake up on my tour bus at 6:00 and get ready for my day and school.  The most exciting part of my day is see all my friends and all the people at the circus watching me preform.       When it is time to preform I sometimes get scared by look out and seeing all the people just waiting for me to preform.  The my fellow people in the circus give wisdom and im ready to preform.  I do the acrobatic preforming section of the circus.       When im done everyone cheers me on and the little tiger cub comes to me and gives me a huge hug.  By then it is about midnight and I take a shower and take all of the circus make-up.  Then im ready for my next day at the circus.        I wish i could see my family and friends more, but i love prefoming and like my family always says, 'Go put yourself out there and make some huge memories!'

I say this because I like to watch acrobats. One acrobat is Philippa Hayball. Philippa Hayball has loved being an acrobat in the circus because she said she loved to go to many different places and see new faces, she loved to have fun while the whole audience watches her, and she likes to travel with the 100 people that are also in the circus act.                  One reason Philippa like the circus is because she gets to travel and see new faces. Philippa has traveled all over the planet including Japan, Australia and all over North America. Every where she goes she sees new faces.             Another reason Philippa likes the circus is because she has fun while the audience watches her perform. She loves entertaining all of the audience, and doing her job.                One last reason Philippa like to be an acrobat is because she loves to travel with the 100 people she calls her circus family, they are also preforming at night.             This is my way of showing you the life of an circus acrobat and I hope one day you get to see what i am talking about, or maybe you just might be one! 	NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP .

When you first wake up you have to eat breakfast quick because you have to get ready for the morning show.  After you eat breakfast you have to practice for your act.  My act is training lions to jump through hoops.  Hopefully it's not your turn to pick up after the elephant.  After you practice it's time for lunch. all you get is some cheese burgers and fries.                                               Show Time        Before the show the ring master will let everyone know the acts that will be happening.  Once your on your on.  first everyone goes on at once and it's a big fiasco.  You have to make sure you don't bump into anyone or they'll be very mad.  You wait anxiously until it's your turn.  First the trapeze artist are up, then the acrobats, and finally it's your turn. it's hard being a lion tamer, especially when people are watching.                                                  After The Show            After the circus is over you have to clean up.  During the clean up time you literally have to clean up everything.  After you're done cleaning up it's dinner time. you get a big dinner.                                               The Fun Times                   When you're not working you're having fun. You may think the clowns are the most fun you're wrong.  The most fun is the trainers with their animals.  It's fun riding on the unicycles when the clowns aren't around throwing water balloons at you.  The most fun though is climbing the trapeze wire.  I also like swinging on the trapeze swing.                                               Conclusion                As you can see the circus is not all fun and games.  As you have learned  it's mostly work not play I hope you know this before you join the circus.  Even though I have fun some times  it's not allways fun.

We being kids were curies we walked into the tent and we found a man sitting at a table winning like a baby, I asked him what was wrong but I don't think he could hear me over  his sob. He looked up from his crying and said that if he did not get people to see and come to his carnival that he would have to shut down. Me and my friend  had to help him so we got up went back to my house got on my computer and printed out a flyer for his carnival. We went back to the man and told him to get his people ready for the carnival of there life.

He had a big family, he had an uncle,an aunt, a sister, a friend,and of course his mom. Speckle's mom would always tell Speckle and Sam (his sister) not to come out of the mouse hole they lived in.The house they lived in was in a apartment with a women and his children. the women of course was the mom and was known as a scientist, Sam and Speckle were very curious and wanted to out to see the world, or apartment 31.              The very next morning Speckle woke up from a shower going on from a human, he remembered that he was going to sneak off in the apartment, and insisted for his sister Sam to go with him and Sam really wanted to go to and so they were off. Once Speckle took his first step out he spun around in joy and called his sister to come join him. then Speckle thought the kids room was full of toys to play with 'Sam!' he shouted 'lets look in the kids room'. Back at the old mouse house Speckle's mom woke up and she cooked because she thought they were there. soon she was searching for the kids but they weren't there.              Her panicking woke uncle and aunt mouse and tried to calm her down. Sam and Speckle had a wide grin on their faces because of all the toys. they started playing and had a joyful time.Then they heard stomping and they didn't know what to do so they ran and ran back home but then there was a big push of air and a broom was coming at them. it suddenly hit Sam. Speckle was panicking 'SAM!!' he rushed were the human couldn't see them and saw that Sam had a broken leg. he grabbed her and put her on his back and carried her back safely to the mouse hole.  the human was turning all around in confusion, she didn't know were they went. Speckle was relieved that they were okay, but mom was angry she told them not to go outside and they disobeyed. she was bursting with fury and put them both in time-out. Also Sam was hiding her leg so her mom wouldn't get more furious.                         Early in the morning Sam had woken Uncle mouse up because her leg was full of pain and was hurting real worse then yesterday.Uncle mouse got a string of material that was made out of cotton and got a cream to sooth her pain. he put the cream om and wrapped her leg very slowly and he called Speckle to get two sticks to hold her up when she stands. after that the mouse family had lived happily together for the rest of their lives.

You work from sunup to sundown, and have nowhere to call home. You need to have balance, concentrate, and have a specific Skill.       You also need the right body. It also takes a lot of practice too! And you have to travel thousands of miles for performances.   But there is also good things about life in a circus!   You get to travel the world, and meet new people!   And see the audience get   so exited and happy about what they see.   See how thrilled the audience is!   Maybe life in a circus isb't that bad afterall.

Furthermore,you have to be focused and concentrated on what you are doing at all times.Also,always put in your best effort.Some circuses travel the whole globe.you also perform in front of live audience.Being in the circus isn't a joke you have to take it seriously.                     Additionally,people may think its a big joke but its really a big deal to most people.Circus performers work long nights and days and stay away from home a lot.When your are on tour you cant really call people and your are always thinking about all the shows you are going to do.While you are gone you will miss your family.lastly,you have to work long weekends and weekdays a lot.To,close, this is how the circus life is.

At the beginning of the circus I bring out Cutie the Leopard. She jumps through rings of fire and does lots of tricks. One of her tricks is dancing we give her a treat if she does it right.If she ever gets mad or fierce we have to take her back to her cage out back and bring in Sharp, Sharp is Cuties brother he behaves a lot better than Cutie. Cutie is just competitive she always has to be better than everyone else. Sharp just wants to have fun he loves doing tricks but he can't do the ring of fire because got burnt before on the leg and he is just to scared to do it. At the end of their act they will both get a treat. Their treat is kind of gross though because it is a raw bird that you have to lay out in their cage for them.                 After the elephants and dancers are done I get to go out and do my trapeze tricks. I have a partner named Lewie. When it is time for our act we have to climb this 153 foot tall ladder that goes to the top. When we get up there we have to wait for Jimmy the announcer to announce us. When I get up there I just think happy thoughts, because if you don't you might not make it. It happened to me on my first show I got up there and just froze. All I was thinking about was massing up or falling or missing a flip. Since I didn't think happy thoughts I messed up so that's why I think happy thought from now on. Jimmy just announced us first I jump off the podium and flip to the first bar when I get it swinging I do a triple flip to the second bar. Now it's time for Lewie to come in. He glides to the first bar and then I flip to the third bar and he goes to the second one. Then I flip back to the second bar where Lewie is we but I dive for the net under us but we lock legs before I touch the net. Then the bar starts to swing a lot and that's when I flip back to the first bar. And that's when we both let go and fall on the mat.                    After the show when everyone leaves I got to my trailer and go to bed.

First they have a very busy schedule and every day they at least have one. Sometimes  they will be really tried because they haven't slept or ate so you will be just want to fall a sleep. Then they might be tired  On Saturdays you usually have at least two circuses because it is a weekend and the kids are out of school. And the parents are not a work so they can bring them to the circus. Then if they live near the circus were they are preforming they can just walk, bike or go on a shooter and they can just bring there friend if he or she is coming over.   Then they have a busy schedule because they only have like 4 or 5 trailers to sleep in. and it will be super crammed in side even in the pie car were they eat. ?Next they might not have a enough food for every in the circus (even the clowns). Also  I bet there hole family would be doing the circus because you don't usually go to your house because you will be traveling around the world.? Those were some fun facts about the circus.

We make cute balloon animals, honk our big red noses,dress up in colorful costumes,and talk in a weird voice.IT'S THE BEST JOB EVER!We get to travel the world entertaining every summer.We go to China,Brazil,France,Jamaica,Mexico,Canada, and so many more!         We have over 1,000 performers!We have elephants, monkeys, birds, and a whole lot more.My father is a knife thrower.Which means he gets to throw knifes every night in the summer at inocent people.(Well actually just one person, we call him Sojo) Everyone in our circus is really nice.Well... all except for stephan.        My typical circus day is...       rise at 6:30 AM, get dressed, then have breakfast which my dad get's up super early to make for me.Then I go rehearse with half of our circus for that nights show.We only rehearse with half because we don't need all of the circus in one tent.After that we have lunch.Lunch is always curly's decision.(He won't ket us decide).It's usually fried chicken or something like that.We have 2 hours of free time right after lunch.I'm 14 years old so I can walk around and don't need to ask.That's what i do for those 2 hours.After that i have my tutor teach me my math,scisnce,social studies,and literature.Finally we have dinner at 6:00 PM.That's always a suprise.I have a curfew of 9:00.Our show is always at 7:00 to 9:00.That is my day.        My life is the best life anyone could ever wish for!

The next day the mayor sent out people to put up fliers telling that there will be a circus in three days and the tickets will cost four dollars each ,and kids under four are free.So the performers got the news that they had to be ready by that time to perform.The performers practiced until the mayor said that they were going to have to perform tomorrow because he was very busy on the day of the performormace. so now they really neede to practice.                     It was the day of the performance all of the performers were all nervous.All of the adieunce waited until the mayor to say that the performers were ready.Now the performers were all ready to performfirst it was the the clowns came in doing frontflips every were. Then the horses and the ring juggler  came out the juggler started                                       	EX VBD DT NN WDT VBD VBG TO DT JJ NN TO NN IN PRP VBD IN DT JJ PRP VBD DT NN TO VB RP -NONE- DT VBN TO VB DT NN IN PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NN TO VB CC DT NN VBD NNS '' IN PRP VBP IN DT NN '' NNP RB IN PRP VBD PDT VBN RP PRP VBD JJ WRB JJ NNS JJ IN , DT NN NN , VBZ , DT NN VBZ , NN NNS , DT NNS , NN , CC NNP NNP JJ NN DT NN NN IN NNS TO VB RP NNS VBG IN EX MD VB DT NN IN CD NNS CC DT NNS MD VB CD NNS DT , CC NNS IN CD VBP RB DT NNS VBD DT NN IN PRP VBD TO VB JJ IN DT NN TO NNP NNS VBD IN DT NN VBD IN PRP VBD VBG TO VB TO VB NN IN PRP VBD RB JJ IN DT NN IN DT NNP RB RB PRP RB VBP TO NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN DT NN DT IN DT NNS VBD DT JJ IN DT NN VBD IN DT NN TO VB IN DT NNS VBD JJ DT NNS VBD DT JJ TO VB PRP VBD DT DT NNS VBD IN NN NNS DT NNP NNP DT NNS CC DT NN NN VBD RP DT NN VBD

Not just anyone can joinds the circus and become a jugler, tight rope walkdsfer and a clown. You need to practice before even audfitioning to be in the circus. These are the thing that you need to be in the circus the right body to become a tight rope walker, timing if you are a jugler and a GOOD smile for a clown.         The circus is a dangerous place and if you want to be in one good luck.It is dangerous because if you are a tight rope walker you could acciedently fall of and brake a leg or your skull.If you are a jugler and you were jugling sticks with fire and them you could miss one and get burned alive!!!!!!!!!! Last and least if you are a clown you could get make up in your eye and acciedently walk into something and get hurt.          When you are in the circus wake up really early like at 7:00 in the morning and eat breakfast and then go perform all day and probbaly all night to.if you want to be trapeez artis the you need to learn how to bend your body in a weird shape.

Why exactly would it be challenging because you would have to learn a new circus act every day or week. The hard thing is you get up at 7:00 get ready go to school, 9:00 school time, 3:00 School's over, 3:30 chores and practice, 6:30 dinnertime but they don't eat to much, 10:30the show is over they're wiped out ready to hit the hay, and 12:00 they're in bed thinking about the end of touring season.              The circus has all kinds of cool things like circus clowns, acrobats, jugglers, tightrope walkers, circus horses.

Isabella was a smart and nice girl that rarely even got a B so she had a lot of time on her hands when she wasn't studying. Her friends always called her izzy. One day izzy woke up and said she wanted to do something exiting with her life so she got up and went to school.                                                          6 Hours Later            Ring! Ring! 'ok students this is our last day before summer break and your report cards are in your daily envelope.' Says mrs. Goldilocks izzy's teacher. Izzy rushed home and looked at her daily envelope. Yes she got all A+'s but that didn't suprise her but what did suprise her was a bright blue paper that said ' Are you bored sitting at home at reading these papers? Are you 10 or older?' Well izzy was bored and she was 12. so she kept reading the paper, 'Then join a Circus sign up here first class free!' so izzy ran to her mom and asked, 'Mom can I join the circus?'                                                             5 minutes later              'Well honey you can join the circus if you promise you can keep your grades up and be careful' her mother said. Izzy replied 'ok I prromise' so izzy signed up to be in the circus and went to bed.

On tour,you dont really have anywhere to call home and you're always thinking about that night shows,'' says philippa.''I miss my home and garden and i dont see my family.                                                                                                      You have to work a lot of hours and weekends as well.Thats a life of a performer  from a circus its fun to be a performer because you get to travle around the world.Anyone who thinks circus life is nonstop play is crazy.I max know different, i live in big trailer with my family. We travel 20,000 miles in seven months each year, visiting 150 cities.I work from sunup to sundown.I also get a thrill from performing in front of a live audience.''I get to play and have fun every night.its great to see the faces of the audience just jump alive when when i make eye contact with them during a performance.You can see the audience being transported to another world.''You need to have a specific talent, the right body type and be very determined. Philippa,sroad to circus stardom started when she was five years old.I did musical theatre and balletand all kinds of music, singing,acting and everything to hone my craft who also trained in rhythmic gymnastic for years.When i was 11, i knew i wanted to be a performer,so i went for it. I gave up everything else and concentraded on my dancing and performing. there are so many people out there who want to do what you do, that you have to go for it.you have to put your heart into it and be certain that that,s what you want to do.

As the ringmaster, it is my job to make sure that people are doing what they are supposed to be doing.  I also have to help other performers make sure that can do their act.  The lion tamer probably has the hardest   job of any performer because the lion is very dangerous.      In my downtime, I like to help the other performers practice their acts as well as my own.  The juggler is one of the ones I don't help because he sometimes juggles flaming chainsaws!  The trapeze artist also is not someone Id like to help as she flips around and does twists and twirls.  I could seriously hurt myself !  As for my own act, well, that's what this story is about.      When I first joined the circus, I had no act.  The old ringmaster, my father, was about to retire and I never even thought about becoming ringmaster.  I decided to ' try out ' for a clown. Well that was a joke! (HAH HAH!!! Get it,  joke!) Anyway, the clown didn't work out as I  previously said. Next, I thought about being a tightrope walker. That also didn't work thanks to my little slip I had that left me in the hospital for 4 weeks.  After I got out of the hospital, my dad was retired and that meant a position as ringmaster was now open.  I knew it would be imposable for a rookie to get the position as ring master.      It actually wasn't me who got the position but my older brother! (Can you believe it after how hard I've worked! )  So, I got a little angry. Wait. I shouldn't a little angry. I was VERY ANGRY.  I was so angry that I quit the circus.       I know this story is about how I got my job but it didn't happen the first year. Months later, I got married to a beautiful woman. (a.k.a The Trapeze Artist).  After I explained what happened, she encouraged me to try again. So I did.  When I got back to the circus my brother wasn't there. I was happy yet confused at the same time.  The juggler told me he had been diagnosed with spinal stinosis ( did I mention he was a dwarf ?)  The whole circus went to visit him the next day at the hospital.  He was completely paralyzed from the waist down. It was all so sudden.  Moments later, a machine started to make a constant beep and doctors rushed is and asked us to leave. I knew what this meant.   We had go back to the circus and the I was automatically ringleader. Simple as that. But that's not the end of the story. That's just the beginning. A year later we went back to the hospital not because of my brother, but because of our new born child. We named him Dillon after my brother ( who had really died.)  Dillon became the youngest member of the circus. He could ride a unicycle at the age of 3 months. Amazing isn't it.  Sometimes he fell, sometimes I fell when tried to ride to unicycle which was not a great idea by the way.   Our lives felt complete.  We needed nothing else.  That's when the scary thing happened.  Dillon started to throw up constantly.  We were very worried. We took him to the doctors office to get him looked over. The doctor said he probably had a appendicitis and that we should take him over to get an x-ray. Indeed his appendix had ruptured. They had to operate immediately.  The operation was successful but Dillon couldn't ride his unicycle for many months.  We needed another act. Clowns, jugglers, lion tamers. What else did we need? Then I had it.  We need a strongman.   We bought plane tickets all the way to Africa to find some of the strongest people in the world.  Many came to preform but we knew we could only choose one.  One man could dead lift 600 pounds! There's one possibility right there.  Another could bench 800 pounds.  The choice was hard because they both could lift the some amount of weight. We went with the second guy.  He seemed really interested about being in the circus.  He almost exceeded his maximum limit before we had to stop him. We had no choice but to take him.    He filled out his passport to America and started to travel with us.  Great news was waiting for us when we arrived.  Dillon could almost ride his unicycle again.  We were so excited that we threw a party. Everyone came and brought Dillon something. He got a golden unicycle from the juggler.  At the time he was 2 years old and still better than me on a bike.  After the party we had our first show. The next week, the circus was packed with people Everyone had been practicing their acts for weeks and still felt nervous.  We started of with the lion tamer then my wife, them the juggler.  After that we had Dillon do his routine. the crowd went wild and everyone did good.  My act was not only as a ringleader, but as a father, a husband, and a brother.  This was my family. This was my place. This was my life.

It involves dedication and skill to be in a circus.Anyone who thinks life in a circus is easy should probably think again.If you want to find out what it is like to be in the circus then read on.          Being in the circus involves a lot of hard work. You have school,chores,practice then a show! Then by twelve o clock you are just barely getting into bed.          Being in the circus does have good things and bad thing about it. For example you do a lot of tours. So that means traveling and you dont get to see your family as much as you would like to.          As mentioned there are also good things about being in the circus. Even though you dont get to see your family as much your friend who perform with you become like you second cicus Family.Another good thing is you get to visit so many new places and that ties in with school lessons as well.         So as you can see being in the circus is hardwork. Even though there are some downer being in the circus is a wonderful expirence. It involes dedication but it si enjoyabl to go different places, meet new people, and have an enjoyable time performing with friends.

I saw the red nosed clowns, on there unicicles.  And last but not least I heard, just as we were siting down in our seats the magi walk on stage and yell out to the oudiance. ' Welcom ladys and gentalman to the one and only Bellini Circus!'               Everyone stood up in their seats and started to cheer.  During that time, over all the ruckus, the magi yelled.  'Let the magic begin!' All the sudden a guy and a girl flew down to the ceilling from a trapiese twirling and swaying side to side.  Clowns came from everywere, and then lots of red smoke appered when it was gone.  A lion and his tamer came onto the stage while the lion let out a ferocios roar.               Everybody started to ooooooo and aaahhhhh, as the lion did lots of amazing tricks.  Until more red smoke appered and there again was the magi, and he said.  'How was that ladies and gentalmen, give a round of applause for that performance!' and we did until everybody started to file out of the big top.           I will never forget that day will I, I said as I walked out of the big top.

I think joining the circus isn't just fun and hard, maybe it can change your life.            I think the circus is an interesting and weird place to work. I've always wanted to join gymnastics, but I never did. If I join gymnastics I might persue my dreams. Being a gymnis can end up being an acrobat, so if I join gymnastics I would might end up being an acrobat.            If I do work at a circus, I know how hard it is to work at one. To work at one you would have to have a cerain talent. Your talents can lead you to a great job. Working at a circus takes a lot of practice. You'd have to practice your tricks a lot. Working at a circus is a little risky, but if you really want to work at a circus, you should go for it. Working at a circus could be risky because of all the tricks they do. Their tricks are sometimes dangerous.            There are also good things about working at a circus. You get to travel around the world. When you travel around the world you get to travel in a big trailer with your family. The best part about working at a circus is seeing the smile on kids faces when they watch you perform. Some people that work at the circus work there to inspire children.            The circus is really fun. You can play games and win prizes or you can watch the circus acts. If your feeling sad I suggest you go to the circus and turn that frown upside down. When you grow up, you should join the circus.

It might seem fun because of all the cool stunts you do, but those are very hard to do.        As soon as you are done with break, You do nonstop work at the circus until the show is over and then you go to bed. The next day you wake up, it is back to work again.        You don't have any time to see friends and family. Also, you don't get free time to play things like soccer or baseball.         There are some upsides, though. People think you are really cool and people want your autograph. You get to see different places in the world like Japan and Europe. You get to meet many people, too.        As you can see, the circus life is not as easy as it seems. Such as long hours hard performances and not being able to see your family.

It was one of the hardest practes ever because we were in Tenesee. The biggest circus in the world.              My name is jeff franks and i have a family of five. They all our in the circus. This is by far my scariest circus ever. Although I was happy two because I knew I could do the tight rope preety well. Even if I fell there would someone there to cacth me. I was scared for my dad though. He had to do the tight rope and he was not aloud to fall of or else he would get kicked out of the circus. He would get kicked out because he had been praticing since my age and I am only 11.               When we got in and we started praticing people then started to come. Just a bit after an hour of practicing the place was full of people. 10,000 people. There were so many. I went second right after the person who does all the flips. It was then my turn. When i did it I heard a whole bunch of oohs and aahs. That is when I got all relazed. I finished it and I had done well!!!!!! It was then my dads turn. He went across the rope in ten seconds! It was super quick. He didn't even stumble! After all it was a good day!!

First, if your going to be in the circus you have to practice everyday until you get your preforming act right. you have to put a little risk and a little fun in your act, be creative and try new things. if you finish one act try another. make sure your act is a perfect ten and you'll be great.                                         Next, you have to be confident and determind. if you are not confident in your self when you are doing your act something will go wrong. you also have to be determind and brave if you are not you would not want to do the act anymore and the show will not include you.                      Last, you have to be ready for anything. you have to be prepared for the unexpected beacuse what if you have to perform three or more times a day or what if  your performing partner gets sick and you cant perform. you have to be ready for anything and what ever happens, the show must go on.            Clearly, the circus life is not easy, you have to work hard, be confident and be prepared for anything.

When our dreams came true we had to learn acrobatics.We had to do sommersaults which made us dizzy.Then we walked on tight ropes which almost made us fall.My sister and I also got launched from cannons and we got a little frightened.Then we learned something new.                   Training animals.We thought it would be very fun but it wasn't.One of the snakes had bit me while teaching him to play ringtoss but at least it didn't have poison.When my sister was teaching the monkey to swing on a vine,it accidently flopped on her head and ruined her hair.My sister and I were learning how to jump on top of the horses,we jumped on top of them,then they ran through the tent.Then we did something scary.                   Juggling.Well thats not really scary but you have to juggle chainsaws that are on fire.Now thats scary.We also had to juggle balls which were ok and we had to juggle swords which was scary because they could cause a minor injury.Then we juggled torches which also could burn my hand but I finally did.                   When we practice everything it was time for the show to start.When we went to our positions and started they were amazed.A few people got creeped out but gave lots of tips to the usher.When we finished we were wiped out.Then we realized that it is a very tiring job and hard work.Also we learned our lessons on being a circus performer.                                                                                                                            	.

He wanted to be better than Houdini. One day he tried to saw a person in half that really didn't work. The next day he was trying to make a lion dissapear. Ouch!                             After he came back from the hospital he started taking notes at Houdini's  magic shows. One day he was at the mall to get a suit for the magic at the circus tonight. Then he saw Harry Styles and the great  Noahweenie asked him to be in tonight's show. Harry said ''yes'' with a big smile. The great Noahweenie gave One Direction free backstage passes.                             The show was 5 hours left.                              The great Noahweenie was after the lion tamer. He told Houdini who he saw at the mall and he gave them backstage passes. Houdini was enraged he yelled so loud louis popped a eardrum. Houdini was because he was so mad at the great Noahweenie. It was Noahwennie's time to shine.                               He got Harry and cut him apart,but put him back together.There he was Harry was behind the stage while the body was cut open. Everyone was clapping! Noahweenie got teary he was so happy! He was in headlines everywhere!                              He went to Italy, France ,and the U.S. .                               Noahwennie had his own clothes line ,he was popular than Houdini. Then he got married , had 2 kids and lived in  Sacremento and sadly died in car crash.

She wanted to join the circus cause she loved the circus. You had to become a acorbat or a traoeze artist to have the specific talent move. Your body type needs to be very determined. when she was 11 she knew she wanted to become a performer so, she went  for it. She gave up everything else that she did so all she did was join the circus and there was many many peoole at the circus, and there was A lot more people in the world that wanted to join the circus so, you have to put your heart into it to be certin that, so thats's whatever you want to do in your life time.

I stretch, yawn, get dressed into my overalls and head over to the pie car for breakfast.           Oh! What am I thinking? I need to introduce myself! Hi, my name is Ariana Lasnier. I'm not your average 12 year old. I have spent most of my last 5 years touring the world with my family in the circus. I know what you're probably thinking... I'm a freak that can bend into a pretzel on a tightrope. Well, I'm not. Being in the circus is so much different than that. I'm part of the acrobats section. Not to brag, but we do A-MA-ZING tricks while hanging from ropes and so on. Anyways...          You get the point. Now, back to the story. On my way to the pie cart, I realize something. It's abnormally quiet. That's odd...  At the pie car, I sit down at a table and wait. And wait. And wait. Where is everyone? After what seemed like ages, Michelle, our cook arrives.    'Finally...' I mumble, my stomach growling.   'I'm sorry dear, I was in the back helping your mother. She's coughing up a storm!' Michelle apologizes, clanking the pans on the stove.   'W-what do you mean? I mean, she'll be okay for the show tonight won't she?' I ask worried.   'Your guess is as good as mine!' She laughs.         I fake a nervous laugh to cover my anxiety. We can't go on without her! We need her to tame the lion! After a while my eggs and bacon are ready.   'Eat up or you'll be late for school!' Michelle commands.         Well of course I can't go to just one school due to the moving for 7 months each year. Instead us younger performers get home schooled. My mom teaches, of course she would if she wasn't sick.         I rush over to the schooling car. Class has just started.   'So today- *cough cough*- we are going to revise evaluating expres- *cough cough* expressions! Goodness sakes! I'm sorry for the cough!'   My mom exclaims.     'Gee mom, you're really sick! You could rest. We'll just do tomorrows test so you don't have to talk.' I suggest.   'Well, I guess...' She says unsure.         So we take our test then read a book. Finally.... Class is over and I head to the stalls for some chores. All I have to do is feed and groom the horses and clean the stalls. After that I have to practice my routine and then I'm done until the show. This would be easy but my mom can't help. Great. So I decide to do the parts I can, by myself. Like flips, twirls on the rope and so on.         When I finally finish I head over to my moms parlor. There she is coughing and coughing and coughing!    ' You really are sick aren't you...' I say in a hushed voice.   She groans. I'll take that as a yes.   'Who's gonna take your place then?' I question   'Well, *cough* I think maybe we could postpone the show.'    'No! We can't! We are already booked for at least a show per day!' I exclaim. What are we going to do? I thought. Then, it came to me!   'Mom! I could tame the lion!' I say. I regret what came out of my mouth right away, that thing could kill me!   My mom thinks, coughs, groans and finally says 'I need to rest.'         As I head towards the door I think. I guess I could at least try to tame the lion. I just need to suck it up and learn. I turn back to my mother one last time. 'Mom, I'm going to tame the lion.' Then, I leave.         At the lion cage I find Simba- the lion- sleeping in the corner.   'Simba... Simba...' I coo. He growls. Ok. Where is the food?  I scan the room and stop. Over in the opposite corner is raw fish. Yuck!   I quietly shuffle over to the corner. I slowly stick my hand in the bucket. Of course being myself, I fully extend my arm in front of my face and hold it by the tail like a pair of dirty socks. I throw it to the lion. Out of nowhere it pounces over to the fish and rips it apart. Ok I can do this...         After about 2 or 3 hours, I'm finally done with my 'training'. Fingers crossed I don't die tonight. Time to get ready for the show!          I scurry over to the makeup parlor. All they do is powder my face a put on some mascara, lipstick and eyeshadow. Now, my costume is not exactly the most comfortable outfit on earth. It's a short dress with hanging, itchy fabric at my waist. Then, of course, is my tights. Now I look circus ready.         As I jog over to the main tent, I pass my biggest horror of the night. The lion being pushed, in its cage of course, over to the tent. Can you say death sentence? My head is spinning. This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this, that lion will rip me apart! My knees feel weak. I feel dizzy. It's too much! Suddenly, everything goes black.         'Ariana...' The darkness calls.   'Ariana.' Closer, louder this time...   'Ariana!' Out of nowhere I'm snapped back into reality and being shaken by Joshua ( my acrobat partner). My eyes flutter open.   'Oh thank god your awake! We're on in 10 minutes!' He sighs of relief.   'W-what happened?' I mutter.   'I don't know. We found you passed out on the ground a few yards outside the entrance.' He explains.   'Is my mother okay? What about the lion?'    'She's still sick. But we have a substitute performer. Duh!' He laughs.   ' Sub-substitute!? I spent hours training with that lion!' I complain.   'Its fine... Anyways the audience came in and they-' he was cut of.   'It's show time!' My father exclaims in his announcer voice.         We take the ladder up to our ropes. Hanging there we wait for our signal. The lights go out.   'Ladies and gentleman... Welcome, to the Balabam Circus. Pleeeaaaassseeee, put your hands together for our first act of the night, the acrobats!' The announcers voice booms over the loud speakers.   The audience cheers.          I look down at the dirt floor far below us. I take a deep breath and let go of my rope. Swinging by the the rope attached to my feet I twirl over to Joshua who grabbed my arms and flipped us both. Slowly we put our arms out to show my rope is unattached and we are both just hanging by his rope, and we are only attached by a chain in our mouths. I open my mouth to release the chain. The sensation of dropping washes over me, only to be stopped by the swinging bar a hook onto. The crowd goes wild. Around me I see all the girls hanging by silk, twirling endlessly with so much grace. I pull up to position myself to sit on the swing. Only to leap through the air while Joshua swings on his swing to catch me. Again the crowd goes bonkers.          After a moment of them cheering I jump and plunge through the air, flipping over and over again. After a few seconds I blindly spin around. Trying to aim towards the landing mat. I realize I'm off by a foot or two and won't make it to the mat. Suddenly, something slams into me from behind. Joshua. He Had noticed my mistake and altered his path to help me.          I tumble onto the mat trying not to look dazed. And stand with my toes pointed and arms out. The crowd claps and we exit to the back section.         The crowd becomes muffled as a sit backstage.    'Hey uh, thanks for helping me out.' I mutter awkwardly.   'No problem. Hey wanna go get some popcorn?' He asks   'Sure!' I say relieved to get away from the quiet room.         After an hour and a half or so we get ready for our final bow. Oh duh! My mom! She came out and helped with the lion. Anyways, at the final bow I notice someone. Danielle Stone. My heart leaps up my throat. She waved her hand for me to come over after the bow.         I scurry over to her after explaining to my dad a friend was here. Danielle is, well was, my best friend before I started the circus.    'Oh my god! Hi! I haven't seen you in ages!' I shout over the noise hugging her.   'I know! You did awesome! So, how you been?what are you up to?' She smiles.   'Oh nothing. Just, you know, touring the world and such...' I joke.   ' Well about that... I'm joining the circus!Im going to be an acrobat like you!' She exclaims throwing her arms up.   'Really that's great! Well, as much as I'd love to talk I have to go. See you soon.' I hug her once more and walk away. Time for the meeting. I head to the back of the tent         Joshua waves me over to sit by him at our performance meeting. I blush and sit down. I mean, he is kind of cute... Moving on! The meeting is basically reviewing how we did and stuff. While they talk I rest my head on my arm. Although there we some bumps, today was a pretty great day!         	PRP VBP . NNP . NNP . NNP , PRP VBP RP DT NN NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN , NN , NN VBD IN PRP$ NNS CC NN IN TO DT NN NN IN NNP NNP .

The things that I'm going to do at the circus are to train the show animals. I'm also going to be able to make up my own trick, and preform it on an aniaml!       First, I have to make my own trick and then practice it on an animal. The animal I will choose would be a tiger. I've been practicing this trick for about a week. Now I get to finally get to present it in front of everybody! My trick is to jump really high off of a trampoline. While I'm in the air I will do a back flip right onto a tiger!       Next, I have to practice a few more times before the show. 1, 2, 3 and jump, flip and land. Then, my boss wanted me to make the tiger sprint and go upsidown on a big loop. So then I had to wait one more day to present my trick. 1, 2, 3 and jump, flip, land, sprint and loop.        Finally, today is the day, preformance day! As I go out I here the aduince cheering as the spotlight is blazing into my face. I feel presured, but I know that I can do this. I get on the trampoline and warm up. I finally get high enough to flip. As I land on the tiger I yell 'RUN!' At first I was very scared to go on the loop. Then after the loop I wanted to do it again. So I went back to the trampoline. Jump, flip, land, run and LOOP!        My first preformance wasn't so scary after all. I can't wait to do another preformance next time. I wonder if I get to do something crazy next time?

Now that I'm on the circuis topic the craziest thing happend at practice yesterday.       I was practicing my routine when I heard a chain snap and the sound of large feet heading my way. 'LOOK OUT JIM!!' My friend Mike yelled. I turned around sword at the ready and to my suprise, it was only our trained gorilla Curious Gorge.       'AAHHH HAHAH!' Mike laughed out loud. 'I got you good.' 'Don't do that, you know I'm in the moment when I'm practicing.'  At that moment, Gorge started to literally go ape. After he threw a fit he went to the door and pointed outside. I went to investagate and saw that one of the lion cages were empty.          'Good boy,' I said and got him a box of cookies. he went back to his cage and started to work on his cookies. I noticed that the lock had been broken and tracks lead into the main tent. I opened it up there was no lion just one big banner that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIM! After I read it out loud, other people started to crowd the tent. 'What's the matter, forgot your own birthday Slash?' Mike asked. 'Guess so.'

My father died from getting eaten by an animal while training them when I was 6. The performance that I do is acrobating, my mother is an animal walker and she sometimes trains the animals too. Also I have a small 2 year old sister named Mitsy.The circus I preform in is called Le Circe De Lune which means the circus of the moon in French.         A normal day in my life is that I get up around 5:00 A.M so then I can get some practice in before the school. Then at 6:00 I rush to the Pie cart to get a tasty Nuttella crep, which is technically a flat pancake, after that I rush to the school, which is a red wagon. My best friend Enzo waits for me at the door. In school we have tests and homework and weekends and all, but instead it's moving. Usually we learn about the places that we preform at, like right now we're in France.         After 6 hrs. of school I go home to feed my sister, because my mother is working. Then I go and practice for 3 hrs. before the show. After I put on my sparkly leotard and dress Mitsy in her puffy pink dress, and even though she is to young to really preform the clowns use her to do there show. Then I head down to the tent, the people painted my face.         Then as usual I have an awesome preformance and am totally wiped out. After I eat dinner and go to sleep around 11:00 p.m and wait for the day to start again.

This is a story of how I, Isabell Castini, got in the circus! It started out one summer morning. I was getting ready to go to the park when suddenly my dad says, 'Isabell. Do you want to go to the circus instead?' I called back, 'Sure!' So I got ready to go to the circus! I was in the car when my dad asked me, 'Isabell, what would you be if you were in the circus?' I replied, 'Well, I guess I would be an acrobat!' My dad kept driving and said,'Well, Isabell, how about I get you lessons to be an acrobat? This is the perfect age to start!' He says that because im about 11 years old so he wants me to learn how to be something I want to be.                      We got to the circus at exactly 12:00 o'clock. We were just in time! The first act was clowns! I watched the clowns as they happily threw pie in each other's faces! It was so funny! The next act was the acrobats! I was so excited! They did flips and twirls and whirls! I was so amazed! Then after the show was over I told my dad, 'Yes. I would love to take acrobat lessons!' So the next day my dad called the city's office. 'Hello? Do you have any gymnastic lessons or acrobat lessons? I am not sure what they are called.' Asked my dad. 'Yes, all you have to pay is $20 a month.' said the phone lady. 'Okay. When do the next lessons start?' asked my dad. 'Next Tuesday? Okay we will be there!' 'Well?' I asked. 'You may come next Tuesday ok? Do NOT let me forget! This is very important!'                   A week had passed and my dad woke me up super early! 'The early worm catches the bird!' My dad cheerfully said. 'Um...dad? Isn't it supposed to be the early bird catches the worm?' 'Oh. Right.' said my dad as he laughs. 'Well anyways. Today is the day!' 'What?' I asked while yawning. 'You are supposed to go to your lessons!' my dad replied. 'At 7:00 in the MORNING?' I asked. 'No!' my dad says, 'You are supposed to be getting up early if you want to be in the circus like your big sister.' 'Okay. I will try to be more responsible.' I replied.                  Finally after what had seemed like an hour to me (which had only been about thirty minutes.) we were there! I entered the building and the counter lady was standing right there like she had been waiting for me. I asked her what time it was so I would know that she wasn't some kind if robot or something. She said it was 8:00 A.M. 'Okay, so maybe it was an hour.' I said to myself. 'Go right in there.' said the counter lady. As I went inside I saw girls who were probably up since 5:00 in the morning doing flips and really cool tricks! 'Wow! I wish I could do that!' I said out loud. Then a lady came up to me and said, 'Hello there, My name is Mrs. Belini. Are you one of our newcomers?' 'Um, yes.' I replied shyly. 'It's fine we are all family here! you don't need to be shy.' she said. she led me to a balance beam and held my hand. She told me to climb up the balance beam. It wasn't very high and she said she would hold my hand so I climbed up on the balance beam. She told me to try to jump off and spin 360 degrees. So I jumped off and tried to spin and I did! She said that was beginner stuff. I was so happy that I got off to a good start!                  A couple of years passed and I was doing AWESOME! I was now 15 and I knew a ton of stuff about the circus and the Belini Brothers! I was thinking about joining them. Then I knew something was going on. My circus/gymnastics teacher's name was Mrs. Belini! She is their SISTER?! I ran to my dad and told him, and he said he already knew. 'Isabell, she is going to try and get you into Belini Brothers!' screamed my dad. 'What?! I barely know anything about circuses and-,' my dad cut me off. 'It's fine! Do you think that she just wants to do that just because?' 'No.' I replied quietly. 'Then you are fine. She told me that you will be able to see them on Friday. Ok?' my dad told me. I started to stutter, 'Um, but, when? How? Whe-' 'Stop stuttering. you will be fine.'                 A week passed and I was ready! I got up REALLY early and my dad wasn't even up yet. I took a shower and got dressed, and I sat in the living room waiting for my toaster waffle to be done. My dad walked in the room thinking nobody was up yet. He almost screamed, 'INTRUDER! INTRUDER!' 'I woke up early dad just like youi said. Right?' He started to laugh. 'Ok what is the big occasion?' he asked. I gasped. 'You mean you don't remember?! The Belini Brothers? We are going there, remember? So i can audition?' 'Oh yeah!' He yelled. 'Hurry! Get dressed! Take a shower!' 'It's ok dad I already did all that.' 'Ok.' he said.  3 hours had passed and finally we got to the car and started driving.                 We finally got there and one of the Belini brothers told me to go on the stage and audition. I was so scared I could barely feel my feet! So I got on the balance beam and did a bunch of cool trips and flips. Mrs. Belini also taught me how to do the acrobat tricks in the air. I climbed the ladder. Everything looked so small but I saw my dad and Mrs. Belini Cheering me on. So I jumped and did one flip. I grabbed the bar and did flips. I was so amazed that I could do all this stuff! Then the Belini Brothers spoke. 'Isabell Castini!' I thought they were going to kick me out but they just started to laugh and dance. 'We want YOU to be in our circus!' I panicked and screamed, 'AHHHH! I am so happy!' My dad told me 'CONGRATULATIONS!' I packed my things up and said, 'Thank you dad.' I got on the train and left. And that is the story of how I got into the circus!                                                                             The End                                     	DT NNP NNP .

By: Grace Miculian                                      My shaggy long brown hair  touched my skin lightly as if it was scarred of me. My name is Scarlette Defox and i'm an acrobat in the circus. But enough aboust me i have to tell you a day at a circus for me.     I was laying in bed awake starring at the crumbling white paint on the ceiling. I was waiting for Koney Non , a clown, who woke me up to eat at the pie car.     I was wiped out , though i got used to being tired. Today we had a matinee show at 3:00.                      Knock , Knock , knock.      The sound echoed at the door flung open.                                       Koney Non was in the opening of the door already wearing wis make up and clothes plus his red velvet wig.                                   'Sorry , I forgot to wake you up early!' Koney chuckled as we went in my van.                                       ' What time is it?' I asked cunfused.                                        ' Oh its 2:49' Koney whispered.                                 'WHAT!!!!' I screamed juming up off my blue sparkly bed.                         ' Why did'nt you wake me up!' i yelled as i ran to my make up desk.                I grabbed my yellow worn out brush and brush out all my tangles. My hair was done by the time he answered.                                    ' Well they had extra buritos at the pie shop and I ran to get my fair share and then i forgot, then time passed by then i remembered you and got you some snacks' Koney laughed as he took out some crackers.     I jumped up and grabbed the crackers and shoved them in my mouth not caring what the flavor was.    i chewed it all up and it tasted like white cheddar.                   ' I hate you but i gotta say thank you so much I love you!!!!!' I screamed as i went to sit back down to put on my glittery make up.                Koney smiled and walked out my van and closed the door.      I put on my blue eye shadow and then but on eye liner.           I went as fast as I could wlile i put maskera on.\\   It was 2:50 by the time I finished.     On my make desk was a curling iron , but i had no time to spare. I put my hair in a bun and ran into my bathroom.     I looked in the mirror and I did'nt look have bad.      My brown hair looked perfect. But at that moment i knew i could'nt brush my teeth becuase i heard the clock go ding ,ding ,ding ,dong.    Meaning it was 2:59.              Luckily my outfit had been ironed and next to the sink.   I quickly slipped on the dress and tights and ran outside.     It seemed as if the Circus house area was a desert and i was the only one there.      I walked passed the vans and cars then started to run in to the building that we did our preformances.          Why was everybody practiceing I mean we had a show to do but nobody was in the audience.    The ring tosser was ring tossing, the lion tamer was taming and everybody acted as if there was no rush!                        I felt a tight pinch on my back.    It was Koney the Clown.                  ' You know that the show doesnt start till tomorrow!Right' Koney chuckled as he walked to his post.                 ' What!!!!!' I whispered as i walked where the acrobats trained.             So maybe the life in the Circus is crazy , but it is my dream to do it so I will do it. No matter what.

My mom, Melanie, replied,' I know you and your sister, Alexandra, both do.'            We got there soon afterwards and we bought tickets. Then I started noticing everybody was pale. When we sat down inside we saw unicorns. We knew that something was wrong.            We watched the show anyway then they all came after us. We ran to the car and drove home. We were safe at last.

The circus is a dangerous place a lot of people get killed thoughout the circus each year.You have to be strong to be in the circus espesuraly acrobats.Of  cource the circus has lots of  food and drinks. We have cottencandy,popcorn,and funnul cakes.         When we are off on the weekends everybody takes that as an advantage to practice. We pretty much do not get away from the circus.

You can't just join the circus. You have to have a specific talent that is your body type and be determined about it too. If you what to be a circus clown then you have to practice a lot because you might mess up. When your in the circus, you get to travel all over the world. But, you have to go to clown school and you'll meet other clowns from different countrys. The bad thing is when you can't see you family much because the circus goes on at daylight and night. If you want to be a acrobat, you have to take acting and ballet classes.To be a circus tightrope walker, have to be great at being balanced. If your not balanced, you will fall off and thats why you should practice a lot. Circus clowns can fit in a small car, use a unicycles, throw pies, and spray water. It hard to be in a circus because you don't get to see your family and work at night, but you have circus friends.

I have been wanting to be a volunteer if they need one!  The cicus is in Ohio near my Nana  so I invited her to come with us! She said ( I will think about it I might even bring your cousins to!)  I was so excited it starts at 6:00-8:00 P.M., and maybe all of my cousins might be there to!        Now we are on our way to the circus, and my Nana calls she is going to meet us there with all my cousins.  We made it were at the Circus! I hope they need a volunteer because I will be that volunteer! I see my nana with my cousins waiting for us to meet them!  Then we went to go and find a seat with my family. It is about to start! The first thing that happened was the Lions doing there tricks, and while the lions are doing there trick my unkle is doing tricks on a tall rope. I didn't even know my unckle Jhon was in the circus!!!!          That was the last trick of all, and when my unckle chanched he came and saw me before I went back to West Virgina! Then the conductor said ( wait ladies and gentle men there is one last trick for you!)    Then every budy who practice did a show telling us thank you for coming to the circus! When we got home I just could not stop talking about the circus it was so amazing! So this is my story at the circus the end! 	NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NNP , CC PRP$ NN VBZ VBG PRP TO DT NN .

He thought 'I wish I was in the circus.' Then he saw it, an advertisement for an opening at a circus. The boy jumped down from the bleachers and ran away from his parents, that he did not like.         When he got to the car, he asked a man if he could join. The man said yes and handed him a form. He wrote his name, Kingsley Bowton. He then wrote down 'his age'(13). Last, his signature.         Kingsley handed the man the form. He was now in the circus!! But it's not all he thought it was.         The next day Kingsley awoke and went to what is called the pie car, which is where circus members eat, for breakfast. Then he had to go to school. Half the kids there didn't even speak English. The school was a lot like his, surprisingly for him.         After school he played with his new friend, Rudy, then did chores with him, too.

He loved to hear the whistle blow when they came to a town. Today they are arriving in Riverside, Iowa. As they arrive Crazy the clown is getting his balloons and bubbles ready.        When Crazy gets off the train with his balloons and bubbles a big wind comes and starts to blow them away. But just in time an 11 year old girl named Erin catches them for him. Crazy is so happy and thankful that he asked Erin to be part of his act that night. Erin is so excited!        That night Crazy and Erin put on a great show. Everyone cheered.

One time i was a clown it was very silly I had a big set of hair and had make up on me and i had a big shous on my feet it felt like i was a gient but with a small body big feet and goofy clouths on but it was hard geting the makeup on my face. So I asked my frend brian to help me pout it on me so I  can be in a circus.      If i wasint the clown the other people wood have two jobs. at dinner time i ate lusonya  but i cood not have a lot of time to eat or i would have missed the show the show was2:00 houres long when it finished i had to go to sleep if i did not i cood not go to the next show.

I'm an acrobat in the circus, and believe me, it's not as easy as you think. We have to wake up very early in the morning to do our jobs, and we go to sleep very late. We do several shows in over 150 different cities in a year! I travel with my family, and all the circus performers live in one big trailer. My mother is an animal trainer, and my father is a clown.                 Even though we live in a trailer, we still go to school. The   school just travels with us. Believe it or not, our school is just like yours! We have our regular lessons, along with tests. We also use computers. But because circus performers come from all over the world, a lot of my classmates speak different languages. I have always wanted to play an instrument or do a sport, but we never have enough free time to do other things.                  When school is over, we have do to chores and practice our circus tricks. Being an actrobat takes a lot of agility and perseverance. I took gymnastics when I was smaller, so I know how to do a lot of the flips and other things in the job of being a circus performer. In the circus, I still have a lot of friends even though we're not in our real home. We try to adapt to different temperatures, but it's hard because we move around so much.                   Sometimes life is hard for us circus performers, but I know I will always enjoy being an acrobat in the circus.

When the sun comes up that is when we wake up and start our day. We get dressed and go to the pie cart. the crew is setting up the tent and me and all the other kids go to school. It is like a normal school just it can move around the country. The hardest part about school is all the languages I have to learn. The most common language is Russian. We have about 10 Russian families. after school we have a little break before practice so i useally play with the other kids. Now it is time for practice. I am trying to do a backflip off of an elephant and land on a horse. After the first few fails it started to hert. after the 3 hours of practice it is finally time to eat. I eat very little because after that we have a show.

It all started on May 4, 2010, my birthday, I was at my car getting ready for the next trip to Nevada. Then all of a sudden my car started moving. I looked out the window and to my relief we were just leaving early, but noticed my cat was gone. My cat was sitting on top of another car. I hit the emergency button that made all the cars stop,'Screeeech!' I grabbed my cat and we were off again. I thought all the crazy stuff was all done for the day, but I was wrong, very wrong.             Finally we stopped in Nevada for the week and we started to set up for the night. Then suddenly I heard a,'BOOOOMMM' I shot out of my car and ran to the tent. I looked around and saw that part of the stands were lose and fell of. I grabbed a wrench and ran to the stands and started tightening the loose screws. I guess I set an example because then everyone in the circus pitch in. Like I said before there was more in store for me that day.             The show started in ten minutes and everyone was filling the stands. I used to be nevous, but I've been doing this for a while so I was exited. Especially since I learned a new tightrope dance. The show has begun, but something was wrong I could feel it. 'ROOAARR!' everyone screamed in terror. Luckily I learned how to tame a lion in circus school. I finally got the lion back in it's cage and everything was fine. The show was canceled that night,but that is fine because it was a wild day anyway.               Wow what a day. This was probaly the weirdest, wildest,and most wonderful birthday ever.

They decided to go and find and animal. The problem was that the circus had every animal known to be in the circus. They didn't know what to do. They went to Australia to find a kangaroo. The problem was the kangaroo just kept trying to hop away. Another problem was that the next performance was three days away. This was going to be their biggest crowd yet because they had advertised saying they had a new animal.                  The crew decided to go to Africa to find an animal. With one day left. When they brought the cheetah back from Africa, he wouldn't listen to anyone. Every performer tried to tame the cheetah.   During dinner time, our stage manager said that maybe he should try taming the cheetah. He hadn't tamed any animals before but we decided we should let him try. The cheetah was going to our grand finally. When we looked through the curtains, we saw that the crowd was huge. As usual, all the performers and the animals went. Then, it was the cheetah's turn.                   When the cheetah and the stage manager went into the place where the performers perform, everybody was cheering. All of us were peaking through the curtain trying to look. The cheetah was amazing. It jumped through flaming hoops, and walked on three legs. It was the best animal we trained ever. After the spectacular performance, we decided to let the stage manager also be the cheetah trainer.

I had known that she would never be the best in our circus, but I never knew that she truly had no talent. Already a half of the crowd was shouting angrily to Manny, our ringleader, and Monique. Shocked by the audience's response to her part in the show, Monique fled the stage and burst into tears as she ran to her trailer. I couldn't blame her for the audience's reaction. Many times the audience quality changed. In Atlanta, there were many happy people while in Salem, there were many grumpy people. Although most of the angry responses were because of the audience quality, I knew that part of it was because of her act.               Dandrum Circus was a very successful circus until Pansy Lynn quit. Pansy was about the best horseback rider in history. She was the one who wowed the crowd with her amazing horse tricks. To the public, she was known as 'Pansy the Horse Whisperer.' Sometimes Pansy would go to the audience and answer their questions and sign autographs. She loved the publicity. And her horse, Kay. Pansy loved that horse. He was proud, handsome, and Pansy would die for him. Actually, he died first.               Pansy cried her eyes out the day that the doctors declared Kay dead after he died of a disease. At first she refused to work with any other horse and stayed inside her trailer for weeks. Manny talked to Pansy and even sent her to a therapist to help settle her feelings. Pansy came back fresh and happy. It seemed like she had forgotten about Kay. I followed her to the stable when she was picking out a horse to practice with. I saw her come towards a beautiful tan horse like Kay, except it wasn't. 'You look so beautiful,' Pansy said as she stroked his mane,'like Kay.' She paused, making a shocked and puzzeled face. 'Where is Kay?' she said to herself. As if remembering, she sadly walked back to her trailer.                The next day, I heard that she quit. Jose, the circus manager, looked as red as a beet when he came out of the office trailer after his talk with Pansy. I didn't have a glimpse of Pansy that day and never saw her ever since.                We moved to Seattle. I helped post flyers for job openings in our circus. One of the jobs was Pansy's part with horses. Jose sat in his office interviewing many people who wanted a job. I had peeked through the window and had seen Jose's tired face after the interviews were done. It was after dinner and he was about to flip the sign that said 'Interviews in Session' to 'No Interviews' until a teenage girl with purple hair and bright blue eyes ran up to Jose. 'Are the interviews done already?' she asked. Jose looked around. No one else was in line. 'I guess one more is fine,' he said. When both of them went inside the trailer, I slipped back to my own trailer and had a good night sleep.                She got Pansy's part. Jose introduced her to everyone in the circus while we were eating breakfast. 'Her name is Monique and she claims that she is the 'horse whisperer' of this town.' We all clapped. At practice that day, I saw that she was not very good, but I didn't let that worry me. At least until showtime.                Monique ruined her part. She drove the horses too close to each other so that they were practically hitting each other. Then she fell off the horses and tripped herself and got herself stuck in the hay while the horses were chewing her hair. At least there was my part.                After Monique were my friends and me. We're called the 'Birds of the Trapeze.' I jumped and Ellen swang towards me. We caught eachother and danced around our course. Maylee and Lucy joined us. The crowd loved us. Now it was time for the finale. We all grabbed ropes that were in a circle and were somersaulting and changing spots. I've seen YouTube videos of us, and we were really good. Then Aimee jumped in the middle and we became tropical birds in paradise. We landed perfectly on our posts and posed. The crowd cheered wildly and we took a bow. They seemed to forget Monique.                Later that day, Manny told us that we saved the show. Monique had quit. 'If we find another bad performer, I'm not gonna put horse tricks on the show,' he said. We only had a day in Seattle. I wasn't sure he was going to find a replacement. That is, until I saw the long line of people outside the office trailer.

They needed a new unicycle rider  before they're world tour. Ben excepted  and forgot all about his parents  he had a fun time  traveling and playing.Ben also found out that it is also hard and not just all fun and games.       But one day he while he was practicing he  found out the circus was going back to his home town. He thought it would be fun if his parents came. He hadn't seen them in a year. So he invited them to the show he was shocked they  even came.They were sitting in the front row .When he started his performance he got on his unicycle he was starting to go faster and faster then.           He feel to the floor and everybody gasped and crowded around him he was out cold. When he woke up he saw that he was in the hospital.He was wondering  what had happened then the doctor came in and said that it was serious.       The doctor said he tore his acl and said he could not go back to the circus. Ben was devastated he parents were relived and  they said he could go to the circus every time they're in town.

The things that happen in the circus is practicing because if you don't practice you would maybe fall or not do the trick right.The next thing to practicing is to never give up and practice makes perfect so if you don't practice you would never do the trick right and then the audience will clap for the amazing trick you did when you'd practice.       The things that happen in the circus are doing lots of stunts,tricks,and having lots of fun.The next thing to stunts are tightrope walking,juggling,and the circus acrobats doing flips with another people and its a lot of fun when you are a acrobat and know how to do it.That's why stunts,tricks,and having a lot of fun is awesome.       The things that happen in the circus can be very hard because its like school you get graded,report cards,classes,and teachers.You need to do good in school even anywhere else or you will get fired or get a bad grade in your report card and your parents won't be happy about what you did or your teacher might not let you do any of the fifth grade activities.       In,conclusion the things that happen in the circus are practicing for a performance doing lots of stunts,tricks,and having lots of fun.Its also hard to be in the circus because you have to practice every day also its like school,you get report cards,classes,and teachers.THE END 	DT NNS IN JJ IN DT NN VBP VBG IN DT NN VBG NNS IN NNS , NNS , CC VBG NNS IN NNS RB RB TO VB IN DT NN IN PRP VBP TO NN DT NN RB PRP$ IN NN , PRP VBP NN NNS , NNS , CC NNP NNP NNS WDT VB IN DT NN VBZ VBG IN IN PRP VBP RB VB PRP MD VB NN CC RB VBP DT NN DT JJ NN TO NN VBZ TO RB VB RP CC NN VBZ NN IN IN PRP VBP RB VB PRP MD RB VB DT NN RB CC RB DT NN MD VB IN DT VBG NN PRP VBD WRB PRP MD NNP NNP NNS WDT VB IN DT NN VBP VBG NNS IN NNS , NNS , CC VBG NNS IN NNP JJ NN TO NNS VBP NN VBG , VBG , CC DT NN NNS VBG NNS IN DT NNS CC PRP$ DT NN IN NN WRB PRP VBP DT JJ CC VB WRB TO VB JJ POS WRB NNS , NNS , CC VBG DT NN IN NN VBZ NNP DT NNS IN JJ IN DT NN MD VB RB JJ IN PRP$ IN NN PRP VBP VBN , NN NNS , NNS , CC PRP VBP TO VB JJ IN NN RB RB RB CC PRP MD VB VBN CC VB DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN NN CC PRP$ NNS MD RB VB JJ IN WP PRP VBD CC PRP$ NN MD RB VB PRP VBP DT IN DT JJ NN NNP NNP , NN DT NNS IN JJ IN DT NN VBP VBG IN DT NN VBG NNS IN NNS , NNS , CC VBG NNS IN NNS RB RB TO VB IN DT NN IN PRP VBP TO NN DT NN RB PRP$ IN NN , PRP VBP NN NNS , NNS , CC NNP NNP

The next day at school I was thinking of some things for the contest and then it hit me.I should make a good story by having a good plot and beginning,middle and end.That night I started my story about the circus.                                     THE  CIRCUS   The day I was born my mom told me that I wanted to be in the circus I don't no why but when i was 4 they put me in Gymnastics they said it would help my balance on the tightrope.I don't no why they did but i'm glad now because I am a tightrope walker now all thanks to my parents I travel all around the world seeing different sights and beautiful places that I never thought I would see before.       When we reached our destination I saw a bear riding a unicycle wasn't that a sight.When we were practicing I got nervous and almost fell because i've never performed in front of a live audience before.I got so nervous on the tight rope my legs just froze and my legs locked but i caught myself and got back on the platform and got down because i was scared to death that could've put me to my death if i would of not kept my balance.       That night in front of the audience was packed and I saw this little kid about in the 5th grade or so and he was in the front row of the circus.He smiled at me I smiled back and waved he looked like he admired me and that got me across that tight rope.The night when that boy gave me a smile changed my life if that boy wouldn't of smiled I wouldn't be telling this story right now.That circus was about ten years ago and if I could have the opportunity to meet that boy again I would shake his hand that was the circus man's dream now and his goal.           10 years later he made his dream come true and shook the boy's hand for the first time.           15 years later the man died of a heart attack in his basement.   The boy went to his funereal and gave his heart to the old man because the boy looked up to him.       20 years later the boy gave the old man a grave that no one could give him and he buried him in a circus and when the boy died of a disease he got buried right beside his idol.

I quickly scanned though the paper. Right when I got in my moms car I started talking so fast telling her what I hade just read.Finally she told me to stop and slow dwon and start agin. So I did. She asked when it was due and I  probable should get started on it.    Right when I got home I got a big stack of papers, a couple of pencils and I got right to work. Finally my dad and my big brother got home. I asked where they have been all afternoon . My dad sayed he and had to do some cleaning up in his classroom and my big brother said nothing as usally. Then I told my dad about the circus thing. He said that was awsome and asked what my story was going to be about. I said that I really didnt know. The next day at school half of the kids where saying that they all ready had they story done.That night I got my story done and writen the why I whated it. So the next day I tured it in.    The teacher said that torrom they would be telling you won and you would get your ticket and stuff. The next day I dressed a little nicer than what I usally wear.When I walked in for school and went in the gym to sit dwon I saw a lady and a man and are princable. she asked all the kids if she could have are atenten. we obeyed  her commed.Then the man said I will now tell you the winers of the copatenten. Frist from my class was  just a couple of people and me. I was so shocked when they said my name. I think so was ever one else. The man took are picture and said see you to night ladys and gentlmen .    That night I saw lots of people I knew. The same man came out and said please injoy the show .The show was awsome.Frist they had a bear in a twoto dance on a ball , then they had a women walk and ran on a tite rope luckily she did not fall.They also had a women jumb on a hourse backwards and clowns did lots of funny things they also had a lady and a man swing on diffent fabic that hung from the clealing and they would swing to one to the other .They also would hung on each other. Someday I wish I could do some of the things the people did.I wish that the night would have never ended.

Once, there was a circus performer named Chicken Yumyum.  She was a person who was not afraid of any type of snake, so she decided to join the circus.  Back then, people use to dance with constrictors in the circus.  It was all her talent.  So she decided to join the circus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        She was entered in a circus in Tokyo.  There was many trains to pull stuff with help of trucks and ships.  Chicken was the last performer.  Her job was to stand on the horse while sprinting and dance with mean constrictor about 7 feet long.  It was a success!  She then went to Florida to do a huge practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                        While practicing Chicken thought she was going to be the best and most wealthy performer in the world.  However on the newspaper it said that a clown called the floating spirit could juggle on a very thin rope while bouncing on a ball with a monster unicycle.  Chicken got mad and said to herself,'that clown should try a constrictor till he falls of his rope and dies.'She practiced more and more and was going to preform much more better than the last one.  This time she was going to a lot better than her last preform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There were a lot more trains and ships and trucks.  Again she was last which was good.  The Floating Spirit was there that time.  He was on a rope that almost looked like a spider web with a unicycle and a ball while juggling 6 balls.  This time in his preferment he said,'THROW THE RATTLESNAKE.'Someone shot a rattlesnake in the air and he started dancing with it in one hand while the other hand was juggling the balls!  Chicken saw that the rattlesnake was weird and how he juggled and how he unicycles was weird.  Chicken didn't know how to juggle, but she did know she was not afraid of snakes.  She asked somebody who was in charge of the circus materials,'where are the rattlesnakes?'We don't have any rattlesnakes,'said the guy,'but we have corral snakes.'Chicken was confused, but she didn't care that much.  This time she got a 8 and a half constrictor with 2 corral snakes.  She put a unicycle on a horse that was much faster than the other horse.  She was a great success but more people cheered for The Floating Spirit than Chicken.  They through money and roses at The Floating Spirit.                                                                                                                                                                             All night Chicken thought about all the strange things that happened that night.  Then it hit Chicken that the clown was a fake!  There were strings on  the balls and on the clown!  He was also attached to the unicycle!  And there was no rattlesnakes in the circus and the rattlesnake was fake or dead because it never moved! 'Nobody would believe me,'she thought,'but he can ruin my career!'She was doing nothing for 5 minutes and then she had brilliant idea.  She dressed like an untalented person and asked somebody,'when and where is The Floating Spirit's next preferment?'The guy replied.' America, Main, Tuesday April 21, 9:30 pm.'That is where and when Chicken left.                                                                                                                                                                Chicken borrowed a spot light and went into the tent.  While 'The Great Floating spirit' was doing his fake moves Chicken aimed the spot light above the clowns head and turned it on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It showed the lines above his head and then everybody started shouting BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! and started shouting CHICKEN YUMYUM!                                                                                                                                                                       In conclusion, Chicken Yumyum died after a corral snake bit her and fell of a tight rope and was constricted by an anaconda about 16 feet long.  However, she was the most famous circus performer in history.

My name is Lola Hoptree and this my life in a circus.I live in a big trailer with my family , and some circus performs.Every day different for me, because I travel to different places every day.                  A typical day for me is not like yours. I wake up at 5:25 A.M, get dressed, brush my teeth, and I go eat some food.Later, the performers and my family get ready for the big show.I put on my neon costume, and practice my tightrope walking for tonight.Am trying to walk on my hands, but my dad said it's to dangerous.Also, I have been learning gymnastics.My mom does acrobats with my dad.And my sister is a juggler.We all practice are talents in the circus sometimes even play around.me and my sister love to play around.            Sometimes it's fun being in a circus and all,but sometimes i miss my old school, and my old friends.I like being in the circus, but I miss my old house, and my old dog.I mean we travel everywhere and sometimes if were lucky we get to go back to California and visit my grandma and grandpa.Me and my little brother love to go to my grandma's house ,because it brings back so many memories.Also it's like the first time i can go outside without people asking me to take pictures with them.I can play with my cousins and see my uncles.               I love performing in front of people. One, because I get smiles, and people laughing at our performances, and two when I perform i see people amazed of what i did.I love performing in front of hundredthsof people.Also when I see their faces it makes want to do this more.I never want to stop performing its somthing i love and always want to do.And, I'm sure my family members feel the same way to.                                                                                                                                                                                                     As you can see, being in a circus is hard, but fun at the same time. And I always want keep on doing it.

I'm still not a real clown I'm being trained by Bobo the clown. One day Bobo tells me to get Momo his pet monkey, but when I go to the cages all the animals are gone. The circus master thinks that I did it so he told me if all the animals aren't back by midnight he's going to kick me out of the circus.         First I try to find all the small animals, but when I thought I got all of them I founded out I was missing Momo. I decided to find Momo later and go for the bigger animals. The bigger animals were easyier then I thought they were. It all came up to Momo to decide if I can stay. It was five minutes before midnight and I didn't know what to do.         I was on my way to the master when I heard something. The look on his face when I told him Momo was under his hat was incredible. He told me since I found all the animals I can stay. Bobo was so proud of me he told me now I'm a real clown. And to think all this because Momo.

In order to be on a circus,you'll have to have talent. I am good at juggling. So one day I got ready. All performers need to wake up early and get ready so I got ready at 7:00 A.M in the morning. Then I went to the pie car, where circus performers eat. And I ate there. The food is delicious.                                                          Then, after I ate, I went to the circus and knew that I had the chance to travel around the world with my talent. This was my chance to show the people what I can do like juggling. I knew I had to work all day and spend a lot of time away from home. So I practiced and practiced until I can do it and I was juggling. I was so happy and I wanted to show the people what I can do so bad. So I practiced and practiced.                                   I knew I can do it but I just kept on practicing and practicing. Then it was time for the show but I was scared and shy. I have not been in front of a lot of people. The people that work there told me that it is going to be all right. And I felt more better. Then it was time and the person that calls my name and my group called us and we performed. I didn't want to go but I had no choice.                               I was so happy and so glad. It was the best time of my life. I love being a juggler and love being a circus performer. There is a lot jobs in a circus but I like juggling so I wanted to be a circus performer. After I performed, I wanted my family here. I miss my family. Circusis are fun and exciting. I love to be a circus performer. In conclusion, a circus isn't like flying fun games, its all about what you like to do and what you're good at.

A circus can look like lots of fun but can be a little hard to work in because you have to wake up early to get dressed. Circus's can be fun to  watch but can be a little stressful for you to work in. One day a girl named Karen thought it might be interesting s she went to search for a circus she can join.               Karen was a curios girl.  So she set off to Massachusetts because she heard their was going to be a circus there soon. She saw the magical circus and looked at everyone do their magical talents. Se was impressed about the way they did their tricks. She said out loud ''I WISH I WAS IN A CIRCUS. She asked them if she can be in the circus. They said sure you may be able to be in the circus.               She decided she wanted to be in the acrobatics because she had been in gymnastics before and knew how to do tricks and flips. Karen was not used to waking up at 7:00 A.M. so that was a big change for her. She loved school, but she did not like how it was taught in the circus classes. She knew two languages very well. Soon they made Karen learn another language she was very happy she got to learn another language. Not long before she realized that she had to go to bed at 10;30 P.M. after her show was over.               Ever since she entered the circus she gets to talk to her family once a week. She was not very happy with her new schedule. One fact she did love about the circus was the deliciouse food trucks. Each day they had a different kind of food. She had her own dance studio where she practiced from 3:30 to 6:30.               At last she realized she really didn't want to be in a circus. Sje loved the way her life was, she really missed the times she spent with her family and friends. Yea she loved the food at the circus but she missed her moms delicious home made food. Now Karen is going back to practicing gymnastics. 	NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBD IN CD NN VBG IN DT NN .

But when it was about a year into performing it started to get a bit boring. I have ben in the circus for about 2 years now.       I am a lion tamer. It is a little bit scarry but i got usted to it. But one day durring the circus my lion bit me and i blacked out. I woke up in the hospital and asked what happened. They told me everything. They had to put him down. I was so sad.       I got out of the hosiptal and still carryed on with what i did. My new lions name was SIMON. He became my best friend. All the extra time i had i would play with him. We would also go out for long walks. Thats my circus life.

'What happened?' Moma asked. 'Papa's favorite horse, Lust, is missing!' Laura cried. 'Oh! That's just terrible! There is no show without Lust. He's the star of our circus you know.' Mama said, pulling Laura close. Suddenly, one of the circus clowns burst into  the trailer. 'The show is about to start Mrs. Cinders. We're all waiting on you.' the clown spoke in a goofy voice. 'Have you no idea that Lust is missing!' Moma practicly screamed.     'Lust is missing!' the clown said, his eyes bulging. ' That's right, and we're not doing the show without him.' Laura snapped. 'I don't know Laura. Not doing the show means losing a lot of money.' Moma said shaking her head. ' What are we waiting for then? On with the show!' the clown smiled, and waddled out of the trailer. 'Sorry sweetie.' Moma sighed as she walked out of the trailer and closed the door behind her.     'Don't worry Lust. I'll find you.' Laura exclaimed confidently. With that said, she grabed her flash light and snuck out of the trailer. The moment she got out she heard rustling in he underbrush. Instinctively she filcked on her flash light and pointed it tward the underbrush.All of a sudden, somebody put a hand over Laura's mouth and draged her into the prickly bushes.     Laura looked up and saw that it was her dad and Lust. 'Papa aren't you suppost to be at the circus, and how did you find Lust?' Laura asked. ' The circus life is so busy that I decided to run away with Lust.' Papa frowned. 'Papa, you could have just told us and we could have stopped our tour. Nobody would mind. All we want is for you to be happy.' Laura said, and hugged her dad. 'Really?' Papa asked. 'Really.' Laura said. With that said, Papa grabbed Lust's reins, took Laura's hand, and walked back to the circus. 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NN JJ NN VBD . '' VBN NNP NN IN PRP$ NN CC VBG PRP IN PRP$ NNP POS NNP NNP VBD .

But if you dont like BIG animals then you should proble NOT go there becasue they have like elefents. And if you are scared of the clowns like i am you dont want to go because there are a lot there. And if you are scarde you are going to get lost then just stay with your parents or dont go antill you have your own car maybe. but i thank you should go befor you are all grown up and you should spend time with your family.

After the show you go back to the tailor get change and to go to sleep.In the morning you get changed go to the pie cart and eat breakfast.When you are done eating breakfast you go and do your moves for the    show. If you work at a circus you are always busy you never have time for yourself.  Even if you work at the circus you have the same hobbies as people who don't work at a circus.       When you grow up things get harder become difficult. School will give you more homework , you learn more difficult moves ,but if you like your job it is fine because you may even learn to make new moves   no one has ever thought of !

Victoria said,' First let me go to the pie car.' Her dad said,' Okay but make it quick.'               Victoria was used to being woken up like that. Victoria's mom said,' Hey, Tori. Nice seeing you up on time.'  Victoria and her family always got up early so Victoria could practice before school.After 3:00 Victoria went right to circus practice .              Finally it was the day of the show.First the clown came and made the crowd laugh. Then the animal trainers and animal tamers.

There are lots of preformers and animals. Some animals that are there are elephants, lions, bears, and monkeys. Also some preformers do acrobats, circus jugglers, tightrope walker, and clowns. It is very fun and exciting at circuses because there are lots of fun activitys and magic! The animals are fun to watch because there are animals doing tricks and having fun. There is also food like hotdogs, cotton candy, and panuts. Some circus preformers travel alot. Some travel 20,000 miles each month!! Thats a lot of traveling!

Animal stunts have to do with sometimes just animals or animals and humans together, either way it is a stunt with an animal in it.Like in the section that i highlighted nex to the section where it says ''3:30 P.M.'' it says all kinds of stuff about what animals and humans do in a circus. Another example of a human and an animal working together is when it says that Bella was working on a stunt where she flips off the trampoline and lands on the horse. That is a stunt with and animal and a human.          Another thing that happens in a circus are circus acrobats. Circus acrobats are very flexible and very talented. They do flips,front handsprings,arials,and a lot more! Thay might be my favorite thing that happens in a circus. I personaly LOVE circus acrobats!          One more thing that happens in a circus are tightrope walkers! They are probably my 2nd favorite thing that happens at a circus.They are VERY balanced and sometimes really flexible! They can do tricks on the tightrope too! These activities are very exciting and interesting and I hope that I can go to a circus soon!

I do the math in my head. That leaves 84 minutes before my performance. Eighty-four minutes before I have to step out in front of the thousand-member audience. This is my first performance in front of an audience and yet I am performing the closing act.               My name is Anastasia Ludovic, but I am known simply by my stage name, Minnie. I am a flame swallower and a lion tamer. Since both my parents are acrobats, I was taught circus skills from a young age. I developed an interest in flame swallowing when I was nine-years old. My parents were reluctant to allow me to practice this act, but now, seven years later, I am a professional flame swallower and lion tamer. I learned how to swallow flame while standing upon a running lion's  back. But I had never done this in front of an audience. And, I get stage fright!               But it is too late now. I hear the ringmaster call out my name. 'Now presenting MINNIE!' he yells. I take a deep breath and step out onto the stage.         Twenty Minutes Later        My act has finished. The crowd is cheering louder than a lion' s roar. 'Encore!' they shout. 'Bravo!' I bow and then after several moments more of cheering, I go backstage where the rest of the crew piles on top of me in a big bear hug. I have never been happier.

First they put posters for the circus. Then the fun begins. Many crowds of people dash into the huge tent. Then the acrobats come and start flying on each other. They are all dressed up as clowns. They paint their faces and put on wigs. Next a lion in a cage comes. A clown puts their face into the lions mouth. They risk their life. If the lion for some reason becomes wild, it might eat the tamers face.

Everyone in the whole neighborhood was excited to hear the news except for one family, the Joyners family. They all hatted the circus because years ago the family's main man tried out for the circus, but he was turned down by the trainers.       The children of the Joyners family always wanted to go to the circus but their farther wouldn't let them.        One day the children ran away from home to live with the circus. The circus trainers made them show what they knew how to do. luckily, the children had been practicing gymnastics and shore enough they were with the circus now 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP , DT NN VBZ VBG TO PRP$ NN .

But before we move on with the story it all started when my Mom entered a contest . Then a week later she a phone call saying that she won and got seven  seats for free to go to many circus any time she wanted and that they don't  expire . Also the lady said we get what ever snack  we want for free!So when i got home my mom had a gathering and made my favorite dinner which is pizza.           After we where finished my mom said she was going to tell us exciting news. So we ate really fast because we were so anxious to now what she was going to tell us . Finally she said 'OK since we are all finished eating  I'm going to tell you the news ' we all blurted out what is it . She Finally said that she won tickets to the circus with free snacks and seats. Also she said i could invite three of my best friends who of course  you know .so i invited them and after that they said the were going to ask their parents. The next day they told me that the all said yes.           So on Saturday we went to the Circus and got front row seats the four of us sat together and watched the tigers jump through hoops  that had fire we all said cool!!!! at the same time which was really funny . Also we all stared laughing because there was a clown  and my little sister Samantha said 'why is that clown so dressed so funny and started asking lots of questions.We all started cracking up even the audience.at last we all had a fun day and i hope u did to hearing my story.

Whether you have a way with animals or you can put your head between your feet. What ever  talent you have the circus needs you. My talent is the way with animals. I look after all he animals and train them. Claws and fangs are no fear to me. The tigers, leopards and lions all trust me. I can ride the horses and the wind sends a gentle breeze to my face. I reward them with apples and oats. The elephants are easily startled and can be soothed with a touch of silk.       Of course the education is provided for all the children. This is the one time I feel like a normal kid. How boring! No pie in the face, no shows ,no animals. No animals.... . At school we lean what every other kid would learn. Math, English,Science,Forgien languges.       After school, I'm am wecomed back by all my animal friends. i practice my skillls. For example, I practice taming the lions. They roar and swipe at me, but become gentle an timid when I throw them a piece of meat.       At the show, hundreds of people sit waiting for the time of their lifes. The show starts and all I remember is an array of  colours and laughter. It makes me smile.

Bella Castini and her family visit about 150 cities a year.            At 7:00 am Bella wakes up get dressed up she go's to her pie car for pancakes and bacon. Bella's crew is setting up the tents and music for tonight show. At 9:00 am Bella went to school because the circus many of Bella's classmates speak different languages french,Russian, and Italian.              3:00 pm school was over  they gave her a brake. At 3:30 pm Bella had to do her chores and practice. Bella feeds, water,and groom. the horses were used for the horse act. Bella is working on leaping from a trampoline into the horses back. I think it takes a balance and concentration.          At 6:30 Bella eat with her family. Bella and her family could not eat much because they were going to perform.          12:00 she went to sleep. if i was Bella and did it everyday i will be really tried. i think the second part is the same. the thing i did int get is that why do they let kids perform. it can be very dangerous.

I think that is the most hardest thing to do because when you are flipping you also have to have balance. Once when I went to a circus when I was little thae lead acroabat had to walk on a tight rope and then jump into a pool of water. When he jumped off of the tight rope he slipped and broke his leg. The fall was like thirty feet into the air. thats why i say it is the hardest.                Anoher thing that is hard to do in the circus is twisting your body. When i went recentlly to a circus with my mom this one group of boys from ages 9 to 17came out. Their names were 'The Bone Crusher Boys. ' They call themselves that becuse they had to twist their bodys around in fuoll curcules while keepin their heads still. On boy came out when it was his turn and he could dislocating his shoulder to twist his arm around and with his hands tied behind his back. his arms went around like 5 times and it didn't even hut him. when their act was over, he showed us how he moved id arms around like that and i was because he could his inner armpit bone pop in and out whithout him hurting himself.                Lastly, the most hardest thing to do is walk on stilts. I say that because the same day I saw the Bone Crusher Boys I saw the people who walk on stilts. One guy had french braids in his hair and he was like 35 years old. He could walk up the stairs with the stilts on and he could jump up and down with their stilts on. Lastly he said you have to have a lot of balance to be on these because the bottoms of the stilts are really small. And that is why I think the Circus is a hard job.

Most people think that our life is just fun and no school, no homework just traveling and games in the circus, but no that's nothing like my life at all. I still have a normal life even if I am in the circus.       First of all, I do have school there are other kids on the circus train with me and we have one teacher. between circus acts we have school and homework. Even though I do live on a train I still have lots of responsibility, including taking care of my dog Fluffy and doing my chores.       The circus takes a lot of work including practicing for 8 hours everyday.I have to stretch a lot especially since I'm an acrobat we're the most flexible in the circus. I almost never get any sleep for example, one time we had a circus that went all the way from 4:00 to 11:55 P.M. and I didn't get to bed until 3:00 A.M. Most kids my age have to go to bed at 9:30 P.M. on the school week.       Being in the circus is also very dangerous sometimes. My best friend Meranda is also an acrobat but her parents work with lions. One time Merandas dad was practicing with the lions and one lion jumped back and scratched Merandas dad it wasn't pretty. But luckily he was trained not to be scared so he didn't panic at all, he acted very calm.       Sometimes I get super home sick, I'm from California but I'm only home for about 2 months and im in the circus train for 10 months. I've been everywhere in America on this train. I've never been out of the country for a circus act but my parents said maybe next year the circus will take us to france. My parents and Merandas parents and some other people are on the circus committee.They make all the decisions for us like which state where going next, and they help set up all the circus stuff.       On the train sometimes if we're bored all the kids on train come and we play different games.some of my favorite games that we play are hide &amp; go seek tag. its super fun escpecially since the trains really long we have many places to hide and run.       Now you can see how my life is, its not easy and all fun and games at all. well actually being in the circus is lots of fun but you know what I mean.It takes lots of work, responsibility,  time and trust but its all worth it!

The clowns have to go out into the crowd and take pictures with them sometimes.People that sells stuff have to go out into the crowd also and give people stuff for money.The people on the stage sometimes relies on you to finish the sentence or song.I like the part where the animal tamers come and teach the animals tricks.Also I like when the beach balls come out.

It all started 27 years ago in a small village called Burritoville. There were circus auditions to join the renown travelling circus called The Burrito Brothers. At the time I was only 7 years old. No person has ever made it into The Burrito Brothers at my age. My special talent was that I could walk on a tightrope.                        I was number 54 to audition. I nervously watched as people were being denied into The Burrito Brothers. My friend Barney was doing an acrobatic performance when he fell of the rope that he was holding on to and came crashing to the ground. He went into a coma.   That injury made me even more nervous.                        34,35,36,37,38,......54.                                     It was my turn. I did not want to go into a coma and i did not want to be denied. I wanted to be the youngest person to ever join The Burrito Brothers. The problem was that The Burrito Brothers did not want very young people to join their circus.                         'Well, are you coming or not 54?' Yelled the director.                          'Y-yes sir.' I stammered.                             As I climbed on to the tightrope I suddenly got butterflies in my stomach as I thought about poor Barney who went into a coma. I put my right foot on the rope and then my left foot and so on.                              I had 3 more steps...2......1.... I made it!!!!! All of the judges were clapping. The director announced, 'Congrats, Jonny. You are the youngest person to ever join The Burrito Brothers!!                                     That was how my career started.

Today, my dad practices somersaulting off a riding horse. im working on leaping on to a horse's back. It takes balance and concentration. Other kids are practicing jubbling or acrobatics. Our neibor walks baby leapords on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.                      6:30 PM Dinnertime! My family and I go to the pie car to eat, but we dont have much time because were preforming tonight. we do 10 shows a week. one each weekday, and a matinee on Wednesday, two on saturday and two on sunday.                 the show is over. Im wiped out. Walking back o our trailer, we passed the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. two days from now, we will be all set up in another town.                        12:00 AM in bed. Im thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be nice to go back to our real home in Florida. When I grow up, will I stand infront of an audience as a circus peformer like my parents? who knows ? The circus is fun, but its a busy and tough life. 	NN WP NNS VBP NN VBZ JJ NN VBZ JJ .

Some good parts are that you get to do some cool stuff. The bad parts are you don't get see friends or family.

I changed from my pajamas to my day clothes and went into the pie car for breakfast. I finish my breakfast and rush to the bathroom and brush my teeth. I go and watch the crew set up the tents, lights, and music for tonights show.       'Melanie, shouldn't you be getting ready for school?', Tony, a crew member asks me. I look at the time, and see that it's 8:30.           'Woops! Thanks Tony.', I say rushing to my room and start brushing my hair.       30 Minutes later, it's 9:00 A.M. I rush out of my room getting ready for school. You see our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any normal school, ours has computers, report cards, and tests. Many of my classmates speak languages such as: French, Russian, and Italian. This is because in the circus life, you travel all around the world. As we travel the world, it's like our geography lessons come to life.        Once school is over, at 3:00 P.M. it's a quick break for me. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I also play with my tiny dog, Noodle. Our trailer is to large for a small pet. I wish I could join after school activities (soccer, football, cheerleading, etc.) But we never stay in one place long enough.         At 3:30 p.m. It's chores and practice. I feed, water, and groom the horses. Tody my dad is practicing somersaulting off a horse. I'm practing spinning off a rope 300 ft. in the air. Everyone says I had guts to agree with doing that trick. (This trick was being postponed until two days from now.) Trainers are working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. Our neighbor walks baby cheetas on a leash. Other kids my age are practicing juggling and acrobatics.          6:30 P.M is dinner time! My family and I go to the pie car to eat. We don't eat much because we have shows every night after dinner. We do 10 shows a week. We have one each weekday; plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on Sunday, and two on Saturday.           10:30 P.M. The show is over. I'm tired and need some sleep. In two days from now we'll be in another country. I was hoping we'd go to Las Vegas, in Nevada. But I highly doubt that'll ever happen. I hopped under my covers and drifted to sleep. That night I had a strange dream about my spinning on a rope 300 ft. in the air, trick.                                                    THE DREAM        My palms were sweaty and I turned to face all the people counting on me, to do this trick. My hands gripped the rope. I climbed the rope, to the top and I felt the rope begin to spin. I gripped the rope even tighter with my sweaty hands. I plastered a fake smile on my face to cover up the fright. I saw the crowd cheering me on and my parents, the crew, and the other performers cheering me on aswell. Without thinking one of my hands let go of the rope. My smile was swept off when this happened. The crowds cheers got louder but everyone elses stopped. Everyone but the crowd had nervousness on their faces. I tried to put my hand back on the rope but the rope was spinning to fast. I finally got a grip of the rope with my other hand. I took a deep breath and my palms got sweaty again. I looked down, and that was the moment I realized I was afraid of heights. My breathes were quicker and my heart literally stopped. My hands slipped on the rope and when as I was falling I heard gasps and 'oh no's!' from the audience. The crew, my family, and other performers rushed to the rope. I closed my eyes tight and was waiting for impact. I slammed onto the floor, with a 'THUNK!' then I  blacked out.                                                 REALITY   I woke up sweating. I saw that my family was surounding me. They all looked worried, I noticed that I was crying. I wiped the tears off my cheeks and rubbed my eyes.        'What happened?', I asked, looking up to my family.          'You were crying and sweating. You were screaming in your sleep.', my sister, Alyssa, said still with a worried look on her face, 'What were you dreaming about?'          'I was dreaming about the rope trick. I was dreaming I fell off and I slammed into the floor.', I said, laying back down.           It was Saturday and my family gave me 'It's going to be okay, nothing will happens' before leaving the bedroom. I rubbed my eyes and got out of bed and headed to the pie car. I ate breakfast and went to go look at the rope.       I looked up at the rope and took a deep breath. I climbed the rope up to 300 ft. I looked down and it wasn't so scary.                            ON MONDAY AT THE SHOW           I looked at the people counting on me. This wasn't a dream at all. I sighed and climbed up the rope. I looked down and felt the rope begin to spin. I gripped the rope tighter and felt goosebumps go up my arms. I didn't realize my eyes were closed until I opened them and the crowd was cheering. I did it. I acomplished this trick nobody else would do. Im proud  of myself.

If you did you think you have what it takes to be an Acrobat or Trapeze artist?   If you want to find out some of the ins and outs of becoming a circus performer Kidzworld spoke with Philipa Hayball ,an acrobat and dancer with Cirque Du Sollie's circus show ,  Quidam.                                         Circus Performers - Getting Started   Not just anyone can go and join the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist.

A lot of thing happens at a circus a lot of kids go there within their family and have fun. In circus their are a lot of treats like cotton candy and more.At a circus there are  animals and candy, soda and more. Also at the circus they have clowns that juggles and circus acrobats that hangs on rops, tightrope walker that rides on a rope with a unacycile, and horses that listens to to a person.circus is a really good place to go on a filed trip. I like going to circus but some times bad things happens like when kids eat to much candy they throw up. But other wise tons of kids and grownups go to the circus and watch people dance and also do tricks. Alot of times when we do not get to go the circus because they all ways go to diffident places like when they go to oakland they only spend a coplue days out herte then they leve.At circus they always have a clowns that maybe when the circus is over the clown may make bloon  animals for the everyone. The circus is a really good place i love it a lot and that is all about circus my favirote thing to watch at the circus is the circus acrobact because it is so exticing to watch them hang on the rope and blance so stright that is why it is my favorite thing to watch at the circus.The circus is the best.

I grew up on my grandmas farm with cows, pigs, chickens, horses, and cats. Her farm was blue and she had a gray silow about 15 ft. tall next to it. She lived in a big yellow house with a nice big porch for summer days. Being on the farm isn't easy, their are lot and lots of chores to do and you still have to go to school all at the same time. I live alone with my grandma because my parents didn't love me or want me so my grandparents took me in and two days after I got there my grandpa died of a heart attack.                Sometimes when I would have to feed the chickens, I would really swing around on the rope, and do cool acrobatics. I loved doing that kind of stuff, it would cheer me up and remind me of my dream to be in the circus.               One day when I was in my room at 6:30 right before I had to feed the chickens, I heard on the radio from my grandmas room that there was an open auditon to be in the circus. I wrote down all of the information I needed and thought of a plan to get there. My grandma doesn't like the circus, so my plan was to say I was going to just watch, when I would really tryout. I practiced my flips and tricks over and over again till they were perfect.              Finally it was the day, the day of the circus auditions. I asked my grandma if I could go and I was right my plan worked! When I got there, so many people were there I couldn't believe it! My turn was up, I was about to burst into tears and run off stage but I kept my cool.             'Ana dear, the phone is for you and I will allow it since well, you can find out for your self.'             'Coming, and o...k?'             I came to the phone and figured out why my grandma said what she did, I won! Out of 3,789 people, they liked me the best! We packed my stuff because I have to move in with the circus I can't just live at home. For my last day with grandma she didn't make me do any chores, the whole day was just fun and games on the farm. I am really going to miss my grandma, she was the only one who ever cared for me and that really means a lot.             It's my first day at the circus and boy what a busy day I have. First at 7:00 A.M. I have to get up and eat in the pie car (food truck for circus people). Then at 9:00 A.M. I go to school, just because I am in the circus doesn't mean I get to skip school. Inbetween 3:00 P.M. and 3:30 P.M. I get to have a break and play arouond with the circus acts and my friends from school. After that when it is 3:30 P.M. I have to practice my act and do chores. Right before the show I eat dinner in the pie car but not much because we have a show after. When my show is over I am wiped out and ready to go to bed. Finally at 12:00 P.M. I get to go to the trailer and plop down on the bed to fall asleep.            The circus is my dream but I miss my grandma more that anything. Life is really hard without anyone to take care of you and love you. I can't wait for the end of our touring season so I can go home to my grandma and spend time with her.

Daphne was getting tired so they all started walking home together. 'Bye, see you all tomorrow.' Said Jenavee. ' Bye', said Velma and Daphne. About 5 minutes later Daphne and Velma bumped into a boy named Fred. Fred wanted to be a part of the circus, and since he has been to one of their shows he asked Daphne and Velma if he could join the circus Velma asked Fred if he could come to the circus tomorrow to show them what he could do in the circus. ' Ya, I can.', said Fred.' Great,' said Daphne.           The next day it was bright and sunny outside. Daphne picked up Velma and they started walking to the circus. Fred was there waiting for them.As soon as Daphne and Velma got there they went to the show tent. Daphne asked Fred what he wanted to do in the circus, Fred said that he wanted to be an acrobat. Before Fred started Daphne called the rest of the group over. Right when Shaggy, Zachary, and Jenavee got there Fred showed them what he could do and the group was amazed, so they told Fred that he could be a part of this circus.           The next night at 6:00 they had to perform. First it was Shaggy the clown, second it was Daphne and Fred the acrobats, third Zachery the juggler, fourth  Velma the tightrope walker, and lastly Jenavee with the circus horses Lucky and Corbus. Every one started clapping.           As you can see being in the circus is a lot of fun but being in the circus is also a lot of hard work.

I felt like an anchor was tied to my neck, dragging me down. I had blueberry pancakes, and bacon. I'm always starving when I wake up. The bacon, crunchy, and greasy. The pancakes, letting out the warm smell of berrry.         I got dressed for school, brushed my teeth, tied my shoes, and walked out the door.  Im always moving from place to place because of my scedual.  There are a lot of many kids I have met in my past.  Most of them are different compared to me. Im pale, and others are dark skined.         I went to school stressed because I was always wondering when Iwas going to move to another school because of my shows.  Today we learned a math lesson and it was pretty hard.         I got home, did my chores, took a shower, did my homework, and got ready for the show.  i was really nervous this time.  It's really weird because I've been doing this for 7 years, and I never ever get nervous.  I tried to get somone or something to destract me so i could get my mind off of it.         I got dressed in this ruby red sparkly dress. My mom gave it to me just a few years ago. I put it on, and went on our way to the circus.  I was waiting untill they set it up.  It was my turn to go. I was super nervous. untill I thought to myself, ' I can do this. Iv'e been doing this for 7 years. I can do it .' I got up on the high rope, and did my trick. everybody clapping in enjoyment. I got off the rope when I was done. ' I did it!' I said aloud.

It was 7:45 I was supposed to get up and be ready by 7:30. So I dashed over to the front door and quickly put on my shoes.                    Once I got to the pie cart my food was still steaming hot the way I like it. I ate my food kinda a fast but, then I slowed down because I started to choke.               I walked over to where that beautiful tent was supposed to get put up, and sure enough the crew was right on task. They were setting up the tent, bright shinning lights and some pretty cool music for tonight's show. Soon it was 9:00 it was time for school, so I said my goodbyes and went on my on way.                     When I got to school the fog was starting to clear up I was so happy that the fog was clearing. The school that I go to is a one room school house but the view that we see is just gorgeous. But, like any other school we have assessments report cards, but there is one thing that is different languages but, not me I speak English.          After school my parents lets me go play with my friends. My parents say that I'm in their hair to much, more like their in my hair too much. After I'm done hanging out with my friends I have to do chores. For my chores I have to clean the horses stables and clean them for tonight's show.             When I am done with that my mom and I make the most delicious supper in the whole wide world. After dinner I get my costume on and do my beautiful makeup. And then it is time for the show.                When I get out there I see over one million eyes.              The show is over and I'm going to go hit the the hay!

Here is a story about the average day at the circus       I wake up today in Tennessee. We traveled there after yesterday's performance. I get dressed and go over to the pie car for my breakfast.We're having bacon and pancakes, which is good, because I like pancakes.       Once we all get our fill, we have to set up the stage with lights and equipment. Then, we work on our training while the kids go to their small-sized school. We also have to take care of the elephants, horses, and all the other animals, along with making sure the equipment is clean enough to use.       We also have lunch in between there, but right now we are having supper. I go back to the pie car for my meal. We only have a little bit for supper because we will be performing afterwards.       When we all finish (which didn't take long, due to our meal size) , we go on stage for the big act. After a couple acts, I come on with the horses. I have them dance around and then I feed them some apples and carrots. Then some riders hop on their backs and I have the horses run around in a circle. My act is done. Me and the horses more off stage and let the other actors perform.       After we're all finished, the audience leaves and we go to sleep. Once I get into my bed, I wish I could tell my family and friends about my great act. I can't do that, though. We don't get to see home very much, so I just go to sleep in my trailer. . . . 	.

Yeah, thats my room and I am a circus preformer I work as an acrobat. I have a couple friends: a clown, another clown, and an elephant. We all play games together. hopscotch, bingo, and dragracing. Yeah we all like t hang out at the pie car.  We all talk about our dream preformer.....THE TIGHT ROPE WALKER! We all want the huge veiw and everything, but the sad thing is... only one of us will get the job... probably the elephant. Than elephant says,'we should practice and the best one will win!.' So that was what we did, practice practice practice. the thing is none of us could do it. So clown #1 got a stick says here so I grab it. Then, I realized it, never trust a clow. all of the sudden it sprays water all over me. and it only felt like water. It was pink paint. Ao thats why I'm in this here tub with pink paint all over my face, not cotton candy from the circus ma'.

The circus is a very crazy job to have you have to do things like practice every day.Get along with your teamates you work with.Also if you dont like being funny and if you are serious then I sugjest that you dont take the job.        The animals in the circus are talented there are animals like tigers,lions,birds,and ect.But circuses are usually during the summer so i would remember to put on your sunblock you dont wanna get sunburned now do you??        Gymnasts in the circus have to work and train alot to be as good as they look and if you are going to do what they do you need to EAT HEALTHY!!!!!!!!!!            I hope that you as a person do the right thing and think about all the things that the circus has and if you will want to particapite.If you like come on over and try out for the job and we will put you on the spot.A circus is a very well deserving job.

Like me I put on some  weard looking wings.At frist I didn't want to work here then after the first day I loved it.    I started working here when I was 15.I thought every one would make fun of me. They said it was cool and they wished they worked here.Then I thought I should ask my boss if some of my friends can come and work here.He said''NO!'' I ask why not he said becaues I new what to do and they wanted someone who can learn  and to remeber. Ok, thank-you though.    The next day I went on my first day to a circus that Iget to peform in. Ilike it and I did good for my first time.            Now I'm retired but I still remeber my times in the circus. I hope when you are older you will do what I did.

She travels 20,000 miles in seven months a year. She works from day to night. Here's what she does when she wakes up: 7:00 A.M. she wakes up, gets dressed, and goes to the pie car for pancakes and bacon. The rest of the crews are setting up the lights, and music for their next show for the night. 9:00 A.M. Is school time. A one-room schoolhouse travels with them while they are on tour. Like any other school, this one has computers, tests, and report cards. Many of Bella's classmates can speak different languages like: French, Russian, and Italian. 3:00 P.M. After school, the clowns let Bella play with their unicycles and with their juggling balls. Then, she starts to play with her dog, Noodle. Bella has always wanted to be on a soccer team, but they dont stay at one place long enough. 3:30 P.M. After she plays with Noodles, she feeds, grooms, and waters the horses that are in the show with them.          Bella is working on leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back. The other children are practicing to juggle and do acrobatics. 6:30 P.M. Bella and her family go to the pie car and eat dinner when their done practicing. They have to do 10 shows a week. 10:30 P.M. The show is over and everyone is tired.  Two more days and then they will set off to another town. 12:00 A.M. Bella is thinking about the end of the tour session. She wants to go home already but the tour isn't over. Bella doesn't really know if she still wants to be a circus performer when she grows up.                                                                       Becoming a Circus Performer            Source #2      Kidzworld spoke with one of the performer about how it felt being in a circus. Her name was Philippa Hayball. She is an acrobat and dancer with Cirque du Soleil's circus show, Quidam. Not just anyone can join the circus, you have to have a special kind of talent. When Philippa was five years old, she was in circus acts already. She did musical theatre and ballet. When Philippa was 11, she knew she just wanted to be a circus performer, so she gave up on everything else and concentrated on her dancing and performing. Philippa has worked all over the planet including, Australia and Japan and all over North America. Circus performers have to travel ont eh road with 100 more people who are in the circus.            Philippa always gets a thrill from performing in front of an audience. She says you can see the audience being transported to another world. There are some drawbacks in being in the circus. Circus performers dont spend a lot of time at home, and they have to work for very long days. When they're on tour, they can't really call anywhere home because they go to a lot of different places. Circus performers are always thinking about the next show. Philippa says that she misses her home and she doesn't see her family that much either. She says that when you're a circus performer, you have to work very long hours and they have to work weekends too.

Well my friend Rose knows that a real circus is harder that you think.            On stage, circuses may look like all fun and games, but Rose knows it's not! Her day begins when she wakes up at seven o' clock. She gets dreasses and heads out to the pie care for breakfeast.            She often has typical food for breafeast. She might have bacon, or cereal. At around nine she goes to school. She has a traveling school with kids that don't speak just one language. Since Rose travels to perform at so many countries and speaks many languages. Her school still has tests, computers, and report cards, but its way more fun!            Three o' clock school is over, and she has a short break. She plays with the clowns, then she trys riding their unicycles. Three forty five is when she practrices for the show. She goes over her routine and then wait.            Six thirty. Dinner time! Rose hasn't eaten all day and is starving. However, she can't eat much because she has to perform.            Seven is show time. She does her stunts, and once again, she was nervous for nothing. Ten thirty show's over. And she has to clean up. At twelve shes in bed, fast asleep.                 Rose has a hard circus life, but it must be fun. I wish we could stay together, but she had her crazy, circus life, and I have my normal, life life.

As soon as the bell rang , the kids jumped out of their seats and rushed home to write a story for the front row seats, and the picture with anyone in the circus.

His mother and father encouraged him to be a trapeze and worked hard always working and swinging.          But when he was seventeen he got his first job as a janitor in the circus each day he would watch the trapeze artists practice gliding through the air.?? But one night after cleaning he climbed up the trapeze ladder and there he was gliding through the air he felt so free and alive. From that point on he did that every night but one night Rita one of the Italian trapezes saw him she thought he was amazing that she told her boss about him she explained how graceful he was and how amazing he looked and from there her boss said to bring him in.           As Gustav walked in he was tense and nervous he knew what he had been doing all these nights after cleaning but he didn't think that his boss knew. He started to sweat so he spit it out and told his boss everything. His boss told him that it was okay and he wanted to see him do it again so Gustav went and did trapeze his boss saw him and hired him right on the spot. Gustav did this every night for 3 years but when he was twenty he left the circus and found a new circus called circus circus h was hired there to. He was working harder each day and then finally it as his big day the day he came to new york city!           He performed his hardest there doing flips and sins and catching the other trapeze artists. That night he as tired and he slept when he woke up he saw his boss and the old circus they wanted him back but then he convinced them to come to circus circus. Now Gustav is one of the greatest trapeze artists ever and still does flips and spins with his partner Frita and he has made Circus Circus one of the greatest circuses on the planet they travel around the whole world showing of there skills such as Gustav and Frita doing flips and twirls and spins and the clowns making everyone laugh and the lions roaring and the lon tamer taming it. The whole circus works hard and they are the most determined. Some other people in the circus would also be clowns, lion tamers, and the acrobats. This is what gstavs schedule would have looked like.       7:00 A.M. Wake up eat breakast  8:00 A.M. Set up the trapeeze stand 9:00 A.M. Practice for 2 hours or so 11:00 A.M.

Well I have. there are circuses everywhere! In russia, italy,north america, and rome. You have to travel 20,000 miles every few monthes! That is a lot! There are also many things to do in a circus. Like acrobaticts, juggling, taming a lion, walking across a tight rope, and riding on elephants.                                                         To begin with, I will be telling you about clowns. A lot of kids think clowns are scary, but really, clowns are just there to entertain kids. They don't have to do much, but ride in a little cars which is amazing but still. Clowns are kind of funny looking. Clowns have purple hair, a red nose, a big tie, big shoes, white gloves, a really weird hat, a painted face, and a colorful suit.                               Another thing you do in a circus is acrobaticts. Acrobaticts is way more complicated than most things in a circus. what you do in acrobaticts is two people hang from a rope and swing around and around and around. that really gets the crowd going.what really interests people about acrobaticts is that they want the acrobats to fall down which is really rude. Acrobats dress in fancy clothing. They dress in white. The boys wear pants and a shirt and the girls wear a skirt and a shirt.That kind of act is personaly my favorite. It's my favorite because I like to see people from a high distance.                                The second to the last thing you can do in a circus is juggling. It takes a lot of talent to do something like that. There are many things you can juggle with. there are bowling pins, fire, chainsaws, balls, and metal rings. fire and chainsaws are really dangerous to juggle. thats why I said it takes a lot of practice to juggle amazingly. Its also embarrasing if you mess up. people don't want to see a bad show, they want to see well preformed show. If I wanted to be in a circus I would need to learn how to juggle because I would mess up badly.                                  The last thing you can do in a circus is to tight rope. Now tight roping takes alot of skill. You can get really hurt especially If you fall off. Thats why before having a job at the circus you practice by finding to trees that are parallel and tie a tough rope to the ends of the rope. If you make it to the end without falling, untie the rope and put it higher than it was before. keep doing that until you get as high as the circus rope. Then before you know it you will be doing that in front of a huge crowd. You will be a huge success.                                  As you can see there is a lot of prosess in being a circus preformer. All you have to remember is practice practice practice every day. In my opinion, I really don't want to be a circus preformor. It takes too much work and too much practice practice practice. You won't get anywhere in life unless you practice                                                                            	NN IN DT NN NNP PRP RB VBN WP NN MD VB IN IN DT NN .

Even with the little elephant incedent.'' Zozo the clown had just finished the show of a circus. Zozo works in the Circus Talents circus. His job is being a funny entertaining clown. His best friends name is Marty, Marty was one of the acrobats. They travel together and perform for the same audiences.         ''Ya, I guess your right. Sure made the croud jump though.'' said a tired and disappointed Marty. Earlier that day in the middle of the show, one of the elephants got a little irrataded because someone stepped on her big soft feet. She had waved her head up and down in the air, and did a big circul around the stadium.          ''You know, I love all the kids and people that come and see us, but being in the circus is a lot more than just fun and games.'' said Zozo.   Zozo was right, not everyone is perfect, performers are just normal people with a dream come true. Right after he said that Marty was fast asleep. Just then Zozo recalled how he first got into the Circus Talents.           When he was a boy all his friends would call him Zozo the clown because his name was Zack. He always made his friends laugh and have a good time. That was his goal in life. Too make kids and adults laugh.   When Zozo started working in the circus, it wasen't such a great life. He had too wake up at 5 am every morning, take care of all of the animals. And worst of all he could only watch from the sides as the other performers did their show.          But afer two years of working super super hard. He was excepted in being a clown. And that was all that Zozo wanted. Too this day everyone enjoyed coming and seeing Zozo do his show and make people laugh, his dream had come true.                                                    The End.

I thought as I groomed the horses, who had just finished practicing for tonight's show.       'Cassidy!' I heard my mother calling. 'Honey, we're heading to the pie cart for dinner! The show is starting soon!'   I run after my mother and father and my sister, Amber, and soon we reach our destination.       As soon as we walk inside, Buddy the Clown greets us warmly.       'Ah, how are you, my dear Hillers? Sarah,' he turned to my mother,'how is your tightrope walking coming along? James,' now he turned to my father and clapped his enormous hand over my father's thin shoulder. 'I've seen you practicing your act where you'll juggle flames. Such perfect timing: tonight's show will be one of our best!'   My father laughed as Buddy removed his hand from his shoulder and now placed it on my head.      'Cassidy, are you excited for tonight's show? I can't wait to see you two somersault off Daisy The Elephant. That must take a lot of bravery!' He patted my head, as if I were a young child. People treat me differently just because I'm younger, but I'm twelve and very far from being the youngest one in the circus. 'Amber, your acrobatics are looking exceptional!' Amber is fourteen, only two years older than me, but she makes me feel as if she were another mom to me.        After we finish eating, we head to the main tent, called the Big Top. We are already in our costumes, and we all wait for the show to begin. My mother ties her long, fiery red hair back. The ringmaster steps out, welcomes the audience, and anounces the first act: James Hiller. Dad steps out into the spotlight and begins his act. At the end, my hands hurt from applauding. His act was fabulous!       Several more acts follow, including my mother and sister, until finally, it is my turn.      I step out into the center of the ring. The audience quiets, completely. This has never happened.      One man in the audience shouts out. 'That kid couldn't be older than nine! I came here to see a circus, not a ballet recital! She's going to get hurt!' Several others shout in agreement.       I hear my mother gasp from backstage. Out of the corner of my eye, I see my father, looking confused.       What is going on? I thought.       The ringmaster attempts calming the audience, but it is useless. 'Let's see your act, little girl! I am in the mood for some Girl Scout presentation.' The audience roared with laughter. I felt the anger boiling up inside of me. 'Ok, I will show you my act! Come on, Daisy!' I signaled for the elephant to come.       'Ok, just like we practiced.' I whispered in Daisy's ear as I climbed on her back. I rembered everything I had learned. I had to show this wild audience I was not a little kid, I was a talented young woman!          I gave Daisy a little kick, and she ran like the wind in circles around a small circular platform, where I will land. I slowly counted down. 5...4...3...2...1...       I remebered everything, even tucking in my chin. I did 6 flips and landed perfectly in the center of the platform.      The audience sat for a minute, speechless, then suddenly everyone, even the man who had called me a little girl, was clapping. I felt nothing but sheer pride and deep satisfaction. Not only had I done perfectly on my act, but I had proved everyone wrong. I was no longer a little girl. I was a confident young woman. 	VBG DT NN NN NN MD VB DT NN IN NN .

You may think that being in a circus is spectacular, amazing kooky, tops up crazy, and a one in a life time opportunity but it's really not. Here I'll show you.            Having the opportunity of being in a circus is great but to become you have to sacrifice some of the other dreams that you might have. When I was 9 years old I always dreamed that I will become an international singer and when I was 12 I always wanted to be a nurse.            15 I went to the circus. It was amazing! Ever since I knew I had to be either a fierce lion tamer, a daredevil tight roper, or a legendary trapeze artist. When I told my mom and dad about my dream they were full on with me they paid for ballet lessons, track in field, and swimming lessons.            When I became 19 I signed up for the circus. They put me in a dark room with blue curtains and only one little hole window pouring in dim and dusty light. The employ hit a lever (which I guess was the spotlight) and a bright light the shade of lightning hit my face. Immediately I re-flexed my eyes by shading it with my arm. The employ responded ' Bright eh.' I shook my head. ' Well then wait in tell you meet the boss, he's wonderful!' said the employ sarcastically. He then left the room. I suddenly became very frightened. After 10 minutes a man with a purple, green, and orange tucks and a completely bald head came in. He had a snigger on his face making himself look completely dumb. I couldn't help but laugh a little. The man suddenly shouted out ' WHAT ER YOU LOOKING AT BOZO!' I then saw his big fat pigs belly. I couldn't help but laugh again. He began shouting for an hour strait and than he stopped and became silence. Then he said ' Dance.' I didn't do anything in the shock of how he he just suddenly became dumb. He yelled 'DANCE.' I suddenly caught my train of thought and started doing my most recent and advance ballet moves I knew. When I ended I could see he was not impressed. I suddenly thought that my dream would come to an end. ' The names Gogachi Panini kid.' I stopped thinking where have I heard that name before. I then blurted out ' Oh, you mean from The Great, The Fantisimo, Circus DE Funda!' The man shook his head.            After four years when I was 23 the boss died we a had a special funicular for him. 1,562,349 people came! I couldn't believe that that many people would come. I was the first one to bless and give the boss the gift because I was the youngest person in the circus. It was scary but it helped allot of other people lose there fear.           I then took my bosses place of training and riding the elephants and being the master of ceremonies. It was scary at first but I came very fond of it.       Finaly I became 56 when I was the only member left. Charles the acrobat died 2 years ago, Haily the seal trainer left to go on American Idol, Goggie the trapeze artist died 12 years ago, Holly the entertainer died 8 years ago                         	DT NNP NNP NNP , PRP$ NN VBZ NNP NNP CC PRP$ NN NN VBZ DT NNP NNP MD VB IN VBG IN DT NN VBZ JJ , VBG NN , NNS IN JJ , CC DT CD IN DT NN NN NN CC PRP VBZ RB NNP NNP NNP NNP NN NNP NNP DT NN IN VBG IN DT NN VBZ JJ CC TO VB PRP VB TO VB DT IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP MD NNP NNP NNP VBD CD NNS JJ PRP RB VBD IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN CC WRB PRP VBD CD PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NNP CD PRP VBD TO DT NNP NNP VBD VBG .

I do all kinds of gymnastics and contortionist things. I love the circus but today was a scary day.       Today my best friend, Safira Exzlen, slipped off her beam and fell twenty feet down, but to my surprise the trapeze artist, Razic Caztiri, swung and caught her right before she hit the net. I ran towards her and saw that the trapeze coach, Yuri Raztac, was clapping and smiling like it was supposed to happen.       I went up to Safira after practice and asked her what she was doing. She told me that when she fell she meant to and Razic was supposed to catch her. I was a little scared for my friend and didn't want her to get hurt doing this new trick, but every time she does a new trick I worry but it always ends up perfectly fine. I said dasvidanya and left.       That night in my head I started thinking of a daring routine like Safira's. I thought and thought and wrote my thoughts down and finally came up with a greatly daring rouine. I would do a front aerial and then and front walkover and the out of the front walkover front hand spring stepout. I would then go to the end of the beam and put one foot on and one foot off the end and from there a backhandspring stepout into a back aerial.       I then thought of more. I thought, finally in the end, I would jump to a trapeze bar and hang by my knees and they would lower the trapeze and I would be about 15 feet off the ground (which would be a trampoline) and I would do a double backflip and land gracefully and bounce off the trampoline and do a front layout bounce back layout bounce front aerial land in a split finnish.       The next day I planned to tell my coach the next day. I told Tariza Raztac, my coach, the next day about the routine and she loved it. She made me practice every detail on every level of the beam. I practiced it on the line, low, mid, and finally high. I then perfected every thing on the trapeze and trampoline. I was doing grand in the eyes of Tariza by the time of the show. When the mattinee comes in four days I'll be ready to perform it. I am so happy I joined the circus!

THE CIRCUS ACTS   the circus have many acts like tightrope walkers,circus horses,clowns,and acrobats to me it from the looks of things im pretty sure they have to do alout of work like you cant juggle with out practice you cant walk on a tight rope without pactice and most of all you cant make horses do your every comand without practice!       the whole point of my passege was to let you know that the circus work hard for us to have fun at there performance and as many accidents as they have they never will stop doing what they love the most and that is performing!

How did I get here you may ask,Well when I was a little girl about 10 years of age, I foud out that I was a brileant gymnist.I started to take gymnastics and my mother and father interduced me to the circus. To me the circus was the best place on earth.There were upsides and down sides like a few weeks into the program I started to miss my parrents alot I wanted to go home but we were to far away.A week latter i reterned home to see my mom,dad,brother,and my dog lucy.The circus is a hard place sometimes.      Some of the upsides of being a circus performer are that you get to have a whole croud of people cheering just for you!You can swing all aroun on the bars with your perfoming partner and you just feel like a little bird fliing high up in the sky.I love being a performer but it shure is a hard job you work from sunup to sundown and don't get me rong you still go to school.This would be a normal day, you wake up go to the food cart get breafast head to the one room school house, but of corse they have computers report card and everything a normal shcool would have.Then school ends and you go do your chores like grooming the performance horeses and stuff like that.A few hours latter about 8:00 the show starts and you try to look as buitiful and as strong as you can up on those ropes as a trpeese artist.Then you go back to your tent and go to bed at about 10:00.Today I am almost 14 I have been in the circus for about four years and I am realy likeing it.Goodbye!

The cirus looks for weird and wacky things, things that they have never ever seen before in their whole entire life. They look for someone who's athletic. Youneed to be athletic to pull off all of the stunts.             Another quallity that you need to have is flexability. You need to be flexable to be able to do all the hard stunts that requier posture and flexability. You need to be able to do stuff with your body that nobody else can do.            Another quallity is strength. You need to be able to big up heavy objects and people with no hustle at all, You also need to beable to hold your self up.           One more is mental strengthness. You need to be able to get up without a pout if you fall or fail a stunt. This is one of the most need quallities that you need.           As you can see, it takes time and hard work and skill and dedacatin to be in a circus.

It is about a circus with amazing creatures and people.I hope this caught your attention,because this story might be interesting.I wouldn't know myself,because everyone has opinions.Like my picky sister hates butterscotch,and Tavian hates snake because...wait,I'm getting off topic here!Well,this is a story about a 9 year old who goes to a circus and finds out...ARGH!!!I DID IT AGAIN!Ah,well,here's the story.          Once there was a boy named Jordan CrackleMcPickle,who was short for his age with red hair like fire,literally , red as a red crayon.His eyes were green as a green crayon,wait,why do I keep mentioning crayons?Well,I guess they were.He had no freckles,only on Tuesday ,which meant he had freckles on every day except Tuesday,otherwise he had freckles as orange as an orange crayon..I really need to stop doing this!!!He went to 4th grade in Mrs.Izmint's class.                     One day his parents told him they're going to go to Fizzychew Amusing Circus!They caught a taxi to the village of Villageville,where they got snacks,after paying the driver.The 3 walked to Avinew Avenue.There,they found the circus!!!!!It was as purple as a purple crayon [I've got a problem]with gold ribbons!             There was dragon flying acrobats with sparklers flashing colors of the rainbow!Unicorn riders jumped of in a back-flip on a trampoline,into the air and on tightropes,and then onto a trapeze set!People riding on fireworks the color of blue crayons[what is wrong with me and crayons]into the sky when the explode with the people landing on the mattress pile.Dancing trees and talking dogs!Snake that grow giant with one drop of milk!              Jordan loved the show more than crayons[ARGH]and I would too.They even ate all their snacks and took a picture with a unicorn!They took a dragon ride also!They even bought one of the sparklers!When they left,they never forgot that day.

I have to work really hard every perfomances and make sure I don't mess up. Sometimes I have a partner but i usually work alone. I've probably went around the whole world! But it wasn't easy at all!       When I first joined the circus I was not good at all, I mean i could do a few tricks but still i was a rookie. one time when i went up to perform and i fell doing a hard trick. Everyone was laughing at me! I thought i was never going to be an acrobatic again but i practiced more and became way better. After that i relized how careful i had to be. now i always make sure the rope is strong so nothing bad happens.           if you ever want to join the circus you need to make sure you really like it because you are always doing work. i only see my family three times a year but the circus is also my family.You also have to be the perfect fit for your act like if you want to be a clown then you'll have to have good face expessions and don't mind getting a little embarresed.       clearly, Being in the circus is hard and you have to be careful but it is totally worth it.

There i was practicing until Icouldn't move. It was almost showtime and I was ready.It was time so I jumped on the horse and did a backflip and landed on the trampoline.                                           It was a risky move but I managed to survive.The audience clapped and chierred for me.It felt good to be chierred on by lots of people.

He thought they could swing through a big hoop on fire.When it became are time to do are trick he thought he had butterflies in my stomach.He walked on the platform.When he started to swing he didn't have a tight grip on the tightrope.In the air He tried to get a grip,but his hands slipped off the tight rope and he fell onto the hoop.He tried to get off but his leg was stuck.          He screamed help me.Someone in the crowd called the ambulance and fire department.The fire department put out the fire.The ambulance took him strait to the hospital.He had third degree burns and is recovering from his burns.

He lived in a house that was haunted. He said that he could talk to ghost, but no one beleaved him.       It was Friday, The 13th, 1997, The Invisable Man also known as 'Ghost' was walking to school one day. People always made fun of his since he wore a mask the looked like a skeleton, and he had enough. When he was 17 he made a potion that could turn anyone invisable.       The next hour in that day he was invisable no one could see him. So Ghost decides to go outside scaring people. He was the scariest person in New York, so people started to cry and move away from New York.       He once saw the love of his life, her name was Betty. He trapped her in a cage and held her prisioner. She was so mad she started to get a red face and her head blew up! To this day Ghost is still out there looking for people to scare. If you're in New York, WATCH OUT!       In conclusion you should watch out for Ghost. Who knows maybe he is right behind you, look out for this guy or you'll be dead.

Mary Jane was a 11 year old girl just getting ready to do her circus performance, she was going to ride on her pet lion and leap over a circle that was on fire. She was nervous every past minute as she watched Johnny Lunar do his performance. Mary had a bad feeling but she couldn't tell if she was just nervous or she thought something bad was going to happen. Mary and Johnny were friends about 3 months when Johnny became a circus performer. he was the same age as Mary that's why they were very close friends. The act that he was doing was very hard because it had a use of fire.           When he lite a match to light the rope for his act, BAM!!!! the place caught on fire. The audience were all panic and couldn't get out because the door way was on fire. Circus performers were leaving from the back door leaving the audience, as Johnny just stood frozen solid. Mary was just about to leave as she looked back and couldn't help but leave without trying to help, so she ran back. She ran around looking for anything too stop the fire as she saw a firestingursher. she took hold of it and blew out the fire from the doorway and yelled out 'run out hurry' so everyone did. Finally firefighters came.              Mary was releaved everyone was safe. As she was walking she saw Johnny and ran to him. They talked about how Mary didn't do her act because of Johnny, but all Mary said was 'as long as everyone's safe it's alright'. A few weeks later Mary got to do her performance. at the end everyone applaused for her as she waved for the crowd.                	DT NNP NNP .

I am Desany and my job is to perform with the lions. So lions are strong and eats humans. Bu we train them when they are baby so they know us and are use to us.          The circus is very hard work it takes time seating it up. then right after the show they have to put it straight back down. So you see it is not that easy being in the circus. Its time to perform see you later.

When you join the circus you won't be able to do all the tricks rite away so you may just be picking up elephant poop.You also may just be able to dress up as a clown and throw pies in other clowns faces.         In the circus you have to get up like at 7 a.m every day.You have to get up early to get make up on,your hair done,and you have to get dressed.If you go to school rite after school you get like a 5 minute brake then you have to get dressed for the circus.        In the circus you get to jump off diving boards,jump through firing hoops,and more crazy things like that.A lot of people thing the circus it just all crazy stuff and playing,but you actually have to work a lot to become a expert in the circus.       People join then find out they have to do a lot of work to perform on stage.When people find out about how they have to travel a lot they may miss home,but when they are on stage they forget all about it because they are having so much fun.The circus is very hard but when you get on stage all that hard work you have done goes to work and turns all that hard work into fun.      If you are a expert in they circus you get to swing on poles and let go and some one would catch you.To become a expert only thing you have to do is practice a lot and a lot of practice.But all the practice is worth it.      Everyone likes going to the circus to see people get sawed in half,jumping through firing hopes,picking up elephant poop,and more.The circus is a fun place for the whole family to go to.Its a nice place to watch a shoe have peanuts,popcorn,and a pop.They circus is a amazing place for everyone.

Another thing that could happen is that if some of the acrobats fall down they will get hurt and maybe even die. If they die the show will be over and if it is over the kids will be sad that the show is over all ready.

'The best part about being in the circus is having the the thrill of flying in the air with Cole.' says acrobat Jenna. Are trainer Kara taught us everything we know, my goal one day is to be just like Kara.           Hi, I'm Cole and doing acrobatics with Jenna is so much fun. When you are in my place you are supporting her, and if u make one wrong move, we both fall. I would say the best part about being in the circus is having all the eyes on you. I just want to tell everyone to go for your dreams even if they aren't far, like being in the circus.       Hi I'm Kara and most of my time goes into Jenna and Cole they are very smart and talented and have great copperation skills.I love what i do and i love teaching people to be just like me, now I've been saving a suprise for Jenna and Cole, but i will be performing with them. In order for us to fit in our costumes we are on a strict diet, except the clown he eats everything! * EVERYTHING*.       I'm the horse, BOB, most people come to see me but they never admit it. The clown rides me, but boy I lose 20 pounds with that *chubby* boy on me. WHEWW!    No one knows that I practice more than the performers, they dont care, but when i nah they are all for me what mind changing people. Now my favorite part of being in the circus is all the popcorn on the ground!!          Hi, im Pop Belly Jo and me and clown team up for dinner whew i can't walk anymore. The producer will still let me drive I always get blamed for wrecking the car, ITS THE HORSE, his hoves are always scratced!

Life in the circus is fun, but the steps are hard. in the circus you have to learn how to use the trapeze, tiprope, how to be a acrobat, and how to use the unicycle. Right now im learning how to walk the tiprope. The tiprope is hard at first. my mom is the lion tammer. Shes teaching our lion, Jasmin, how to jump through the flaming hoop. My dad is a trapeze artist with my older sister. Then last but not least my younger brother has to do the unicycle. The circus is a great place to learn and act crazy for a crowd. When I get chosen for the lucky winner of the contest i'll get to experiance my fellow circus folk.

Its not you have to practice a lot and travel.You can't stay in one place if you do that city or country will get bord with the same act so that meansyou travel.           I have a job in the circus and I can say its pretty hard, but it makes it wild because after I do my trick they all stand up and clap some times  I think they are claping just for me. Getting on I have to practice every day  and on the weekend and after the performence I get right to sleep. Then I  have to do practice and performance all over agine. Just remember if you want to join the circus itsgoing be a long trip. 	NNP PRP VBD DT NN VBZ VBN CC NNS .

If you are wondering what it is like for me to be in a circus, well I will tell you straight off the bottom of my lip. It is really amazing to be around a big crowed, and seeing them smile. I think thats the best part about being in a circus! Would you ever be interested in being in the circus? Well it takes alot of effort for a person to be in a circus. You have to have strength and balance if you want to acrobat. You have to be brave to be a clown, because your in front of a bunch of people. And tons more, but I am here to tell you what I do.       First, When schools over its time for a quick break. The clowns let me play with ther little unicycles, juggling balls, and also their shoes to act like im big foot. Sometimes I even play with our snake,Cheese; but don't worry the snake won't bite! Then it is time to do the things on my list.       Next, It's time for chores. I feed the snake, groom and feed the horses we use in a act.Then check if my costume is ready for tonights show, and see if every body else has theirs too. Last I check to see if every one has their schedual for tonight. The schedual is for the time their on  and everything they need to know for tonight.        Next, Its dinner time. My friends and I eat dinner outside. We are eating chicken, vegtables, and water. We have to stay strong in our body, so no junk food. We can not eat too much, or when we preform tonight our stomach will hurt. Have you ever had cramps in your stomach after you ate alot and jumped around? I sure have, and I do not want that to happen again!       Last, The show is over. now I am in bed thinking of what is going to happen next in my future to come. Working in a circus isn't so bad, it's actually quite fun to be in. Being in a circus is a busy tough life but I know I can make it around when I am with my friends to support me. Well It's past my bedtime, I have to go. Good night! 	NNP PRP RB VBN TO DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS .

I just woke up and now I am eating the chefs famous  pancakes and bacon! We have it everyday for breakfast, and let me tell you it is delious! I'm one of the many acrobats in the circus and there are about 14 more! It is not a good circus without  a lot of acrobats. Anyway, circus life is hard work. When we don't have a proformance ( we don't have many of those) I practice, practice practice.        Today is another hardworking circus day. The show starts at 10:00. Then we have another one at 4:00. I don't get done working tell 8:00 or 9:00(depends how we do on the show.) I need to go get everything on for today the show starts in an hour. I have my big solo today want to look my best! Getting my costume on is a pain. It is all ichey and unconfortble. In the inside you have to be really carefull not to pull a thred or your costume is done. After your costume is done you get make up done. It is really boring sitting in that chair having them work on your face and it tickles!        Everyone is in the circus ready for the show to start! Ahhhh, i am so exited i can hardly sit still.

It is almost my part, ahh i cant wait. Got to go it is HERE!!! And now her solo she has been waiting for Abbi Sitte!! I just got on the rope and.....the lights go out i can't see anything AHHHHHHHHH,Why is everything so dissy? Then in a sec everyone in the circus is around me. The lights are on! Then the tent falls down! What are we going to do?        Wait a minite the tent is still up, the lights are on, the sun is up ok that is weird.

I am one of the tightrope walkers here along with many more different people like clowns, acrobats, jugglers, tightrope walkers, horses, and even a lion tamer.        Like I said earlier, I am a tightrope walker I walk on a thin rope that is as high as the sky. I have to walk on the tightrope without falling off of it. You have to have talent to be in the circus. You have to have skills to be in the circus.You also have to have time to be in the circus because the circus takes up a lot of your time.. But, it would be really fun to say '' I am in the circus.'' We travel 20,000 miles in seven months, each year. We also visit 150 cities. I work from sunup to sundown.        So that is the life of person in the circus. It is really fun to be able  to have this opportunity to be in the circus. You should try it someday.You will love it once you start doing it.Well I hope you enjoyed the show. 	DT NNP NNP .

Actually, my real name is Loupo, not Loupo the magnificent, and I was actually brought here against my will. I am now two years old, and my first show is tonight.   I am supposed to jump through a sieries of rings, follow simple(and stupid) commands  and ride an elephant in circles. The trainers think that they trained a wild cat from Africa, and they think that they did it all on their own. It's actually the animal's choice to be trained. I only did it because I thought they would hurt me if I didn't. It's hard to live when you're afraid of everything. The only good thing that comes out of the circus, is the meat that you don't have to fight for...       I sat in the corner shadows of my cage, in the cart that has LOUPO THE MAGNIFICENT painted in gold all over it. The spectators stuck their hand in my cart to try and touch me. I growled at them, and they cheered. I actually wanted to just get to the show so that no one could touch me.   The trainer pushed through the crowd with a handful of meat in his hand. I groaned. He opened the little trapdoor and threw the meat inside. I sniffed it, and then licked it, then I took it in my mouth. The trainer stood beside my cage and yelled, 'Behold, LOUPO THE MAGNIFICENT!' The crowd cheered so loud that I put my ears back, crouched low to the ground and groweded fiercely at them. They cheered. Ugh.   One by one, they all dispersed. It was now the evening, and I lay down to watch the sunset. That's when the trainer came up to my cage saying, 'Hello Loupo! Who's my little leopard? Yes, you are! You are...'. One day I would run away escape this embarassing talk. He opened the door and said 'Up!' and I got up with a groan. He slipped the noose over my head and 'led' me out.   There was a long line of animals and acrobats waiting to be called into the tent for their turn. The trapeze artists were first, and as the Ring Leader called them in, they danced inside as the crowd clapped. Next were the Poodles and Jack Russel Terriers. They did their part: balancing on balls and jumping rope. Next were the acrobats, and they did tight-rope walking and flying across the cieling. I never cared much for the acrobats, they were always bragging and showing-off and telling everyone what to do and where to go. Then there were the circus horses, then the bears, then the elephants and elephant riders. Then the clowns and dancers, and then there was me.   As the dancers finish their show, the Ring Leader called: 'And now, for the show you've all been waiting for, the wild cat, wrestled from Africa, tussled and trained. The cat that has become a world-wide star! I give you, the marvelous, the magnificent, LOUPO!' That's when the trainer loosened my noose and shoved me into the ring. A clown ran up behind me hollaring, and I did what we rehearsed: Act afraid and run up onto the platform. The crowd cheered. Then the Ring Leader called, 'And now, the magnificent Loupo will perform his first trick: the hoops!' Several clowns pushed up some rings in front of me. I slumped off of the platform and walked through the hoops as they wanted me to. The crowd went wild. Then the Ring leader said, 'Now the magnificent Loupo will follow my every command!' He faced me and said, 'Sit!' So I did as he told. The audience clapped. 'Roll over!' I rolled over. The audience cheered. 'Dance!' I stood up on two legs. The  audience hollared. I felt more pathetic than I ever have been before. Then the Ring Leader said, 'And now, Loupo will achieve the impossible! Loupo will train an elephant!' Then in walked Brophy, the elephant. He did what he was told to do: act wild, act angry. I did what I was told: Growl at him, and pretend to scare him. He did what he was told: Lie down when I growled, and whimper. I did what they wanted me to do: I climbed on his back. He did what they wanted him to do: Stand up and walk in circles. I guess we both felt stupid, but the audience loved it.   When the show was over, I was led back to my cage. I was upset, and angry. About 10 seconds after I lay down, the audience had crowded around my cage. Whooping and Hollaring and sticking their hands in to touch me. This was going to be a long night.   It was about midnight, and everybody had gone back to their trailers, all except the Ring Leader and the trainer. This was their conversation:   Ring Leader: 'So, are you excited?'   Trainer: 'You bet. It's not everyday that you get to train two new leopards.' Ring Leader: 'What are their names again?'   Trainer: 'Ocapoco and Lucapaca. They're going to be in the backround of Loupo. The manager said that the show would bring in more buyers if Loupo had backup.'   Ring Leader: 'But we could barely fit these people in the tent, how are we supposed to fit another thousand?'   Trainer: 'No idea.'   Ring Leader: 'When are they arriving?'   Trainer: 'Tomorrow.'   Ring Leader: 'Oh, well. Good luck.'   Trainer: 'Thanks.' That is how their conversation ended.   Well, the next day there was a lot of buzz. I guessed it was about the two new leopards. Two other cages were attatched to the back of mine, one was painted in silver that said, LUCAPACA THE AMAZING and another blue one that said OCAPOCO THE EXOTIC. The two leopards arrived cowering and bloody.       It took two months for them to heal, they were pretty traumatized. When we first started rehearsing together, it was odd. They wouldn't cooperate and they always would cower behind me whenever someone scared them. I had much pity for them.   In the days that passed there was a lot of disorganization, and it was because of Ocapoco and Lucapaca. Ocapoco got loose, and Lucapaca would snarl at anyone who came near her. I followed their examle with going on strike. First I wouldn't follow any of the trainers commands. Then I would do a Lucapaca and growel anytime someone came near, and I even learned how to open my cage and do an Ocapoco. We went that way for weeks, not once having a show, and Ocapoco and Lucapaca were greatful for my strike. We nearly drove the trainers, acrobats, managers, and advertisers mad by going on strike. As a result, this is what happened:   It was day 47 of our strike, and the trainers were afraid to come feed us, but we just kept our strike flowing. Then one day, the trainers finally gave us some food. We ate it, only to find that there were sleeping pills inside. We slept hard, and when we woke up, we were in crates on a plane. The younger two were scared, and so was I. Then, the trainers opened up the door. They hobbled in, for it was bumpy in the back of the plane. They gave us some more meat, and we were too hungry to even consider that there might be pills inside...idiots. The second time we woke up we were in the same crates, but we were in a car, not a plane. It was hot outside, and the road was bumpy, light streamed in through the few holes in our crates. There was a weird sence of home here, though I could not put my finger on it. Then, the car stopped. Our crates were put on the ground, and they were opened, and I knew exactly where I was: South Africa. I bolted out of the crate and I just kept running, running into the warm sun, running into the long golden grasses of home. I could hear Ocapoco and Lucapoca behind me, but I kept running, I was rinning home.

I ended that when I was 10. When I got home I got out my backpack. My mom, she was coming! What am I going to do? I put my backpack under my bed, the door handel was slowly moving. My mom yelled to me 'Do your homework' I said 'Ok'. I got my backpack out I got everything I needed. At 8:00 my dad said 'bed time'. At 9:30 I got up, I was out the door in a second.       I ran away, I got to the circus tent in town. I told the people 'I want to be in the circus'. They all said 'We do need someone new'. I was in the circus! That morning we left town we were off. I loved all the nature that went bye. We were in the next town in a week. There was a leader his name was Zoco. He asked ' What do you want to be?' I said ' If I could have a job it would be to work and train the elephants and do a horesback trick'. He said ' Ok'. He put us in partners. My partner was Zoozoo. Over the years Zoozoo made me awsome.       I was 13 years old I was very sad I didn't have a family. We were going to my old town I ran once we got their, I looked for the little red house I opened the door and yelled 'Mom, Dad'. They both ran and I showed them I loved them. After that I told them the whole story. The End.        Thank you for the graet time I had. I hope you liked it.

The poster said the famous Inline circus was coming to Notberry. The tickets cost five dollars. Bobby rode home a fast as he could. When he got home he told his mom about the circus. His mom said the family could go. Bobby started jumping with excitement.                      The next day Bobby's family got ready to go to the circus. On the way there Bobby and his brother John were screaming circus. The dad said, 'If you guys scream one more time I'll spank you till you bleed!' Bobby and John were quiet the rest of the way. It took ten minutes to get to the circus. when they got there Bobby and John jumped out of the car and got in the line. The mom and dad got in line with them.                       They finally got there seats and the dad went and got four hot dogs and four waters. The started by the bearded lady lighting her beard on fire. Then a clown came with a hose and sprayed the bearded lady. The bearded lady started chasing the the clown. The clown jumped in his small car and drove away. The bearded lady got so mad she light the tent on fire. Everyone had to evacuate the tent. Everyone got out safe and the police came and took the bearded lady away. Bobby and John thought it was the best circus ever.                       The mom and dad took Bobby and John home. They had to take a nap. The last thing Bobby said befor he went to sleep was, 'I want to go back to the circus.' Then Bobby went to sleep.

Being an animal trainer would be hard because you have to show them what to do. People think its dangerous and it sometimes is. You have to tell the commands and what they mean and the animals have to do something to enetertain the crowd. You have to train tigers, elephants, lions, and all of the other circus animals.                  You have to train the animals to do stunts. For example if you want to stack all the aanimals on an elephant you have to do a command let them suprise you with there trickes. then the horses you       have to do a command to do the amazing things to entertain you. The   horses make them stand on their heind legs and then do something that makes you say 'wow'.  you go to a circus because it is a fun place to go to. because they have fun things to make you laugh.                 These acts are all hilarious and they all crack me up. and they all make me say this wow now that was a great trick. and going on a balance beam that scares me. circus clowns are super funny becasuse they do all sourts of things.

They also have animals like circus horses that listen to people. They also have tigers and lions. They always have elehpants. Some of them paint and some of them do tricks.     They alway have shops were you can buy stuff. Some have cups and some have shirts.They also have people that sell stuff inside because some people might be hungry.

When they auditioned they both got to do the acrobatics.They were so excited that they went to the food court to get some dog chow.So, the very next day they both woke up at 7:30 and they got some breakfast to eat before they go and practice.                          They went to the practice area and they saw there dream of being in a circus and it finally came true.They were so happy that they raped each others arms around each other.So, Honey and Dexter lived happily ever after in a circus.

Everyone ran away and no one came to circus ever again. 25 years later the circus never existed. People who entered the circus became candy.

The circus is crazy most of the day everyone's running around trying to get everything ready.       7:00 A.M.-I wake up, get dressed , and I go to the food cart to get bacon and eggs. The crew is setting up the tents, lights, and music.       8:30 A.M.-I go to school in one of our many trailers with some of the other kids that travel with their parents. We have computers, progress reports, and tests. Some of my classmates speak foreign languages.       2:30 P.M.-I have to practice and finish my chores some of my chores are grooming, feeding, and watering our horses and our dogs too. I am practicing flipping off a horse and then jumping off a trampoline onto an elephant.           7:30 P.M.-I am eating dinner with my family we eat some chicken and vegetables. It is good, but we don't eat it all because if we do our performance won't be the best.           8:30 P.M.- The show started My dad goes on first he perfects every stunt. Now it's my turn I landed my stunt. Everyone else did great I can't believe it. Yeah!       10:00 P.M.- The day is over the performance want great. Tomorrow will be a whole different adventure. I love traveling in the circus. Then after the circus I go to my trailer after a tiring day.

I walk to my trainer and tell her im very nervous.  'You've done this correctly every time we have practiced. You wont mess up I promise.'  My act in the show was a tightrope walker. It took me over 2 months to learn how to tightrope walk wihtout falling off.        I heard my act being accounced. I was the first act.  I walked out slowly and nervously to the tightrope. I walked a little faster.  I wasn't nervous the times we practiced, but now theres an audience and i'm sure ill mess up.  I climbed the ladder leading to the tightrope and waited about 10 seconds. I knew I was going to fall off but i had to try.       I had to remember the good things about walking a tightrope.  There was a net under me so if i fell off i wouldn't get hurt.  I realized i'd been standing at the top of the ladder for about 2 minutes.  I didn't want to keep the audience waiting.  I slowly started walking along the tightrope. My heart was beating very fastly.  I started to get cold chills.       I looked at my trainer.  She looked very nervous and I really didn't want to let her down. I realized I was alittle more nervous about this than I should be.  I started walking confidently along the tight rope. I'd gotten halfway through without falling. I suddenly noticed something in the middle if the tightrope. There was a tear in the middle of the tightrope. I knew if i stepped on it the tightrope would break.       I walked carefully towards it.  I stepped over it thinking it would break. Even though the net was under it, it still kind of hurt when I fell because the net was scratchy.  I walked over the tear in the tightrope and it didn't break. I carefully made it over to the other side. Everyone started cheering and I felt very proud of myself.  I looked at my trainer and she looked very proud too.

In the circus you get to dress funny , like a clown. You can juggle, ride a horse , it doesn't matter just as long as you are having fun doing it.        You may have a special talent. Acrobatics is a great talent to see. people hanging from ropes , chains, even by just hands and feet. Juggling is fun once you get the hang of it. trowing up more than ten thuings in the air is an exciting scene.         Tightroping is thrilling. someone is always scared you will fall , but that generally doesn't happen at the circus.          People will train for months doing these stunts until they get them perfect. Not all stunts have to be of the ground, you can be a clown, ride a horse, be a comedian, or any of those things really.           The circus is fun to see. Don't ever be afraid to chase your dream. If you want to be a clown , be a clown . Whatever you want to be it.

I work from sunup to sundown and I devote myself to become a performer even though I am only 11 years old.                 Every day I wake up a 7:00 A.M. and do what everyone does: brush my teeth and get dressed. Then I go to the pie car for my breakfast of pancakes and bacon. Currently, the crews are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.                  At 9:00 A.M. I go to our circus's one-room schoolhouse to learn. It has everything a school has. For example computers, tests, and report cards. Because my circus travels around the world, I have many performers that speak different languages from me. Our geography lessons come alive when we travel.                    School is over at 3:00 P.M. and I have a short break. The clowns usually allow me to play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I want to have a large pet, but our trailer is too small. Even though I love my life as part of a circus family, I sometimes want to join the swim team. However, we don't stay at one place long enough to.                     After 30 minutes, it's 3:30 P.M. and I have to do my chores and then practice. I feed, water, and groom all the horses. Today, I plan to practicing my tricks with the horses.                     At 6:30, I eat my dinner in the pie car. However, we don't eat much because tonight we are going to perform. We usually do 15 shows in one week.                     After the circus's performance is finished, I flop on to my bed and go to sleep, dreaming about what I am going to perform next. This is my life as a circus performer, and I am proud of it.

I am a lion tamer in the Kidzworld circus.       Here is my typical week.       Monday:  Wake up and go to the pie car to get breakfast. Then go to the school car. Most of the kids there are from all over the world, but we actually get to learn each other's languages. I currently know Spanish, Korean, Japanese, French, and English. After school I have a little free time, so the clowns let me play on their unicycles, as long as I don't break them. I do this part every day. Then our special Monday performance is what I like. we do our trapeze stunts, the sword-swallowing, and then I come out with Bernard and Fabia, my two lions. We do our famous human/lion totem pole.       Tuesday:  Wake up and go to the pie car for breakfast. Then I do the usual for weekdays: school, play, and practice. Tuesdays aren't my favorite days because I'm stuck with clean-up, but it's actually pretty fun.       Wednesday:  Wake up and go to the pie car for breakfast.Then I do the usual for weekdays. Wednesday is my favorite day of the week, because I get to perform for our normal performance, as well as our Wednesday matinee. Bernard, Fabia, and I do our totem pole, as well as our famous double ring jump.       Thursday:  Wake up and get breakfast. Then the weekday usual. We have one performance, and it's the trapeze performance, so I'm stuck with setup and cleanup.       Friday:  Get up and get breakfast. Then the weekday procedures. We have no performance tonight, so I just relax and enjoy the scenery.       Weekends:  Wake up and get breakfast. We finally have no school, so we get to mess around until about 4:00, when everybody performs three times each day. Once I get home, I'm wiped out and ready for bed.

I usually wake up earlier but on today's show not that many people are going. Its time to go eat egg,bacon, and pancakes from the food car. After, we start to set up and get ready for the show.                                                                                                                          On today's  show we are going to show the crowd acrobatics. I'm the person that every body likes and the reason for that is that I have a mask and nobody knows how my face looks like. All of my crew depends on me when the show so far isn't doing good.                                                                                                                             After the show every body is relieved. We have to go back to our set up and go to sleep. Next is another trip twenty miles away. Many people in my crew are tired but we still do our best to entertain our crowd.

Mr.huslte was from italy.everbody was happy, well the first performance they had was about juggling. bobby likes juggling he enjoyed waching the people juggle.                circus clowns came out and started dancing it was funny.lions were going through fire holes and leapords were getting trained and almost in accident bit mr.huslte. it started to get crazy     beacause people were screaming but at least they were happy.                 the circus was about to end and the last performance was starting they needed three volenteers and guess who it was jane,jason and me bobby. we all had to hold on to a rope mr huslte was a magician so then he made the rope into cloths an colorful.                that is when me bobby,jane and jason went to the circus.we had a great day and exiting.I hope we come again.

I am going to talk adout how it s to work at a circus.           First, the people who uses animals in their proformence has to groom the animals. Groom means to clean and brush the animals. If they dont groom yhe animals, they would be stinky. They also have to feed the animals. If they dont feed the animals they woudlnt be able to do their performence because the food gives them the energy they need.            Also, the proformeres have to eat. They eat at the pie car. It has pie, pizza, and ect. If they dont eat a great meal they will be hungry during their proformence. The proformers needs a lot of energy, if they run out of energy they would be tired during their proformence. That is why they have to eat a good meal.             Lastly, when the proformers are done with their proformence, they are wiped out. Wiped out means to be very tired. When they are done with their proformence the go to the pie car to eat because they be so hungry and tired. They have to get up really early in the morning to get ready to go to the Circus. They barly have enough time to get some rest they need.               As you can see, beaing in a Circus is a lot of work. You have to travel 20,000 miles. Some people in the circus are use to it because they probally worked there for 20 years. They have to wake up early in the morning to get to the Circus. If the performers are using animals in their proformence, they have to groom them. If they dont groom the animals they would be stinkyand all. They have to eat  good meal so they wouldnt be hungry during their proformence. They need energy so they dont be wiped out. Circus can be very fun.

Its really fun and not so fun at the same time.Circus performers, get to travel around the world which can be fun and tiring.Some people that work in the circus have fun while others don't.           These are reasons why some people like to work and live in the circus. They  have fun because they get to work with animals.Trainers work with elephants,lions,and chimpanzees.Some tricks they do are somersaulting off a running horse,or leaping from a trampoline onto a horses back.The kids juggle and do acrobatics.They like doing that because its entertaining.Another thing that make people like the circus is because they travel around the world.Traveling around the world gives an opportunity to meet different places and different people.            These are some reasons why some people don't like to work and live in a circus.The circus is a busy and a tough life.They have to wake up early, at seven in the morning, and sleep late.Circus performers work long days and spend a lot of time away from home.On tour, They don't have anywhere to call home.Circus performers, don't see their family that much.They have to work long hours and weekends too.Although for some people the circus is fun, for others its difficult.               As well as the circus performers like and don't like the circus, they can learn new things.When they travel to different places, they get to learn about that place.They learn the culture and the celebrations that place has.This can be an advantage for the circus performers.When the circus performers travel to different places, they can visit their family that lives there.                 Those are some reasons why circus performers like and don't like being in the circus. Just because being a circus performer might seem fun, for others its frustrating and difficult. If the circus performers don't like the circus or if they do, they get to travel and learn new things from different places that they have never seen or been before.

Some people think it is fun to work at the circus, but they don't know it is also difficult.  We asked Ally to tell us about the circus.           In the circus their are clowns, juggling, acrobats, a tightrope walker,and even horses. When you come in a circus you see all these amazing things that you think you want to be in the circus oneday, but what you don't know is that  behind those curtains people are practicing a trying to  do the best to intertain the audience. All of this starts in the morning. 'In the morning everyone gets wakes up gets dress and goes to the pie car to eat breakfast. Then the chidren go school while the parents or adults stay  and practice. In school the children go to school to learn laguages  and to learn  things about the city they are traveling to.'           ' In the afternoon the children get out of school and go to practice and do chores.   Everyone at the circus works really hard and they are trying to do their best preformance every. After practicing they go to have dinner at the pie cart. No one has a big dinner since they are going to preform.          When show time comes the preformers put their outfits on and then the show begins. Once the show begins the magic begins. Everyone  is  quite.'  Ally enjoys preforming in front of people. She always has a smile when she  faces the crowd. When the show is over  she is really tired.          ' The circus  is a very great place ,but it is sometimes hard', says Ally. The circus is always filled with excitment.

One hot weekend, I was doing my chores and my dream is to go to the circus. I was cleaning the dog's cage then suddenly, a flyer landed on my face. It was a flyer for the amazing Bellini Circus. I was so excited because I've always wanted to go to the circus because it's cool and fun to watch. My favorite act is the acrobats. I just love the way they spin in ropes.                I went running to my mom and said 'Mom can we go to the circus and watch the fabulous acts.' My mom quickly said yes because she was in a circus when she was young and maybe she would meet one of the people she worked with before. We all got ready hit the car. As soon as we got there, I saw many lights and colors. My dad went to go purchase the tickets while we wait at the door. When we got inside my sister found us front row seats.              The first thing that happen was the host appered next to me when the drums did a drum roll. It was so cool I was so suprized.

I'm here to tell you about the ways of the circus. I'm a stuntman, but that's not close to all the cool stuff    you can do at a circus. The circus is a place where dreams of some come true. Circuses are very fun ,but then the work kickes in.                                                                                                                                               First of all, you must always be focused because you can easily make a mistake. You will travel a ton through the year. In a circus you only get 9hr. of sleep or possibly less. You can also learn different languages from different classmates.                                                                                                                                                                         There are many types of jobs as I said earlier.  For an example acrobats can be something you might like. As I was a kid, I would love to watch the circus's performances. Now I'm what I always wanted to be and anyone, even you can make your dream come true just as I did. You can be a juggler, tight rope walker, clown, animal trainer, a stuntman like me ,but that's not all there is to a circus, there's plenty more to explore!                                                                                                                                                                                 When you come into a circus, be prepared for what awaits you because it's not all that easy, you have to really want it, you have to strive. The challenges ahead will not overcome you, you will overcome it. Take this advise and hit with your best shot!

Do you think its hard walking on a tightrope?Yeah its hard but what would happen if they fall or the rope ripes they could break their back or head and that would be really dangerous.       I always use to think the circus was fun and not dangerous but when i saw what they did i was shocked that takes alot of work to do and time and they have to take alot of risks to do something that hard.Then I tought how cold they do that that lokks so scary and their faces dont even show they are scared.Now lets talk more about the risks it takes to be in a circus.Would you get homesick when you stay somewhere for a month and then left would that be fun.I think it would not be fun.And would you like to eat in a pie car.It would not be fun to get sick and then stay in a trailer all day long.Or travel in a  litle trailer with a big family and be all squished.I woul not like to live like that that would be horible.I am going to tell you a story of a girl,there was a little girl,she was ten,she did not want to be a clown or work in the circus she wanted to be something else but her parents wanted her to work in the circus because it was a tradition she felt bad and said,'I wish i had  a normal family'but she new that would never happen and she decided to work on the circus she was not happy but did not wanted to dissapoint her parents and she said to herself,'When I have kids I am going to let them do whatever they want to work on.'The lesson I just told you is triying to explain that you are lucky to have a normal family.                                     I would really like to work in the circus but it may be hard you have to do the same routine dail.That would be really hard for me would that be hard for you.Would you like to go to a circus school or a normal school.This a story about the crazy life in the circus.

First the person is telling us how match they travel and where they travel . The person is telling that she is getting ready for breackfast . She is telling us that they have there own school that travels with them .I woudn't be in the circus because i don't like clowns . The horse looks like a robot . I would not want to be in the circus , but i would want to see the circus . I use to be scared of clows when i was little .                                                        If i work in the circus i would be one of the stong men . Another job i would is to be a man that will train a elephant or a tiger . I think that my brother will want to be a person that jumps on to another person . I think that my dad would want to be one of the men that jumps to that giant ring on fire . I think that it will be hard to work at the circus .

I am a acrobat.I love what i do but let me tell you that it took a lot of hard work and effort to be able to be in the circus.I started when  was young and if you want to be in the circus i recommend that you start when you are young its a lot easier to start your career.   Many people think that being in the circus it all fun &amp; games but it is not.We circus performers work very hard and practice for a very long time.Also because of all the traveling that we do while we are in the circus you don't really have time to  see our family when we have a break we enjoy and treasure it very much.I have to practice my tricks and moves everyday but it is worth it when you get out in the ring or as for me get on the bars and start to move the audience almost seems like its moving with you doing the tricks right beside you.Almost as if the audience is there to catch you if you fall.Like you will always be safe and the sense that you get when you nail a perfect new move!being in the circus is a lot of fun but hard work also.    I started as a dancer we learned lots of flips and tumbling that came in handy when i decided to start gymnastics.I found a love for gymnastics and also found that i was amazing at it i won competitions and could do many different moves.When a circus directer asked me to join i was overwhelmed with happiness,but my family didn't agree.It took a lot of hard work but i finally got them to agree.Now my family is very supportive of what i do,and i will always treasure them because if it weren't for them i wouldn't be here doing what i love and it took a lot of courage in your daughter to let her move away forever so she could fill her dreams.   I don't know if the circus is right for you because not everyone likes that lifestyle,but if your interested go for it and just remember the circus will always be there for you!

Though circus life can be hard and tough, it is fun at the same time.                             A day at the circus is very tiring. I work all day with the rest of the people in the circus. Every week, I perform 10 times. Due to this, I practice and practice. One upside about working in a circus is you get to travel to many different places you have never been to before. The circus gives many people an opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many different people. There are many good things about working in circus but there are many bad things as well.                                           Though many people think that working in a circus is easy, working in the circus is really not all fun and games. You have to work long days and you don't really spend too much time with your family. You can't call home either because it all just comes back to the fact you don't have much time. Before you join a circus you might want to think about the very fact that you will be away from your family.                                  There are many things to think about before you join a circus. It's not as easy as you think it is.  Would you like to go to school in a moving vehicle? Well, if you work in a circus you will work in a one-room schoolhouse. It's like any ordinary school, with computers, tests, and report cards, it's just that you will be in a cramped place, studying. After school, it's break time. But that's the only free time you will have for the rest of your day. Then, I usually go straight to chores and practice for the show I will do at night. Finally, it's show time for me. Though I am really scared I am happy at the same time. I tried my very best and now the show is over. I am tired and ready to go to bed.                                 I think that working in acircus can be hard but it is very fun at the same time. I put a lot of thought into joining the circus, and now I think I made a fairly wise decision. Though I sometimes feel that working in the circus is very tough, I really enjoy it.

This is usual for me because I work in the circus and the circus life is crazy. I went back to the trailer which we live in. We are on our way to Chicago for our next show. It is 9 AM right now so it is school time. In the circus, the school is the same as any other school. Now, I have a quick break so I go to where the animals are. I play with Bubbles, our chimpanzee. I have to go and work with the animals, now that the break is over.         I went to see Bubbles but she wasn't there. I panicked, I searched everywhere but I could not find her. I had to talk to my boss but when I did I was surprised because he was not mad at me. He said that this has happened before and that he was pretty sure where she was. I followed him and he took me under the trailer where I saw a hole that I had not noticed before. When we looked into the hole she was not there. My boss was speechless, this was his prize monkey and now it was gone. He said that if I don't find out where she was he would fire me. After he went back to his office, I went to my bed and thought hard. Where could she be? I asked myself.       When I went back to the animal tent, I found a note that I hadn't noticed before in Bubble's cage. It said that I had to pay 80,000 dollars if I ever wanted to have Bubbles back. I told the manager abot this and he called the police. The police found fingerprints on  the note and found out it belonged to the former animal handler which I replaced. My boss said that the former animal handler was mean to the animals and was greedy so he fired him. Also, he wanted revenge against me because he thought of me as an enemy. When I was in the university, I was the best at everything and he was second best. He always tried to be first but I always did something creative. I kind of remember him but its been a long time.       Once the police got his address they put him in jail for theft. We had a celebration after our show to honor me for finding Bubbles, our star. Every month I went to talk to the former animal handler and soon we became friends.

Circus people have to take risks but I don't think that that wooed fall of mack a mistakes. The owners of a circus get to travel and they get to discover things that that did not no abut. To join the circus you have to do some cool tricks to amaze the anodes. It wood also cool to win free ticket. I wood also be happy to win tikes for my family. I bet my family wood be glad of me. The only thing people might be scared are clowns.

Third his plan of this story was to help a circus doing the thing he loves and as I said he loved jumping through hoops and then this reminded him about the three branches in his school           about how they were like three hoops and then he remembered why he ever wanted to join a circus and that is why he joined.                 Fourth he was inspired maybe he could inspire more by joining    a circus act so maybe just maybe he could help people recognize   that he could was trying to explain the constitution.       Fifth MOST OF ALL you need to know why he joined well   that my friend is for me to know.

Also Tom juggles many diffrent things. Tom juggles torches, chain saws, pins, and balls. Tom is 20 years old. Tom was born in Missisipi with his family. he travels all around the world. he has been to South America, North America, Japan, and Canada. almost every day Tom wakes up at 7:15AM and by the time a show ends he is home by 11:00PM and normaly in a hotel when on tour. Tom has a tough life.

You are going to have to go to the pie car for breakfast. You still have to go to school. You still are going to have the same exceptions like computers, test and even report cards school at a circus is NOT much different than, a real school.  When school is over it is time for a quick break. After that it is time to do chores and for practice. You are goign to have to feed, water, and even groom the animals. After, the day is over you are going to have time just to sit down and relax with your family to eat dinner but, do not eat much if you are goign to preform that night. You are goignt to have to do 10 shows a week. 	VBG IN DT NN .

I am a circus performer and I am a tight-rope walker. People ask me wht is so fun about going to unknown lands, moving alot, and having a job where you could break your neck. I'n just about to tell you why!            One reason I like woking in the circus is becuase of everything I get to see. Since the cirus I work in travels global, I have been to nearly every part of the world. Just think about it. One week, I wake up in the Niagra falls and then next week I am in Manhattan! I have also seen all the seven wonders of the world.            Another reason why I love the circus I live in so many unique places such as Austrlia, India, China, Costa Rica, Rio de Ja&ntilde;ero, Africa! I see new animals, places, and I meet new people. I bet you don't get to do that!            Some people ask me, ' Aren't you afraid of falling of that high tight-rope?' Well, actually, once you develope the balance, Tight-rope walking is like riding a bike. And it is super fun to walk high up and look at everybody watching me below.            Working in a circus is fun because you see new places, you live in new places and you get to take fun risks.

He was really excited and encouraged to cross the rope an the other side. Everyone was cheering for me I did not want to let them down. Hi I am Raghav, but everyone calls me RAGS. Being a circus tight rope man is very exciting.                The good part about being a tight rope man is that you get to have a lot of hard tricks and you get to stay with your family. The food is your choice. You can see your neighbors and watch them do amazing tricks. No need to go all the way to a circus to see everyone. You are getting the behind the scenes look that no one else gets except the other circus people and the manager. I went to the second show and I was about to fall of the tight rope, but the people cheering me on were encouraging me. 'It is not over until the crowd stops cheering' is what I say. The encouragement is good to persevere you, but it is risky. This is my daily schedule ten shows a week. It is trying, but it is worth the loud cheering for me. I hope you can join too. Well, maybe  I will see you.

When Jamie got older her mother started to teach her life in the circus.At school she alwase talked about circus things,like working,food,and all the stuff they have to be able to do to become an amazing circus performer.On Jackie`s seventeen Birth-day her mother took her to the family circus.Jackie`s mom said she could be in the act next week.Jackie practiced over and over.In the morning mom woke her up very early.She said 'get up its time for breakfast'.She got up and went to a little cart wear they served bacon and pancakes.Then after she rested a while she went to comb the horses she loved that job but she new there was much more than that.Then later she practiced magic and juggling.Her dad came to visit her she has not seen her dad in a long time.Then the show was about to start she could hardly wait to go out there and show her amazing talents.Jackie got her unicycle and she went out after her uncle said'Our new and talented 17 year old....JACKIE!!!         She loved to hear her name said by her relatives who love and appreciated her.She got her unicycle and ran on the stage.She was great she did a back flip of the unicycle,on top of a trampoline then she jumped on a pole and swung herself around.Everyone was amazed a 17 year old could do all those things at once.After the show the audience went wild the were crazy and they just loved her act.Then Jackie took a break and she ate dinner and she spent some time with her relatives for a few hours,then she went to bed thinking of what the audience is going to think next week`s circus.        All in all Jackie had control over the circus when she turned 21. She passed it down to her kids and her kids past it down to their kids.They all reacted the same way Jackie did,happy confedence and hard working. :)                                 	CD RB VBG IN NNP DT NN VBN NNP VBD JJ NN NN JJS IN PRP$ NN VBG IN DT NN DT JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD JJR PRP$ NN VBD TO VB PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN PRP VB JJ IN NN NNS , IN VBG , NN , CC DT DT NN PRP VBP TO VB JJ TO VB TO VB DT NN NN NN NNS IN JJ PRP$ NN VBD PRP$ TO DT NN VBZ NN VBD PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN JJ VBN IN CC JJ DT NN NN NN PRP$ NN RB JJ VBD JJ IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBD RP CC VBD TO DT RB NN IN PRP VBD NN CC JJ IN PRP VBD DT NN PRP VBD TO VB DT NNS PRP VBD IN NN CC PRP JJ RB VBD RB RBR IN JJ JJ PRP VBD JJ CC JJ NN VBD TO VB PRP$ PRP VBZ RB VBN PRP$ NN IN DT JJ JJ DT NN VBD IN TO VB PRP MD RB VB TO VB RP RB CC NN PRP$ NN NN VBD PRP NN CC PRP VBD RP IN PRP$ NN NN JJ CC VBN CD NN JJ : JJ . . .

Now in the present I am 17 and an acrobat. Life in the circus is tiring. You need to wake up really early, Then you need to start practicing for the next show. We practice from the time we wake up until lunch then, after lunch we practice more. Once its dinnertime and dinner is finished we wait until the next show. Around 7 o'clock we crowd in to the circus tent. The clowns paint there faces, the baton throwers get there batons, The acrobats do warm ups and the lion tamers get there lions. By 8 o'clock we're ready to start the show. We walk into the clearing and we look at the happy faced audience and we all smile for there gratitude.                 'ALL UP!' The lion tamers yells as all of his lions stand up. The lions gather in a circle.                 'READY!' The lions wait for the Que. The lion tamer throws a ball in and the lions bounce it to each other. One little rebel of a lion decides to sneak off. The crowd gasps in horror as the lion starts to walk the tightrope.                 'SOMEBODY SAVE THE POOR LITTLE LION!' A little girl from the crowd screams. All of us turn around to see the little lion struggling to get across. Peter our tightrope walker jumps on our super-duper-bouncy-jiggly trampoline he lands on the tightrope. He pushes the lion off of the tightrope to the trampoline. The lion is safe! Everyone sighs letting there stress be relived.                   We continue our show the tightrope walker started walking on the tightrope. The baton thrower did there skit.                  It came time for me to do my skit. I started to do the acrobats but I failed. I started to fall and I thought of a quick plan.                     'I NEED A TRAMPOLINE!' The lion tamer heard me and put a trampoline on the bottom of me. I dropped on the trampoline safely.                      By the time the show ended it was 10 o'clock and I was tired. I lay my head on my pillow and dazed off into a endless sleep. I had a dream of the show awaiting tomorrow.

They all loved each other the same.Then one day they saw a banner that said, '' Circus in town, See it Today!''.Then they knew at once they had to see it.Then there was one problem.Biaunca was afriad of clowns!They tried to make her over come it by having a clown come to their house.She didn't come out of her room.Then when she came out they told her how nice they were by having it give Kiauna and Tiaunna a flower and it worked.I did n't sleep over because I don't like clowns.           While the others were geting dressed Tiaunna and Kiaunna and I snuck into the circus to see the training.We saw acrobats,lions,leopards,and the ringleader.We saw how tough it was to be be in a circus and went back home.While we were walking home we saw a banner that said the show wasn't until the next day..When we came back to the house they got dressed but told them the news.They just shrugged put on a movie at some candy, icecream ,and popcorn and went to sleep.           The next morning we woke up and at breakfast.The show didn't start until 5:00 P.M.We had seven hours to spare so we went shopping,bought fast food,went to the park, babysat our baby cousin Cayleigh down the street, and finally it was 4:00.At 4:30 we first dressed their baby cousin then ourselves.We were all ready at 4:50 and went to the circus. We got lemonade, hot dogs, ice cream, popcorn, and candy.           Since we were a little early they got to meet some of the people before they did their acts.They even took many pictures with them.They got to ride an elephant too.By then it was time to get our seats.Before we went offstage the teams told us to come back after the show to spend more time with them and we said 'okay'.       The acts were more than what they expected.They saw the lion do tricks,the acrobats doing things they never seen not even a gymnast do,they saw clowns on unicycles and more.At the end they did something really special they never did before.Even I Jayia saw it myself because I was there.They told us to come on stage during the show and they said it really loud!We ended up doing a magic trick that we didn't even attempt to do.At the end of the show we thanked them a lot and hoped to see them again.Then I came up with a good idea!I told them,''come to the pool with us tomorrow'' and gave them the address.The next day thay showed up and we all had fun.When we came in the house we went on the computer and saw our pictures online to the world,then we turned on the t.v and were on the news! I will never forget that time.

The owner had to shut it down. The circus today is a museum for rich people. The reason why the circus turned in to an museum.                                                                                                                                 The part why he shut it down The Circus is         because he was not making a lot of money. Business by the circus being closed. So he made a museum for the rich people it worked out good for the owner. He was happy.                  It worked out good for me and the owner. The owner was a boy. His name is Carlos. My name is David and was a happily ever after for Carlos. It was bad at the circus for me. I had to clean up cow mu-newer.                   As you can see, I am in a bad situation now.                     The thing i need is a life.

Also you could be acrobat which is when you are swinging back and fourth on this thing and you have swich rope with another person but you have swing on the rope and do a trick.Then you swich in mid air. You also need to have a lot of practice you just cant walk in a circus and do a show and make your performance come out perfect.                                                                                                                                                You need a lot of practice because if your a acrobat and you have no practice and your in a show and you mess up a lot and next time that many people will come or maybe no one will come.And you also need school because you travel around the world and you need to speak diffrent launguages. Because if you just speak english chinese people wont understand you.You also need school to know how dangerous the circus is because what  if the circus animals get out of control you could die.Also if your acircus tightrope walker you could fall off and you can break your head and die because of how high you   are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is what i was going to tell you guys so if you join the circus remember all these things.So see you in the big city if you become famous because you might become famous because this will give you good advice on what to do in the circus.Oh and i forgot to tell you never be afraid and alwalys try your best in whatever they put you to do so good bye and good luck.

I have two teachers thier names are Mrs.Kirby and Mr.Jordan.I love to go to school to get an good education so I can go to an university or college as long as I am in school while im in my teen years.                                 If I had a mother and a father that were circus people that means that would like to attend the circus and  acually took place in one or even live in one it would take practice and we propbably would never get to have family time like go to the mall and go to a fancy resurant and eat out.                                     I would not certainly want to live in a trailer either because a house is much bigger and can hold heavier things like the bed, dresser, oven, dryer and all of those good things would maybe make the tires of a trailer burst and also a some houses do and do not have wheels on them.

In the circus is a lot of cool things like lion tamers they do lots of cool things like juggler's and lots of other cool things.Circus are fun expressly for little kids.                                                                                                                                                            For Example circus are fun but they are most likely for little kids.But sometimes they can  also be for teenagers.Most circus can be for grownups.But most of  the time some grownups don't like circus but i am a grownup i will like circus.circus are so fun i will take my own kids to a circus because they wound like to go to a circus someday.                    In conclusion the part of  the story i like is were told about what they do in the circus and the reson i like that prat is because it said  a lot of  cool things.

I eat cereal,take a shower,brush my teeth,and brush my hair.I go down with my crew and we rehears everything we do in the circus I do really really cool magic tricks that take a lot of brain focus and skill,my buddy Kaitlyn trains the animals to do tricks (she is really good at it),and Erin will do acrobatics and other things that have to do with flexibility (she is not really good at it) she died while doing acrobatics as a elephant stepped on her we replaced her with Brittney now she is good.       We have to go to state to state to perform while we were on our private jet I talked about how mean,selfish,ugly,and tall Erin was.We have her flat and tall body for our statue so i can beat it!anyway I am sorry i may have gotten a little mad so anyway.           We just started our new show! I did a awesome magic trick where I made my assistant Erin the 2 disaper( I wish she did anyway), Kaitlyn made the animals do really cool tricks,and Brittney did awesome flips.I really love being in a circus.

I joined the circus when I was 3 years old, I get to do acrobatics. When I first started being an acrobate I just did flips and cart-wheels but now that I am 15 years old I get to do all sorts of things, in my latest act I swung off the pole did a triple back flip and landed ontop of a matress straped to an elephant! Ok maybe it was just the net but the elephant would be way cooler. Oh and sometimes I get to help the sorwd thrower by being put on a spinning wheel and have knives thrown at me! It really gets your blood going not to mention your stumache turning! My mom and dad are the owners of the circus so I get to see them every day, unlike the other circus performers who miss their familys a lot. My best friend Lilly is in the circus too we get to do some of our acts together. But I feel bad for Lilly because she doesn't always get to see her family, but we kind of took her in as a family member.            Life in the circus is hard work, practiceing every day 12 shows a week! Not to mention still having to go to school. Sometimes I wish I just had a normal life and didn't have to work so hard. My little brother Tiger or Ty is what I call him wants to be a clown so he's always doing things to make people laugh. One advantage to living the circus life is being able to vist a these cool places like France, Rome, America, Cuba, and all sorts of places. I love the cirus life and I wouldn't give it up for anything.

First did you know that in order to be a circus performer you have to have a special talent. Next you need to learn gymmnastics if you  want to do jumps and flips. Then if you like training animals such as lions, leopards, and elaphants then you should by a pet like a dog.Then youshould train it, and then you could start with different animals.               Living in a circus life could be different. First you will learn new things such as, walking on a rope, acrobats, juggling,and training animals to do tricks. Then you will ride to different places to perform.Then you perform 10 times a week.You might like working with clowns, because you learn new things. Finally you might hate working with the clowns because you will have to ride tons of miles just to do a performance.                There are many things to do when you are working with clowns. You might like working in the circus. I think it will be lots of fun working in the circus.Thats why working in the circus could be lots of fun.

When you get back from school relax. Next, do the chores and practice. Now it is dinnertime. Finally the show is over and I feel so tired I also wonder if I will ever be a performer like my parents.                  In the morning I wake up and get dressed. Then I go to the pie car. We call it a pie car because clowns love pie for food and to throw at people so that is why we call it a pie car. We eat pancakes and bacon. Mean while the crew is getting ready for tonight show.                  Next, it is school time! We have a room for school in a one- room schoolhouse. Our school has  computers, tests, and report cards. The kids in the class speak all kinds of languages because they are from all around the world. Our geography lessons come alive.                   School is over. Now I take a quick break. We get to play with the materials that the clowns use. I also can play with my puppy Candy. She is a poodle because they do not allow big dogs.                     Chores and practice. I feed, water, and broom the horses. Today,  my father will practice siome somersaulting off a running horse. I am working on leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back it takes balance and concentration. Kid are doing juggling and acrobaticts.                      The show is over.

And if you make a mistake like a Acrobat your going to problaby hurt yourself so that is why you need lots of training. And my name is Bob Perez and i am a Acrobat in a Circus.                              You have to practice a lot in a Circus like an Acrobat. It takes a lot of work to be in a Circus. Almost every single day you have to practice being in a Circus. Like practicing how to train a lion, juggling, being on top of a elephant, and doing acrobatics. And you have to do all of that on a stage in front of a lot of people.                                 Once you practice you have to go through every step. Like first jump on a trampaling then on the pole and then the other pole. And once you perform in a Circus you have to memorize everything that you have done while practicing. And sometimes they put it on T.V. so you have to really trie your best. And sometimes you have to do more shows after that and after the first show you have to practice even more until the second show starts.                                    And in the second show you have to do a lot of different moves. So you have to try your best on both of these shows.

In my opinion after the circus would be the hardest part you would have to clean up the bleachers and take down   the tent and transport it somewhere else.                                          Then set it up again then take the animals to the tent and go home. Then the next morning you would get up drive back to the tent feed the animals.                                                                                       Then you would make sure the animals aren't sick and make sure there cages are clean and if they aren't well you have to clean it up. Then you would get dressed and put everything up like the bleachers the tight rope and the ladder pool beach ball and put out the rest of the equipment.Then collect the tickets and let people inside then when everybody has took there seat you would have to get the animals and have the show.

After we got that done and situated we saw the acrobat high in midair. When we watched the circus it was like they did not know we were their thats how focesed they are. Then they picked a kid to go up and help them do a magic trick.                            When they did the magic trick they lit a big stick on fire and had him hold it why they lit one more and juggled them.The kid got to keep the two sticks when they were done doing the magic trick with them and they were not on fire anymore.When the elephant had a rider on it they had to put a chain around them so they did not fall off. Two min later they got off and had to go sit back down. When they got done with the animals they had the tightrope walker come out.                                         Then they walked around for a while and finally they got done. When they were done you could go take pictures with the animals. But we left and it was a fun but boring show. Then we left and I was about to have a headache. Last that is my last circus that I went to.

If I was in a circus I would do that. There is a rope tied between 2 poles and you have to walk across it. It would be awesome!         Being a tightrope walker would be fun.You have to be still and steady. You cant be too nervous or yo will fall off. This happens in every circus. The rope is high in the air so you will have a hard fall.        Being in the circus would be fun but I would not do it. If I was in a circus I would do the rope walking. It would be good for me because I'm not afraid of heights at all. The circus is awesome. Although I will never be in it.

Also you have to make everyone smile!            If you watch a circus it seem cool. But it is very hard to do. Like do flips. Climb ropes and jump on them. It is fun to go to them but is hard to do.          It is fun watching the animals. they roar and talk too. they are very amazing. they are smart to. They are tamed.          The elephant is the biggest. They roar. The shoot water from their trunks. They are very cool animals. I want to ride one one day.          clowns are funny. but they some times scare people. i feel bad for clowns. i think the clowns are the best. they wear funny make-up.          clowns get hit by pies alot. it is fun to watch. some clowns get hit by other foods too. i think they are super cool.           the other people their are funny too. some are fire twilers. some also do flips and cart wheels. i like the magic guy!          Well thats a circus! They are cool and fun. Some times you have to work hard. Most of the time you have fun though. Go to a circus.

When you go to a circus there is only one thing you need to look out for. Having two much fun! I will tell you the story of how the circus is brought to life. I will tell you about the Setup, The Clowns, and what a show is like.               Our setup here at the circus is very interesting.We live in vans with about two other members of the circus. In all we have about two hundred members in all. On a normal year we have one hundred vans! Inside the van's are two bedrooms, one bathroom, a TV room and a couch, oh don't forget the kitchen. Our meals normally are things that you can put in the microwave. Sometimes if we are lucky we get to go out. The animals sleep in their cages. We have a special place for all the cages so none of the animals get taken away. When you take a overview picture you will see a place for all the vans. A huge amount of animal cages. One mini house that contains some bathrooms. Five mini food stands and then the circus. The color of the circus is red and white. The pattern is like swirls. We are known as the BIG APPLE CIRCUS.              The clowns are the main attractions. That is because we put so much time and effort in to them. When the clowns get out of bed the first thing they do is walk to the costume designing van. ?When they get here the costume designer makes sure that they get the worst clothes to mach. This makes them look really odd. Finally there bow tie with sparkles tops everything. When they have all of that they walk over to the hair designer. The hair designer gives them a very wacky wig and a very bright hat to top their head. When this is all done they have one more trip to make. The face painter! Our face painter gets all of their face red, then white, then a big red button for their nose. Finally they get to put on there gloves to show that they are ready to show off there skills.   Finally it is time for the show. Get the clowns ready, get the horses yapping and let the show begin. 'Welcome to the circus! As the lights start to dim backstage is a tsunami waiting to irrupt. Finally the irrupt explodes and the actors do what they do. The clowns are falling on their backsides and the acrobats jump all over the sky. The juggler juggles bananas on fire. Horses cantering all around. This is the BIG APPLE CIRCUS. Memories that i will always remember is the day i was in the circus. A clowns job is always to tell stories that are funny to the mind but all I want to tell you today is that great things happen even when you do not expect them to happen.         The circus is an amazing place and i hope you enjoy the experience one day two.

You have to visit 150 cities. You need to wake up at 7:00 A.M., and get dressed. Then you go to school. When school is over you need to have a little break because you will need to get ready for the circus show. When you are done with your break you need to do chores and a little bit of practice for the show. You go do the show, and you do what you have been doing at home, what you have practice. When the show is over at around 11:00 P.M. Walk back to the trailer, and go to sleep.

Most of the time you are always traveling to all different places about 20,000 miles apart. The circus goes to about 150 different places. You never get to have time off to be having fun.       2. If you had dreamed about going in a circus I would not say try it unless you had a very good talent to enter a really good circus team. They are always working on there trips to different places. When you never get time off and you are working 365 days a year I feel bad for the people that have to.       3. One of the upsides of being in a circus is that you get to see and travel all across the world.You get to go to so many different places. You are go to have about 100 different people that treat you like family. They are always by your side no matter what. They are always there if you are hurt so I say you could try out if you want to. But I say you should only try out if you have really have good talent. So try if you want to. If you get hurt your circus family will always be there for you. So don't worry you will be fine.

Well, Bella Castini works with a circus everyday from sunup to sundown.   When you work for a circus you must have a special talent. In this case Bella's   talent is with horses she leaps from a trampoline and onto a horses back. Now you   have to have some bravery and talent to do that!        Bella lives in a trailer with her family and goes to school in a traveling one room   school house. Bella still has a house in Florida too but she is mostly on the road.   Bella's parents are in the circus along with her being in the circus involves time,   dedication,talent,flexibility and luck.              The circus has things like...  tight rope walkers,Clowns,acrobats,Circus horse acts   and Circus animals! The Circus is where Bella works and she sees people from over   ten shows a week.Being on the road with a circus can have some downs too.You   only get to see your family outside of the Circus when you are in the city they live   in or take time off. Also you work on the weekend and train on the weekend too!                    At the end of the day you are wiped out but it is all worth it because now everyone your the person who jumped on a horses back! And you gave that thought to all   the kids who came to see the show. The circus is fun to see hard to perform  but amazing all together.                 	NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN DT JJ IN PRP$ NN WP VBZ CC VBZ NN IN DT NN .

The first thing you need to know is dancing. I know its a circus but dancing is an important factor. You need to learn how to do certain dances. These will help you in your performance.           You need to learn how to unicycle as well. It takes balance because your on one wheel but once you got it you got it. You then need to learn how to juggle. This is a hard process but you have to be able to throw the balls in the air and catch continuing this process while on the unicicle and you have to know where the ball is so you cant look down.

'No,actually i just finished.'Her answer didn`t surprise me;she tends to get up at 6:30 in the morning.   When I finished my breakfast,I checked the time;7:50.Just in time to see    the tiger.When the train started to come to a stop;I got up so fast I nearly tripped over my footing.I loved helping set up,but I really wanted to see the tiger.I ran outside when the train came to a final stop and caught up to Mauricio.When I opened my mouth to say something he stopped and said in his italian accent'I already told you could come,you don`t have to keep asking!'.I blushed.I knew what he was talking about; lastnight,I`d begged him halfway to death to let me come.Finally after two and a half hours of saying please,pretty please,please with a cherry on top(I have a record for holding my breath)he`d said yes right when my voice started to get sqeaky.'I was just going to say good morning but yeah that works too'I told him.'I`m just going to get my backpack and i`m ready'I told him'O.K, I`ll see you at the train stop'he replied.I nodded and ran to my train cart to get my phone(pictures),wallet(you never know when there might be something pretty on sale),and my backpack.I rode Blackjack;one of our horses(my favorite one in particular)and rode off to the train station.   When Maurico and  his assistants came I told them 'Finally!'   I had been waiting for forty-five minutes.I had been jumping from excitement,or maybe just ten cups of coffee pimps me up a little.Ross;one of Mauricio`s assistants rolled his eys at my exitement, but i just ignored him.We made our way to buy the tiger.When we got to the other circus manager him,Mauricio,and his assistants all went inside this big room to talk leaving me alone in the hallway.When Ross finally came out he told me we had to wait but the deal was done.The other assistant came out to tell us that we should go to camp,it was going to take a while.We got our horses and rode off to camp.When we got back the whole camp was set up so i just went insiide and read a book.three hours later;it was time for the show and mauricio and the tiger still weren`t back.I went backstage to get ready.         After I finished putting on my make up and changed into my circus clothes I heard Mauricio`s voice on speaker for the introduction.It was my turn.I got behind the curtain and got on Blackjack.Once we did our performance;which was riding Blackjack through flaming hoops,no biggie.we went around the back and watched from the audience.The acrobats show was amazing.Shannon and Isabel had learned new tricks.the tightrope act was kinda tricky at first but he got the hang of it.It was time for the tiger act.the white tiger galloped out there and did all these amazing stunts you couldn`t think were possible for a tiger.It did the craziest of things and listened and obeyed Mauricio`s every command             After a while we went to sleep.You would think that after seeing a tiger you couldn`t fall of sleep .I think i beat that statement easily.                                        The End.

First of all, the circus preformers will need to find a place or a location to have the circus and preform. They have to make sure its a public place.          Second thing is that the preformers need make sure the have ads or papers to put out so everyone would know.         Third thing they would have to make sure they know what stunts they are doing or preformances.       Finally they would have to make sure they are ready and they have everything to preform.

I have been studying it ever sense. Whenever the circus is in town i always beg my mom i want to go but, we couldn't go because we didn't have the money. When i was six years old i started to watch videos of the circus. I started to get more and more into it.   In one video i saw people bending and twisting no other humans can bend! I was very amused.So I started to give it a try. I practiced and practiced until i can do it. One day later, i finally did it! I can be flexible.                         One day, i was watching TV then my mom came in with a big smile on her face. she said that we had enough money to go to the circus. Then, i started to have a big smile on my face. I jumped up and down, up and down, till i got dizzy. My mom said more . She said that we have tickets and our own show! The smile on my face got bigger. I also said how many people can we take? My mom said we can take the whole family. 'One ticket for me, one for you , one for your father, one for your sister , and one for your brother'. 'So i bought five tickets'. I began to do cartwheels all around the room. I don't think i can go to sleep tonight.                         I told my brother and my sister about what happened, and they got really exited too. Tomorrow is going to be the best day ever! At night, i started to do a back flip and a front flip. My mom came into the room rubbing her eyes and said 'go to sleep young lady'! I hopped into bed and pretend to go to sleep. When my mom exited the room, and i started to do flips again. In the morning, i started to get dressed and eat my breakfest. So did my brother and sister. We were all ready to go to the circus. When everyone was ready we all went to the car and drove to the circus.                                                                                                                               By the time we got there i saw a lot of people in line to go to the circus. We had to wait a long time to get in front of the line. When we got in all of the circus people were going nuts. I asked one clown what was going on and he said 'our flexible person is sick! We don't have backup'! Then i said'no the show must go on'.'But h-how are we going to do that'? the clown said. 'I saw videos of people being flexible in the circus, i started doing it and i mastered it perfectly'. The clown said 'great, we'll put you in a costume then. The show must go on'! He grabbed my arm and pulled me back stage. There were a lot of people crowding around me. They put an itchy costume on me then, they put me in line.'i don't think i can do this any more'. 'Oh relax you will be fine' the clown said. I gulped and tried to calm down.                                                                                                     Everyone was lining up behind me, then a guy was on the stage saying 'who's ready to see our amazing bender'. Everyone cheered. Then the clown said 'that's your cue'. I gulped again and walked up to the stage. I saw thousands of eyes looking at me. I pretended that i was alone, and started doing tricks that everyone couldn't do. Everyone oohed and aah-ed, then the guy came up to the stage and said 'let's give it up to the amazing bender everybody'. Everyone clapped and cheered. I walked up back stage and saw my family and the circus people smiling my mom hugged me and said that i did a great job. When the show was over the guy walked up to me and said ' hi my name is Bill, i think some day you are going to join the circus'. 'ya' i said. I looked at the stage one more time and said 'some day'.

We had been on the train for five hours, so I figured we were getting close. I looked around, watching all the other acrobats and clowns practicing their tricks. I was about to get up, but my feet were so sore from walking that skinny tightrope, that I decided to just rest.          My name is Alexis Bone and I am a tightrope walker. For many kids, I have the dream job, but it is not all you think it would be. I'm talking about long days, late nights, and being away from home. I figured that it was all worth it when I got named 'Best Tightrope Walker in America' at just age eleven. I was excited for our biggest performence of the year, but nervous too. I looked out the window- we were there.         It was 5:00 P.M. The show starts at six. Our crew works on the finishing touches while I warm up. I looked at the clock- six. I started to hear the familiar voice of our ringmaster, Mr. Brian O'Haris.   ' Hello, and welcome to... Circus Sundown!!!'   His voice boomed throughout the large tent. First up was the acrobats. Next were all the clowns and animals. Finally it was the trappeze people and me.          I decided to rest my feet and watch the performences through the T.V. backstage. I watched the acrobats do their amazing stunts, I watched The clowns riding in the small car next to the huge elephants, and when I saw the trappeze people coming out, I stood just behind the entrance, waiting for my cue.         I saw my cue to start climbing up the tall ladder in the back of the tent that leades to the tightrope. When I got up to the top, I felt like I was going to be sick. My nerves went crazy as I heard my final cue.         I stepped onto my platform- the crowd went crazy! That made me feel a little better, but when the music stopped, I went back into fully terrified mode. I stepped on the wire, scrunched my feet, and began. I tried to look confident as I started to make my way across the wire. I was focusing so hard on not falling, I didn't notice that I was done. I threw my hands up and bowed. The crowd went crazy as they gave me a standing ovation.

411	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	W			F	516685	5	11074701	Y	56196	        Have you ever wished to join a circus? Have you ever been asked to join a circus? Well I can say yes to all of those questions! My name is Rachel Dolphie Loveer and I'm here to talk about being an acrobatic in the circus and what life is like in a circus. Just to begin let me say it is an exciting, amazing, but incredibly hard job. You have to practice, practice, practice every day. But when you get into the ring every minute you spent practicing is worth it. The crowd cheers and all you see is the smiling faces all around you.                                                                              After I wake up and eat my breakfast its all about school and acrobats for me and my family. First I learn regular things like you and then I practice. Then after a half an hour of 'backbending' work its time for a stretch-break. At  4:00 p.m its more practicing for me with multiple water breaks in between. Then at 7:30 its show time!              Everyone goes into the backstage tent as our director tells about our circus. After two hours of a light show-time practice its my turn to shine. Verso, our circus director, says, 'And now for our youngest little acrobatic! Who, at age 13, can do more than her father, Marcos! I introduce to you Rachel Dolphie Loveer!' I cartwheel out and twist and turn in the air as I jump into center stage. I lift my head to a squealing baby girl in the front row. She breaks into a wide smile as I climb into the air before twisting, turning, and swinging everywhere. I jump and spin like no other while still being the most graceful acrobatic in the ring. This is what the circus is all about to me.               Then I bow to the audience as they clap, whistle, and shout my name at me. I back bend slowly then walk out on my hands to enthusiastic applause. My family pats me on the back as soon as I'm in the backstage tent. I hear everyone telling me how amazing I was as I smile, hug, and high-five my family. The circus is the best place in the world for me at this moment.                I would give up everything to be right here everyday. And I am! My life is perfect in this moment right here. This is my circus life! I watch as everyone does there acts while congratulating everyone who finishes. After a few more hours the circus is finished. I settle into bed at 12:00 a.m. but that's alright. I did amazing at the show and that's all that matters. Tomorrow it will start again until I'm to old to bend so well. But that doesn't matter right now. Because I'm in the circus, and this is my life.                                                      	NNP PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NN . NNP PRP RB VBN VBN TO VB DT NN . NNP PRP MD VB NNS TO DT IN DT NNS .

As said from Bella Castini and Philippa Hayball, the circus life is difficult and can't be done by just anyone.  There's many things to do like practice or fit in a good meal, and then there's getting started with it all.                 When ever you feel like joining the circus, you must remember some important things first.    The circus is not just a huge playground with an audience all the time.  You've got to travel very far distances from home all over the world, sometimes even 20,000 miles in seven months each and every year could be your life.  Hopefully you know different languages.  The day is work from when the sun goes up to when the sun sets down.  There's also the getting in part of the circus.  You must have a specific talent to join, and you must be good at it.  When you get in, the day seems very long, if you are a child, don't think you've just avoided school for the rest of your life.  It may not be exactly the same, but you still have tests, report cards, computers and everything a regular school needs.  When you're ready, it's time for the show, remember, you have at least until late in the night for relaxation, practice, and food.  The way the circus works is tough so you should be ready for a whole different turn in your life.                                          Now, the life of a carney in the circus is insane.  You wake up early then head to get breakfast.  For the kids, it's school time right after.  You must be able to memorize languages from all over the world.  The classmates you have could be from France or Italy and still not speak your language.  Even though you have a busy day, you still get tests and report cards.  As soon as the school is over you might have time for a short break, but then it's off to practice.  Oh, and don't think yo have no chores any longer!  You then get dinner and then it's off to the show.  As soon as the show is over you may just want to crawl into bed.  You get about 7 hours of sleep, maybe that is.  Your usual bed time is around 12:00 A.M. The life of a carney is crazy and tiring.                                 The talents you need must be very different and unusual.  There's singing, dancing, and being amazingly flexible.  You could be an acrobat or perhaps a trapeze artist, maybe a clown or a juggler, there's the job of a tightrope walker as well.  You may have wanted to be a performer your entire life or you have just gotten sick of your regular life and wanted to do more.  Some people have been doing performing for years.  Like doing gymnastics, music, or acting as a starter.  Philippa Hayball said, 'When I was 11, I knew I wanted to be a performer, so I went for it.'  One talent that every carney should have is concentration.  You need to put your heart in it throughout everything.  As a carney, you have the priorities of being in the circus.  You need to have the talent they have every day to be in the circus.                     If you ask anybody who lives in the circus, they will tell you their is and upside and a downside to the package of the circus.  The upside includes the chance to travel around the world.  You may be able to make new friends too.  Everyone you meet can become your family.  The thrill itself of performing for a live audience is amazing.  Their job is to play and have fun every night.  They see it as a pleasure to have our faces be filled with such joy that is so unexplainable to anyone.  The audience is almost taken to whole different world.  Sadly, there is a downside to the job of a circus performer.  The fun and games has an end at some point.  Even though it's a glamorous lifestyle, there are drawbacks.  There's nowhere you can really call home and that can really enter the mind during a night's show.  Some miss their own gardens and pets and family.  Truly but sadly, they don't often see their family.  Plus, the work is so tiring during the long hours of the days, even weekends.  The upsides can be great, but the downside can be most unpleasant with the life of a carney.                      The life of a circus performer is like living in a, well, circus.  Crazy, wild, fun, but also sad.  Philippa Haybal and Bella Castini have their experiences with the circus.  It can't be easy all the time and there is the day when you just can't do a thing.  They have said that when you're in the circus, your whole life begins to change.

Jumping over rings of fire to clowns juggling on a unicycles it made them look bewildered. So one of the people in the group decided that they should join the circus. They ended up becoming performers and were sent straight to work.       First, One of the people in the group loved animals and signed up to be a animal trainer. So when she got to her area she realized she saw a sign labeled Lions  and on a little table there was a whip and some meat for the lion. She crept inside feeling very terrified that there was one large lion just sitting there looking very hungry. As the girl crept up to the lion it began to growl  and then roar. Quickly the girl whipped the lion and it crawled to the corner looking very angered because he was  whipped and it stared at the meat for a long time until the girl gave him some. after that they started doing a lot of tricks.       Next, the tallest of the group and he oldest decided he wanted to tightrope walk. All he had to do was cross the tightrope and he would be done for the day.when he got on he made it thirteen steps until he fell then the next was fourteen steps and then fifteen steps and then he finally did it he passed the twenty step tightrope and collapsed on the ground do to him being extremely tired and after he climbed down the ladder he rested on the ground.       Then, the next person who was the youngest in the group joined acrobatics when he jumped he missed the rope and broke his arm. After the ambulance came for and put on his cast he came back because he didn't want to miss the matinee and once it was his turn to jump he sprinted and then jumped but this time he didn't miss the jump and he started becoming known as 'one arm'.       Finally, The group walked back to the pie car after the show and talked about what they did. The girl talked about the lion and the oldest talked about the tightrope and the youngest talked about his acrobatic accident. After they thought about they realized that they all faced their fears.       When the whent to sleep they all thought of their journeys and what they did not realizing that they had another big day ahead but none of them cared they only wanted rest.

Living in a circus life can be  very tuff sometimes you have to do dangoures stuff,  like going on a rope and trying to cross it or jumping through a ring of fire.           If you are in the circus you have to be willing to give up time to practice, work on tricks, and even travling.          You may think that a circus life is easy but you have alot of responsibilites being in the circus you have to make sure you don't get hurt and make sure you don't hurt anybody else.         A circus life is fun being with your clown friends but it isn't so fun when you have to practice but that's a part about being in the circus you have to practice, if you want to acomplish something you have to practice they didn't get that good by just watching somebody do it they practiced it.     They have to travel places all the time for shows, they have to make riscay disions, and live in a trailer.          You have to study to get tricks.    Being in a circus isn't all high-flying fun and games and clowning around but it's more glamorous than being a accountant.        Circus people don't get to see there familes as much as we do because they are always on the road   you have to do alot of hard work.  Circus people are amazing. 	DT NNP . . .

Being a circus need to have a specific talent, a good body type and have to be determined. Being in the life of circus is not all high-flying fun or clowning around with people. Circus need to travel to alot of places and have to learn tricks for the show and they have to leave their home for along time.It takes alot of effort to be a circus, acrobat or even trapeze.

He went inside the tent, and felt exhausted just by looking at his father practicing his performing skills. He then saw his older sister, Kathryn getting ready for the show, and his mother helping performers plan their outfit.            Daniel went to the dressing room, and put on his costume.He put a robe around his costume. Then, the make up artist made his face look like a clown. He was ready for the show! The other performers went outside to the pie car and ate pancakes, bacon, and hashbrowns, while drinking apple juice. He joined his father and practiced his juggling while standing on one foot, and his tightrope walking acts. He went backstage, and got his sister. He asked her if she wanted to do a very special performance with her. Excitedly, she said,'YES,'.             So they practiced and and practiced and practiced until they got it right. 'I can't do this anymore!' said Kathryn. Daniel kept encouraging her to keep trying, and said,'c'mon it's already planned, and we have a special time performing towards the end of the show for everyone.' But Kathryn didn't listen and ran away.             At the end of the show, Kathryn didn't show up. Daniel didn't want to cancel, so he went with the plan. As he introduced himself to the crowd, Kathryn came out! Daniel was surprised, and proud of his sister. They did their special performance, standing on top of horses!

Also making funny faces and they ride on tiny unicycles,a unicycle is is a bicycle with one wheel.The circus is fun but it can be dangerous because you can fall of the rope will riding a unicycle and below  a pit of crocodiles.     In the circus you can also see people riding elephants and cutting them them in half and come back into on piece.also people standing on one leg on a rope and below water some times.Also you can see circus horses.Also circus acrobats,circus jugglers,and circus tightrope walkers     The view of the circus is train tracks around it and like a hut that is red and white from the view up.Inside it is kinda dark and little trailers outside and little car they all fit in.     There can also be animals that juggle or play a song.Also they can  ride a unicycle while juggling.Also they can slide a real sword down there mouth and entertain the people that came to see them preform there show.The circus is a fun place you can enjoy.I hope you visit the circus but remember it is dangerous.

I mean, I should know because I, Sarah Newton, am a circus performer.  I do many things in the circus.  For example, I'm a tight-rope walker, and I am wonderful at acrobatics, which is a wonderful combination. Would you like to here about my life in the circus? Well then sit down and listen, because it's a long story.      A morning at a circus is hectic for me. I have to go over my routine with my partner, and my solo routine. I must help to set up the tents and a few rides so that the circus is ready for you. It is hard work but it's all worth it to go on stage and perform! It is amazing to know all of the people that I know; in the circus people have many different personalities, but we all have one thing in common, we are very, very, very daring. There is a swordsman, Richard, who puts a sword down their throat and doesn't feel a thing! There is also someone, whose name is Jacquelin, lays on a bed of nails and it doesn't even faze her! My partner in acrobatics is Christopher, and he is very charming, but sometimes when we practice, he acts like he's going to drop me. Those times are quite frightening, but I now know when he is fooling around.      An afternoon at a circus is nerve-racking and exciting! I do my stunts with Christopher (hanging upside-down is plenty of fun) , do my solo in ballet with a mixture and pop, and watch the other amazing performances. I am everything at once when the circus performance of that day is over, I am exhausted, excited, happy, and sad that the show is over. Many people congratulate me, and I them. It always is a WONDERFUL day!      At night a crawl under my sheets and blankets and think about what tomorrows show will have in store, and where we'll be in a week or so; there is always one last thing that I always think before drifting off to sleep though:                                                           Circus life is wonderful, fun, and tough.

Austin is a person thats works in the circus and says that people in the circus do chores and all sorts of chores to.              One chore is that you have to clean stuff like the horses. You have to take responsibilties to do things. They have so much work to do in a day.                 There show probaly ends at night so the dont get that much sleep.

Like 7:00 they did a show at night . At 3:00 the clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls.At 3:30 trainers worked with elephants, lions, and chipmanzees. At 6:30 they did anthor show at night they do 10 shows a week.                   I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration. other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics.Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.                   10:00  the show is over I'm  tired and wiped out from the show. when walking back to our trailer,we pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables,and trailers. Two days from now, we all set up in another town.               12:00 in bed i'm thinking about the end of our touring season. When I grow up, will I still be a circus performer like my parents? Who knows? The circus is fun, but it's a busy and tough life.           not just anyone can go andjoin the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. You need to have a specific talent, the right body type and be very determined.     	NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN WDT VBN NN IN JJ NNS , IN JJ NNP NNP CD PRP VBD DT NN IN NN .

When their  not performing they are washing animals, practicing, and feeding and watering animals. To be a performer you have to have many skills. You have to be flexible and balanced. Many people believe that the circus is mostly fun and games, but there is a lot of work to be done to be able to make things happen on stage.       You have to train the animals and practice with them.the days are long. First you eat breakfast. Then you practice and practice. Next you go to school. Then you get a quick break. Then it is time to set up for the show. Finally it is action time.There are many techniques to being a circus performer. Before I joined the circus I thought it was all fun. Then I figured out the real circus behind the performing.

So later on when you go to the circus you will enjoy the nice time that people get money for performing for you to watch. Some oother people who practice they usally don't earn money because they usally don't performed.     well I'll see you at the next performance later on and remeber WIN FRONT ROW SEATS AT THE CIRCUS.

My parents vanished and I had heard really bad things about the orphanage. Just like what most kids would do I ran away to join the circus. My name was Angelina, but I was worried the police would find me and put me in the orphanage. So I changed my name to Taylor. I found a circus that was heading out of my town. They let me come along but only said maybe when I asked if I could join their circus. Soon I got to know some of the other circus kids. There was a little red haired boy whose name was Jimmy, there was the acrobat, Lea who was 15 and really nice, and then there was the Grinto triplets they were a fun group of little girls, their names were Jenna, Joy, and Janelle. I was new to the show and had to practice hard. I stayed with Lea who was also a runaway, soon she seemed like a big sister to me. We had shows every day and it was really tiring. The circus was soon like my new family. I was training to be an acrobat like Lea. Soon I was ready and got to perform with Lea for the first time.              I forgot about my life before the Clover Circus and my troubles before the circus too, until it was time to pack up and leave for the two month break between seasons. Where could I go? Lea and I both had no where to go. We wandered around the town together. But then we saw it, the miracle we needed. We went to the door of a building that said,' Do you need a home for a little while or some one who can take care of you. That's me, Miss Peps and my crew.' Taylor and Lea had found their stop. They rang the bell and sure enough there was a nice looking young lady with some small children beside her. They were welcomed inside and then explained their situation. The two girls were given a room to share and were graciously welcomed into the household. Soon enough our two month break was over and back to the circus we went. We re-trained and went back to performing. One day we were ready to perform but Lea was not in the prep area practicing. I knew something was wrong. I hurried to our trailer only to find Lea lying in her bed. I looked at her and I could just tell she was very ill. I told the rest of the cast and crew who imitiatly called a doctor.             I did the show without Lea but it wasn't the same. Lea had been in bed for days before we found her sickness. She had the Mario sickness which could be deadly and was rarely cure-able. The doctor gave his medicines and the nurse tried her remedies but Lea did not get any better. By now she had been sick for three months. I was very worried indeed. The doctor said that Lea's case was very hard. She was inching closer to possible death each day. She was moved to a hospital where she was tested and treated some more. One day she got a call from the hospital but she was so worried that it was bad to pick it up. She weeped and weeped thinking that the call had been because of Lea's passing. Then Jimmy knocked on the trailer door and then quickly came in. 'What are you so sad about Taylor?' 'I thought you would be exited to know that Lea is recovering.' 'What?' Asked Taylor. 'Yeah, her sickness was cured.' Sure enough about a week later Lea came home.             Our show went back to normal and Lea and I stuck together. We always went back to Miss Peps during the off season. We both stayed on the  Clover Circus our whole lives but we both made families. I married Jimmy and we had two little girls and one little boy, their names were Angelina, Lea, and Zack. Lea married a man named Brad and also had three kids, two girls and one boy whose names were Taylor, Marina, and John. They all lived a great and successful circus life.

You could want to be an actor that is not it. it is a circus performer.            There is a lot of things you need to know to be a performer. First you need to know what your doing. Also if you can even do what you whant to do. Then you have to try out for what you whant to be. After you hope you got the part.            You have to be very fit to be a circus performer. You also need to work out a lot. The first hting you should do is go to the gym. Secound you should start to run or jog. Finnaly you should dring lots of water.            There are lots of jobs in the sercuse. The first one is my favorit the lion tamer or animal tamer ether one. They are a lot more like acrobat. Theres also horse rider and a eleapheant rider. They are way more but i like the clown.            They are very many jobes in a circus. They are all very cool you should probably weight till you get old. that is why i like the circus. they are very talinted.

But I mite be a clown and do the funny stuff like spit water out of a flower, or shoot shirts out of a launcher and ride in small cars that I can not fit in to and have some cool hair that will be blue and have red lips and have some funny close to were.

The circus is a fun place to be because you get to be a clown, lion tamer and a acrabat. But I want to be a clown cause I am a funny person.               Being a performer seems easy but its not you have to wake up really early in the morning around 7:00 a.m. and don't get off till 10:30 p.m. You also have to go on long rides to preform at different parts of the world. So don't being a preform and thinking it is very easy be prepare.                When you are a preformer you do some dangous stuff one mistake can make you end up in the hospilte. Here are some examples like when you are a lion tamer the lion could attack you, when you are a acrabat you do something wrong you could fall and get a really bad concussion and end up in the hospilte.                 So if you want to be a preformer you should be prepare to wake up early in the morning and get off at late times. Also all the thing that can happen to your body during a preformance. Be for the circus.

It is a lot of work being in the circus and we do about 10 shows a week 1 every day a competition on Wednesday night and 2 shows Saturday and Sunday.          'Being in the circus is like having a second family.' Francis [the clown] told me.'Just like any other family we have to work together and watch out for each other.'Francis is the face of the company and if we were a family she would be the mom.          Phillipe is our boy acrobat he does a performance with Frannie. they won best acrobats at the C.G.A [Circus group awards].'Frannie and I both love our job.' Says Phillipe. ' We hope to have this job for a long time.' says Frannie.          Believe it or not as a child Frannie used to be terrified of the clowns at the circus.         You can still join the circus but do me a favor and make sure that your heart is set to it.

Our one- room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school, ours has computers, testes, and report cards. Becauce the circus performers are from all over the world, many of my classmates speak other languages: French, Russian, and Italian, like my family.

People at the circus do crazy stuff like do lots of back flips. The circus goes on at the fair grounds every year. The circus has people who play as the clown,acrobats, and the tightrope,and the one and only the circus horses.  The person who does the circus horses trains the horses to do lots of trick. The person who does the tightrope walking, gets really god ballent to do the tight rope.            The person who does the juggler has to practis how to juggle for the big circus. The most inportant persone is who talks to the people that watching the circus. He or she is important because it is the most talkitive person in the circus so that is why. So that is what i know about the circus.

My name  is  _________ me my mom and my dad are big cat trainers in the circus. I started my first aproaches when i was 9, at first i was very scared i knew what big cats are like and at first didn't want anything to do with them but luckily it wasn't as bad as i imagined it being.       Jasmine is my favorite out of all the cats she is a female tiger and fun to practice with. Me and my parents got her from a zoo in _________ when she was just a cub shes been my best friend ever since. Although it was fun at first taking care of the tigers,lions etc and helping my parents train them it was LOTS of work i had to get up 5:00am-6:00am to clean all of their cages feed them and get them new water before i went to the performance that we had to get ready for inbetween 7:00am-8:00am (1 hour drive).       Once we got there i still wouldn't get a break from all the work i had to do in the morning once it starts the bright eyes would always hurt my eyes and my ears would pop while the man talks into the mimchrophone. It's also hard to keep your patience when you wait like nearly an hour to go on and once you to go on your so stressed out you want to puke.and i dont know how many times i've messed up the performance with the easiest job! Walking the cats around the rign! How easy does that sound? Well its easy enough until the cat freeks out or get distracted! also it makes me mad that my parents get all of the money that we earn i mean cant they see that im part of the performance to? I mean am i just working for nothing!?       Once we get home i have to feed the cats, clean their cages, and get them new water all over again while my parents relaxe adn watch tv in the house. Right after i finish we have to go to another performance and do it all over again and you know what when your parents are in the circus with you there is no backing out so im kinda stuck here until i get married and buy a house or until my parents just pass away so if you want to join a circus i suggest changing your mind because the is a 100% chance your not goin the enjoy it that much and its not as easy as it looks, you need to be skilled like you cant just do a flip on a trampoline and decide to be an acrobat but there are still possibilities that if you work really hard your dream will come true and if this is really what you want to do, go for it down back out keep going there will be rewards for doing it!

Its not easy sometimes because remember, I do this everyday.I have to get up early everyday,and get ready for school.When I get to school it stresses me out from all the learning! When school is over,I have to practice for the circus. It takes lots of practice to get everything right. After I practice,im still a normal person, so I clean my trailer because it makes me feel better.But dont forget,the day isnt over yet. I still have alot more work to do before the day is young.Next I eat dinner but since I have alot of shows everyweek, I have to eat light. Now since im done eating, I practice a little more before the show.When they call us out and we see seats getting filled with people,we know its time to start.After another big day,I go home wondering how the next show would be. Im tired and all I can think about is sleep. I always dream about what my life would be when im older. I wish to be an amazing performer! I also dream about my home and my family. I dont get to see them often becuase I work weekends too.If you ever want to join the circus be prepared and know that when you leave your family,you only get to see them for a short time. But although the circus is fun and you travel everywhere with your friends,dont forget to visit your family sometimes. Well my day is over and this is the life of being in a circus, you should try it sometime and you would know that its amazing. 	PRP VBP IN DT NN CC NN PRP , PRP VBZ DT RB JJ NN .

It's a very interesting job I think.           In a circus you need to learn a lot of things for example you need to learn languages acrobasis and to jugle and a lot of stuff I like going to circus       My favorite things they do on circus is that they walk on the tightrope its very scary I think and its very interesting they're balancing       I like going to circus because it's a very interesting job I enjoy going to circus . They are very trained people I love they're job .           I hope you enjoyed reading this story bye.

Would I have a normal life with normal friends, or a nice cozy house where I could lay next to the fire place with my pet dog? People who have normal live's always wish to have one like mine. They just don't understand how hard it is!                 When I wake up I have to eat breakfast, go to school, and when I come home I'm still busy practicing for our show. There are some upsides to being in a circus. I get to travel around the world and see all the the different places. I also love going on stage and watching the audience's excitement when something happens. On the other hand, living in the circus is hard. I never get to sleep! I am always so busy, I work from sunup to sundown. I hardly ever see my family either.                      In the circus I have lots of friends, they're like a second family to me. We always have time to play, just not very much time. The clowns always let me play with their stuff, I especially love to ride their unicycles. Some of my friends own lots of wild animals. They ocasionally let me walk with them and their animals.                  Having a life in the circus seems cool, and it is, but having a normal life seems fun too. I don't know if I'll stay in the circus when I grow older. I guess I'll have to grow up first then find out. All I know now is that living in the circus is fun, but it is a busy life...

She had a brother named Alex.Her moms name was Arika,and her dads name was Matt. Addies birthday was coming up,she was going to turn seven years old!!She wanted to invite three friends and go to the circus. Addie always dreamed of going to the circus, so this was her chance to ask her mom and dad to go to the circus with some  friends.  So three days before her birthday she asked her mom and dad,'mom,dad ,can we go to the circus for my seventh birthday?!?!' Asked Addie with out taking a breath.'Um... we'll have to think a bout it Addie .Ok. Now go to bed its already 8:30!' Said Addies mom.                       So as Addie walked up to her room with her nightgown her gramma gave her. When Addie got in bed and lay there. she thought about the circus.'what fun it would by' Adddie wispered to herself. The next morring Addie ran down stairs to wake up her mom and dad. Now it was only two more days befor her birthday.'Mom!Mom!Mom!'Yelled Addie running down stairs.'Have you thought about it?! Did you make a dission??' Asked Addie.'Well'.said Addies mom in yawn.'We did infact...Yes!Yes you can go to the circus!!! Said Addie's mom happily.'Can I go wake up Alex?!' Said addie.'No you should let him sleep for a little while longer- 'BUT I'M RIGHT HERE !!!'Yelled Alex jumping up from behind the bed with a huge smile on his face. 'Go play you waky kids!!! Said there dad Matt.                                         As Arika and Matt were making pancakes for Addie and Alex Arika said,'So should we make some calls for Addie's birthday party? Asked Arika. 'Why don't I go geet her so she can make the choice.' Asked Matt. Addie had three best friends one named Sofia. One named Rose. And last but not least, Annabell. So they called Addie down  and this is what happened, 'We need to know who you want to take to the circus??' said Arika. 'Umm... lets see.. One is Sofia Two is Rose and three is ..Annabell!!!!!' said Addie happily. 'Ok Addie thanks, you better get up stairs you brother is is building a fort so none of your bombs get him!!' said Arka. 'Hey no fair!!' yelled Addie running up the stairs. 'Oh jeez Matt, flip the pancakkes your going to burn them!!' said Arika as Matt went to flip  those pancakes.                                               'Hello, yes this is Addie's mom Arika. I'm good how are you? Well I was just wondering if Sofia could come over on saturday for a circus that were going to for Addies birthday.... Oh she can make it! That is great. We can pick her up at 3:30 on saturday. Bye have a nice day to you too.' Siad Arika hanging up the phone.'One down two to go.'Hello, yes this Addie's mom.how are you today? I'm good thank you.We were wondering if Annabell cuold come for on a circus party at the circus on saturday for Addie's birthday party? Addie, she is turning seven. Annabell can make it. that's fantastic... No we'll pay for her. We have everthing under controll,we can paty for her. Yes I'm sure. Goodbye,. thank you, have a nice day. two down one to go'. So Arika dieled rose's mom's phone number,'Hello, this is Addie's mom who is this? Oh hi Rose can I talk to your mom please? Thank you, bye Rose. Hi Ms. Sapet how are you? I'm fine. Can Rose make it to a party this saturday for Addie. Oh... Well thats fine, have a nice day. Bye!'                                          'Addie!!!!' Yelled Matt 'Come on down.' Yelled Matt as Addie ran down stairs. 'Yes daddy.' Said Adddie. 'Annabell can come, Sofia can come and Rose can't come' Matt said. 'What do you meen Rose can't come?' 'I meen rose can't come.' Said matt with a frown om his face. 'Addie it will still be fun.' Said Arika. 'Ok.' said Addie. Addie wasn't that happy when she heard that Rose couldn't come.  So that night Addie lay in bed thinking about her party and how fun it would be. then she wispered to herself, 'It will be fun... Right I know it will if Rose is there or not.' Then addie got up out if bed and got her favorite teddy bear named Mr. Teddy. 'I wish you could com to the circus with us.' wispered Addie. And she slowly went to sleep.                               The next morring Addie woke up Alex and the played and played, until alex said,'hey, we should go out side and play' 'we should shoudn't we.' Said Addie. But there was a twist. There parents told Alex to say that because down stairs Addie's  parents we're waiating for Addie to cime down and the would yell,'SUPRISE!!!'  So Addie got dressed in her play clothes and heade down stairs andall she saw was glitter and confetti. And what she heard was...'SUPRISE!!!!!!!' Yellled Matt and Arika.                              So at 3:30 the all got in the car and headed to Annabells's house. when Annabell got in the car with a HUGE gift Alex's mouth opened wide  and nothing came out.'Hi Annabell, how are you doin'?' Aksed Matt. 'Good, how are you Mrs. and Mr.Lincon?' 'Good thank you.' They both said at the same time. 'Where off to ge Sofia!!' said Alex. So they we're off to get Sofia.when Sofia came in the car with a smaller present Addie was still happy with what she got.                            They finnaly got to the circus and the show began. First there was a clown show, then there was aacrobat show. Sofia was amazed with acrobats. 'How much do you think they practice?'Sofia wispered into Addies ear. 'A bunch that's for sure. Then there was a juggler, then a tightrope walker. 'Do you think hes going to fall?' wispered Addie in to Annabell's ear. 'I dont't think he is.' Anaabell wispered back.                        When the circus was over they all fell aslep on the way back home and they all dremt about the circus. Addie was still awake she thout to her slef,'I'm the lukyest girl in the world!'

I have never been in a circus but i have read book about it and heard its wonderful. For one book I read it told you what happens in the morning til night.                                            They wake up very early (7:00)and go to sleep very late(12:00).It must be hard doing that!Its probbley not hard for them beacause there use to me, not so much. Before I talk about the kind of shows they have I talk about a regular day for them.                                                   7:00 A.M.-wakes up,gets dressed,and goes to pie car (where they eat ). Crew sets up lights,music,and the tents for the show.                                                                                      9:00 A.M.-school time one room where the performers learns what to do for the show they also have computers,tests,and reportcards.they learn how to speak diffrent languages!                 3:00 P.M.-school is over and they get a 30min.break.                                                                    3:30 P.M.-chores and practice.                                                                                                    6:30 P.M.-dinnertime they go the pie car. But they dont eat alot because of the show.                  10:30 P.M.- the shows are usally over everyone probbly pooped out.                                       12:00 A.M.-usally in bed now.       Now I will talk about the shows they do! One of the shows they do will be with a circus clown, circus acrobats,circus juggler,circus tightrope walker,or circus horses. I would think all of them would be good.         If you want to join the circus you have to be flexible,strong ,not scared of heights,and dose not have stage fright. If you are all of those and want to go to the circus go when old enough.You have to be flexible because if your an acrobat you do flips in AIR and more,you also should be strong if your one of those heavy lifter guys or dudes,scraed of heights for an acrobat and tightrope,and last but least not having stage fright you cant have that if you want to be in the circus or any show!              So for a circus you can do alot of and if you want to do it do it... if your parents know and do not runaway to the circus!!!!!!!!

We go all around the world doing shows. I practice making the lepords do many tricks.                 It is time for me to do my show. Tonight I am working with the lepords. They are going to do a dance I tought them. When the show started my friend, katherine, went first. Today she was making the lions jump through big rings.                                                                           I am up next. I'm really happy it's my turn. I am out and the lepords are dancing around,the moves I taught them. It was really funny. My other friend,Ioannina,is next. she is an acrobat. she is really good at it.                                                                                               It is the end of the show and I am beat.I am going to be in another city soon. My friends and I are walking back to our trailers ,we are so tired. I have to walk back the animals, so I say good night to Katherine and Ioannina helps me put the lion and lepords away. In two months I will be back at my real house. I wonder what animal I get tomorrow.

I live here in the circus with many actors including; Billy, Larry ,and Joe the clowns, the elephant riders Susan and Marcy,and my favorite, the acrobats Silvia, Trent and Me!               Life in the circus is hard work especially if one of us gets sick or injured before or during a show. I remember the time I was walking the tight rope and I fell  just like in practice and Silvia caught me,but when she through me to Trent he didn't catch me so I fell the 30 foot drop.  I ended up breaking my leg. Most people blamed Trent, but I forgave him after I got my cast.                   Our work is very dangerous because of the animals and acts we do. The lions and tigers that we use are wild animals that have to be especially when we train them.One times when I went to welcome them they tried to attack me! Its also dangerous for the acrobats because If they fall they could get so injured so bad they could die! The tightrope walkers also need to be careful cause if they fall, they can also get injured.               In the circus you get lots of free time. As a dog, I use my free time sleeping and playing with Silvia and Trent. Different actors and different people do different things with their spare time, like the clown do silly jokes, while Susan and Marcy groom the elephants. there are tons of things to do in the circus. Hope to see ya there!

'The Plascencia Brother's Circus'! It was the highlight of the fair. Everyone came. From the hobo's in the street's, to the rich people in their mansion's.          I bought a ticket to watch the 8:00 PM show. before that I wanted to play some games. The first game I played was the show your strength game. When I was in line this one guy cut in front of me. I told him to stop cutting. He didn't do or say anything. He wore a black jacket, baggy pants, and had a bag full of water bottle's.He was guy in his teenage year's. He stayed in line until it was his turn. When he finished he just ran off? But my curiosity got the best of me. I ran off after him. He stopped at a wall looked back, got one of his can's then sprayed it. After a while he went away. I looked at the wall and it was graffiti! Those can's weren't water bottle's! They were spray paint!          I had to call the police, but they said they already knew. They said they had been getting reports about graffiti all over town. The police station it self was graffitied! I knew I had to take matters into my own hands considering I saw him myself. I knew he graffitied every where so I myself painted over a wall white. After a few hours he showed up and started painting. He saw me so I chased him up to a dead end.   I asked him why he did it and he said. ' I paint the world as I see it '! He tried to climb the wall but fell. Landed on his back and just moaned. I called the policed, had fun at the circus, and still had time to watch the show.

Wode he had ate 145,236,987 candy bars before he had never lost the contest for front row seats before.                                                                                                    One taco and then another  i scarfed down as many as i could I was so hungry when i came and now I was so full but I had to keep going. my parents cheered me on he ate 2 by 2 . I could not beat him but then he waved his surender flag. I HAD WON YAY .          I was in line for the circus i was so excited my heart was  pounding. I had finally got to the front of the line . I had saw the acrobats hang from tight ropes it was cool. I saw circus clows hit each other with a foam bat . I was amazed when I saw the tightrope walker walk a 13 centemeter rope                        I had a fun time at the circus. It was cool but I am still full from all those tacos I ate uuhhggg.

Lucy, I want the spotlight to come on after the music begins. And I want the karate monkey in before the routine actually begins. Mikayla, can we get a bigger hula hoop for the lion? Somebody needs to get this curtain working before our show! One hour on the clock people! Move, move, move!'           I was so tired but I couldn't even rest for a minute. Our show in front of the French circus promotor, Mr. Reyes, was coming fast, and we were all working our heads off. I, Destiny Dominguez, am the manager here at the Neon Animal Circus. For a solid month, all we had done was prepare for this day, and when it finally came around, none of us were ready.           We worked hard for the next hour, and just as the audience began filing in, we were finally ready to perform. 'Hey Lucy, I see the promotor. Let the performers know that he is on the east side of the stadium.' 'I'm on it,' replied Lucy.           'Ladies and gentlemen,' I began, 'Welcome to the Neon Animal Circus. Firstly, just a quick safety check. Exits are in between the east side seating and south side seating. No smoking inside the big top, and please remain seated during the show. Flash photography is not allowed. But now, let the show begin! Let's hear it for Cody, the karate monkey!'           The performers and I did the best we possibly could. We met with Mr Reyes after the big top was cleared. I crossed my fingers behind my back. 'So?' I asked. 'I'm sorry,' said Mr. Reyes, 'It was good, but not good enough. I can't sign your circus on a France Tour. I'm sorry.' Sigh. 'No, It's okay. We understand. Thank you Mr. R.' I replied.           Although discouraged, the circus headed to the pie car and quietly ate a dinner of fried rice. Even Mikayla, who never felt down was clearly slightly disappointed. 'You know what,' she began, 'we may have been let down this time, but the circus is our way of life! We can't give up now! I say we try for an American Tour!' Soon, the pie car was shaking because of all the excitment. 'America, here we come! You can't take circus away from us! It's our way of life!'

486	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	A	N	N	F	534891	5	11074852	Y	56196	 Hi, my name is Stormbringer Light.   I am 16 yearts old and an acrobate. I am very famous for my tricks and my stunning beauty. People come all over the world just to see me perform. Today is a big show. We are performing in New York, New York. People like Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, and Taylor Swift were coming and I was going to get an act all for myself where I would be the star. I remember how proud my parents where when I told them about my star act       (flashback)   I was screaming,' Mom, Dad.' Then my dad and mom said what. I told them about my act and then they looked at each other and smiled then my mom said, 'We where waiting for this day to come.' 'What do you mean', I said curiously. 'We named you Stormbringer because we new that when you would grow up and become a circus performer, you would be very famous and beautiful so we named you Stormbringer because your beauty looks like it is based on that', said my mom in her musical voice 'Make us proud Storm', my dad said in his deep bass. I had a lump in my throat then I said, 'I will, I promise.'       (flashback ended)       I always wondered why I was named Stormbringer and now I knew why. I finished practiceing my grand routine and headed for the dressing rooms to change. I was surprised when I found my mom there. She and my dad are trapese artists and were dressed in black clothing with sparkles on them. My mom said,'You know your grandmother was a acrobate like you right? I nodded. 'Well she has a beautiful dress she wanted to save for your big night, and your father and I believe it is this night.' my mom said. She showed me the dress and I loved it, it was a white and black with sequins that sparkled and it had designs like storm clouds. I put it on and kept my hair in a high ponytail with a silver band. I looked and felt beautiful.           It was time for my act to start. I felt extremely nervous, but as I faced the crowd  and made my way to the place where I would jump down onto the ground in a 150ft jump, the cheering made my nervousness change to confidence. I looked great, my routine was great, I felt great, and this was my night to pull up a storm, for I was Stormbringer and I would make my parents proud.       The announcer, Jason said, 'I now give you the one you have all been waiting for the beautiful, and powerful Stormbringer!' I smiled the announcer was my friend and and I have a huge crush on him so immediatly I felt even more confident. I flipped out onto the ground a huge cheer came making my ears ring. I twirled, flipped, cartwheeled, and did so many other tricks. The crowd loved it and I was presented with a boquet of roses. I shined and I had created a Storm, for I was the great Stormbringer.       All the other performers did great, but as my name was called out, I got the loudest cheer. I looked at my parents and they looked very proud, I had done it, and I had done even more.       After the show I went to my parents and they looked so proud. They said, 'You have done a great job and made us prouder than we have ever imagined' I was in Cloud 9. I looked outside and saw a huge storm had come. There was lightning, rain, and thunder. My parents went to dinner while I changed into a fancy black sequined dress, I loved my grandmothers, but this dress meant more to me. I went outside to the storm, I wanted to stop, but I felt as if a force was propelling me. I felt the rain on, my dress, listened to the thunder, I lied down in the grass, and set my mind to wonder all there is to do and life and all there is to try, and soon I was singing to the storm.       'Hey' a voice said. I turned around and it was Jason. He leaned in and kissed me and I felt like I was floating, I understood what he meant, and said yes. He grinned and said, 'Come on let's go to the dining car.' I badly wanted to go, but I said,'You go, I will stay here' I stayed in the storm for an hour and found Jason waiting for me. We went to the dining car and ate. I smiled, I finally found my true self. I was Stormbringer Light. The bringer of storms.       That night when I went to sleep, I dreamed of my grandmother, my grandmother died when I was 3 months old so I never met her properly. People always said I looked just like her. Now I understood why they said that. I could have been her twin if I was way older. She said' Hello, I am your grandmother Moonshadow. Like you I was an acrobatic, and very famous and beautiful. People always said that the Moon would shine brighter when it saw me perform. Then I had a very famous show like you where everyone would come to see me. Then after I had performed my best ever, the moom shined so bright, and it was a full moon when it was not supposed to be one. I had a moon and you had a storm. You have many doubts about yourself which are not true. You will have a very successful career and make me very proud.' Then my grandmother dissapeared in a blinding flash of light along with my dream. In the morning I remembered her advice and grinned. I was ready to start the new day.

In order to become a proffesional circus performer you have to be willing to tak risk, practice everyday, and practice hard. I remember when I was little there used to be a school traviling with us. We had Geography lessons, Math lessons, and Literature lessons almost like your normal day at school.                                                             I became a adept juggler by training and teamwork. It requires a lot of teamwork to master this skill you need to help others in order to reach victory. On some occasions, I had hurt myself when I was practicing juggling torches. Sometimes these type of things may happen to you in the circus.

Well, to be like me, you must have a special talent in yourself. For me, that special talent is balanace and coordination.        Generally, to be an acrobat, you must take very dangerous risks. You must also learn very complex, tricky tricks. For example, what if your acrobatiing partner does not catch you at the correct time? You would fall down and possibly break your neck.       Another reason you must have very good balance. For example, what if your rope falls? You and your partner will die or get serious injuries. If you want to be an acrobat, it will be a very tricky desicion. 	NNP , PRP VBP DT JJ NN , NNP NNP NNP PRP VB TO VB IN PRP .

Being an acrobat isn't all that easy, it takes courage, but not all bravery, it uses common sense so that you don't just jump off a bridge or something like that.Some may dream of being like me when you grow up but it isn't that easy you ave to go through these steps first.       First to become an acrobat you have to have an excellent sense of balance, not just like balancing on a balance beam I mean on a trip wire.Second you have not be afraid of heights, if you are then don't be an acrobat! third of all you need to do gymnastics or ballet to train yourself female or male. Lastly join the circus.       Once in the circus get ready for some amazement in your heart like I did, it lit a fire in my heart. You will have a front row seat to amazement with all your fellow performers. Once it is your turn partner or not do not be afraid just go in and do it and the crowd will be in awe.you will run, then jump, and  accompanied with the spotlight on make an amazing performance.        After that incredible performance you are tired and want to go directly to bed, but your fellow performers stop you in your tracks and take you out to eat and celebrate.When you finally are in bed you  say to yourself 'what a performance' and then drift off to sleep.

This profession is   being in a circus.  A circus is not really a show where performers goof off and have fun.  It is actually a show which requires balance, practice, skill, and talent.        The performers travel all around the world when they preform circus acts.  For example,     Australia, Japan, and all over North America.  So many places to travel is so tiring!  Hi, I am Phil Johnson, and I have experienced all of this traveling.  But wait until you hear all of the other things that I have experienced, because it is so tiring!       There is also a variety of circus animals such as Tigers and Lions, and maybe even bears     or horses.  Some circus acts do tricks with the animals.  Tigers or lions could jump through a hoop!  With horses, someone could jump off a trampoline and onto a horse's back!  This requires lots of balance and practice.  But people should be super careful about how they are with these wild animals.  The animal could attack the person, or maybe even kill it.        Sadly, the performers stay away from their hometowns and families.  This makes me feel a little bit homesick.  Although the circus is a tough life, it could be very fun on stage doing difficult tricks in front of so many people watching you.

Me and my brother travel all around  the country in our RV like train with our parents and the other people in the circus. Our life is with the circus.                 Most days, I get up and practice, then I have a quick break for breakfast. Then my dad takes me to the animal cart where he trains our lion, Frank. Next, I work on the trapeze, my most talented skill. I work for 2 and a half hours strait. Finally, I get to have a break for dinner and if it is not performence night I get to relax and then go to bed.                 Circus work can be hard. There are many diffucult things to learn in short periods of time. Also,we have a different show at a different place every week. Even though circus life can be hard, I enjoy it very much. Although I don't go to school, my father, who was once a teacher and teaches all the kids on the train. Some of the kids are near my age but, some of them are older and some are younger.                 Tommorow we preform in Vermont. I am working on a trick with the elephants and with my best friend, Sara. I have been in the circus since I was 4 and I am now 11. But even though Sara is 11 too she started when she was 7.           Even though the circus can be challenging at times, it will always be my passion. I belong with the circus.

I do two jobs one: groom and feed the animals, and two: i am the trainer for the horses, yes i also perform with them.       My day is crazy! first i wake up and feed all the animal because i beleive that they should all get fed first. After that i eat, normally just a bagel with cream cheese. Then i get my barn clothes on and start practicing my show for tonight, witch i do this untill lunch time. I give all the animals food and water and then get myself a sandwitch.       6:00-7:00pm and 7:30-8:30pm and when our shows each week start. The circus can be really stressful for the people and the animals, becuase we move so much! We move town to town each week.       its finally time to get our show elfits on. After i get my elfit on i give all the animals a treat to say thanks for doing all this for our company. After the two shows everyone is tired! I put all the animals back in their stalls and habitats, and get ready to start moving again early in the morning to a diffrent town.       Thats my life in the circus 	NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NN , PRP VBP JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP VBP CD NNS CD : NN CC VBD DT NNS , CC CD : PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NNS , NNS PRP RB VBP IN NNP NNP NN VBZ JJ .

Everyone calls me that because I'm the best at the trapeze. I travel all over the world doing my tricks, everybody loved me until one day. That day was today.      'Remi get out of the bed we need to practice' yelled my partner Dana.' I am just let me get my stuff'! So I got my things and we went to the tent but when we got there someone else was on the trapeze.  'Who is that', Dana and I said at the same time. Ann over heard us.'Oh that's Rosie and Sydney they are the best from the US'Ann said. 'But we are from the US!!!' I said 'Well not anymore they are' Ann said. 'Lets go talk to them' said Dana. 'Fine' I said       'Ummmmmm excuse us' I said in a polite voice. 'What do you want smalls' said Rosie. 'Well I heard you guys are supposedly the best trapeze artist from the US' said Dana. 'WE ARE ' Rosie and Sydney said in unison.' But we were voted the best in our country' I said. 'Well let's just see who's the best then later tonight when everyone shows up here thy are going to vote to see who's better' said Sydney. 'DEAL' Dana and I said at the same time.        ' It's time for the show' Dana said. 'We are going to have a little competition to see who's the best at the trapeze Dana and Remi the Great or Rosie and Sydney, we want you to vote on your phones ' the announcer said. 'Remi the Great and Dana are up first'. ' Break a leg'said Rosie. Next thing you know Dana breaks her leg while walking out there. But that wasn't the worst thing I didn't have a partner to do the trapeze with. 'Thanks for jinxing us'. I hope you brake something but then her partner got really sick and started puking. ' It looks like none of us are going to win'said Rosie 'Or let's just team up'.' Fine Ill do anything just to perform said Rosie        The crowd loved us they wanted us to do it again so Rosie and I are partners now and we are called Remi and Rosie the Great.

But trust me  they have alot of resposibilaty to take care of .  They also have alot of fun!                                             Firstly , the circus is nonstop play is crazy! Bella Castini is one of the circus preformers and she lives in a trailor with her family . They travel 20,000 miles in 7 months each year , visiting 150 cities and they work from sunup to sundown . here's a typical day for Bella at 7:00 am she gets up , gets dressed , and goes to the pie car to eat breakfast ( pancakes and bacon ). The crews are setting up tents ,lights ,and music for their nights show . At 9:00 am its school time . Her one - room schoolhouse  travels  with them . Like any other school , theirs has computers , tests , and report cards . Because the circus preformers are from all  over the world , many of her classmates speak other languages : French, Russian, and Italian like Bella's family . As they travel around the country ,their geography lessons come alive!                               Secondly, some fun things they do in the circus is play with the animals and learn new tricks . Some of the animals they play with is girraphs , tigers , monkeys , elephants , and so many more  they train the animals to do fun thing and if you like the circus come and see the animals and pet them . They are all trained and to do tricks.  Becareful  with the tiger he is the one who thinks your a treat!                         Finally , to become a circus  preformer you  have to a specific talent , the right  body type and be very determined . You have to put your heart into it  and be certain that thats what you want to do .One of the upsides of being in the circus is that you get a chance of traveling the world! And your audiance is intertained and they clap as loud as they can if you try your best.

The first reason I think it will be fun is that you get pick out a circus act you want to do.For example,you could pick anything you want to do,like acrobatics,juggling and training.I would like to do training, so I can train with different kinds of animals.Such as horses,birds,bears and maybe tigers or lions.I would train these animals so good they would know what to do when they walk into the show.                  The second reason I think it would be fun to be in the circus is I get to practice my circus act all day to get better at it.In addition,I would teach the animals to do tricks like jump,juggle for the bears and speak for the birds.Also,I would hug the and give them treats for doing tricks.I would also give the food,water,and baths.I think that my animals would be the best trained animals in the whole world.I would be so proud of my animals if they got a reward for best trained animals.                    Lastly,I would like to do my act at the show with all my animals I have trained.They would be the best animal act there and people would love themso much they would get a standing applause from the audience.The adience would want to take pictures with the animals every time they would come.                    As you can see,I think a regular day at the circus would be fun and exciding for three reasons.To pick out a circus act ,practice it and perform it.

You might be thinking being a circus performer is all fun, but it is not all that fun. The circus is like a paradise with all the shiny colors, but you have to perform and practice from sunup to sundown.              It is really hard. It all starts at 6:00 A.M. I wake up and go enjoy my fabulous breakfast. The stage is getting set up. They put red curtains. They are inserting all the different color lights.             Then it is time to learn at 10:00 A.M. We go into the room that moves with us. We learn about different places. There are many people from different countries and some of my best friends speak diferent languages but somehow we are able to contact with each other.             After that, we start training at 4:00 P.M. I like to practice doing juggling and acrobatics. Some of my friends do dangerous things such as jumping onto horses from trampolines.We also practice with the stage animals. It is a lot of fun, but also it is a lot of tiring work.            Finally, we perform. I do my acrobatics and have a lot of fun with the stage animals. Everyone does great and the crowd goes wild. We are all happy because our work payed off.            We eat dinner and sleep. We all think,'What a day. This is my fabulous life at the circus.

Everyone that works in the circus needs to work hard so the show could go well and the aduance would like the show.  Have to have a talent to be in the circus.                                              Some people wake up early to set the tents. Alot  people have to do jobs in the moring to get ready for the rest of the day. They travel a lot to different places and meet different people. Not all of them are adults some are kids because their parents were in the circus and so know they are in it to. They don't stay in town so they just stay their for a few days and then they go to the next town. They do ten shows a week and are very in a tight schedule. Have to practice alot so itcan go well in the show. Hardly get to have a rest and berly see their family but to them the circus is their family. Don't have a place to call home. The circus is very hard but they still get to have fun.            The young people that work at the circus have to go to school even while they are on the circus. Take lessons on geography would come to life. Their is alot of people that don't speak English just other languages. It is like a regular school they have computers, tests, and report cards. The school travels because they don't stay in one place. They have to learn alot of things because they travel the world or county. To themit is like our life just that they travel and act and do tricks in front of people. They have to work hard to put the show on for alot of people. Have berly time to rest have a very busy day. Each day they have to do the same thing but in different places. They don't have a easy life like ours.            Some people run away to go to the circus but you don'tget in that fast you have to have a specific talent to be on the circus. Have to be determined to join. Their are ups and down to the circus. The happy thig about is that you get to do tricks in front of people and do  what you want to do you just have to have fun. But it is still hard because you hardly have to have sometime for your own. Have to work hard to make the people that are going to watch have fun and enjoy what they seen. Could make people laugh and enjoy the day. Little kids that go want to have fun and play and see that acts. The circus it is all about having fun. They do hard tricks so they have to practice so it can go well. To the aduance it looks easy but it is really hard so that it makes people have fun at the circus.             The work that the people do is very hard it is not easy as it looks. They have to practice everyday so they have to work very hard to do it in  the show so it could go well. It might look easy but if people try it is very hard to do and they just do it so people can enjoy it.

There are impossible things you can't  do like leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back.                        Kids go to the circus with their parents. To spend time with their family.Go to have fun with their friends. If  you join the circus there are really awsome stuff about joining the circus. You may travel all around the world and learn cool languages,go to interesting places,and meet really cool people. You may perform all over the world like Astralia. the circus is a fun place to visit and a fun place to work.                           At the circus you may learn how to juggle well some people no how to juggle I don't. You might perfom at TV shows. Circus performers might inspire kids to work at a circus. If kids would think that performing at a circus is hard they can show there talent and may get to perform things they are used to like dancing,singing, and maybe even the host of the circus.                         Working at the circus is really fun but if you would want to work at the circus tere would be some things you would want to know.Working at the circus means you would have to stay away from home for a while nothing bad if your little brother or sisster annoy you all the time.But you will miss your parents.There are some good news about joining the circus it's SUPER FUN!!!!!!!!                           The circus is a fun place to visit you should take your family there they'll enjoy it. The circus was made so kids can have fun and so parents spend some time with their kids. Kids will learn impposible things that seem..........well impposible.Th circus is really fun it's a happy place to cheer people up when their feeling blue .......not the color blue.

I was eating peaceful when somebody called my name.My friend Alex was the one who was calling me.'Hey Coner are you coming to practice or what'.'Of course'I said.We went running so fast that my friend Alex fell.I helped her get up and once we got up we saw this flyer up n the tent..2 We wanted to see what it said so we went to the pile of people who were covering the flyer and read'Dear im here to inform you there is no practice today or the next 3days because you will have to do a special talent of your own but if you fail you would be FIRED!We were afraid we were going to fail,but we promised we would try our best.The next day we actually had free time because practice was canceled,but Alex and I used that free time to practice.Alex already knew what she was going to do,but I still had no idea what I was going to do.I began to get worried.3 Next day I went to my friends trailor to talk to her, I still didn't know what to do and the show was in 2 days.She told me to calm down so I did so.She also told me to think about it and do what you like the most .I decided to take her advice.I finally knew what I was going to do only I thought I would fail in one minute so I started thinking of something else. I was freaking out I now only had one day.4 Ahhh! The show is today. I am so scared, if I don't pass this i'll be out of this circus!I was thinking but then inturupted by the host, he wished us good luck.I got it! i'll get on a horse jump of then i'll juggle then lastly say suprise that would be perfect because its not that hard to practice. Once the show started I began to get nervous but I had a flashback of my friend and what she told me so I just calmed down.It was finally my turn and the host said I passed I was so happy.5When that happened I learned that I have to be brave and have fath in myself.

I am usually exhausted after all that flipping and dancing.In the morning I get up from my tiny bed and get ready for that days show. When in all ready I like to go to the breakfast car and have breakfast with my clown friends.after that we set up the lights for that day and clean the     tent.     When that is finished I practices my acts in the circus. Later I go and do the daily training with the elephants if they do a good job the get a treat.Some times I like to go to the horse cages and play with the horses.My friends work with the leopards and lions. I like to work with the elephants because they are my favorite animal.          My entire family is in the circus my mom my dad even my little brother and sister. We mostly play the rolls of clowns. Since my brother and sister are little they like to play in the little clown car.Some times in the circus they are the clowns in the clown car.We love to see the smile on the adencs face when the show is on it makes all of us feel great 	NNP IN DT NN VBZ VBG PRP$ JJ TO VB IN DT NNS IN NN VBZ NN CC NNP NNP VBP RB VBN IN DT DT VBG CC JJ DT NN PRP VBP RP IN PRP$ NN VBD CC VB JJ IN DT NNS NNP NNP IN DT JJ PRP VBP TO VB TO DT NN NN CC VB JJ IN PRP$ NN NN WDT PRP VBP RP DT NNS IN DT NN CC JJ DT NNP NNP IN VBZ VBN PRP NNS PRP$ NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNP VBP CC VB DT JJ NN IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN DT NN DT JJ NNS PRP VBP TO VB TO DT NN NNS CC VB IN DT JJ NNS NN IN DT NNS CC NNP NNP IN TO VB IN DT NNS IN PRP VBP PRP$ JJ NNP NNP NN NN VBZ IN DT NN PRP$ NN PRP$ NN RB PRP$ JJ NN CC NNP NNP RB VBP DT NNS IN NNP NNP PRP$ NN CC NN VBP JJ PRP VBP TO VB IN DT JJ NN NN NNS IN DT NN PRP VBP DT NNS IN DT NN NN NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NNS VBP WRB DT NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ DT IN PRP VBP JJ

I was so excited I practiced for weeks all the hard work payed off. My first show was in a couple weeks and I couldnt wait. My Mom and Dad were so proud of me  expectially because my parent are in the circus . We live in a nice house and  I have one big sister and one little brother they dont want to be in the circus though, and my name is James I am 10 years old. I love the circus ever sense I saw a circus show I've always wanted to be a cirucs preformer and knows my chance!               I was practicing for my first show when I fell I broke my ankle. Oww I yelled, everyone ran into the room what happened they all said!!      ' I dont know, I said my ankle hurts really bad though!'  My dad toke a look at my ankle         'I think its broken,'he yelled 'Come on lets get you to the hospital!!' When we got to the hospital the doctor said yup its broken.   ' I  screamed NO its not broken it cant be I have a show in a couple weeks I cant go know!.'                                                  When whe got home I went up to my room i didnt want to talk to anyone right know. I wanted to know though when I will get my cast off maybe I will get it off in time! I thought.        'Dinners ready' my mom called from downstairs, ' Come and get some dinner James'               I limped downstairs when I got down my dad had my cruches ' Thanks dad ' I mumbled               I was eating dinner when my mom said ' The Doctor said you will get your cast off in a couple weeks isnt that great!     ' Not really my shows in a couple weeks do you know what day?' I said    'No I dont sorry he didnt say ' Said my mom. I was quiet the rest of dinner I didnt want to talk then i finished my dinner and my dad took my plate and washed it.                  I was sitting on the couch when the phone called I couldnt get up and no one was around. So I let it go to voice mail luckily the person left the voice message.   It said,' Its the doctor i  just wanted to let you know that James will get his cast off in a week thats all i wanted to say goodbye.' and he hung up. YES!!!! I said   ' Everyone came into the room what happend?' They said    ' The doctor called I will get my cast off in a week i can still go to the show.' I yelled   ' Thats great just make sure you dont brake your ankle again when you get it off.'   'Trust me I wont.' I said                 A week later I got my cast off I was so excited iIcould practice again! The week came to the first show came i made it i said!! You did great my mom said good job for all that practice. The audience clapped for me when I left I was so excited i left all proud. The circus people even asked if I could come next week. I said Yes! and my family all went out to dinner to celebrate.     	DT NNP CD NN PRP VBD RP IN DT NNP CC PRP VBD PRP .

If you want to be in the circus you have to wake up at 7:00 a.m. at least or before. 9:00 a.m. Bella goes to school. At three 'o' clock school is over. Sometimes the clowns let me play with there balls and ride on their unicycles.                                                                                                                         At 3:30 Bella has practice. I have to feed, water, groom, and train the animals. In the Circus you can't play and have all fun and games. You still have to work and not just sit and watch tv and do nothing you get to train and play with the animals.            6:30 we have dinner in the pie car. We don't eat a lot, because we perform then. At 10:30  the show is over. We have ten shows a week. One is a show each weekday, a matinee on Wednesday, two shows on Saturday and Two shows on Sunday.               At 12:00 I am in bed. Bella says ' it would be nice to go home'. Bella is waiting for the tour to be over. Bella doesn't get to see her family a lot. Bella doesn't know if she will be a performer when she grows up to an adult. You can't just join you need lot of training for just one stunt and lots of practice so you don't get hurt.                 Bella gave up nearly everything for the circus. Bella could of had not taken the circus job but she did. She could have made newer friends but she has a lot of people to play with and animals to play with. Bella chose to take after her mom and dad. Bella and everyone else travels across the world with over 100 people.

Circuses have many different things in them. Some circuses have elephant rides, some have horse rides, some have acrobats, and some have large or small animals do fancy tricks. In the next paragraph you will learn about some of the jobs people in circuses have.             I will tell you about some cool jobs and maybe some scary jobs. Some people are tite rope walkers, imagine being one of them walking high in the air on nothing but a thin rope doing flips and things like that. Imagine being a acrobat, I think it would be scary fling in the air jumping of ropes and grabing onto other ones and if you have a partner you have to trust them. Those are the talented jobs but some other people get stuck with jobs like the ticket booth stand or the popcorn stand. Some audiences like certain tricks better than other, like some might like seeing animals do tricks and some might like seeing people fly through the air.            I have a few questions I want to think about. The first one is would you join a circus? If you had to choose a job in a circus what would it be? What is your favorite thing to watch in a circus? These are all the questions I can think of right now and so with that I hope you enjoyed this essay.

The circus life is very fun and adventurous, but is very tiring and hard work.             When I was was a little girl, my parents always expected me to follow their paths of the circus life. When I was 7, I was already taught how to juggle and walk on a tightrope. When I was 11, my parents knew I was ready to perform on the live stage in front of millions of crowds.          I was extremely nervous for my first show and stage fright got the best of me for when I was walking on the tightrope I fell to the ground. The crowd suddenly fell silent. That night I felt if it was worth it being in the circus and what it would be like if I was a normal girl just living at home like a simple life. My parents soon came in and consoled me and told me to 'never give up,' and 'the show must go on.'          Ever since then I knew I was meant to be in the circus. I learned brand new tricks such as training an elephant to walk on a tightrope and having a tiger jump through a hoop. I even been working on my latest trick to walk on a tightrope while juggling apples. Of course I fell several times but I got back on my feet to try again. I even still get stage fright before shows, but I know that being in the circus is in my blood.          If you ever want to join the circus, I suggest you should. But you need to make sure that this is what to do for life and make sure you enjoy doing it.            	. . . DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP PRP IN TO VB DT NN .

The circus had finally come to our town London!!! Oh, how much I longed to become a circus trapeze artist. I had been doing gymnastics all my life, and dreamed to be in the circus. Well, one day I got the chance. The same circus I had watched was holding tryouts to becoem a backup trapeze artist. I practiced everyday after school, and prayed that I would be chosen. The day finally came. As I went to the circus for my tryouts, I gazed and studied the other people who came to try out. Just by looking at them, I knew I would get in. Of course, I was right. I was chosen!!! The ringmaster said to me, 'Ella, you are our family!' I beggged my parents to let me go but they could not bare to watch me go. The ringmaster told me that they were leaving tommorow, and I had to make a lifelong desicion.                  I decided to run away, and join the circus instead. At night, I grabbed some food-bread, cheese, that kinda stuff, then made a dash for it. After I was far out in the pasture, I looked back, but then decided to keep going. This is my dream! I had to keep going, and I kept running to the trailors where the ringmaster was waiting for me. There was no turning back now. I saw the trailor ahead of me and waved to hthe circus master. 'Wecome,' he said, in a  thick French accent. 'This is your trailor. You will be sharing with Maria Grande.' As I went into the tailor, a pretty girl approached me, saying hello in French. She had told me that she had run away from home five years ago, and was a trapeze artist too. She missed her parents and was sobbing about it. She had gone outside to get some fresh air. I told her that I had run awy too. She said we shall go return you back to my parents. She said that she was orrow and griefed in pain to never see them again, and she did not want me to the same mistake. Suddenly, the trailor started. Now, there truely was no turning back. I plopped down on my bed feeling sad. I eventually fell asleep.                 In the morning, I woke with Maria shaking me. It was the first day of circus, and I missed my parents terribly. During my first show, I loved it!!! Everyone loved my trapeze act, and it made me feel warm inside that people liked what Iwas doing. The ringmaster was pleased with all my hard work, and he gave me a promotion to the next level. We traveled all over the world, and met new types of people. I had made many friends at the circus, including animals. I learned and made up new types of trapeze and gymnatic acts. Everywhere we went, we werewelcomed and loved. Life in the circus was good, except for one problem. I missed my parents dearly. Five years had passed, and now Iwas seventeen. I finally  knew what to do. I asked the ringmaster if we could go back to my own town in London. He agreed, and we traveled there.                  I knocked on my house's door and my mother opened it. I was so glad to see her. Then my father came outside and welcomed me with a bear hug. I then knew what to do. I had to quit the circus. I said goodbye to all my friends, and they promised to come visit me. I knew it was the right thing to do. 	IN PRP VBD VBG DT VBG NN NNS VBP PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN , PRP VBD PRP$ NN CC VBD PRP$ NNP NNP NN VBD RB VBN TO PRP$ NN NNP . . .

One example is the do a talent called tight roping.   it en-voles balance and concentration. People get shocked at this because many think the person might fall.   Not many people think the circus is astonishing but the only reason that's why is because they have never been at a circus before.    There are a lot of talents at the circus like juggling. But it is not easy working at a circus,   your a long way from home and cannot call home cause you work all day long!.                                                                                Working  at the circus  is fun and all but, it is still difficult                                  to leave your family. I like going to the circus and maybe i might want to be part of a circus when i grow up. At the circus many people work hard to do their job and shock the audience. Do you want to part of a circus? to be part of a circus you need to have the right body and a special talent.                                           You can meet so many people on road at the circus, being at the circus makes me feel shocked and astonish. I really like seeing every act there and i like to spend it with my family and friends.

She told me that sometimes its fun but sometimes its tough,she said she never gets a chance to rest and when she does,its only for a second.When she goes to bed she said she feels as if she was in heaven.Here are the reasons she said it is fun,she gets to type rope,she gets to do trapeze,and because she learns new languages.The reasons she says its tough is because she has chores that are so much harder than regular household chores like for example,instead of washing dishes she has to give the horse a bath and groom it,another reason would be waking up early,and because she has to do at least three to five shows a day!     Although she has to do alot she likes the circus and has a lot of fun.

When I i make my audience laugh i just smile back at them and just making them happy. When your a circus peformer its not all about making people laugh you have to do some other things like taking care of the animals. When a animal gets hurt we cant peform with it so we do a act longer like if a horse gets sick we do the lions more longer. Its hard being a circus peformer you have to travel around the world so unless your family comes with you it will be hard to see your family and your friends and your house because you travel all around the world.          At a circus show we try to amaze them but if we cant we do something unexpected like jumping over a horse or a lion anything like that. My normal day is that i wake up 6:00 in the mourning and get breakfest and at during my evening we usually do a show that time because thats the time where people arent tired. When the show is over we just lay down or we practice for the next show but mostly lay down. If a peformer gets hurt during the show we would cancel the act and move to the next one.          The first time I did a show was when I was 10 years old I did an act with a horse and I was really nervous and scared. When I grew older I started to get more better at peforming and today I am greatfull i chose this career and will never regret it.

Well now that I finished my trainig, I Julia Smith have done just that.Today my family and I joined the circus.       The on the first day my parentes took my brother and me on a tour of the circus.       First they took us to a trailor that they said was going to be our home for the next seven months. When we went inside it was relly small, and all that there was inside were three beds! One was big and the other two were small.       Then my parents took us to something caled the pie car witch apparently is were the circus performers eat.       After that they took us to a tralor twice the size of  ours insde were ten desks this they said was school.       Finaly they took us into the tent, it was huge! Before I joined the circus I thought the tents were small but looking at both backstage and the three rings on stage it was giant. Not to menchion how tall it was.       The circus was not what I expected. 	NNP PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NN .

I have been doing gymnastics since the age of two with a mommy and me class. Right as I walked into the gym I loved it. I am now a contortionist, I do trapeze, and trampoline. Being part of a circus is very hard. I ran away from home and joined the circus at the age of five years old.            I usually start of the day off at 7:00 am with pancakes and bacon. Then I get dressed andat about 7:30 I go to circus school. There I learn how to perfect my skills, learn new tricks, and evan sometimes the clowns let me go on the unicycle.            Circus scool ends at 4:00 right before our first show. I go to my trailer and eat with my friends and the director of the circus. After we go get ready to start the show.            The show ends at about 9:00 and I am very tired so I walk back to my trailer and then go straight to sleep.            Being part of the circus has its ups and downs. I wish I could go back home to my real family.

I've been working in the circus for a really long time. Its not really fun working in the circus when you berally get there.But when you get used to it, it starts getting easy so but this is a really fun place there's alot of clowns, acrobats,and grommers but theres other stuff i cant really explain.                                                                                       First, of all Ive been working at the circus for a really long time. I get so excited when there are shows coming up.Its so fun when you watch when people are really excited to see the animals,acrobats,and people jugguling on a unicycle its super fun but when we get ready to clean up its not fun there's always popcorn on the floor and especially when you have to clean up the animals busniess its so gross blaugh.                              Second, i have to get ready to eat with my family but we dont eat that much because where getti ng ready for the next preformance tonight we always are so happy when there are shows coming up well who can blame us kids,and parents they always have there fun at the circucs the never get old.They always i mean always have the greatest time i see there smile and them laughing.                                  Lastly,we get ready to go to bed. I think in my head that I so happy that i work at the circus if you grow up to be a circus person i tell you that its going to be fun and i mean really fun i was so glad when i found out that i was moving close by the circus i was so excited that i was crying of joy.I was crying because I always wanted to be in a circus even when i was little.So that how my life was when i was at the circus.

So,John started trying everything that was in the circus clowns,acrobats,juggler,lion tamer,ring master,extreme stunt men everything. Then he tryed tightrope walker and he was perfect at it he could tightrope walk back and forth for ten minutes and not fall.So he diecided to perform that in the circus.           The next day John told the ring master that he wanted to tightrope walk in the circus.So,The ring master said Ok lets get you ready for tonight.Right then John had to get a costume,make up,and a lot of other things.       The night of the circus John was nervous all of these bad thoughts ran through his head what if I mess up,what if I fall,what if I ruin the whole circus?Almost an hour has past and it john`s turn.He went on the tightrope and started to walk then he noticed a obsticle was in the way there was noway around or under it so he jumped it and made it.He`d never jumped any thing on a tightrope before and he jumped it on his first time.From then on he had preformed in every circus.

He usually trains animals,but this time he will walk the tight rope. He has never done this trick before. For this trick Dan must walk on a really skinny rope with nothing but a pole to balance him.        He practices and practice but he always falls off at the end. He gets people to try to help him cut he still can't do it right.Then John  came and helped him. He taught him to go real slow and he made it all the way across        When it was his turn at the show he climed up the later and started to walk across. When he got halfway to the end he looked down and saw everyone cheering him on. He continued to walk across  and he made it without falling. everyone clapped and cheered looks like all that practice paid of' John said do you want to do the same next week' charlie asked 'sure 'Dan said 	NNP VBZ DT NN WP NNS IN DT NNP NNP VBZ TO VB JJ IN DT NN NN NN VBZ JJ NNS NNS IN PRP VBZ VBG DT JJ NN PRP VBZ RB VB NNP NNP RB VBZ NNS , CC DT NN PRP MD VB DT JJ NNP NNP VBZ RB VBN DT NN NNP NNP DT NN NNP MD VB IN DT RB JJ NN IN NN CC DT NN TO NN NNP NNP VBZ CC NN CC PRP RB VBZ IN IN DT NNP NNP VBZ NNS TO VB TO VB PRP VB PRP RB MD RB VB PRP -NONE- NNP VBD CC VBN NNP NNP VBD PRP TO VB RB JJ CC PRP VBD PRP RB DT NN IN WRB PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN DT NN PRP VBD RP DT JJ CC VBD TO VB NNP NNP PRP VBD RB TO DT NN PRP VBD RP CC VBD NN NN PRP NNP NNP VBD TO VB RP CC PRP VBD PRP IN NNP NN VBD CC VBN NNS IN DT DT NN VBD IN POS NNP VBD VBP PRP VB TO VB DT JJ JJ NN '' NN VBD JJ JJ VBD

The first time we went me and my friend wanted to be the first people on the elephant. So we ran as fast as we could and we didn't think of how we would ride. When we got on the back of the elephant the lady told use we were riding the elephant wrong so she asked if we would like to see how you really ride a elephant. We said yes and then the lady got onto the elephants trunk and she looked like a sloth. We were so sprised and then we trided to do it and when we were done we asked if we could ride the circus horses and we had the time of our life.

'her name is Amber Emett she is really good at doing it. She likes the curcius beacause she is really good at it and likes to do it. But she dosent do it anymore beacause she didnt have very fun.   One day my family went to a curicas and they loved it very much, but i didn't get to go because I was sick and I didn't go witch is very sad. My parents made fun of me because I didnt go the year after that and went to a friends house. My parents were sad because I didnt go.   I think they had fun.   I wish I would have went with them.   They had lots of fun because I didnt go.   But this I am going well i guess maybe.   Hope i can it sounds like it is fun and the curcais is always fun beacuse you get to go on rides on elefents and stuff like that. If you work there you would proble get to have lots of fun on like rides and sitting in the front row of the blechers and get to bring your friends and family have a good time at the circus Bella don't get hurt our break anything and have to go to the hosspital our anything like that. If you like the circus than you should be in it and do awesome tricks like front flip, back flip maybe a summer salt or something you like to do. I dont thinnk if i was bella i would proble not be in the circus because it would scar me. Why? Well it wouldnt be any fun because you would have to go high in the sky.

They swing from really high places at about seventy feet high catching each other in mid-air without falling. My brother is a clown, he gets to act all silly and goofy. Once he pulled atrick on me. My sister is a lion tamer and she's great at that. I train the horses and elephants to do all sorts of tricks. So far I have trained my horses to stand on their hind legs and walk like a person and another one is me standing on two horses with one foot on each horse.

I have been in this Circus for now (counting years) 1 no 2 no 3 no but 4 years I have been here. I am a girl and I have an italian accent.I have many great stories of the Circus but today I will tell you my favorite story.                It all went down on the 2nd show on Sunday... I was getting dressed up by my trainer Savanna.She gently slid her hands up and down and side to side among my Beautiful pink dress checking for bumps.I wore a little pink and white polka-dot bow on my left ear with som little soft comfy white booties.Iwas almost done getting my dress on when Ace my partner came in and sat on the floor eyes set on me, he wore a black tuxideo with a top hat.I looked at him with barking twice to note him I was almost done getting dressed.A minute later Bo Ace's trainer came in putting a hand on savanna's shoulder.                I got VERY anoyed with this constant act of affection for Bo and Savanna.every time it happened I jumped up and down barking at the top of my lungs, but Ace didn't seem to mind that at all I could tell he thought him and I would do that someday too but I coulden't amigan.I broke this love fest up with 6 howls and a yip then Savanna put on my last bootie and set me on the floor.               I ran to the curtain just waiting right behind it so when Savanna,Bo,and Ace came we could all run out on the big platform and Ace and I would jump through hoops,fire hoops,and jump onto Savanna's back while Bo held a hoop for Ace to jump in.The curtain went up And Ace and I were center attion, suddenly that very moment Ace stopped jumping and walked up to me and gave me a quick little lick.The crowd's booing went on and on I couldn't take it much longer so with two leaps I jumped onto the trampoline and did a front flip and landed on all four.The crowd stopped silent for a moment then a HUGE wave of applase was let apon me and my crew.               little 6 and 7 year olds ran up to the small fence that blocked them going in to the big stage.They held notebooks and pens in their hand sreaming and hollering 'I WANT YOUR ATOGRAPH!!'.I heard a faint screeching in my ear getting louder and louder then I couldn't hear the fans screaming anymore,I only saw the kid's mouths sreaming.               My crew and I all waved and walked behind the redish curtain and we were done for that night.Before I went to bed I walked up to Savanna and put my paw on my ear and scratched sooo hard.Her mouth moved but I didn't hear what she said.She quickly picked up the telephone and dialed Doc Bellin's number.I layed down waiting for the door to open and in come Doc Bellin.As I supposed he bursted through our small door and hurled himself onto my bed.He opened my moth looked inside my nose and looked in my ears.I senced worry in Doc.He said something to Savanna and she cried.             Doc rubbed Savanna's back and talked to her.He brought out a needle and stuck the needle into my neck he patted me until I felt woozy and fell asleep.I woke up with my ears hurting and throbbing.I saw Savanna's mouth move and...'I CAN HEAR!!' I thought.Savanna moved her mouth and said without any motions 'Come here Zepher.'.I got up and sat at her feet.She sighed and said to Doc 'She can hear,She's not deaf!'I looked at her with suspicion.She patted me an said It's ok girl then we all slept for that night.            Acouple months later Ace was a father and I had 4 lovely puppies 2 girls and 2 boys.After that things were all good.             And that was my favorite Circus story.Hope you enjoyed it!!

My name is John my performing name is The Flying John. That's my performing name because I get shot out of a cannon. In the circus I got no family, but I feel like all the other performers are my family.                 When I first came to the circus I wanted to be a trapeze artist but they said I was to chubby and they couldn't carry me. Then, I asked if I could join the clowns. They accepted. I went to practice with the clowns the next day. It was very funny to practice with them, they did very funny things. When it was my turn to show my skills the clowns didn't like me, they said I wasn't funny enough. I thought I was never going to find the right thing to do.                 Then, I saw that the person that got shot out of the cannon quit. I thought 'This is my chance.' So, I went to ask the ringmaster if I could do that. He said yes but that it will take a lot of practice. I kept practicing until I got it. The only thing that bothered me is that what if I didn't land on the net. Tonight was my first performance. I was facinated to see what other people could do. By the end of the show I was getting so many compliments. Then I became the greatest performer that circus had ever had.

There was a boy named Joseph. He dreamed to be a clown. One night Joseph went outside to throw the trash away.A big wind came a blew him to a tree he went asleep on the tree.The next morning  he woke up he was in a circus he didint know why he went wandering around and found his parents.His parents were clowns!They did a show Joseph wanted to be a clown and play in the show.His parents gave him a front row tickets to watch the show.                                                                                                                                                                                            The ring master invited to play a part.         Joseph jumped out of his seat and took the invite.  Joseph was a clown that had to go on the tightrope and hit himself with pie walking on the tightrope. He didin't care he only cared that he was a clown. He was about to start the show. He woke up and it was just a dream but when his parents came in the room they were dressed as a clown and said Happy Birthday Joseph! And gave him a big cake for him. And took him the the circus for his Birthday. And he got to be a clown for a day.

You have to learn lots of things like a being a funny circus clown, Doing difficult acrobats, juggling, being a tight rope walker. Training circus horeses, and more.Its also hard to wake up early and trying to do lots of things.Its fun to do other jobs like being a food vender or stage hand or usher  but training animal are the best. you could train elephants,dogs,horses,snakes and more.                          During the circus thousand of people come to see us do ammazing tricks. But since we have to go to about 150 cities we might have to know new languages for them to undestand us and if were going to different places we meet new people thats what Ilike about the circus. when we go to diffrent places its really fun to see different views like Big Ben, going to Paris.                             I like working in the zoo beacause playing with exoti animals,traveling alot, fun to see all acts,get to expirence things you never done, and learning new things. The toys they give out at the mercandise shop are awsome. You could get a stuff animal, bracelets,t-shirts, and hats.Thas why I like the merchandise shop.                          Clown are my favorite part of the circus they might be funny or scary but are so cool and I think its awsome.Then I think the food vender is good at making food they make hot dogs, cotten candy and other delicious food thats what you see in a circus.

After school I have to head home and practice juggling for tonight 'what a big day.'                    3:40A.M. Schools over time to practice as I was walking I passed by the circus and saw my mom and dad practicing on the rope. So I thought of just practice juggling here. First time 3 balls next 4, 5, 6 i kept on adding and adding until I got the hang of it. My parents said that I was amazing.                     8:30P.M. I was getting ready since the shaow starts at 9 WOW! This place is so crowded people from all over the world speaking diffrent kinds of language. But then I saw the clock i had to go back stage and get ready first was my parents then the taming lion then the horses I was the last act finally my turn. Once I got out crowds cheering then I started I added more and more when i was finish the crowd got even more louder. I bowed and left.                      10:30P.M.

There is a reason for that nickname, and I'm going to tell you why. When I first joined the circus I was just looking for a college job. But after a while I started to want to stay. It was fun and exiting. I liked the risk of flipping through the air. Oh, by the way, I'm a trapeze artist.            'Are you ready yet?' The circus master asked. 'Totally' I replied with a grin. It was my first live performance. I watched the clock as the second hand curved toward the twelve. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0! I was on! I ran off the platform and savored the roaring of the crowd. I flipped off of one swing and onto another. I went soaring through the air and flipped one way or another. Then I noticed something out of place.            Where was the landing platform? I realized with panic that there was nowhere for me to land! I made a split second decision and jumped toward an elephant. I landed on his back and bounced toward a  swimming pool. I landed with a loud KER-SPLASH! The crowd went wild! And ever since then, I have loved performing in the circus.

The is was the first time I ever jumped a very small hoop. I was nerves and scared. Finely it was my turn to jump that little tinny hoop. I was running full speed about 40 to 43 mph then did a kart wheel and spun in the air Swoosh I made it the people cheered and laughed.

James came in.'What's...''he began but then went dead silent.''OH NO!''James ran away and started screaming 'CARL!CARL! YOUR NEEDED!''.All but suddenly reality smacked her face.It was the lions cage that was opened.Jennifer almost fainted.She raced back to her trailer and saw that Carl was gone.He left a note however.It read''Jennifer, i went out for a moment to walk Charlie.Don't worry, i haven't disappeared this timeJennifer would've giggled if she weren't absolutely terrified.The last time Carl left everyone thought he ran away from the circus.Okay Jennifer calm down now I think James has got this all under control, she thought to herself.She then remembered James's panic in finding Carl.So maybe NOT under control.She heard a low rumbling sound coming from the showers.Jennifer got up the courage to walk up to the shower.With her shaky hand she whipped open the shower.There,Sitting in the shower,was a six foot tall, carnivorous,lion.Jennifer tried to scream but it came out all Squeaky.At the sound of that,the lion slightly turned it's head.Jennifer saw it's ferocious brown eyes.He roared so loudly that the lamp broke.Jennifer stepped backwards and tripped.Thud!She hit her head. Her vision was blurry but she could see the lion clearly.She stumbled to get uo then hit the floor again.She opened the mini fridge and saw a huge piece of raw steak.Jennifer stood up and retrived the meat. The lion roared again and he pounced.Jennifer dodged it and ran out.'JAMES!'' James stopped screaming and his eyes widened when he saw the lion.He ran to the gate and opened it.Jennifer stopped in the entrance of the gate and stood.She didn't know what she was doing.JENNIFER MOVE!''James screamed.The lion was coming right at her.She did an ariel leap over the tiger and James slammed the cage shut.Jennifer was sweating and was out of breath.Carl then walked up to them.''What did i miss?''he asked.'Nothing Carl,Nothing at all.'Jennifer replied smiling.That night was her biggest night of the year.Jennifer got a strange feeling.That feeling was confidence 	NNP VBD DT JJ WP VBD VBG IN PRP$ JJS JJ NN NNS IN PRP MD VB JJ DT NN VBD DT IN VBG CC VBG CC VBG NNS , CC RB IN PRP VBZ VBN IN DT NN NN IN : DT NN PRP VBZ IN RB IN EX VBZ VBG CC VBG , EX VBZ JJ RBR TO DT NN TO NNP VBD IN PRP$ NN IN DT NNS CC DT NN NN VBD RB CD NNP CC PRP VBD RB -NONE- RB VB JJ VBZ RB DT NN IN VBG , PRP RB VBP JJ RBR TO NNP NN NN VBD TO PRP$ IN PRP VBD RP DT JJ , RB RB RB WP PRP VBP TO VB IN VBZ VBG TO VB RP DT NN CC NNP MD VB PRP$ '' NNP .

You get dress in to regular cloths and go to school just like you would at home.  The difference is that you get to stay in one town.  Our school comes with us.  We get out of school and we play and do chores then practice.  The show ends at 10:30 and I go to bed.   That's the life of acirus person. It's hard but very fun to do.

But you have to practice like all the time. I'm an acrobat. I love to hung out with my friends. My partner is Logan he is 25 years old.'              We perform in front of a lot people. We have a lot of children who want to be like us. I never thought that I would be an acrobat. Now I am.               You should become apart of the circus. You would love it. You can become like me. We  travel 20,000 miles, 7 mouths, and 150 cities each year. Wow that's a lot. It is so much fun. Do you like to dress up? If you do you get to dress up in awesome costumes.               We perform a hole bunch of cool tricks for all of  you. We do back-flips in the air, we are very strong, we lift each other with a chain and our mouths. We can flip to each other in the air.   REMEMBER DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME!               When i first started I was like no way i was  going to do this. But then when I started doing the tricks then  I was like  this could be my new job. Now I am an acrobat. I love my new job and I work here and I give lessons to people who want to be an acrobat                Now I hope you want to an acrobat just like me.

He didnt want his friends toknow  thathe works at a circus.so when he say one of the memmbers he freaked out and  went to  the restroom to hide.          The next day he asked his mother to shave her beer of  and his mother asked why and the son said for no reason,and they just moved along.The night had com and the son stayed up and the mom fell asleep and the son went to get a shaver and at night he was going to shave  her beer og but the mother woke up and the just gave her a kiss to not make it suspicieos.         It was the day of the circus for the special event. The sun was going to be part of the show .He was getting ready to go on a rope to balance the rope was pretty high. When he was about to go on it he saw his friends and got scared and emberess so he wasn't concentraded so if you get on a rope to balance you have to be very concentraded but the son was not concentraded so he fell of the rope and droped off from about 8 or 9 feet,during the circus. His  mom tried to help up but he didnt wake up.           So after that they toke him to the hospital and said that he would have to be in a wheel chair for a pretty long time unless that he learns how to walk again,but the doctor daubted it.So they went back home and the son was really mad at his mother. He started screaming at his mother and told her to shave off her beer , but his mom didnt shave her beer off because she makes jokes in the circus whith her beer and if she takes it of she will get kicked out and not make money to help her son not to starve to death,but then he also refused not to go to school untill he learns how to walk again.So then he didnt go to school.             So the next day his friends heard of what happend to him and they went to visit im but he didnt let them in because his mom was their.So the next day he actually went to school and his friends saw him and told him that he felt sorry for him at that moment his mom came to pick him up and he started screaming at her telling her what she come for and the guys started laughing and the girls were just telling the guys to be quiet and they left the girls went to visit him and talked to him not be emberessed by what his mom looks like or have just ignore the people who thinks its funny. So he went to a place were they teach them how to walk again and he laerned how to walk again and he wasnt emberess anymore and he kept working in the circus very happily.

In the circus they have to travel all over the world just to fascinate and amaze many different people.you need to set up evrything so people can get amazed and go to your circus,like for example big posters that say ''Circus circus come and enjoy our fun loving circus now!evrysingle day your probably going to have many different people come and enjoy the circus,but evry single day your going to need to clean up after them.It's pretty much true you are going to need to clean up after them because the audience does make a big mess evry time they go to the circus,like litterally all the popcorn and soda spills all over the floor.                 Many circus's have a special place where performers from the circus go to eat,they call it the ''Pie car'',and no they don't eat and buy pure pie right there,only becauase it's called a Pie car doesn't mean they sell and eat pure pie there.you can't eat too mch though because you still have to do some more performances!many performers enjoy the food there.                Circus workers need to travel evry where almost around the world,and this is all just so people can come to the circus.It is very difficult to travel sometimes because the workers may get sick.Even if they get sick they still decide to travel.they all ways travel no matter if it's near or far.they travel evrywhere evry single day.                As you can see working at the circus is easy and hard at the same time.You get to do many different things at the circus but some thing include lots of training.They also travel alot and you might get sick on the way to your destination!Your always going to need to clean up after the audience leaves because if you don't it's going to be a mess.remember their your adience let them be proud and enjoy the performances!

I am supposed to perform being shot out of a cannon doing a 360 back flip ,swing on acrobat monkey bars,and land on a mattress.And that will be the final act or event in the show.      3 hours later... The announcer came out. He called the first performer(The Tight Rope Walker). His act is to walk on the tight rope without falling and juggle too. He called out the next performer((horse)Flame Jumper). The horse's act was to jump through the hole of flame. After that he called the next performer s(Flying Man and Miss Hanger).Their act was Miss Hanger grab on to the acrobat monkey bar and Flying Man grab on her legs,swing,put legs on on other acrobat monkey bar,and let go.On the come around Flying Man grabs Miss Hangers legs and when Flying Man swung back to other platform while Flying Man fly's on to a mattress.      Now on the grand finally the one you've all been waiting for (Cannon Flip Acrobat o Man).When I got shot out of the cannon I could see much awestruck in the peoples eyes. After I finished my act everybody was screaming my name, throwing flowers, and also wanting my auto graph. So when the owner of the circus saw me he was amazed he was so awestruck he was so dumbfounded it was so manifest in his countenance.      When he could speak again he told me I was gonna be on TV and on the newspaper all around the world.

Bella is in middle school and hates the circus. I can't stand all of those clowns. To be honest clown creep me out. It just seems like they are cute and funny but really they are evil. That is why I never go near the circus.       Great I have a test today in math. If you didnt know that is my worst subject. It is also my beat friend Cathy Santoinis worst subject. Well I dont know why cathy and I are best friends we have nothing in common. Except that we are both horrible in math. one thing that she loves and I absoulotly hat eis that she loves the circus. Some times i have second thoughts about being best friends. Yes its 3:00 I CAN GO HOME!       What? Sorry honey but we are going to the circus. I cant belive my mom just said I have to go to the circus! This is the worst day of my life.       Now I am at the circus with my family and we just put a raffle ticket in and they are pulling them out. First The harrison family, then the jackson family, then the bardos family. Oh no we got called. Come on up! Now we have to train elephants. Wow this is actually fun. And then on I now love the circus.

Horseback been my family for years. I am going to jump of a trampoline onto a horse's back today. Before I practice I have to groom them and feed them. It is hard to do it thought. You would have to be brave enough to do a stunt like that. Remember to use safety items on. Since i am a girl I probity chicken out.                                                                                 There is a lot to learn if you have a horseback riding act. You have to: First you have to learn how to ride the horse. Next you learn the basic acts. After That you do even harder tricks. Then you have to learn the stuff I am doing now and put it in a show.                                   It is fun riding horses and showing of my talent. I will always ride horses at the circus. I love the circus. It is my best home forever.                                                                                                                   I think horse back riding will be in my family forever. As long as I am here I will like this CIRCUS forever.

An it thakes a lot of praices to proform. Them stunts the do a lot of wead thang and that what is what is weard.A circus is mostly two colers red and whight.                                                                                                                                                                       A circus is all about animals that git put in shows. That proform in front of people to make them lafe.Some time people get to proform to and that's cool.The are clown that porform to the are spost to be funny but the ant to me.There are tightrope walkers that is wine you walk across a rope that is very long.                  The people let you see the animale's at the end of the show to look at them.That is fun I bet but some of the animals have to be in cages.That is because the are dangers animals to be arond.Some of the animals can kill you. That why them animal are cageed in so the don't get you.

Now, these two kids have names, the boy was named Oliver and the girls was named Astroria. Thay left the orphanage because they where called runts (ironic, right?) and always left them out. Impressively, they managed to get out of there and decided to live their life as two performers to get away from the orphanage and the bullies. The day they made it to the circus it was ,of course, a nice morning. Let's start this story, shall we?'Finally, were here!' shouted Oliver, that had his mouth covered quickly. 'Shhh!' said Astroria, 'you'll wake the performers' she continued.They had to wait for the gates to open before going in.  Eventually they waited until the gate was opened and quickly scampered in. Once in they met the owner of the circus.'Mister Tillman!' Oliver called out.'Who's there?' Tillman answered. Tillman was a strong man and also is a performer, but only for the beginning.'We'd like to be in your circus!' Astroria replied. 'Where are your parents?' Tillman asked. 'W-were orphans and we'd like to be performers!' stutered Astroria. 'Are you two related?', Tillman asked. 'We think not...' said Astroria. 'Well it's okay if I let you two be performers if you guys promise me your acts could be chosen.'Tillman asks. 'Of course' both reply. Many months past and the two perfectly fit in with the others, but one day. 'Okay todays act for you two is......acrobatics!' said Tillman. Over the time, both kids have became more skillful at the circus and acrobatics were their favorite act. Before the act starts Oliver ask Tillman for fire effects at the end and Tillman agreed. Durring their show, everyone was amazed by their moves and tricks. 'Okay this is it , try to do as many frontflips as you can!' reminded Astoria to Oliver. 'I got this' replies Oliver. Oliver springs off aboard, does a few flips and perfectly lands in the safety net. At the same time Astroria, still standing on the board falls off because of a shining light hitting her eyes. Oliver notices and (by pure luck) finds a trampoline, bounces on it, catches Astroria, does another flip, and perfectly lands as the fire effects go off. Everything is silent but out of nowhere  the crowd chants,shouts, and whistles. Later that night everyone treated them with even more respect than they did before. They still performed but they chose their permanent act would be acrobatics. The End.

One Beautiful morning, I was going down to the market, when I saw almost the entire townspeople looking at the 'HELP WANTED' wall. Well, I was not going to just stand there staring like a buffoon, so I went down there, to see what the hullabaloo was about. The hullabaloo was that there was a 'HELP WANTED' sign for the Circus!! Now, I don't know about you, but if there's a Circus, they make MONEY! If you saw them you would pay them for just being there, I mean they, like, radiate money. Well, me and my folks could use some of that money, so I hurried up with my tasks and went home to tell my folks about the chance we had. They were ECSTATIC about doing it. They wanted all of us (Lewis, Sarah, Miles, and I) to try out for it. 'It'll give this family a better chance of getting in!!' My mama said. 'And which ever one of you gets in-you go for it!!' On the 'Try-outs' we were so exited! when we (individually) tried out, me and Sarah got in, but the boys didn't. Lewis was fuming! He was so mad, he almost broke his computer!! 'I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN IN THERE!! NOT SARAH AND LEIA!!' He shouted.   I'll bet you're wondering how my first day went. Well, on the first day we had a lot of fun. First, I walked in to the tent they had put up. Then, I saw all of the Circus! All of whom I saw was: the Clowns: the Acrobats; and-OH, MY, GOD!!! The Tight Rope Walkers!!! I walked right over there, and they welcomed me as if I had been their friend forever. They helped me do their routines, and they even let me do one on my own!!! They were so kind, they let me use their ropes (since I didn't have on yet) and made me feel right at home. I was so happy, that I forgot I had a performance that morning, AND that I was dreaming about the first time I walked in and met every one!! 'That was the best show yet!!' Sarah said. I had told my sister about my dream and she thought I was re-imagining how I had felt because I was nervous. The fact is, I am nervous. But I don't dream things when I'm nervous. So, I don't know what to think of it. 'Well, wish me luck!' I said. She and I said 'See ya' and I went to the 'Performance Tent' to rehearse.   I was the BEST out there. When the crowd cheered, I just stood in the finished position and just Smiled. That was the best day of my life!!

The people came in the tent like a stamped of buffalo. The circus is packed with people ready to be amazed. 'Our first act of the night is the world's funniest clowns.'said the announcer The clowns were super funny.They through pies at each other,the flowers they had sprinkled water on each other,then they all packed into a little car and left. The crowd was cracked up. 'Our next act will blow your mind, we have our lion tamer. She will tame our lion with just a small stool and a whip.' said the announcer. The crowed watch in ah while they saw the lion tamer work her magic. 'Now for our acrobats to perform over a flaming net!' said the announcer. As the crowd watch the acrobats they were blown away by the manginess of them. 'Get ready for our final act of the night we have our world famous tight rope walker, Gunther Granday. He will also perform over a flaming net.' said the announcer. Gunther started walking the tight rope he reach the middle of the rope then, the crowd gasped. Gunther fell! But then Gunther grabbed the rope with his legs and got back up on it and walked all the way across. The crowd was more amazed then ever. 'Thank you all for coming' said the announcer.

Traning in rhythmic gymnastic will take years.Some pepole concintrate on dancing and preforming.You can be a circus acrobat,circs juggler,circus and a  tightrope walker.Despit what many people think,the life of a circus preformar isn't all high-flying fun and games and clowning around.It's more glamorous than being an account, but there are some drawbacks. Circus performers isin't work long days and spend  a lot of time away from home.

First of all, having fun at a circus having fun at a circus is a dream come true because a circus only comes once a year and with alot of good musicians,circus clowns, circus acrobats, circus jugglers, circus tightrope walkers,and sometimes circus horses. When i was about 8 yrs. old my daddy took me too the circus and an actress was performing at the circus. She had a Michel Jackson dance contest and ofcurse my brother won. The winner got to take a picture with the actress and the actress put her leg on top of my brother. it was really funny but sence then the circus didn't come back and no one knows why.                             Second of all, enjoyable peaple should enjoy the circus because their are alot of good ,talented, and amazingly greatfull peaple actresses to come and do a show for us.Clowns are very nice some of them and some peaple are afraid of them like little kids love clowns i know i still love clowns and other peaple don't sence they are little kids but they don't know why. I was afraid of clowns once but my friend Victoria her dad is a clown and he talked me out of it and sence he talked to me about not being afraid of clowns and i haven't been afraid of clowns any more by the way my friend victoria's dad is very halarious.                     In Conclusion,When you go to a circus you have to have fun enjoy it and love it because like i said it only comes once a year and maybe the story that i told you may help about me and that story is true. And if you ever get to go to a circus again make sure to buy alot of suff like lights, nachos, icecream cones, cotton candy, enter contest and alot more of alot of activities. I know i loved playing all kinds of activities and buying icecream cone. So if you ever go to a circus enjoy play eat and love it.

Being a circus performer isn't all fun and games, I still have to do homework like any other kid, and practice preforming. An advantage for me, is that you get to travel all over the world and meet different people. It's really cool because making people from different countries laugh and amazed is a really good feeling.                      My family and I usually have to sleep in a big trailer and have to spend a lot of time from home, but I'm cool about it. I sometimes think if I'll ever to actually live in our house, but I guess it's just one of the backslides you get as a circus performer. I do get homesick sometimes, but I try that not to stop me from preforming.                   People usually think that preforming is really easy but it's really not! We may make it look easy, but those moves takes a lot of training and talent. I joined the circus 2 years ago when I was 8. I started with gymnastics and then started wanting to become a performer. I knew it it would require patience and talent, so I tried my best. My parents were kind of worried about me not being home all the time, but I told them I would be OK.                 As you can see being a circus performer has it's advantages and non-advantages. I still love being a performer in front of people, but people should make sure to think about it first. My name is Andy and I see you next time!                                                   	PRP$ NN VBZ NNP NNP CC PRP MD VB PRP IN NNS NN .

'I'm joining the circus today and i'm really excited,'I said.My mom is with me and she is filling out the paper so I can try out.The next thing I do is go check out the circus tent,it was amazing I said to myself.Then I saw some bowling pins and a unicycle I started doing both at the same time because I knew I had to try out to join.           Then the anuoncer said,'If your trying out go to the middle of the circus tent!'At that moment I sprinted to the middle and I was the first one there then only about six more kids showed up.Then a funny looking guy came up to us and said,            'Howdy young circus performers,i'm goofie,your instructer,'he had a strange yet funny accent.I asked,            'Is this where we try out at?'Goofie said,            'Yup, yupidie yup yup yup.'            Next we started trying out I tyred my best at riding and juggling at the same time I thought I did ok.Then Goofie said,            'Ok folkes since there were only one two three four,'I could here him whisper counting.'As I was saying since there are only seven of you you all made it.'Every one started cheering but me.I was happy that I made it but sad becuase I made only because there weren't enough kids.Then Goofie whispered to me,            'You were the only kid who did good.'As soon as I heard him say that I burst into joy.I went home and told my mom everything and lived the life of a circus clown untill I died.

Suddenly, the circus was there and out stepped Max, the famous single-man circus. Why did he join the circus when he is only ten years old and makes everyone laugh. He wears regular clothes for his circus acts and his parents work at the most high-tech software company every.                When the circus started, he was the circus acrobat, circus juggler, the circus clown, and the circus tightrope walker. What made the people laugh, is the announcer called different names, but everytime it was Max. When the circus was over Max had earned one trillion dollors from the some of the trillionaires watching the circus total, in one circus act. he earned more money than both of his parents mony combine times ten.   Thats why Max joined the circus.         	CD NN IN NNP , NNP , EX VBD VBG CC VBG IN NN , NNP NN VBZ VBG .

My mom and dad pushed me in to being a circus performer when I was 4. I was very flexible for my age. That made my dad very happy because he was a  tightrope walker so I can be a acrobat. When I was 6 my dad went to go do something and left me next to the rope. When he came back  I was doing handstands on the rope. He was flabbergasted when he saw me. He said you are two in one and there is no way they won't exept her. When I was 8 my dad toke me to the owner of the of the circus and he was happy too but then he said that he already had a girl like her and only had two men but only one of them was like her too. He said we will do 3 shows first to two wins.   I met the girl the next day she seemed nice until I talked to her she was tring to put presure on me so I will mess up and she gave me a pair of shoes that were so slippery that i fell every time i spun around. She wasn't going to play fair she was going to cheat.        This is the first show and to told her to get the my new shoes and I lnew she was going to get the ones that were slippery so I fell and blamed it on her. She won that show but the manager know she cheated so he is watching her now so I will feel more safe now that he is watching. The nexted show I won because he said that I was fresh, eligant, and graceful. My dad was right there nexted to me after that show he was so proud of me. Then I got wrried if I don't do something new I could go home. My dad was tring to think of something to do and it reminded me of me childhood. Then I forgot that my mom was going to be there. I wanted to surprise her. I remembered that I loved to do the monkey bars and I can try doing a trick on it. Then my dad remebered that i was good at throwing and juggleing.I found what I was going to have a volenteer stand by a wall and I will juggle knifes and throw it at the volenteer while I am on the tightrope.Also I am going to pretend to fall off but catch to ropr and do a flip and land on my feet. The fun part is that the volenteer is going to be the other two in one girl. The show went just like I planned it and the knife went right above her head.         I won the last show so I get two stay in the circus it was fun to win but my effert and detrmination won it for me and my genuis helped alot to. In the end you can be the best and not make it because you didn't push your self. It is good to take risk sometimes if the risk is worth taking.

My favorite thing to do is tight roping. Tight roping is where you are about 50 feet in the air with a 12 foot long stick to balance you for walking across a 1foot wide rope thats 30 feet long that you have to walk across. sounds crazy right,thats what  i do every show.       When i put my feet on the rope, it sinks down from my weight and i start walking, thats when my head starts spinning but i just keep on walking. If you've ever stood on one foot this is nothing like this, this is one foot in front of the other and is much harder than balancing on one foot, walking on that tiny rope feels walking on air , really really  high in the air with a stick for balance. But once you get on the rope you can't go to fast and you can't go to slow,you cannot make any mistakes when tight roping, it's all about timing.

'I don't know Hunter' said Alexis talking to her brother. 'Why not!' exclaimed Hunter. 'You are in shape, have good balance, and you get to travel the world!' Alexis was walking around her house trying to decide. Then, Alexis said she would join the circus tomorrow. Her parents said it was ok, and they went to bed.       The next morning Alexis and her family went to the circus sign-ups. Alexis was really nervous. Then her mother said 'Hello my daughter would like to join the circus. Is this where we sign in?' There was a big man in a white shirt and he nodded. The man lead Alexis and her family to a tent that was filled with people all over the world lining up to sign in for the circus. 'Are you sure you want to join the circus?' asked Alexis's father. 'Yes. I want to perform in the circus.' said Alexis.       A man blew his whistle and everybody went to him. 'Anybody who is joining the circus go in that corner.' Everybody went over there inclouding Alexis. He pointed to Alexis and said 'Whats your talent?' He asked. 'Ummm umm' Alexis didn't really have a talent so she blurted out 'Walking on the tightrope' she said. 'Ok you go over there' he said.       She walked on the tightrope very well. She didn't fall once.' Ok we will be leaving for our first tour tomorrow.' He said. 'TOMORROW!!!' Alexis screamed. They all ran back to their places to practice more. Alexis said goodbye to her parents. Then she went to practice. She was sad that she wouldn't see her parents for a while, but she was happy she was joining the circus.

Well, it contains hard work and a lot of dedication and you must have the right body type. You need a lot of fexlibility and training to be a circus preformer. There are many ups and downs of being a circus preformer too, it isnt just perfect there are many hardships that you will face along the way. Bella ( a circus preformer) traveled 20,000 miles in ONE YEAR!  You will probably also be wiped out from the practices and the show that you will do. You also have to STILL do school but, in a one roomed school house! The ups of being in the circus is you can practice stunts and flexibility. You also get to see all the different kinds of animals that are in the circus which are mostly wild ( but tamed) animals.                                                   Story about the circus By: Hallie Solie                                                                                                                                                                                           People probably could look at me and think that I was not a circus preformer. I don't ike the cold stares people give my mom when we go out in public with our face paint on. I don't want to be in the circus, but it is seomthing that I love and can't quit! I first joined the circus when I was 4. My parents wanted to keep me at a reasonable age to join the circus because there were so many different stunts involved. I first started meeting with a dance and gymnastics teacher every day, every week. We practiced keeping the beat and ometimes even different stunts. Soon when I was 8 I could do any gymnastics trick that anyone asked me. I was a terrific gymnast/ dancer and I officially joimed the circus after that. The first time I did a stunt it was revolting and unrealistic. I swung from bar to bar until I reached the end of the fish net. it was so scary yet so fun that I wanted to keep on doing it until I died. When I fell I just got right back up. My mom called me Wonder Women. Now, its different.       I get to have my own part in the show! I will be doing gymnastics AND dance! It will be so much fun! It was totally worth 10 years of waiting! I guess since I am 14 I am old enough to run the show! My first dance was a major hit! People loved it and applaud me loudly! It was the most beautiful clap I have ever heard in my entire preforming life. I would have to do a gymnastics act later tonight. My gymnastics act was even better! The claps were louder and more real. Back tucks and Front tucks were the main idea of what I was doing. People wistled and screamed my name! If I could do this all my life I would. Our next tour is in Boston ( I read my bosses planner  ) I hope they liked our act as much as Florida did!         Boston tour wasn't any different accept for my routine! The crowds applaud me like Florida did and they also screamed my name! Finally, people decided it was my time to do something that I wouln't do in a million years, I ran through the ring of fire! Johnny Cash blared through the radio and I looked at that small ring and jumped with all my  might. The fire burned me but it was something I could fit through. I guess I found my new circus act out.         	NNS IN DT NNP NNP VBZ PRP IN TO VB DT NN NN .

It is very fun but I never can call a place home or join a sports team. I will tell you how fun and difficult a circus life can be.           6:30 am  I wake up and get dressed in my acrobat suit and go into the food car and eat pancakes with the clowns. The clowns are fun to eat with but they always want to play with their food. A lot of times the human cannonball man makes the pancakes.         7:15 am I start practicing my acrobat routine with my brother. After I finish practicing for the night show I play with the clowns. I love to ride their unicycles. Happy the clown showed me how to ride one. Happy is my favorite clown because he always wants to play boardgames with me.         8:45 am School starts I usually learn about math, science,geography and reading. Some times we have a lot of homework and if I need help I usually ask my mom, dad or Happy.Whats really fun is that for recess we get to play with the monkeys. My favorite monkey in named Ty, he is the smallest of all the monkeys.         2:30 pm Schools over and I have to start doing my chores. My chores are to feed all of the animals and practice with them so they are ready for the 5:45 and 9:30 show. I practice with the tigers to jump through a ring of fire. I don't really have to practice with the elephants because they don't really do anything people just do tricks on them. Last I practice with the monkeys, they do acrobatic and tightrope acts. It is actually kind of fun to practice with the monkeys.          3:00 pm I have my meal before the show. I eat with the clowns and my brother, mom and dad. My mom is an animal trainer and my dad is a tight rope walker. I have to eat my supper at 3:00 pm because if would eat right before I do my acrobatic act I might get sick during the 5:45 show.         4:30 pm  We start setting up the stage. It is horrible setting up the stage for every show because when we tour the world  we have to set up each time we move cities. It is really hard for me to carry the big safety net for my acrobat performance. It must way 100 pounds!         5:45 pm We start the show. That's my favorite part because all of the hard training will pay off. It is very exciting being an acrobat because it fells like you are flying through the air and just when you are going to hit the ground I get swooped up by my brother.             8:30 pm We just finished the show. It was super fun, I love performing in front of people. All of the performers get a quick break before we all have to do the 9:30 show. I've always thought the 9:30 show was to late at night but I still have to do it anyway.         9:30 pm We have to start the 9:30 show. I know I said I love doing my acrobatic show but I hate doing it all over again. I'm really tired after the first show but I still have to do everything again! It is horrible.         12:00 am All of the shows are over for the day and I am pooped. Everything I do is super tiring And I have to do it all twice! It is super fun to be in the circus but it also has a lot of down sides.

You have to wake up at the crack of dawn to help set up the tent and make other preporations for opening night. It is always a nonstop crazy life. Working and practicing is one of the main things you do all day long. You prep the tent and feed the animals ( if you have any at the circus ).                 You lots of traveling all across the country or even the world!! You visit many new places like russia, america, india, china, and japan.

I'm excited, scared, and happy at the same time. I really hope I make it in, if I don't I don't know what I will do with my life. If I make it in , I'm planning to be an acrobat. I have been training for 4 years. Before that I was in gymnastics. Now, here I am trying out for the circus. Well I think I should be heading to bed now, I don't want to miss my big day!             Awww! Good morning. OH NO! I forgot, I'm trying out today. I need to get ready. Right now I'm half asleep and my tryouts start in 30 minutes! I'm just going to throw on some clothes and head out the door.                       Finally, I'm here just in time. All of a sudden I here my name. '' LEILANI! '' Someone yells. Oh, that's for me. I better go in to the room for tryouts. AAW. I can't believe this is happening. I'm walking in to the room. WOW! It's awesome in here. Theres ropes and bars everywhere. Then I here a booming vioce say, '' You may start now! '' Then I reply, ''Ok.'' So then I start my routine. I climb up on to the rope and do all kinds of tricks.Then I end and then the booming vioce came back again and said,'' Terriffic!'' Then I finally look around the room and see him. It is a clown! Then he says, '' Hello, my name is Balto, what is yours?'' I then say loud and clear, ''Leilani.'' Then he replied, ''Well,guess what you made it in the circus!'' Then I run all around the room saying thank you. I finally settle down and he says, ''The first show is tommorrw morning at 11:00, thank you.'' Then I walk out the room, head to the car, and my mom drives me home.                         Oh, yay. Today is my show and I'm already at the circus trailer.I practice a little then everyone starts to get here. Finally the show starts. Balto gives a nice start, now it's my time. I head out excited do a flip then jump on to the rope I do my part then head back stage again,as I walk away I here everyone cheering for me. I actully have to say that might have been the best moment of my life.

Me and my friend Rily want to the Amozon Circus for the inside scoop. Of what they do, me and rily want to find out what happens in the circus like, how many people perform, how they fly on the silks, and how they teach the animals to do cool tricks.       So me and Rily went to talk with the main cheif of the circus Mr. Hoeny. He said that each night they perform they have 60 people perform exact. He also said that 10 people do one trick on the animal they have been training but they each go one by one. Then the next groop will perform what they have to do. Until they are done the people who are not performing they will help run the show. So that what me and Rily got about how many people are in the circus.       Next we went to the flying silk tent and me and Rliy had to find someone to help us. So we found Madam Kishca the famous Silk person. So I was talking to her and she said the flying silks are really hard to master it anly took me 2 years to learn how to use the silks because I wanted to be in the circus and wene they had tryouts i was only 5 and i made it to the circus the gudges were impress about how well I did. So back on the report well on the flying silks we have to be flexible so we have to do gymnastics wich is easy if you have been doing it since you were 1 years old which i have been doing said Angelina the reporter. Next you have to  have good grips on the silks because it will hurt you if you dont have a tight grip.       The last thing is how do people train the animals. whaqt they do is that they use treats to help them understand what to do like counting painting and other stuff. that all you really need to know about the story.

Intro:  Hello, my name is Katie Johnson. I am 11 years old. In this story we are going to be talking all about the circus.                           Let's Join The Circus!        One day while I was sitting on my bed, I wanted to go for a walk. When I was outside I saw some flyers that said' JOIN THE CIRCUS TODAY!' Then I said to myself 'I want to join the circus now.' When I had got home I had asked my mom could we join the circus, surprisingly she said 'yes'. So we got Evey thing that we were taking.Then we had go plane tickets to go to our destination which was Africa.When we had arrived at Africa's airport we saw a big white and red tent. My mom and I had went inside the tent and signed a white sign up sheet. We interred the big tent and we got taught many of tricks. When everyone got their together we had a show. There were thousands of people there just to see us perform. Soon as the circus crew saw the audience they knew what they had been practicing.                             The performers!      The first performer was Andy, he was a lion tamer.  Andy had brown lions, and white lions. After Andy there was a gymnastics girl names Kate. Kate did back flips, jumps, and she cartwheeled off a moving horse.Finally, it was my turn I was the one who controls the elephants,  that had to be the best job of all of them. I made the elephants stand up.Also made the elephants hold up one hand. The whole crowed cheered and screamed.The circus did the same act everyday of one week . After the week was over we would make up new acts.The circus is like school you would go for a few months and then you would have a few months for a break.                                      After the shows I would help the other kids groom the animals. There  was two people there that I was really close to  her name is Madison and My mom. Madison is my best friend.When the tour around the world was over everyone went home. My best friend Madison moved next door to me ,so now I can see her everyday.We go to school together and we are in the same class.After school we go outside and practice some old circus acts. I all ways wished to be  in the circus and my wish came true.   Madison and I said when we grow up we would be awesome circus actors.That was my time in the circus.

His parents had just told him that they were going to go to the circus that Joseph worked at to watch him perform!Joseph has been working for the Alveni circus for two months, just enough to get the hang of it, but now that his parents were coming he felt like he had learned nothing.         There was only one thing to do. Practice, Practice, Practice.So Joseph left with an alarming,''By!'', hopped on his bike, and started pedaling. He checked his watch, 9:34 a.m., when he looked up, all he saw was the red and blue of the circus tent.On his way in he waved to Matt, his best friend out everyone at the circus. He quickly climbed up the ladder, and hung on to the trapeze. Before starting he took a big, deep, slow, breath. While he swayed he did amazing flips, alternating as if time didn't even exist anymore. This is how he always felt on the trapeze, but while he swung he saw his parents along with all of the fans. He was still looking when he plummeted into the net.          Oh no! He had forgotten he had a performance this morning!          When he woke up he heard,''And now, Joseph  Kelleman!''What the heck was going on!He looked down and saw Matt giving him two thumbs up, and managing a slight smile. Ohhh, Matt had brought him up here. Well, now or never. He grabbed on, and he did it!While he swayed back and forth he saw his parents smiling. Well, he saw them smiling upsidedown, but either way, it was success.                                                  	JJ NN .

Every morning its get up, get dressed, clean up after the animals, do your chores, eat breakfast, do some school work, practice, eat lunch, get ready for show, practice more for show and do the show.            I have to live like this everyday, it can get annoying, but you can't quit my family is in the circus with me. They can tell you how hard it is too, the clowns when I have time will sometimes let me ride their unicycles, its hard luckily I don't have to do that for a show, then I have to care for the animals more.             You will be surprised by how much you have to do shows, every few days you put on a new show. I have to help put up the tents, bring the animals in, fed the animals, get everything to the places they need to be and always be prepared for the worst in the circus life.             There are many animals we have to take care of, leopards, lions, tigers, elephants, chimpanzees and more but there are a lot of them. We have special trainers for the animals to do their acts with, I take care of the horses and elephants mostly, the elephants are the smelliest animal I'll ever meet!               My act is standing on two running horses, and then when they start getting farther apart I do the splits with my feet on different horse backs. Many of my family members travel with us, and other people I know come with us. Many of the people in the circus are either from my family, or my neighborhood I lived in.              Back when I lived in my neighborhood I went to sleep at 8 p.m. but here, I don't get to sleep till 12 in the morning. Living in the circus is hard, and it takes forever to get used to, but when you do get used to it, you won't ever go back.             Bad part is, if you wan to be an acrobat, you have to be right body shape and have determination. Some people join for fun, some wanting to see the world while having a fun job, many come by themselves and have no family with them. When you come by yourself, it feels like you are a stranger in a world of people knowing each other.            Life in the circus can be hard, after awhile of living with it you will start to like it. Being i the circus isn't just doing fun things all the time, it has to do hard work, determination and many chores and jobs you need to do, so don't think its all merry good time here, think and study what you do before you join.

If you are ever in a circus you would have to do chores to like feeding, grooming, and give water to the horses they use. All the acts would eat in the pie car. pie car is just a name for were the performers eat.       Circus performers have to work on weekdays and weekends. being in the circus is a very hard job to do. There are many acts in a circus some are acrobats, tite rope walker, clowns on unicycles, and all the animal acts. When you travel for the circus you usually travel with about 100 people that are in the show. To the performers every one of them is family. one upside of being in the circus is you get to to show your talent in front of a live crowd. in you do some thing amazing the crowd cheers for you.       in conclusion the circus life is glamorous and not so glamorous if that life sounds good for you, you should try to learn some sort of circus performance.

My name Hannah I am a professional dancer at the circus and often get to be an acrobat. to a horse           '?He ya, He ya!' I heard a man yell to a horse ' I can't do it!' The other man yelled. I watched him whisper to the other man. I think he was doing a super-sonic boom. That is the hardest thing to do in the circus.The only man to ever do this was Jacob Mark also known as the amazing Jake. The super-sonic boom is were you swing on a thin vine  then onto a trampoline, then a summer-sault  and land on a horse. I saw the man do this and I left.             I walked into Markus's training room and watched him juggle the knifes. 'Hey he yelled 'Hey I yelled back ' Do you wanna try?' he asked 'no thanks' I smiled and left. We were all getting ready for our last show this year,  this would be the 40th year. I'm 11 so this is my fifth year.          I walked into my training room and went to the ropes. I had to do a dance on the ropes.This would be the first person to do this. I started to do my dance and I fell. I got back up but my leg still hurting. ' Help!' I yelled ' What is it?' A woman yelled across the room. ' I hurt my leg really badly'          The circus got cancelled and we are preforming tonight.I felt really bad that it got cancelled, HONK HONK! I heard 'JELLY!'        Get ready to dance with HANNAH! That was my que. I got on the ropes and danced and deaced ' I DID IT!'

Holly is 5'4'  she is 20 years old and she had 12 years of gymnastics. Holly wear a light blue outfit(it looks like a one peice bathing suit) and matching shoes.                Her job is a little bit difficult. She does a lot of diffcult things Holly gets scared sometimes. One time she was hanging 100 feet in the air! She wakes up at 7:30 a.m and doesnt sleep till Midnight but she she doesn't do a show till 7:00 p.m and gets done by 10:00 p.m.                    Holly is in a show right now she is swinging on a 100ft rope the croud rawrs in exitment but Holly is kinda scared even  know she practiced this morning. Holly thinks she messed up when she really did a great job.                  Holly feels upset a circus life can be difficult. Holly has to wake up really early and goes to sleep very late. Holly sits in the red and white circus tent and crys because she thinks she failed. All the workers came up and cheered her up, the clowns did funny dances, the circus juggler juggled many things, the tight rope walker taught her how to tightrope walk and all the animals did tricks.Now Holly feels much better.                      Holly went to a few classes to tell them a circus life is hard but fun. How she doesn't see her mom and dad and siblings often because she is working but, the clowns and all the other workers cheer eachother up.

As the clown walks out I look up and see a man with one foot on a very small tightrope,  I wish I could do that! Suddenly he falls but the circus has not set up the net! He bangs his head on the ground and his brain splatters everywhere! I rush down with the rest of the crowd to take some of his brain home as a souvenier!              As the circus medics come they tell everyone to put his brain down so they might have a chance to put it back in.   When I home I ask all my friends to give me some money so they all give me $1000 then I take all that money and donate it to the man who's brain splattered all over the floor.

Learning the circus routines is hard because you need to be on time when you are doing tricks and need to be confident in how you are doing. Circus performers do 10 shows a week and travel 20,000 miles in seven months just to do performances. All you do is work from sunup to sundown and after that, they still have to perform. Most circus performers are wiped out after they are done performing. They even cant go to bed until 12:00. Imagine riding a unicycle and doing a trick at the same time. Well that is what they do. They are always away from home and I cant even imagine being that home sick.           When you are in the circus, you live in a trailor. You sleep and groom yourself in there too. When circus performers wake up, they eat breakfast in a pie car which is where performers eat their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Can you imagine that?! Since performers perform at night, they dont eat much dinner before they go out on stage or else they will puke. They perform weekly plus a matinee which is an afternoon show. When most performers have nothibng to do, they are practicing. Kids practice juggling and scrobatics while adults practice flying up in the air and balancing on wires.            Now you know how hard it is in life in the circus. If you want to join the circus, make sure you are confident and ready for any expectations coming your way because you are in for a ride. Also be strong and practice practice practice. Remember, practice makes perfect.

I really wanted to be in the circus so I took home the poster and showed it to my parents. At first they thought I was just kiding. I kept on telling them that I wanted to be in the circuc. Later on they got tired of me asking so they said yes and took me. It took us some time to get to the adress on the paper but we finally got there                  When we were signing up the owner said that I needed an adult to come both of my parents decided to come with me.After we signed in the gave us a room and told us that they would find out what we were good at tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and they come and get us to find out what we are good at. They find out that I'm good at tight rope walkink, my dad is good at doing stunts and that my mom is good at training animals                    When they tell us that they are not haveing shows until next week everybody is sad at first. Then we realize that this gives us extra time to practice our acts. Next week comes and we are all ready. As we are getting ready to put on the show we start to see people comming through the doors. By the time all the seats were filled with people we were all ready to put on a show.

The crowd starts 'booing' at him. He feels ashamed of himself. Sammy, a friend of his who is in the circus saw it all. Sammy in his point of view it was a simple mistake that any one could have done. Manny felt horrible about this incident others were just laughing at him.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sammy tried to make Manny feel better, but he didn't succeed. Manny then got so mad that he didn't want to talk to anyone now. He was angry and mean now. Sammy from his point of view saw Manny acting weird like never before.                                                                                                                                                                                         Manny went again and came out performing and he fell again and he was okay with it and he started laughing at himself. Sammy now saw him in his point of view very happy and he was being himself.

I Christopher T will tell you what I do at the circus.       Circus workers work all day with very little brakes.   It can also be dangerous.Like if you fall of the tightrope during performance then your messed up big time!  One time a guy was doing a triple backflip off a elephant and he got all stomped on and died.  Thats why the circus doesnt like to hire people who will most likely do that these days.       Not everything at the circus is boring.The circus is dangerous doesnt   mean it isn fun.  It is fun because were risking to do stuff like that.  A very risky and my favorite is the human canon.  Its a canon used to launch performers through the air.       I live in South Carolina.Well at lease thats were I used to live there   before I became part of the circus.  Lets just say for now that I live everywere the circus goes to perform.  The reason why we can't live in a house is because we only stay for a week in one place and thene pack our bags and go somewere else to perform.       Wait,  I forgot to tell you guys about the things we do when were   not performing or practicing.  We still have to work no matter what.  I do chores (yep, we do chores still) like feed the animals.  We eat at a cart called a pie cart which doesnt have pies there sadly.  And we clean our own trailers.           Well thats all I do at the circus so that means I told you everything   that I do there so this case is closed. 	NNP IN DT NNP NNP PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN VBZ VBN . NNP PRP$ RB NNP .

First, his parents denied his request and  said,' The circus  is too dangerous for you to join. Your father and I both love you so much so we don't want to see you at a young age.'           'Well, I am an adult now so I have my own decisions of what I want to be. So, no matter you agree or not I am going to join the circus.            A few days later, Bob went to his room and packed up his clothes and everything else he needed.Since Bob had his own car, he took off driving to the Bellini Circus. When he arrived, he applied to join the circus. The manager said,' If you want to be in the circus, you'll need years of practice,'           ' Sure, I am all ready. I don't care if I have to practice for years, being a circus performer is my dream.', replied Bob.            The manager took  Bob to the room where all the newcomers belong. ' Bob, this will be the room that you practice in. If you need any help you can ask the teacher here, Jimmy.' Bob wanted to learn how to juggle so he took three balls and tried to juggle. He failed like 300  times but he did't give up. He walked up to Jimmy and asked,' Hey, Jimmy I need help on juggling balls.'            ' Jimmy took two balls and started juggling. See, Bob the trick is that you always keep your eyes on the balls so you won't loose control. Start just with two balls, learn from the basics.'             After two years of practice, Bob finally became a professional circus performer. He began juggling rings and walking on tightropes. He performed at the Bellini circus for five years. In the sixth year, he missed home. In the circus, there are no phones or any devices that can contact your relatives.  He started crying, whining that he wants to go home. He tried to sneek out of circus but got caught for about ten times.             At the performance in San Francisco, where his home is. He was performing walking on tightropes. He felt homesick when he was walking on the rope and he fell off. The manager annouced ' Sorry, one of our professional performer fell off the rope, named Bob.              A woman from the audience got out of her seat and walked to the performance area. It was Bob's mom. She looked at the performer named Bob and there it was, her son, laying down on the floor moaning in pain. ' Oh, poor Bob, if you had listened to me, you wouldn't be in a mess like this.            She dialed 911 and the ambulance came. They carefully put Bob in the ambulance and brought him to the hospital. The doctor said that he had his bones fractured in his right leg. When Bob woke up, he saw his mother. ' Oh, mom. Am I glad to see you. I was crying almost everyday because I missed home. Well, here I am, home in San Francisco. Oh by the way, thank you, mom for rescuing me from the circus. It was a nightmare! There are no phones to call home and barely any free time. All you do there is just practice, practice, and pactice.If I had just listened to you I wouldn't be here, in a hospital bed where my leg is fractured.'             When Bob's leg healed he went home and apologized to his mother and father for not listening to them. Later on, when Bob wanted a new job, he will always ask his parent if they agree or not.

After you show us some of your                    tricks we give you a contract for it. When you're approved                     for being a circus member we show you all of our tricks.                     We first start with juggling! Then there are different levels                    when you get even better at it!                                                                    Schedule                                               First, you wake up and get dressed. Then you eat breakfast.                     all of the circus crew get together and start practicing for the                     big show. We usually practice Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,                                      and Friday. On Thursday we have a break and on Saturday                     that's when we perform! Before we perform on Saturday we                     cool off and wait till we get called on the stage.

My experience at the circus wasn't that great and i did feel bad for the girl at the circus when she fell and for me that circus experience wasn't the greatest but at least i got to go to the circus and that was my experience at the circus.

I have to wake up early so I could eat then  I have to go to school next I come  back from school and  we get ready to do the show at night. Sometimes it's hard becuase you have to dedicate yourself to go to the next level and you have to work day and night. After you have to practice doing tricks like doing flips summer-salting and that gets you exsuasted but you have to keep going and going. Then you have to dance and practice you acts. Next you have to travel all around the world and its hard because you have to live in the trailer.                               The you have to clean up and my clown friends help me clean up after the show then we all go to bed. Next we go to different country's and preform and sometimes we make friends with the people and the give use high fives and say good job. Next we pack up and we go to the next state and we preform. Then some of our tricks is that we walk on lines and try not to fall down. Next we ride  motocycles in a circle cage. All these tricks we do are hard so we have to practice and practice. After we make the animals do somet tricks too.                        All the things in the circus we do take lots of  practice and hard work. The circus is fun becuase you get to hang with your friends and in the show to. Next its kind of fun traviling around the world. Then its amazing when you see your friends preform and  there tricks. We do fun things with the animals like make them jump over things. It's really fun working in the circus you could have lots of fun with all of your friends and family. Then you could be proud of  your family to suporrt you. So thats how it is in the circus.

It also takes a lot of hard work and heart. As a circus performer, you also have to dedicate yourself. It's fun at the same time because you get to learn tricks like the somersault or a back-flip. Life in the circus is fun but difficult at the same time. Here are some details on living a circus life.          To get into the circus you must train very hard. You must do flexibility for an acrobat. You must be brave for dealing with the lions. You also must have funny jokes if you want to be a clown. Training is very important to join the circus.          Lastly you must do these following things:   You must get up get, dressed, eat breakfast, and then go to school like a normal child. You must finish school, come to the trailer, eat a snack, and then do your chores again like a normal child. Then you have to go practice for the circus when your done with your chores. After your practice, you eat dinner, and you must get ready for your show. Lastly, after your show you take a shower, brush your teeth, wash your face and get ready for bed. Then you have to repaet that routine every day.           That is how life in the circus is difficult and fun.

But that is NOT true, we have to have great concentration and the ability to do things that many other people can't. We also have to make sure that it is perfected before even trying to be one.           In the morning we awake at promtly 7:00 then head strait for the pie room were we are served breakfast. We then go to school at 9:00 and end at 3:00.

It was about circus life and we had to write or type another artical about if we wanted to live in a circus. Here is my openyon and i say n;o but some others think diffrent.My name is Billybobjoejackjunyerthethirdfla. here we go.     I think that it would not be fun to live in a circus becuse. You would have to learn to do trick's and you would have to have the guts to do them in the middle of a show and not mess up. You would have to scoop poop probly and you would not make any frinds . You would be away from your famly so you would'nt have any good bday party's or any other party's.the animals could trun on you any sec. like you could be ridding on tt and thay could just knock you off and leave the circus.    well i am going to have to leave and do some other work.Thank you Mrs.Shraddor.BYEBYE   	WRB PRP MD RB VB TO NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NNP NNP VBD IN RB NN CC PRP VBD TO VB CC NN DT JJ IN IN PRP VBD TO VB IN DT NNP NNP VBZ PRP$ NN CC PRP VBP JJ : NN CC DT NNS VBP JJ NN VBZ NNP RB PRP NNP PRP VBP IN PRP MD RB VB VBN TO VB IN DT NN NNP NNP MD VB TO VB TO VB NN POS CC PRP MD VB TO VB DT NNS TO VB PRP IN DT NN IN DT NN CC RB NN NNP NNP MD VB TO VB NN RB CC PRP MD RB VB DT NNS .

Her life was tough she had to work long hours and went to school every day even weekends . She had a pet elephant , a zebra, a monkey, and a horse to take care of and they were her friends. She barley saw her dad and mm but they were near all the time . She learned how to speek Russian, Latin , and Germany at the age of 7 . Her friends took the same classes as her but same were 1 year older than her or 1 year younger than her  . The first show she went to she was 2 years old but was around animals ever since she was born . She had helped put up all the signs and she dreams of being just her mom and dad when she grows up.

This isn't for me to just goof around its because I join the circus.Most of the kids are going to juggle or do acrobatics. I am finnaly old enough to tame a lion and its a shocking surprise. This is not for me its for the audience. The tent is sent up and all the kids and adults are  ready!                                      We are in New York praticing at our big red tent for tonight. Taming a lion was normal one hand with a chair and the other with a whip. When I was done with that I went to see the others.I saw some clowns going inside a little car which was amazing how they all fit. Then I went to see some circus acrobats. One of them fell off luckily there was a net underneath so the acrobat got off and climbed back up. I saw cirus jugglers tightrope walkers and circus horses.        I went back and groomed the horses. Some people were sent to put up posters everywhere. I looked out of the tent and noticed the sun going down. I also noticed alot of people buying some tickets. I know you must think if you did it you would get stage fright but once you get use to it it actully pretty fun. When everyone was seated and the sun went down a man yelled in a mircrophone, 'LETS BEGIN!' and so we did.Circus music played and I saw the tightrope walker walk slowly then fast, then a man threw a cane at the tight rope walker. The tight rope walker caught it almost falling off. I noticed a lot of shocked faces everywhere this shock was a surprised shock. There were some circus acro bats swinging and tossing each other. It was amazing how they dont fall its like there a feather when they get thrown in the air then they grab on amazing!        It was later my turn to do my trick I was thinking to my self i can do this and so i went on the stage with a whip on one hand and a chair on the other. I whipped the lion and the lion roared. I put my chair up quickly so I won't get attacked. The lion was sitting there doing nothing. I had to finish quickly or the audience will get bored. I added some things i whipped the lion hard and the lion got up fast. I yelled, 'ha! ha!' the lion was walking back into its cage. Everyone cheered a I noticed a scratch on my cheek. I bowed and went off stage. I watched some clowns get in a small car and drive around. I heard some people whispering and clapping.        I yawned as we were done. We took down the tent and we got in the pie car to travel to another place. Its fun but yet busy. Dangerous but normal. I grabbed some banges and put on my cheek. For my opinion its dangerous and hard. I would need more pratice. I wish i could tell more but im wiped out. 	NN PRP MD VB WRB .

Skills are one of the most important things to peform.You need to have a skill to be an acrobat or a trapeze artist.Even a clown because you need to have skills of entertaining or have sense of humor.If you want to do something people can notice you need to have skills.Having skills can impress the people.         Being in a circus can be really fun.It also helps you excercise instead of sitting and watching tv.You can also travel around the world.You can also get to know more about the people travling with you.They are very impressive and skillful.You might get your fear over clowns by being with them if you are.         Even though being in a circus is fun, it's also busy and hard.You might get old of the people your with.You'll might not be able to make more friends.It's hard to keep track of school and the circus.You might miss home,friends, and your family.There might not be a place to call home and you are probably tired peforming all day.You might not like the uniform if you have one because they might be icthy and you have to wear them all day.         Being in circus can  really be busy and fun.It can aslo be dangerous or easy.The circus it's mostly for entertaining people.It's not games it's about the circus' hardwork.

It would be fun to work in a circus because you can travel the world.If you worked in a circus you can go to other states or even other countries. If you traveled alot and go different places you may also learn other languages.You can also visit famous places like Statue of Liberty,Las Vegas, and England.           If I got the choice of what I could do at  a circus I would choose to be a clown. I would choose a clown because clowns are funny and people love clowns.The second reason why I would choose a clown because people will not find out who you are since you have all kinds of weird things on and face painting. Last of all I would love being a clown since you get to do funny things.           I would not like working at a circus because you are always at different places. You   would always be away from home and you may not be able to spend time with your family. Second of all you may never get to goin sport teams since you are always at circus shows.The last reason is you can get tired of driving and doing circus shows all the time.

If you could be any kind of person in a circus what would you be? A lion tamer, type-rope walker, or a trapeze artist?   If you chose trapeze artist that was the same thing I chose. One of the upsides of being in the circus is that you get the chance to travel the world. Maxwell has worked all over the planet, including Australia, Japan and all over North America. 'The circus has given me the opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many different people. I travel on the road with 100 people who are like a circus family to me, who are with me the whole time. When you're young, it's the time to do it. It's the time to travel, the time to grow and experience your life.'

Anna's dad owed a circus  when Anna was born she was naturally acrobat and so was her little sister named Gwyn.                   Anna and Gwyn were as graceful as birds flying threw the sky when they were practicing. One day Anna and Gwyn's dad said, 'girls how about you practice a very special trick for Saturday.' Anna asked her dad why an extra special trick is some one really important going to come to their show? The girls father said yes the president was coming to their show and is going to bring his daughter and it is her birth day.               When Saturday came around Anna and Gwyn were both so nerves to preform in front of the president. when Anna got up on the bar and swung and did 3 somersaults and a pike then Gwyn grabed her hands. Then jumped back on to the plat form the crowed went wild. The president's daughter told her dad 'This is the best birthday i have ever had' her dad almost started to cry.

First, I go to school. Then, I do my chores and practice. After that, I eat, and after that I perform. The long show is finally over at ten thirty, and I am so tired! I am finally in bed at twelve A.M., which might seem late, but it's not when you get up at nine.     To get into the circus, we all had to have some sort of special talent that we were really good at. The rooms we stay in are small, so we can't really have any big animals as pets.     We move around a lot. There are bad things and good thing about being able to move around. The good things are getting to travel the world. It makes geography class a lot easier. Another good thing is getting to see and meet new people every week. A few bad things are not really staying in one place for long. Also, not being able to stay and enjoy being in the presents of one place for a long time. Last, we are away from home a lot.     We work with many different people from all across the world. Some speak different languages, but it if they seem nice we still figure out ways to be friends.

At first I thought it would be fun, but now that I'm in a circus I see that it is very challenging. Since I once worked at zoo, I agreed I would take care of the animals and train them. Its VERY hard work!!      Every morning I feed the horses, lions, seals, and chimpanzees. Next I go get somthing to eat at the pie car. Then I help set up the tents, lights, and music for tonights show.  A few other trainers and I work with the animals. Yesterday we got a new animal, a cheetah I named Namarah. I got to work with Namarah on jumping through a ring of fire. She did really good!!!!      That night people came through the tent talking, laughing and guessing what show we might put on for them. We were all nervous for the big show. We had planned to do things we had never done before! As Seth, the director of our circus walked out in front of the big crowed and started anouncing some things that we might do tonight, I help Namarah into her outfit.      The first to go out was Zan, our chimpanzee, and his trainer, Bob. As Zan juggled bowling pins and rode a unicycle I ran out with Namarah. Namarah jumped over obsticles and through tunnels. I heard some of the audiance go 'OOOHHH' and 'AAAHHH'. Namarah stopped where she was supposed to, to start getting ready to jump through the Ring of Fire. I set the tiny ring a couple yards away from Namarah and set it on fire. She stared at me, fear in her eyes. I mouthed ' Do it just like we been practicing.' She seemed to understand. I saw her load back and fire herself right and the ring. Then she leaped, I held my breath and closed my eyes.       All of a sudden I heard screams of joy and clapping. I open my eyes to see Namarah standing right next to me, rubbing her head against my leg. I bend down and look her right in the eyes and say 'You did great!!!!!!.' Then I kiss her on top of the head, and she licks me in the face. I stand back up again and take a bow, I see Namarahs eyes sparkle with joy.     I learned that a circus life is tough but Namarah always makes it fun.

You get to swing by your hands. You also get to walk on tiny ropes.                You get to ride horses and elephants. You get to meet clowns a lot. You get to sleep in a pie car. You get to meet new people every day. You also get to go out i front of people and preform.                 You get to travel all over the world. You get to see a lot of things with your own eyes. You get to learn new things. You get to leap from a tramp oline onto a horse. On show night you get to be crazy.

He told me we are heding to the circus he asked me do you want to come Isaid''yeah''. he said if i wan'ted to do the aked with him I said ''yeah'' but can I be a juggler and he said ''I will ask''.I was glad i might be able to be a juggler I just hope they say yes. So when we got there they said NO but you can be a play the circus horses aked I said ''okay''. I was nerves when it was my uncle the clown he did a good gob and thoose jokes were funny but then the boss said I had to work with his neffue ozzie. So when it was our tern we got on stage we  were making the crowd laugh my uncle told me that we did a great job for the first time ozzie told me that we also did a great job.                    So my uncle sed do you want to come to the next circus at Las Vagas I said sure any time so I had to go with him on the circus train and ozzie told me that his uncle said  that we can do the juggler. So we practice and practice till we got a hang of it and we still practice so we could do a good job the day before the show we were nerves so we went to the pie cart and we ate a little because we had practice after when we went to practise we found that our torches were missing we looked every werebut there were gone we went to go ask ozzie's uncle and he said he didn't have them ether so we went to go ask our teacher and we got lucky she cot someone stealing them so she told him give them to me but now I can give them back to you guys so now we got there and we practice one last time before the show started but this time we practice on the stage my uncle said we did an exellent gob when it was my uncle's turn he did his aked with some one else and there was a big crowd so if we mess up they would never come back again and we won't get MONEY.                          So when it was our turn and we were shure we were going to do our best and the crowd through flowers at us when we were finished ozzie's uncle asked me if I wan'ted to do it next year I said ''sure any time''. So when my uncle was driving me home we stopted at a sushi place and they said do you work at the circus and we said yes and they said If we play an aked we can get free sushi and we said okay so we played for like an hour but it was werth it we were so hungry. After we were on the road and we needed gas and I knew that we had to do another show at the gas station but insted the guy gave us free gas because he saw us at the circus and he loved it that he had to give us free gas and me she said she saw me on telivition and that was my time at the circus                                                                                                                                                                                         	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP CD NN , PRP VBD IN DT NN CD IN PRP$ NN DT NNP NNP VBD PRP PRP VBP VBG TO DT NN PRP VBD PRP VBP PRP VB TO VB NNP '' NN '' .

Many people think a circus is fun and play, though it can be, it also very tough and long. I, Chico Tiger, know this very well because I am a trapeze artist.?           You can't just become a trapeze artist or clown or an acrobat easily. It takes a lot of prctice and is very tiring. The circus travels many places in a year so you won't really see your family unless their in the same circus too.       As you can see life in a circus is very hard.

And at the same time you would to be careful so that you dont get hurnt like if you wanted to do the tightrope and the acrobat.

She said she remembers when she was 7 and she had her first show she would walk on the tightrope it was really fun she   would say.So the next time you say that the circus is just clowning around you're wrong.

He took me to the circus at the end of the show he took me back stage to meet the performers  I cried because of the clown.After that he told me it was his circus I jumped around with joy.Since then I got over my fear of clowns and became one.            Most of my friends are horse trainers,tightrope walkers or acrobats like my parents.My friends that are horse trainers learn how to do cartwheels on the horses without hurting the horse.My friends that are acrobats train with my parents my friends sometimes sprain their wrist because of the rope.The ones that are tightrope walkers have lots of balance they sometimes balance balls on their noses while tightrope walking. I learn to juggle put a needle through a balloon without popping it just to entertain the toddlers and grownups.This is what me and my friends do in the circus.

They were in the car when they finaly got there all he saw was lots of red and white stripes on tents.   He said it was 'Amazing.'   he told his mom to park already,so she did.   He ran as fast as he can to go buy food and drinks so he can get in the tents fast and get front row seats.                  After waiting for thirty minutes the lights when off and the other shining lights turned on.   All Frank was focus on was the animals.   Frank loved animals and was so excided he saw them on stage.   The host came out with a stick and cards on his hand then said, 'Lady`s and Gentlemen, put your hands together for the Jugglers.'  Frank saw many Jugglers some of them even had sticks with fire and some juggling rings.   Frank was so amazed he couldn`t keep an eye off the show.   Until he saw the Lion Tammer.             The Lion Tammer was herting the poor lion than he got so sad he didn`t even want to see that part.   Thankfully that part was over and Frank was able to enjoy the show know.   Frank was ready to see the Acrobats.   He likes how they swing up into the air.   'It looks like they are flying, he says.   Frank likes how the Acrobats work together to swing up in the the air.   The Acrobats bowed  and it was time for the clowns.          'The entrance was funny ', said Frank. They came out of the curtains in a tiny  car and when the clowns came out there was about seven clowns that came out of the tiny car.   Frank was wondering how they all fit in the tiny car it was the size of his dog`s house.    'The clowns were really funny ', said Frank.  It was the end of there act and everyone was clapping.    Frank was still wondering how all seven clowns fit in one tiny car.             The show ended about two hours later.    It was so great.   Frank was sad that they were leaving home but he hopes his mom would lethim come next year with his freinds.

I was on by bed and I dicided to do a flip   off of it.  When I landed I felt like I could do anything.  I was not even close to being as talented as curcis stars so I joined gymnasticts. there I got much better and much more flecsible.  I can now do the splits, do a flip from the ground, and Ican even do a cartweel and a roundoff at just age 8.  After I got to be age 12 the circus ecsepted me. I first learned trapeez.  It is so fun.  Then I realized how hard circus work is. I had to work all day.  My favorite part of circus buisness is the night when I can preform.  It is just amasing watching everyone preform. Finally it is my turn.  I walk onto a tite rope over the curcus tent in a buitiful red blue and yellow costume and start doing flips on the thick tite rope.  People 'oooooo' and 'ahhhhhhh' at me fliping.  I jump off and land in the splits!  People jump and scream and smile.  I did it.  That is how i became a circus star.

This was my last circus act for the rest of my life. I had been training for this one for months. It was the biggest performance we had done yet. It was called the The Shining Star. I was waiting at the end of the tight rope, waiting for the signal that let me on. I was extremely nervous, but excited at the same time. I was supposed to be on a unicycle, and juggling five balls across the tight rope. The horses and the elephants were out. It was my turn. I mounted my unicycle. I made sure that I had the five balls in my hand, and started out on the rope. I wobbled at first but I don't think anyone noticed.                              I Smiled at the crowd and started to juggle. I started out with three, then four, (I was doing great!) then......... I was falling.....spinning forward,and sideways, I landed on the trampoling with a SMACK!!!, and fell off of it. I luckily landed on my feet. I wasn't badly hurt, on the outside. The inside of me was what hurt the most. I had let my whole team down. I just smiled, and ran out. Back stage, everyone crowded aruond me. They all asked me if I was okay. I told them all that I was sorry, and I had let them down. We were sure to lose the contest now.                         At the end of the show, the announcer told the winner. It was us!!!! Everyone cheered! It was great!! I had no idea how though... I mean.. I fell. The other team did perfect. Later I talked to the announcer and asked him how we won. He told me that I did absolutely wonderful, and the way that I had jumped off the rope, spun in the air, landed on the trampoline, and bounced off with a perfect landing on the feet! I was amazed! Did he really think that I had done that on purpose?! I started to tell him what had really happened, but the crew came in and told me I was late to celebrate! I guess falling wasn't so bad after all.

Later that year she asked her parents for 'supposibly' lunch money but what she really did was pay kids to be her friends!.But what she really was.......she was a bully.She treated her 'supposibly' friend like slaves.                               No one wanted to be her friend andymore bu they didnt say anything.later in the monthe there was a new litte girl whoe was kind unselfish and always had a great possitive attitude.                       the mean girl that it was a great chance to get and get another 'friend'.So she went up to her and gave her the money and said,'Here you take it your my frien deal?' .The little girl  said ,'No'. the mean girl said that she had to take the money and that she had to be her friend because she was 'supposibly' popular and had a lot of friends.                         Later in the year the nice girl told the principle and the mean girl got in trouble and was suspended for a couple of days.Later on the little girl made friends with other people and were never ever wanted to be popular.

I sighed, and started to slide out of my bed on a circus trailer. I looked at the clock on the wall-6:51 A.M. I decided that, since I normally got out of bed at 7:00 A.M., nine more minutes of sleep wouldn't hurt. I plopped back down onto my bed and started to close my eyes.        I was awoken again by a light knock on my door. I bolted out of bed and looked at the clock again-7:16 A.M. I had overslept for the first time! I quickly got dressed and went to the pie car. There, I found that most of the performers were already done with breakfast. The ringmaster noticed me and said, 'Is this the first or second time you overslept, Emily?' I sighed once more when the ringmaster had gone. The day was already starting out badly.         I quickly finished breakfast and went to the schoolhouse. Fortunately, that went well, unlike when I got up and, as I would soon find out, my practice and performance time.        At 3:30 P.M., school was over, and it was break time. I saw that we had arrived in our destination-Kansas City. I played a short while with my teacup chihuahua, Teacup, and started practice early, thinking that would make up for me oversleeping. Unfortunately, that was not true.       I began my practice as normal. I started to jump from a trampoline onto a horse's back. After several times of doing this, I began to relax and daydreamed that nobody had noticed me oversleep. My daydreams eventually evolved into a dream of seeing my family and living back in Miami, Florida. Oh, how I missed that time. But I had taken a liking to acrobatics and determinedly joined the circus when I was 11. Now I had been in the circus for five years now. I have traveled all over North and South America. Now, still daydreaming, I leaped again from the trampoline, imagining I was bouncing down the stairs. 'THUMP!' I was jolted from my daydream by pinpricks of pain shooting up my leg.       I was surprised to find myself sprawled in the dirt, wondering how I had gotten there. I had thought I was jumping down the stairs to the a kitchen. I then remembered that I was in the circus, and I was practicing jumping off a trampoline onto a horse's back. I realized I had jumped straight off a trampoline 15 feet in the air with no horse to support my fall.       Wincing, I tried to get up. I made the mistake of putting my weight on my injured right leg and collapsed. I heard other performers arriving for practice. A man leading an elephant saw me first. He ran to me and called to the others for the ringmaster. He then also left to find the ringmaster. No! I thought. I already have embarrassed myself once, but I will not be embarrassed twice! I slowly got up, and started to limp around. After a while, the pain in my leg subsided, so I decided to continue practicing as if nothing had happened. The ringmaster arrived with a worried face. I rushed up the trampoline.       Seeing me seemingly all right, the ringmaster's expression changed from worried to confusion. He then became angry. He turned to the man who was leading the elephant and started to scream something about tricking him. I just continued to practice, trying to ignore the pain in my leg.        After dinner, we all started to prepare for the show. By now, the pain in my leg had nearly gone, so I decided I could make it though the show. My mind insisted on it-performing in a circus show, having fun performing, and seeing the audience so absorbed into my performance were the reasons I joined.        I went with the others backstage. After a while, I heard the announcer announce my name. I took a deep breath. In. Out. Shakily and painfully, I got to my feet. I went in the direction of the stage. In. Out. I emerged onstage, and I heard the audience clapping. In. Out. I climbed the trampoline and waited for my horse, Creamy, who was named for the color of her fur, mane, and tail. Not yet. Not yet. NOW! I jumped off the trampoline just as my leg bent in an awkward position-the position my leg was in when I fell at practice.        I lurched in midair, and was about to slam into the ground. My life is over, I thought. I had forgotten about the safety net, and had not set it up. But just then, Creamy doubled back and, amazingly,  caught me. The audience clapped again, thinking this was part of the show. I rode Creamy back backstage while murmuring to her softly, praising her.        When the show was over, the ringmaster praised Creamy too, saying I was lucky to have such a brilliant horse. If not, I would have died that day.        Nearly a month has passed since then. My leg has long since healed, and I continue to practice and perform successfully with Creamy, my life-saving friend and companion.

The circus let's you travel places you've never been before while travaling with your new family.                                    You should join the circus because you can travel to new places. Here are a few reasons why . First, you will be able to go on many adventures with your 'family.' For example, you may go to Hawaii for a performance and have fun snorkling. Next, you will be able to try new foods. You can try some exotic Chinese food that you have never tried before. Finally, you will be able to explore new cultures. You can go to India and learn about their culture and festivals like Diwali.                        Join the circus because you can make a new and supportive family. Not convinced, i'll give you a few reasons. First, you will have many people who will care for you and love you just the way you are. Some kids in school might be insulted because of their flexibility. In the circus you won't  have that problem because your family and friends all are very flexible. Next, you will h ave people who unerstand you. if you feel down or angry your family will know how to comfort you because they have probably been through this before. Finally, you will have someone to trust because in the circus, most of the people there are very well trained.                          Joining the circus made my life better.

711	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	A	N	N	F	595606	5	11075084	Y	56196	  About twenty years ago, I was a student in Lark Creek elementary school. My teacher clapped her hands and said, 'Students, I have an important announcement to make. Our school has won one rare ticket from the five to attend the Bellini Circus in the front row seats! That's right, one of you very lucky students will be able to win the free ticket by writing the best essay in class'.       As I walked home with my best friend we both discussed how we would write a essay. The instant I reached home, I started to write my essay:       'If anyone would think special talents were gifted to you, that is wrong. Even people in the circus must work harder than ever; often sacrificing extra time with friends and family to achieve their dream of performing in the circus. Take Philippa for example. When she was 11, she had her heart set on being a performer. She gave up everything and concentrated on her dance and performing. This is how to achieve your dreams.       Being part of a circus doesn't mean a free pass from school, in fact the one room classroom has everything a regular class has from a whiteboard to tests. Since circus performers are from around the globe, classrooms are often filled with a 'mixed bag' of students. The circus performers live in a trailer where there is a pie car (it is like a restaurant), a classroom, and of course a home for performers to live in.                                                                                                              When school is over it is time for some fun; circus style. The children get to see what the others are training and finally, kids get to try some tricks them self. People in the circus must be daring and adventurous. Tricks may include: leaping form a trampoline onto a horse's back, somersaulting from a horse's back, acrobatics, juggling, walking baby leopards on leashes, and training animals such as elephants, lions and chimpanzees.       Like all other jobs, working in a circus has ups and downs. One of the upsides is that you get to travel around the world. Performers get to meet people from around the world with interesting backgrounds. Another pleasure is the thrill of performing in front of a live audience. The downside of working in a circus is that circus performers  work for long periods of hours. In addition, performers are away from their family and home.       As you an see circus performers have a different, but somewhat hard life. If you work hard, your dream can come true'.       I looked down at my essay, and realized that I didn't care to win. Writing this essay was the gift after all. I had learned so much about the circus and realized that I might want to be there. I might want to do that. Being a glamorous star of the circus became my dream that day.       The next day, I walked to school with my essay in my hand. I told myself, 'I don't want to win, I have already won a big dose of inspiration'.       I handed in my essay in the morning as the teacher smiled. In an hour the teacher would announce the winner. As the clock ticked, it was hard for me to concentrate. Finally, the teacher announce the winner, and it was me. I had won a front seat ticket to the Bellini Circus. My career seemed to fly from then on. I got to meet Philippa, and she gave me a few words on how to succeed. I worked harder than ever at gymnastics now. I decided that I would awe the audience with my difficultly and flexibility. That is how I reached my dream and became The star of the circus. I was nicknamed Philippa #2. I tell youngsters around the world that it all started with a little dose of inspiration.

Ihave been in the circus for almost 9 years. So let get with the subject.When i am practicing it takes all you got we have to dance, jump,jugle,throw fire, and do even harder more dangerous stuff.We practice for more than 2 whole months.Then we perform in the circus.           When we get to the circus we have to set up everything then start.It is not easy,it is a very tough job.I love my job though. I think the toughest thing is the string i hate it.You have to be very balanced espeally on the one wheel bike.           When we dont put on a good show we are very disapionted,becuase we work so hard on being in the circus it really puts us downn. after we know that we just needed more practice on our work so we can do better next time.when we dont do a good job our directer will make it harder on us and in our practices.When it is so bad we can get kicked off of the whole team intill we are ready to do better and make more progress.               so that is preety much about the circus life. It can get trickey and a little to hrad but it is worth it if you just try your best and belive thaat you can make mor progress the next time.So be ready for the time of your life cause your not want to miss it.

Stacy and I are acrobat partners. We were the secend act of the show. Stacy was just a replacment for my other partner, Brianna. We were great partners, until when she broke her arm by trying to get to one swing to another and missed the target. She was fine after the cast went of ,but her doctor said that she had to rest for 3 weeks.                    It was now December 31. New Years Eve. The day of the show. I was super excited. Stacy was too. Every body in the town came. I almost fell of of my feet. The first act went then us i almost missed the swing, but good thing I didn't. I was so happy.

When we, my family and I, arrived there were many people there. before we went into the big tent we got some treats when we went inside we saw many performers getting ready for the show they were about to perform. We found some seats and sat down. All of the performers were getting in there positions. The show was about to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       First there was a man and woman holding onto ropes swinging back and forth. Then the lady let go and the gentleman caught her.  Then the man let go. The woman fell, but as she was falling she grabbed onto a laced rope that hung from the ceiling. she gracefully went down the rope. The crowd went roaring.               After that some clowns came out on unicycles. They kept falling and bumping into each other. It was very funny.  then there was a lion. It jumped and roared. It did its master told it to. There were also people on horses doing tricks. Then there was a man  that walked  across a tightrope. There was also a woman that was able to put herself in a very small box. then there was a man juggled many figure.             IT was very interesting and exciting to see all of those amazing acts. At the end of the show we were able to meet some performers and ride on the horses. It was a night I will never forget.

But you would practice over and over problem even on weekends. A lot of people try really hard to entertain us because it must be really fun to watch people do all those stunts.       I don't think it only takes only one day to learn how to do stunts because yowl have to do to you get it right. I realized if there one thing I know that no one can be perfect in a Circus every one dose the best they can to be an acrobat and to do stunts.       If being in a Circus is something you really like doing for a living you must really work hard. People how travels around the would gets to esprcence around the would with there eyes I think it might be a once in a lifetime opportune.       Well now when you always travail it must be ausosting to always travail. But still it might not be that easy to be in a Circus but it is shore fun.

We needed to practice really hard so we missed school.Our whole crew ate eggs with bacon and then we got started. Some of us had to wait a little longer because we were full.When we wre done taking a break we went on the road to The Collusieum.             We arivved arrived at 7:00 A.M. because we left the house at 2:00 A.M. We unpacted and went to praqctice. My mom and I are partners at acrobatics and gymnastics.  And my brother and dad are partners at going in the cannon and getting shot out. The rest of our crew ride horses elephants, blow fire, and more! (They all picked what they are good at.)              At 5:00 P.M.we all pitch in to clean the animals but we all forgot the supplies! We didn't know what to do so we had to waste half our money to buy the supplies. (The whole crew pitched in.we were very sad those few min.)               It was 10:00 P.M. and we had to start.(The animals were spick and span.) We made a big entrance and got started. My mom and I did an amazing job in the air. In the ending of our turn my mom did a unbelievible move that no one could do it exept her!               Then it was everybodys' turn. It was incredible. Lastly my brother and dad shot out of the cannon to make the finally. They twisted in the air and landed on their legs. (They didn't break one either.)              Everybody calpped and went home! so we got paid and also went home!

The door leads to were the performers get ready.A long time ago the room use to be a big gas station under it.They need to be very carful of fire because they have all kinds of machines. if there is the slightest fire the tent will explode!             One day a very thoughtful woman was getting in her costume to perform. She had to get paint on her face and gether wig and nose on.The woman had hair like a clown so she didn't need a wig.This is the first time they ever saw hair like that.Her hair was curly and they needed to make it flat so they had to use a flat iron.This is the first time they used a flat iron.When they were done they did not turn off the iron!There was a hair on the flat iron and the hair caught on fire and a piece of paper caught on fire!When they were in the middle of the play BOOM the circus blew up!              Many people were injured and some people died.They shut the circus down and people lost there jobs.They were goind to build a new circus but it would take about one year.Now the worlds most popular circus is burned.

The circus had lots of flying ponies ,but suddenly one of the ponies escaped.                                                              All of the police units helped catching the pony that escaped. They chased the pony in their police cars and in airplanes too. THe thing is that the police units did not know that the pony was magical ,but they found that out when the pony started flying.            Many days later the police units finaly caught the pony and put him back in the circus.

Many people love the circus because it is funny and there is alot of friendly people.You get to do things like ride horses and get to train to be an acrobat.           There are many more things you can do in the circus like jumping through rings of fire and riding dirt bikes and doing flips on them. In the circus you get to dress up like a silly clown and make funny faces. You might think it's embarrsing but when you have some one doing it with you it's not that bad.            Before you get up and start your day really good you get to eat some hot pancakes with melted butter and runy syurp. You have bacon with your pancakes that is greasey and crunchy. That is the good part about how you start your day.              So, when it's time to start the circus you are very nervous and scared. My friend comes over and pats me on my and says' It's going to be okay.' I get out there and turns out to be really fun and I don't want it to end.                It's the end of my day and I'm very exhausted and ready to go to sleep. My parents tuck me in and as soon as I hit my pillow I was asleep and wasn't waking up. I woke up the next moring and I started all over again.

To begin with you have to train many things that you do in your performance you have to be training for many many hours and you got to now what you are practiceing or else when you do your preformense you will do the wrong one, you also need to practice juggling it could take you like three years to learn how to juggle. Mostly what takes you to a lot of years to practice is to be a acrobat because you need to hold on to another person for for a few secons.                                                                                                                                        On the other hand you have to jump off many things while all of your performances, when you are practicing jumping off thing you also need to put a trampaling in the bottom so if you fall you land there, and you need to pactice almost all day to now how to jump from here to there and you need to start little to little before you start to jump all of the of the big tall things.                                                                                                                                   Thirdly you also need to practice holding on to ropes while holding on to another person that takes you many hours an days and weeks, because you have to hold on to the person then bring them up to the handle and you have to bring your self up with no hand just use youre legs to push your self up and some times you have to hold on with a hook atached to your foot.                                                                                                                                       Fourthly you also need to learn how to do the splittes if your a women. It takes you a few days to learn how to do the splittes and you use it when you are doing acrobat while you are on the ground but if you are a guy it takes you a few weeks maybe months, when you start to now how to do it you start to it from little things to big things.

Circus life is far from all fun and games.  Every day, and sometimes twice a day, we entertain a large audience for many hours.  Everyone works from dawn to dusk.  Here is our normal schedule:       6:30 A.M.: Wake up and prepare for yet another long day.  We head to the pie car for a quick breakfast.        8:00 A.M.: Time for a long, boring day of school.  All the kids are packed into an extremely small trailer, which makes learning hard.  Just like a normal, non-traveling school, our school has tests and progress reports.        3:30 P.M.: School's out!!!  But the work is just beginning.  We have to practice for tonight's show, and for the following shows.  While the crew continues to set up for the show, all the performers practice their respective stunts, such as walking on a tightrope, training wild animals, juggling objects, and jumping on to and off of a horse.  Beinng a good circus performer takes, balance, determination, and concentration.       6:00 P.M.: Everybody returns to the pie car for a light dinner.       7:00 P.M.: Showtime.       10:30 P.M.: The show is finally over.  The audience really enjoyed the performance!  I managed to juggle three bowling pins!  However, I am very tired and eager to go to bed.       11:00 P.M.: I hop into bed.       Circus life is a very tough life.  But it is also very fun. So despite the downsides of circus life, I enjoy it and am eager to take the stage for every performance.

The elephants are one of my favorite ones.The loud crashes of their feet pounding on the floor is noisy.Sometimes I think I feel the groung shake.I like the lions to.Their trainer gives them the insturctions with his long pole.          When it is my turn to be up on stage I will clinb on the ladder all the way up to the ropes.I get to the top and I see someone on the other swing infront of me.When I get at a very fast speed I let myself go and feel someone getting a grip on my ankles.After the loud applause I do some more tricks with my partner.          After I am done with the show I am congradulated for doing a nice job.I thank everyone and tell them the same.After all of the acts we all go infront of the audience and bow.Everyone cheers.All of the trainers are very proud of their animals.         When everyone is in bed I go to the ropes and look down to the ground.I think of the performances we did this evening and the crowd applausing wildly.I am proud of everyone.

Then, he brings out this big long whip looking thing and pretty much tames the lions. Came out the swinging trapeze and they grabbed to the ropes one after the other. It was so cool! Next ,came out the tightrope and the girl hoped up on it and cut flips, jumped, and sprinted across the rope. At half time my family and I got up to get popcorn and I rode the giant elephants. After halftime was over the clowns came out and stole the show. They had everyone laughing and cheering.  When the circus was finally over i got some of the clowns autograph and met some of the performers. In all, the circus was a fantastic experience and the next time we have a circus i am definitely going to it.

I love the gleam of the crowd's teeth as they cheer for us.  I am a juggler for a huge circus.  I Can't even remember anybody because it is so huge.  I always stick close to my dad and mom since the are the ringleaders.  I know we are only supposed to have one but they insisted it being this way       My dad has been with this circus for his entire life.  My mom also.  I love watching the clowns make people laugh.  I hope to be one of the numerous animal trainers.        We usually stay in a town for a week and then do strenuous work to pack up.  That is what I hate the most. I meet lots of people and many new friends.  Our portable school is just like any else.  It has computers and report cards and we have grades like everyone else.  I really strive toward one day going to a real school and meeting regular people.  I want to live in a neighbor- hood and have friends.       One day I decided to watch a circus show.  I pretended I was a kid in the crowd and it was so cool.  I saw lion tamers and people swinging on the trapeze.  I told myself that one day I would be that good.  That's when I realized I love the circus and would live with it forever and cherish every moment.

One day when I  was at the circus with my family, right    before the show started I did something so funny that a   group of clowns look at me and laughed, but right after the    show the same group of clouns was talking to my father,    then my dad came where the family was standing and told us    that the clouns wont me to put on a show for a group of    people. When we got home i ran in my bedroom and shut the    door and practice for my big act that Thursday night at 8:00.   when i got there i saw the clowns and ran over there were they   was and ask them 'are yall ready for the big act of the night?'    As soon as it was my turn to go and perform on stage i went    and performed and the croud loved it.And when we got home    my parents was happy for me and I chose what I wonted to    be a clown.

I finally get to sleep. Too bad I can't party in the pie car with everyone else because of mom and dad. Mom and dad are so mean to me. They say I have to be in the circus 'till I'm 65, and I can't party inthe pie car 'till I'm 18. And you know what? Today is my birthday. I'm turning 18 today, and I didn't even ggo to the party. They completly forgot. Maybe they don't even care about me..... I don't know.            I'm sorry I don't do this every day, but I barely get even a spare second in a week. From 7:00am to 10:30pm every day, I work and practice my horse riding standing and dismounting my horse, Shamrock. I don't even get a full education. I only do school work 3 hours a day, and right now I'm supposed to be in college.            Today my schedule was even worse. Mom made me practice during school, so I missed learning what an antacedent is. Dad made me do the heap of dishes in the pie car, because I didn't put my dish in the sink. Also, the director got mad at me when on of my bells flew off my bracelet Annie gave me last year. I don't even know if Annie is my friend or not. She just is kind to me. We're both the same age, and we have a lot in common, but she has been avoiding me lately.            Although, one part was good today. I finally did everything perfect on my routine during practice, but my directer didn't even notice I did it flawlessly. The only person(thing) that noticed me was Shamrock, and he was licking and slobbering all over me.           Today was horrible, with one good part, but in the circus isn't that bad, especially when I can actually talk to someone(something) that will listen. 	NNP CD , CD CD NNP NNP , NNP VBZ IN .

I wake up and go to the pie car to have breakfast. I usually have scrambled eggs and pancakes. Everyone is startingto set things up for tonight's show.       9:00 A.M. I go to school. I learn different languages, sometimes on a computer. When I travel the world, I'll have to know how to speak to the audience!       3:00 P.M.  School's over-I usually grab a quick snack and practice juggling or unicycle riding.           6:00 P.M. I have dinner and prepare for tonight's show when I'm finished.           10:30 P.M. The show is over. I am wore out. Tomorrow, I will have to perform again. Now, I'm off to bed.       Circus life can get stressful!               Now, I will tell you what a performance is like.                I wait for my que at the beginning of the show. When I get the signal that I'm suppost to perform, i run out from behind the tent curtain, do a couple of cartwheels as i go, and I get up on the trampolene. I have to jump on a charging horse.            The horse is released, and I get ready for the jump. when the horse gets close, I jump! If I time it right, I will land on the horse and I will be able to gain control of it. It is a terrifying trick, but I've gotten used to it!            Finally, Circus life can be stressfull and even risky at times. It is fun to watch the audience applaud me for my hard work, though. Circus life is stressful, but it is well worth it!

After that we whent home and it was the best day ever.     Then my mom siad that if we wanted to share what we    liked best we could . My little sister said that she liked the    part  when the baby monkey hoped from the moms shoulder    to the ground, Isaid I liked the part where I juggled . My mom    said she liked everything and so did my dad. Then we spent    the rest of the day talking about the circus until we whent to   bed.

Also, i am your guys number one fan. I am the best candidate for the seats. If  you didn't let me have those tickets I will never go to your circus ever again. Plus, I will tell every one I know not to go to your circus ever again. I will post it on every social media website.  If you do give me those tickets i will do the exact opposite. I will write good reviews. Post good things about you on social media websites. Especially, i will do good things for you. Im warning you on who to give the tickets to.

Now that made me mad! But that's why i came to Rome. So i can get a fresh start as an acrobat!I have been here for a month and am having my first audience tomorrow. I have been going to the town gym to practice.It was tough competition at the try out but i thought i did well and that's all that maters. i hope i get the part.           I got the results and......I GOT THE PART I AM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!! Plus the stage crew seemed really nice. My first practice is tomorrow night,my first gig is next week.                                    *Next week at the show*       My first show was very difficult, i messed up twice,and if i mess up again I'm fired!  So i decided i need to practice more before my show in 2 days.        At the gym I worked on all the gymnastic stuff. i practiced for hours and hours until it was completely perfect......That took a while.After that i thought i would go out for ice cream at freezable. I was told it was the best ice cream in the world!       Then i went home and slept i needed my sleep for tomorrows show.       When i woke i looked at the clock. It was 4:30 P.M. I was late and for sure i was going to be fired. So i ran down to the circus as fast as I could and when i got there everyone was upset.      I went around to my booth and got ready but still no one came to there booths. Then  was soon as i knew it everyone was at my side. Yelling 'where have you been we had to cancel the show because you didn't show!' I said 'I'm so sorry it won't happen again.'     after that the little magic man came and said 'But it's ok because here we're all a family and we stick together.' Every one agreed and called back on the show and in the end I found my true family! 	NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NNP CC PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NNP JJ NN PRP VBD IN VBN PRP IN DT JJ NN NNP NNP WDT VBD PRP VBD .

She was always early.Only a couple of performers were there. Abi was a high wire performer.She had to practice her balance every day at home. only sometimes she would fall. Abi liked to join the circus,although it took a lot of practice.        Tonight, she had a performance. Abi was never nervous, she was always confident.

She had long black hair and big brown eyes. Her lips were full and her eyelashes long. Her body shape looked as if it was good enough to be a gymnast. There was nothing more she could possibly want. She had her own room, painted rose pink. Her name was painted on one of the walls. By the time she was eight, she was spoiled rotten. She had candy in her room. She had decorations in her room. All the children at her school adored her because she would always get money from her mom, take it to school, and give them some or buy them something.             One day, when Tiara took money to school, she lost her money somewhere in the school. she asked everyone if they saw it but they all had no clue where it was. She began to cry. Everyone in the area looked at her and began whispering in each others ear. She could hear them say, 'Is she really crying over money? I can't be friends with a crybaby so everybody can be talking about me.' Could this be the end of her popularity? All because of crying? She stood up and told every one to stand up and empty their pockets. Right when she said that everybody did so, maybe she didn't lose her popularity after all. as soon as Joe emptied his pockets there it was, low and behold, Tiara's $50.00!              Everyone gasped. 'Joe, how could you?' everyone gasped. Joe apologized to Tiara but she did not forgive him. It is one thing to borrow, but stealing is not the way. Soon it was time to go outside for carpool. When Tiara got into the car she told her mom what happened. As long as Tiara had her money back her mom was not disappointed.

I started to walk and i was doing fine untill i started to shack everybody gasped and i got my balance and i made it to the other side everybody started to clap and cheer for me and i was very happy then i became a really good tightrop walker.

Most living things in the circus are humans but there are some pretty exotic animals.My favorite is the dancing monkey in a tutu her name is cocoa she is very young but is also very friendly.She likes to make friends with the other monkeys but since they are so much older then her they are mean to her but she will always be my friend.Next there is the beautiful white horse named beauty how ironic beauty is quite the diva she will not go anywhere near mud so we always need to make sure to keep her stable clean.next there is a penguin named Pepe he loves to dive in water and swim around and play with crushed ice.Also I cant forget about mist a dolphin I haveknown her since i was a baby.She can leap so high and put so much impact on the water that it wets people in the 20th row.                                                            I love to live on a circus but sometimes i miss my friends back in my old neighbor hood  and i really hope that one day i could see them again or they can come watch me perform my tricks so circus life can fit some life styles but if your like me it will all work out. So remember if you wanna live on a circus dont forget the life you used to have.

In the end this would not be a regular day in circus history to find out what happened in this wacky day in circus history read these paragraphs.         The people had just arrived to the Bellini circus people buying popcorn and cotton candy the performers getting ready for the show and the family's waiting impatiently for the show to start. The lead act was the clowns doing some jokes and some other stuff but just as the clowns ended the circus tent collapsed. People were going crazy this was just like when the Minnesota vikings stadium collapsed except there was nobody in the dome when that happened but today there were thousands of people. The circus director was going crazy so he called the fir department. When the fire department got there they evacuated the rest of the people that hadn't already left the structure. Then the manager soon found out all of the circus animals got loose so he had to call animal control to wrangle the animals. Then came news that some people got injured so we called the medics. They ended up being okay they were just minor injuries. There was still major chaos all around and in the tent.''What happened'' and ''What's going on'' were questions a lot of people had when leaving the venue. They found out that people outside the tent did something to make the tent collapse and fall. To this day nobody knows how the tent fell and who did it. It will probably remain unknown forever. At the end of it all nobody died and only one animal they didn't get back a baby elephant.

I work night and day. Most people think that being in a circus means that you get to play all the time, but that is not true. The circus is about hard work and dedication. I've been working at the circus for 10 years and I still haven't gotten the hang of the schedule.The circus may be a fun place to work at, too, despite all the bad stuff, but you still have to travel a lot of tedious road trips. You also have to put up with schools and colleges that are a little too much on the wacky side.                      If you're wondering why I chose to be an acrobat, my answer would be that doing all that work really pays off when you show all your awesome moves, like front flips and jumping off and catching yourself, to the world (where-as other jobs don't pay off as much).                     One really awesome thing that is probably the reason I joined the circus is that instead of sitting in a desk and looking at a book for geography, we get to see our geography lessons come to life as we travel the world, now that is something truly amazing. So if you're looking for a job and love to meet new people and do new things, why not the circus, you got nothing to loose.

I entered the circus when I was 5 years old, I was very young to be a performer, in fact the youngest in the whole group of performers. I was recognized for my talent of being funny and being great at gymnastics. Today I am a clown and an acrobat. My back round is very interesting.       Right now I am getting ready for a show. In this show I am a clown. I usually juggle and make kids laugh. Sometimes on the set I make other actors laugh too. I n this show I will barely be on stage. Most of the time when I am on stage I am an acrobat. When I am a clown I tell jokes to kids and try to sell stuff. Since I am in the circus I do not get to see my family and it is very hard for me because I miss them so much. Lots of the other people that are in the circus like me even though I am much younger than them.       Circus life is very hard. You have to practice basically all day. This afternoon I practice for nearly four hours. before that I had a delicious breakfast with bacon and eggs in the pie cart. I am lucky to get such good food from the Pie cart. Lots of parts of being the circus is fun too because I get to be the clown and get to use unicycles and juggling balls and make people laugh. In the circus life is fun and hard.       This is it. It is time to go on stage. I only have one part on stage and it isn't very long. I can't wait. First I act as a mime and pretend I am in a box, even though I am not. Now I am done and I have to put my clown uniform on.       You have to change into new clothes very fast in the circus business. Now I am trying to sell cotton candy and other foods and condiments. It is pretty easy. Tonight I have sold lots of food and now I have to entertain the audience. I am now walking over to a baby. He is very cute. I have a great joke to pull on him. I will run up, jump right over his seat and scare him. Ready, set, go! I ran up and scared him but right when he saw me he started crying loudly.I felt bad so bad. He was crying so loudly that the tightrope walkers on stage were balancing on a rope and got distracted by the loud crying. Lots fell and got badly injured. Soon I heard ambulances. The worst thing was it was all my fault.       Lots of people yelled at me because I ruined people on set had never yelled at me since I came here. I was was scared the most of my boss coming toward me. I new I was fired. One thing I noticed was the crowd was laughing as if it was part of the act. Once my boss came close the only two words he said was 'Thank you.' He said 'We made so much money that it doubled most of high paid shows, even though it wasn't part of the show it was still amazing.' What Harry just noticed was that the tightrope walkers were still on there feet and were in their ending pose. What a show!

I was getting ready to go down a giant slalom course on new years eave. I was invited to this because I was on the ski team and was a really good racer. BAM I was off and I was speeding down the race course at huge speeds. Last I finished the course and got an award and hot cocoa. That was one of the best days ever.

The animals are usually elephants and monkeys!!! Sometimes the monkeys even jump through fire!         The circus is a great place overall. There are also clowns that assist the monkeys and elephants. The circus is a crazy place. They perform in tents at the circus. The animals at the circus go wild! There are both acrobats and trapeze artist. It is not easy to join the circus, you have to have special talent. Also when you perform at the circus, you get to travel the whole world. You have so many opportunities to travel the world. The audience loves being at the circus, but the circus is hard work it isn't just flying around, and goofing around. Overall being at the circus is lots of fun.           	VBG IN DT NN MD VB NNS IN NN TO VB NNP NNP MD VB DT NNS NN NNS . PRP MD VB JJ NNS CC NNP NNP NNS VBP RB NNS CC NNS . . .

But behind all that fun, many things happen. The circus is very busy. You have to set up for the show, you have to practice for the show, and do chores. Life in the circus is so busy and tough. This is the life in the circus...                   Long busy hours happen in the circus. But you can't just walk in a circus and be like, 'Oh, I want to be a trapeze artist'. You have to have some sort of talent. Like myself I have the talent to be very flexible. So I'm a acrobat. But also, you have to be focused, sometimes I can't do a trick and I fail.                   Sometimes in the circus you feel lonely. I know you have all the people traveling with you but, you are far away from your family. You also spend a lot of time away from home. A lot of the time, I miss my family, my home, and my belongings. It's very tough being in the circus.                    All together everything in the circus is fun. But it also can be very tough. So next time when you see circus perfromers, think about all the hard work they put into their talent. Many things happen in the circus.

You can't just say I want to become a circus performer, you have to train for it. For instance, if you want to do acrobats, you have to have the right body and you have to train for it. If you want to do juggling you have to just train for it. It seems so easy, but sometimes it seems as if you kind of risk your life. Like if your somersaulting off of a running horse, that seems like your risking your life, but that's what trainings for.             It also seems that the circus performers are more your family then your regular family. It seems like this because you are traveling so much and your always away from home. You really have to put your heart in it and concentrate because if you don't, then you might mess up and you don't want that to happen in front of all those people.             And of course you don't just go to school and train, you have to do chores too. You might have to feed the animals, groom the animals, help clean up after every show, or just help get ready for every show. And when your in the circus you usually work from sun up to sun down. So your going to be busy every hour of the day.               It also seems that if your in the circus traveling all the time, you might get a really good experience if your paying attention. It seems like this because you get to travel all around the world. You would probably get to travel to Japan, Russia, Ireland, or even Australia.              And it seems that being in a circus makes you famous because you are well known, and people are amazed by what you can do, and since they're so amazed they tell every one to go see the show. Then when the word gets around, people start to know your name and ask for autograghs. And thats why I think that your famous when your a circus performer.               And when your on tour and away from home. It seems as if you really have no place to call home because your always moving from one place to another. Your going to always be thinking about how your going to do on tonights show, or how everyone else is going to do that effects you.               I've always wondered if the circus performers ever missed their real home and family. I've wondered this because they usually call their circus performing friends family and home. But who knows they might not.              And now that I've talked about how hard it is to be a circus performer, would you want to be a circus performer? If you do, then what would you do, would you do juggling or trapeze? What would you do in the long hours of a circus life?               And like I've said, performing in a circus seems very fun, but it is very hard work. It is also a great experience too. So if your interested in going to a circus, then go to one and see the amazing things they've worked so hard on.

She wakes up in the morning and gets dressed. She dressed in normal khakis and a Nike shirt. She walked to the pie car to get some food.As Lila finished, she saw telling a worker to move the tent further right. The man seemed confused, he did`t seem   to like his job. After breakfast, she walked to the school house.            When she got to the schoolhouse she saw her friend typing up a report on a test at the computers. She smiled and waved. She quickly turned around, I guess because she had to finish the test. Lila walked to her desk and waited for class to begin. When class did begin, she had a good time. They took a test, though, which wasn`t   very fun. Finally it was time to leave. When she walked out it was warm and she wanted to play outside but she had to practice. Lila takes care of the animals.            Lila walks over to a leopard named Carter. She`s known him since kindergarten, when she started. Carter purrs as Lila puts the leash on him. They walk around the area were the tents are being set up and booths are being assembled. Carter was so big and strong at one point Lila rode on his back. Her mother saw her and laughed,   ' Carters getting big isn`t he.' she smiled. Lila just nodded.        Lila fed Bacon the elephant. She loved feeding Bacon. When she was little she got to name him. She had just ate breakfast so she named him her favorite food. When she got done feeding all the animals, and grooming the horses she took a break. It was really nice to relax. Sadly, though, she had to stop at 6:30 for dinner. Soon   her family was done because they have to eat fast. They have a show at 10:30 so they had to rush. By the time it was 10:00 Lila was ready to go. She wore a blue uniform that had shiny purple stripes.            The show was starting and Lila was hugging her leopard close. She was very,very anxious to go on stage, but   Carter made her feel fine. Finally it was show time. Lila and Carter ran up stage. Carter couldn`t stand it, but   Lila always made him wear a tutu. Carter jumped through fiery hoops. Lila spun and juggled and flipped and   hurdled through the air.           As the show spiraled on Carter snuggled and purred as he slep on Lila`s feet. Everyone walks back to the trailers for some reason Carter doesn`t want to go in his cage. He never does on show days. Carter and I both   walk to my trailer and we fall asleep. Carter loves it here at the circus and so do I. There is so much things to do   being here.            Sometimes I wonder what it will be like at other places then the circus. Carter doesn`t want to leave, neither   do I. I hope I can stay here forever.

Suddenly the rope holding me snapped or got cut off and Iwas falling with my face looking at the ground.Suddenly, a weird clowncaught me and put me down and I was scared of what just happened recently. Part 2. It was my second day and I was about to redo my acrobatic event. Then like magic the rope holding me snapped or got cut off once more. I was falling. Then POOF! The clown saved me again and when i saw an object behind his back it was a lighter. He confessed of  burning the rope and he was arrested. That was the scariest momentof my life.

For a moment, she was confused. What am I doing here? she thought. Suddenly, the moments of the day before came rushing to her mind. She had been selected to perform in the Bellini Circus as an acrobat. She had been led to a trailer that she was to share with another acrobat, Betsy White. As if the thought had conjured her up, Betsy stood before her, calling  cheerfully,  'Time to get ready!'  The tall, freckled girl always seemed to have a smile. Angela quickly scrambled to change out of her pajamas. The shows were at night, so she didn't need her outfit yet.           Betsy showed her around the circus area after they went to the pie car for breakfast. At 9, they had school. Betsy enjoyed it thoroughly and made many friends, some of which came from different countries!           After school, Angela, Betsy, and their friends ate dinner and quickly changed into their outfits. Angela was exhilarated. She loved seeing the audience and feeling like they had come all the way just to see her! After the show, Angela changed out of her outfit. She crawled into bed and fell asleep immediately, she was so exhausted. She dreamed about the circus and the happy times she would  have.

He is in his room starting to pack up to run away. Five minutes later his mom yelled 'Time to eat'. 'Ok' mumbeld Joe. He ran down the stairs and asked his mom if he could eat in his room and she said 'Yes'. He got his food and ran upstairs and shut the door. He was planning to go out the window and hop on the train that is going to the Circus and it is leaving in five minutes. So he grabbed his suitcase and went out the window. He sprinted to the train staition. He ran on to the train and sat down.            He was scared when he sat down next to this guy with a gun in his pocket, so he moved by a girl with brown hair and blue eyes. The train started to go. The train was going 150 miles per hour. Before he new it they were at the Circus. Joe walked into the back of the Circus tent. He asked this guy if he could be in the Circus and the guy said'What skills do you have'. 'I can shoot out of a cannon' said Joe. 'You show me that' said the guy. They walked over by the cannon Joe asked the guy what his name is and he said 'Bob'.  Bob lets me get in the cannon.             Joe went in the cannon. Bob lit the rope BOOM goes the cannon. Joe lands safely in the big blue net. Bob says you are awsome. Want to be in the show tonight? Nevesly Joe says'Yes'. Than go get ready for tonight. The night came Joe is very nerves. He climbed into the cannon. The crowd counted 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, BOOM goes the cannon. Joe lands safly in the net . He runs to the back of the stage. He forgot something horribal. He needs to go back home.

The Wom POM Circus is the biggest circus in America. The tent is 123 by 123!I am amazed that I got the job because there are 140 men,125 women,and 70 children.A total of 345 performers.  Tonight,we are performing for the President outside the White House and I am in the first show. I am the leader of all the childrens acts, even though I am the youngest.Please wish me luck! Date June 23, 2012                                             My show did well!There were fire works and dancers and me and my good friend,Jonah, did the tight rope.If you wished me luck,you did great! Date June 24,2012. I`m already all grown up,but it seems like yesterday that I was in the Wom Pom circus. I still have great memrys from tight rope walking. I`m very excited for the new generations of tight rope walkers.I go to all the performances that are near my large home.My fellow tight rope walker is still my best friend.Date April 29,2024.

But the first story tells you, what time you wake up and what time everything is. You wake up at 7:00 AM you wake up get dressed eat. 9:00 AM you go to school the school haves one room. 3:30 PM chores and practice feed you're pet and anything else. 6:30 PM time to eat, don't eat to much you have a show tonight. 10:30 PM the show is over and you wiped out you walk back to the trailer and see all the circus offices,concession stands, stables and trailers. In a couple days you will be somewhere else to perform. 12:00 AM you're in bed thinking about the end of you're tour. It will be nice to go back to you're home but you will miss performing. All of the practice you need for your next show will be tiring. You can't just go and join a circus out of no where and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. You need that skill in you, the right body type and you have to be able to be focused. You have to put you're heart into all of your work. It can't be sloppy. Did you know there are millions of people in the world who would like to be in a circus? Well there is! There is a bunch. I learned that being in a circus is a lot of work. ?       You need all of the makeup, practice, strength, flexibility, focus. You need a lot. You will need lots and lots of practice to become a performer for a circus. I learned a clown needs a lot of makeup and they need to be nice and they need to be funny. Circus Acrobats, need makeup, outfits, patience, focus, and most of all they need to put they're heart into their performance. A circus juggler needs skills too juggle all sorts of things. A tightrope walker needs balance practice focus and also put their best into it. The trainers have to train the animals right so they know what to do. The trainers need to make sure they train the animals so they don't get scared and run off and destroy the performance. The crew who makes all the tents,trailers,outfits , and all the other stuff they need to make sure they are in there place. and not some where they shouldn't.      Working in a circus is a ton of work as you see. You need the makeup, outfits, performance and the skills. When you're on a tour you really don't have a place to call 'home'.Sometimes you might think to you're self i miss my family, friends and house back home but on tour you're having fun. Working at a circus is long hours and weekends. When you work at a circus i bet its fun to perform and do all those fun stunts you do. I also learned that yeah the practices are long and hard but when all those people see how amazing the performance is they will wanna come and watch again, or maybe you will inspire them to try out working at a circus. The Performances are 10 whole shows a week yeah its a lot but its worth it. When you work at a circus you travel all over the world to like japan , florida , california, colorado and other states like that. well thats what i learned about the circus life.

I like to do lots of hobbies like, play sports, enter talint shows and jurnatics. I also like the shows you put on. Im am willing to do a show for you. I have a story that I was in a circus and I was the main act for the show and then I had made a mistake that I forgot what I was sopost to do then after I woke up and it was a dream.   I want to be in the show you are haveing this week and if I can it would be great. I would love to be the main acter in the show. I love being the main acter of the show and being in front of croweds. Iuse to do shows for my family when we went camping. We use to be in the middle of the beach and gust put on a show.We loved to do shows with my family.

After I practice, we go to the pie car once again for dinner, After dinner is when things settle down, I have time to play and have quality time with my family and then go to bed. Everyone seems to think that circus life is fun and high flying, well people who think that are wrong, circus life is really tough, for example, you have to have the right body,  talent and you have to be determined.       You cant go to the circus and expect to be a acrobat, lion tamer or stuff like that right off the bat, it takes lots of training to get to the point where you can actually perform in front of a live audience. If you want to be a good performer, you have to give up everything else and focus on the circus.        Although its a very tough and busy life for me and my family, it can also be very fun. When you are a performer you have the chance to travel the world, you meet lots of new people, and the people from the circus are like a family to me.        A downside to this life though, is that you don't really have a place to call your home. You are everywhere and your always thinking about the upcoming show. You work really hard for the circus and sometimes its not fun at all because you have to learn things that are hard for your body to do. You work a lot of long hours during the day and the weekends too.

Is it normal for someone to fail a lot? I think it is. the circus clown is always failing at his tricks.                  Traveling is the most fun part of the journey. The circus is always traveling around the world. Places like Michigan, Kentucky, China, Japan and Germany.                        Arriving to the location is always the best having people welcome us asking questions like how was the trip, did you have fun. The people that welcome us always want to interview us.                 Doing the show is always the mos important of the trip weather you do your part right or wrong it doesn't matter.

Well this story is about circus tricks and some circus performers that do those tricks.                Jake Flamer an acrobat who is in the circus has an amazing job. He Is from Australia. He is a tight rope walker and swings on the bars. He also has a team of 34 people.                      Jake Flamer, one of his performers in Italy did amazingly well. One of his flips went 8 feet high above the bars. On the tight rope he juggled 5 bowling pins while walking on the tight rope. Another one is he jumped off the tight rope onto the swinging bars. The crowd was amazed. That was one of his most amazing performances. I would like to see Jake flamer preform.                There are other jobs in the circus. The tiger act is another performance. One tiger act is walking the tiger. But first you have to get the leash on it. Then you can walk it. Bella Castini`s neighbors do that. They are professionals. They do that with tigers and leopards.                         There are also magic trick performers. Jenna Keorner is a magic trick performer. She puts people in a box and makes them disappear. She also puts people in a box and cuts them in half and puts them back together. That is another job in the circus.                                  Those are just some of the jobs in the circus. That is why I should go to the circus. 	NNP PRP RB VBN TO DT NN .

A lot of people say the circus is fun it is but you miss your family.                  When you start to perform in the circus you need to go through a lot of traing before performing.            The traing is hard so keep on trying.                          Once you start performing you travel a lot and it's fun.               When you perform tou do backfilps and other crazy things.                That is why I think you should join the circus.                                             	DT NNP .

The first thing you do to start your day is to head to the pie car for pancakes and bacon. You have to have a good breakfest so that's why there's a pie car. Next you have to go to school at 9:00 A.M. The one room schoolhouse travels with them. Like any other school they have computers, test, and report cards.       Many of the people in our school speak many different languages so that's why they come here. Some of the circus performers speak: French, Russian, and Italian. Next at 3:00 P.M. school ends and we have time for a quick break. We usually have fun. Then at 3:30 P.M. it's time for chores and practice. I have to feed, water, and groom the horses that we use in our horseback acts.       Dinnertime for my family is at 6:30 P.M. My family goes to the pie car to eat, but we can't eat a lot beacuse we're performing tonight. We do ten shows a week: one each weekday. 10:30 P.M. The show is over and everyone is wiped out. We walk back to our trailer and start sleeping for the next day.

The thing is that my crew was not so good.See I had an tightrope walker that just kept falling of the rope.I noticed that he was looking down every time he fell.I told him to not look down.     After that mess I had an animal trainer that sucks at training the animals he just kept getting bit any time he went in the cage.And guess what when i went in there the animals just let me do my job.After that we went for a bite to eat.I had a tuna sandwich yum.w   When we got back the cage door to the lions was open.yikes!                 we rounded up the lions and one bit me.ouch! Then an acrobat cant do flips or the splits.but a miracle happened its like every person on my team got better at there act. it was the best day ever we hit the road for the best circus ever program. we made lots of money.And there you have it a happy ending after all.

We smell the buttery popcorn,the melt-in-your-mouth cotton candy,the roaring of the tiger makes my sisters and I jump but we mustn`t stop now we have just arrived at the world famous Wringling bros. Circus! My family goes through admission and some contortionists walk by, one of them waved to me I blushed, and waved back. We dash to find the best seats we can, but wait what about snacks? My dad said to 'stay put' my sisters and I agreed and eagerly waited for the snacks to arrive and the show to start. My sisters and I were practcally out of our seats after another tiger roared. Finally the show was about to start, but where is dad?            We assumed that there was a long line for the snacks so we sat there and watched the circus acts. Then I saw someone I strangely recognized. Could it be? My Dad in the circus? No way this can`t be happening! This is crazy! My Dad had tricked us! I watched in amazement the stuff I never tought he would be able to do.            My dad went offstage and arrived with snacks. My dad was dressed the same way he was on stage. I stared in amzement and ate my melt-in-my-mouth cotton candy. My Family had the best experience at the circus. Don~t be fooled on how old your dad looks never underestimate your family and definitely not the strange ways of the circus.

Many people want to be in the circus, but they don't know how difficult it will be. Lots and   lots of people want to join the circus, but be careful it will be   a bumpy ride!             First of all, the circus is very complicated and tiring. The circus has a tight schedule. To be honest with you, I wanted to be in the circus and I found out that it is a hard job.If you have a special talent like dance or gymnastics, you will probably be good for the circus. The bad thing is that if your in the circus, you won't be able to see your family.              Second of all, I realized I never wanted to be in the circus because I knew I couldn't be with my family. Traveling everywhere is fun, but wouldn't you like to travel with you family? I would miss my family so much. The circus is fun, but hardworking.The circus is very amazing when you see it in person.                 Third of all, seeing the circus in person is very amazing. If you go and see it in person, I guarantee you will have a blast! There is cotton candy, popcorn, and clowns! I have never been to a circus before, but I  am going to soon because my friends have been to a circus before. They told me that is was very exciting and excellent.                   In conclusion, the circus is all the stuff I explained in the story. I would love to go to a circus show. The circus is very crazy and wacky, but also it is a lot of hard work.

So I sometimes think of my life and how i am so lucky to have this opertunity that most kids dont usally have!Also how my parents alawys belive that I can do anything and I am amazing!So I think to myself that some kids sometimes get to see there family not as often as I do,because every I go my family follows! My useawill sedual is kind of crazy though like how I dont even get to bed till 1:00a.m.!Also I kind of hay when I go to school. I am happ about this because it makes me fell normal!

They have to be talented, not just talented a specific talent that people all around the world will enjoy.Many people may sometimes get the job and some don't.Every new day they have to practice some new movements.Their house,garden, pets, and the most important,their family stay away.                                       Some days the people can't practice in only just thinking on their family members.Maby the people that work in the circus wright letters to their family.The audience may think the movements are simple to do, but when they try to do the move ; kaboom.It's very dificult becoming an circus person.       The skills,talent,and flexibility are all used to become a person with circus talent.So come on people and try it, and mayby you can be joined in with a circus crew!00 	NNP NNP NNP NNS VBP DT RB JJ NN VBG DT NN NN , VBZ NNS , VBZ NN , CC DT NN NN NNP NNP VBP TO VB VBN , RB RB VBN DT JJ NN WDT NNS DT IN DT NN MD VB NNS MD RB VB DT NN CC DT JJ JJ NN PRP VBP TO NN DT JJ JJ NN , NN , NNS , CC DT RBS JJ , PRP$ NN NN NNP NNP NNS DT NNS MD RB VB IN RB RB VBG IN PRP$ NN JJ DT NNS IN NN IN DT NN NN NNS TO PRP$ JJ NN MD VB DT NNS VBP JJ TO VB , CC WRB PRP VBP TO VB DT NN : JJ POS RB NN VBG DT NN NNP NNP NNS , NN , CC NN VBP DT VBN TO VB DT NN IN NN -NONE- VBP IN NNS CC NN PRP , CC VB PRP MD VB VBN IN IN DT NN NN .

I had never been to a circus. I was planning to go. But on the side of it, it said,  '$55.95 for each person or instead, make a poem about clowns, turn it in, and if you get an approval, you will win a free ticket to the circus.' There was no way I could get that money in time, I thought. Anyways, I only had $0.50 in my piggy bank. I made the right choice. I decided to make a poem.         During school, I was thinking about writing that poem. I wasn't paying attention to all the subjects my teacher had taught. As days and days passed on, I only had two days left until it was to late. At home, I finally picked up my pencil and started to write:                                                                                   Clowns                                                                         Victoria Kozuchi                                                Clowns are funny, Clowns can be colorful                                        Clowns can also come in various shapes and sizes                                   They make kids and babies laugh. They have big red noses.                             So what else can they do? They all have abilities just like me and you!               The next day, I turned it in. The manager liked it and approved it. I was so happy! I got two tickets for me and ....   I didn't have another person to go with. I thought to myself. Then, an answer came to me. On the following day when I was going to the grocery store, I found a girl who was staring at the same poster I saw. She seemed like she was from my school. I asked her if she was going to the circus. She said,'No, I don't have that kind of money.'I asked her if she wanted to come to the circus with me. She replyed,'Sure!'            It was the day of the circus. We didn't have front row seats, but we had second row seats. It was better than nothing. When the show started, the crowd was clapping and cheering. We seemed like we were both amazed at the juggling act and the circus acrobats. Soon horses came running up in the stage and they looked like bright, shiny unicorns. Lastly, a tightrope walker walked across the rope. It felt like he was going to fall, but he didn't. After the show, we met a clown. He made us both two heart shaped balloons.

I was standing backstage, watching Miko, who was juggling, while Justice was flipping through never-ending rings of fire. My palms got really sweaty and I felt queasy as the crowd applauded and Miko and Justice bowed, because now was my act. Sandra stood beside me and recognized my fear. She grabbed my hand and we walked into the ring together. The lights shone on me so bright, I felt like I could pass out. The clapping sounded like mocking in my head. I couldn't tell what everyone was chanting, but it sounded like, 'You can't do it! You can't do it!' over and over again. Suddenly the bar slowly descended down, and I knew it was time. Sandra and I looked at each other, she smiled, I almost burst into tears. It was time.     We simutaneously grabbed the bar and sat upon it. It suddenly rised up and we were about 100 feet above the ground. My throat closed. No net, no pillows, nothing. If I fell, I would die. Blood everywhere. The lights dimmed, and a big bright one shone on us. Glowsticks on. Fear on maximum. This was it.      My legs wrapped around the bar, and I slowly, one by one, let my hands off. I hung upside down for about a minute, then grabbed the bar once again, but this time I was in a tear drop shape. My legs swung off the bar. 'Don't look down, don't look down!' I thought to myself. After several flips, the lights shut off, not quite pitch black. The audience clapped as the bar descended. Once it lowered down low enough that we could touch the ground, we let go and the bar dissapeared up into darkness. As the crowd kept applauding, I leaned over and whispered to Sandra, 'Good thing they didn't say encore!'

818	AI-XC	20131218113506	1000	1000	NR			F	640335	5	11075191	Y	56196	             I remember the day my parents told me we were going to live on the circus. I was so exited. I was only 3 but I loved the circus. My parents used to be in the circus but then they got married and gave up the circus. But whenever the circus comes to town My parents were in it. So when they got the offer to go in the moving circus the accepted it. I was little so it was easy for me to learn how to tame a elephant or to walk on a rope 50 feet in air with no harness.               My first show was amazing. I'll admit that I was a little scared. OK maybe a lot but I LOVED IT. That day I decided that I was never going to leave the circus. Now that I'm 12 I'm having second thoughts.              I woke up and had my breakfast. Today was Friday the 13. Every Friday the 13 we have cupcakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I chose a chocolate cupcake and started eating it.              I was tired of the circus. Moving every single day could get boring. As I sat in my favorite seat my mom joined me. This was my chance.            'Mom do you ever get bored of the circus?' I asked.             ' Sometimes. But I wait.' She replays.             ' Wait for what?'              ' I wait in till I get a great spot in the circus. I practice in till the manger notice how much better I got and gives me a new spot in the show. Maybe that's what you need.' She replays helping herself to a third cupcake.             ' How did' I say, my jaw hanging wide open.             ' How did I know? A mother knows everything.' And with that she leaves the pie car.             All day long I think about what my mom said. When I practice I try something new. Ins-tide of  juggling I ask one of the clowns if I can borrow their unicycles. They give it to me. I find a nice area with a soft landing. Then I start practicing.             Five weeks later when I'm on my unicycle the manger comes and talks me. He gives me a new place in the show.             ' The clowns say you're good. I hope they're right.'' And he walks away.                              That night at the show I lead the elephants out of their tents. On my unicycle. Blindfolded. I tame the elephants into doing tricks with nothing but my hand. It's nice not being able to see because sometimes the crowd mess you up. When I'm down with my act the crowd goes wild.             That night I don't feel like I hate the circus. I love it even more than ever. I realized that the circus isn't about tricks or clowns. It's about trying new things and loving it. For you it might be sports or a new food. For me it's the circus. Like my mom said you have to wait.

Only 5 people would win the contest and i think I'm going to be one of them i think that because i tried my best and I've past every single one of the challenges.I wish win this contest because i would like to get to sit in the front row whit my family.

Well, if you haven't there are lots of things to do like doing the tents and also doing a lot of shows. Here are what circus people do in a circus.                     Some circus people have to work hard to make the circus.At 7:00 A.M. they wake up eat breakfast and set up tents for the show.At 9:00 A.M. it is school time.At 3:30 P.M. you have to do chores and practice.10:30 P.M. the show is over and at 12:00 A.M. you have to be in bed sleeping.               As a result,being in a circus is very tough and tireing.You have to do a lot of stuff like prepare the tent and get ready for the show.If I were in a circus I would be very tired right now and wiped out .

Going to school geting home from school then having to go to work. Thates pritty tiring dont you think. Then doing a show and going to bed at 12:00am.            Do all that in pharigragh 1. Then you have to lod the aminals. Then take down the tent and lod it. Thates a lot of work. DO you think you can do it.

I will tell you abut how fun, how scary, and how how loud it is. let me tell you about how fun it is. You will have a blast. Im not just saying that to get you to go.           To begin with, i am going to tell you about how fun it is. Before the circus you can go on rides. They have some cool rides you can go on. They also have some good food. They have cool bounce houses.That's it for this paragraph. Let me tell you about how scary it is.                             Second of all i will tell you about how scary it is. It is scary for people who work there. They can make a mistake. They can fall. They can die. Let me tell you about how loud it is.          Last, how loud it is. It gets loud it can hurt your ears. It can make you kid cry. It so loud it can damaged your ears.You might get scared. What ever you do dont take a baby it might get scard.  The circus can be exosting on the way home. Yyou might fall asleep. You might be board. Yyou might be hungry and say something like i haAve to go to the bathroom or im hungry.  That is why the circus is fun cool and scary. you will have a blast. you might go bor.but you have to be strong to be in the circus.You also have to have a lot of talent. Remember if you cant handle being in the circus dont try.

First my mom woke me up. Then I ate and we left for the circus.When we got there I bid farewell and told her to come to the show on Saturday.As she left I met a silly clown named Aldo and we quickly became friends.               While we were talking the ringmaster called for everyone to gather round and meet our newest    (drum roll please) PEANUT BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After he said that, he called me up.As I went up everyone cheered and clapped for me. Then he asked who would like to show me around and help me with any questions. Immediately Aldo raised his hand. The ringmaster said 'How about you Aldo.' Aldo came over and said  ' Come on, Let's go!'                 Day by day Aldo helped me around and introduced me to people.By the Saturday I had made many more friends.That night was the show tons and tons of people were there.Finally the acts began. First , all the clowns came out and did funny things like throwing pies at each other.But I didn't see parts because like everyone wanted peanuts. When I spotted Aldo he looked like he was having a good time.Then I heard a Familiar voice saying ' Peanut boy, over here!'I turned around and guess who I saw, MY MOM! I went over to her and gave her a hug and said 'I missed you' I told about my week  and Aldo. She said 'Sounds like fun'.                    When the show was over I Introduced my mom to Aldo. Then asked if I'm going to stay in the circus. I said 'Even though I had so much fun, I think I want to be with my family'.He said 'Okay'.                    Right as we were about to leave Aldo came after me with a big box. I asked him what it was he said it was a gift for me. I opened it and found a clown makeup kit and a bag of the mysterious marshmallow circus peanuts. I said goodbye and thanks and left. I told my mom ' That  was one of the funnest weeks EVER!'                :) 	PRP$ NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD PRP$ JJ NN VBG IN DT NN CC PRP VBD RB VBN .

I was 100 feet up in the cold night air preparing for what was about to happen. I'm the clown in Rockie Top  Circus. 'I can't believe that my boss wants me to jump onto  a elephant'! I screamed to myself. Then the announcer announced 'ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages, please welcome Tairan Smith' he said in a deep voice.             'Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh SLAP!' as I belly flopped onto the rock hard back of the elephant. The show was started! After the show, I was wiped out. We eat at a pie car. ' I'm sick of this job..............I got it! TomorrowI'll run away!            It was cold that morning but I was ready. I set off at 2:15 to start a new life. I was in Idaho and I traveled on foot all the way to California. It took me 4 years to get there. When I got there I saw a poster that said' Rockie Top Circus going out of business IN NEED OF CLOWN'. I thought about all of my friends and sat there for a long time. Finally I decided that there is no place like home.

For example what I have to do in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. After you read this I hope you will won't to see one of our shows some day.                       First, I I am very busy in the morning. At 7:00 A.M. I get dressed and go out to the pie car for breakfast. We have pancakes and bacon. It is delicious. After I eat we have to set up tents and lights for tonights show. 9:00 A.M. is schooltime. Then I walk to the schoolhouse. The schoolhouse is the same as every school they have computers, tests, and report cards. A lot of the people in the circus are from all around the world ,so many of my classmates speak different languages. When we travel around the world thats when we do geography lessons.                           Next, I have to do tons of jobs in the afternoon to get ready for the show tonight. At 3:00 P.M. school is out. After school I played with the clowns unicycles and juggling balss. It was really fun. 3:30 P.M. is chore time, so I start with the horses. I have to feed, water, and groom the horses. Then I have to start my act. I am leaping off a trampoline and landing on the horse's back. It takes a lot of balance and concentraction. Other kids practice juggling and acrobatics. The trainers are working with baby leopards, elephants,lions, and chimpanzees.                               Last, the end of the night is the best part. At 6:30 P.M. we go to the pie car to eat dinner. Circus performers do not eat much befor the show. The circus does ten shows a week, plus a manitee ( a afternoon show) on Wedensday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday. The show was really fun and everybody enjoyed it. I did my act and did it. It felt amazing! The show was over and everbody is so tired. We walk back to the trailor. In bed I thought when I growup will I still be in the circus?                                   In Conclusion, I hope I will see you some day performing in the circus. The circus is worth being hard because at the end of the night you are very happy that you are in the circus having fun with friends and family.

Also I like the acrabats,lion taming,the cowns,and thetrapese.But the lion taming is the best to me.Why cause you have got to be realy brave to do that.   Well thats all.

If you ask me the circus is really cool.  The bad thing about being in the circus is that you never get to call a place home.  Also you never get to see your family unless they are in the circus with you.                                                             Life in the circus is hard work if you ask me.  I get to see many people which is fun though.  I get to be an acrobat with my parents.  People always ask me for my autograph.  It is amazing to have people ask you for your autograph because it means people really enjoy you.  I love all my fans, but i don't get to autograph everyone oft them because some times their parents think it's late and then they have to leave.  Other people leave because they don't want to wait in the really long lines.  That is what it is like to have all the fans go crazy for you.                                                                                                The disadvantage of being in the circus is that you never really have a place to call home.  I have a home in Mighigan but it is not very big compared to what i am used to.  It only has five bedrooms.  I have three and my parents have two.  One of my bedrooms is used for my bed and clothes from when i was little and not in the circus.  One of them is used for my circus awards.  I put them in there when we do come home but i usally don't have that much.  The other room is used for my circus clothes that don't fit me anymore.                                                                                                 The hard work I put into the circus is fantastic is what all my fans say.  I do miss my grandma and grandpa and all my other family alot though.  When i have shows in Mighigan they will come and see me.  That's why I love it when we have shows in Mighigan.  Also when we have shows in Virginia my aunt ans uncle come and watch because that is where they live.                                                                                                                                  When we are on our break i play with lego's.  One time I built a mansion because my fans know that i locve lego's and they bring me a bunch.  One time a little girl brought me ten boxes of different lego's.  When i get double of something besides lego's I donate them to a charity in Michigan.  When I do performances at local charities when I am in one state the kids go crazy.  Sometimes I got to an orphanage when I am close to one a do gymnastics in the air on a trampoline.                                                                      I have to live in a trailor which stinks.  The good thing is that they are huge.  I have my own bedroom with a queen size bed in it.  I don't have a closet though.  My parents get the closet.  I don't think that is very fare because I have more clothes then they do.                                                             In conclusion the circus life is pretty cool.  There are some ups.  There are also some downs.  An up is that it is really fun getting to go from state to state.  The down is that you barely ever get to see your family.  Now you know what it is like being in the circus.

So kids being in the circus seems to be fun but it really is hard work.         Next, in the circus you have to do things that the owner tells you and if you don't do it and say no.He might say your firerd and than you have to get a new job,but if you still want to be in the circus you have to find another place where they are hireing.But if you don't want to leave the circus family keep looking,and if you still don't find one you have to get another job.         If the job is to hard, boring and mean.Just quit and try harder to get your old job back.Talk to the owner and say that you will work harder than ever.Trust me kids it happend to me and I ended up in the circus for a long time.         Later in the day be nicer at your performence and make the croud happy about the stuff you did and make them incorged in the circus, because someday they might be in the circus too.

Here are some of the things that they do.              7:00 A.M. I wake up, get dressed, and go to the pie car for pancakes and bacon. The crews are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.               3:30 P.M. I feed, water, and groom the horses we use in our horseback acts. Today, my dad pactices somersaulting off a running horse. I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentracion. Other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neibor walks baby leopards on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.         The circus is fun, but it's alot of work. Who knew?                 The circus sounds right for me, I would realy want to ride an elephant, and do trapeeze. It would be a dream come true.

However, it takes alot of work confindence and determimation. I have friend named Cheyenne who is in the circus. She told me its nice to travel around the world doing acts and preforming for people. But, she misses home and being with her family. On the road she said  'there is no time to have fun.'                                                  Cheyenne loves the circus but she misses being with her friends snd family. Cheyenne makes alot of friends on the road but she wants to be with her best friend (me) Serenity. Cheyenne loves tavling around the world and leaning amazing things. she has always dreamed of being in the circus and she finally made it, but she misses home. All in all, its great to be in the circus but you might miss your family. 	NNP PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NN .

The circus life is actually pretty hard. There are many things that you are possibly unaware of in the circus business. Downsides are very common and so are upsides, but there can be more of either to different people though.             There are quite a few hardships for circus performers but I'm only going to tell you some of them. First off one of my most deal-able hardships is how tiring the show is. Our circus does 14 shows a week, one morning show and afternoon show every day! Another hardship is that I have to do almost all the cleaning and chores! But the worst part is I am the animal trainer, so I have to clean up after, groom, take care of, bath, and feed the animals! One of the most hardest hardships is that I cannot visit my family because of my very busy schedule and I cannot visit my friends either! So being a circus performer has a lot of downsides.             Circus performing isn't all bad though. It has its own upsides! Such as, getting to travel the world! I get to see many things around the world! Once I saw the Eiffel Tower, The Statue Of Liberty, and The White House! You also get to see the audience compliment you and see them get 'transported to another world'! I also get to learn new things and tricks as I rehearse and practice. And I do love seeing the children's happy faces once they go to our circus! We also get to eat food that is paid for by the circus. Even with many downsides the circus life is still pretty good!             Another thing I forgot to mention was the profits! I am also the 'treasurer' of the circus. I'm not even sure if circuses are even supposed to have one, but anyways I'm in charge of the profits. And that is hard work! I have to pay everyone depending on how many people paid and gave feedback. I also have to use the money and my FREE time to buy new equipment if we want new equipment or if we need to replace broken equipment. I also have to pay for accidents, candy, one-time-use kind of things, and souvenirs, but I don't have to pay the bills!   That's the owner's problem.             So in the end, circus life to me is exhausting, but it is still a pretty good life. So if I were to recommend being a circus performer I would say it depends on if you are a good acrobatic, but this job does pay a lot!

One thing that I like most in the circus is when I go in the cage with the tigers and lions.I go in and get the tigers and lions to do tricks and be funny.One thing I wish is don't let them be angry that night or its bad news for me.The most funniest thing is when I'm trying to get them to do something they just start running around playing with each other.            Heres something that I like the best at the circus.Its what I have to do every day, is to play with the tigers and lions.This is what I like about the circus.

Because its not always like that.        Hi my name is Micaela lets go on a circus adventrue.            I come for a family of clowns but I'm not a clown in the circus I'm a circus acrobat.        To be a circus acrobat you need to have some skills in dance, gymnastics, and cheer.              At the end of a show its usally 10:00 or 12:00 p.m. I usally dont goo to bed till 2:30 a.m because I'm on my moms tricycle.         But never my dads because if he found out I would be in so much troble that I might not be able to sit down for a week.              So I wake up go to the pie foe eggs and toast. Yummmmmmm!           Oh yea I forgot to tell you what that was. A pie is where clowns, acrobats, jugglers, tightrope walkers have breakefeast and dinner.              My typical day is always busy. Heres my typical day:   7:00 a.m I wake up get dress and then go to the pie for eggs and bacon.           While I eat the crew  is seating up the tents and lights.   9:00 a.m I go to this little room where a teacher teaches me social studies, math, science, and ela.   2:00 p.m schools over and I head to the tent to start practicing.   3:00 p.m I go to the pie for a snake and a break.   3:00 p.m It's dinner time I go to the pie for chicken and mash patatoes.   4:30-6:30 p.m I practice over and over again.   7:00 p.m I go to the pie for a snake and then a little while after the show starts.   12:00 a.m the show ends and I head to our mobile car to get some sleep.             Well thats all the time I have. I have a show to attend to. Maybe I will see you guys again bye. 	VBG IN DT NN NNP VBP PRP RB VBN NNS RB NN VBZ JJ NN .

I'm a lion trainer so I  most likely have the hardest job. Here's a sneak peek on how life in the circus really is.          Living in the circus isn't always fun and games it takes hard work and lots of practice to be in the circus. You also still have to go to school so you have to study for test's and other things on top of practicing for the circus. Right after practice you have to eat dinner and go to bed you get lucky if you have time to play.           Living in the circus is also dangerous you have to be very careful at all times. If you have to deal with animals like me then you have to be very careful. Especially if your dealing with lions or bears like me.         The good side about living in the circus is that you get to do what you love and you're always around you're friends and people who care about you. You can play with the animals which is super fun.         That's how life really is in the circus dangerous, hard work, but it's worth it.

My father just taught me a new trick last night, but he said he taught it to me late and I have a show tonight. I'm really scared to do that trick. The trick is I have to do a back flip off a trampoline onto a horse. Although I love that red striped tent, I really don't want to break a bone in it.       It's a good thing my act is last in the show, so I can practice before I go on. The show starts at three so I have only two hours to practice.       It has been an hour and forty-five minutes I still cant do my trick. We have to get ready for the show, I'm so scared. I put on my costume. I'm watching everyone to their trick perfectly and I cant practice because I'm to nervous. It's my turn. I go out there, I get my stance ready. I say to myself I have to try. I go for it. I land it! I'm so happy. My dad said that he would take us out for ice cream later, but I doubt it.

It's a very difficult job if you ask me. My parents own the circus and they are the leading acrobats. They said that when I turn 13 in two months i get to become an acrobat as well.            There are many responsibility to make our circus one of the top circuses in California. We always have to make sure that the tents,flyers,and other things are ready for the big opening night! My uncle Joe also is in our circus as well, he walks on the tightrope and is very good at it.            Circus life is very difficult if you already didn't know that. We get home schooled on the way because we are on the road a lot while we travel the world. We also don't get so much time to rest we get up at about 7:30 in the morning, have breakfast, my favorite is when my mom makes homemade pancakes, to about 8:00 at night and then we eat dinner. After dinner, we have to perform and that geos until about 10:15 usually.             I guess the circus life is in my jeans, and I'm very proud that it is. Circus life may be diffacult, but it always works out in the end because I have fun and that's all that matters.

Apparently everybody else was too.  Our boss told us that instead of performing at a regular show, we would be competing with other circuses.  The first place circus would be known all over the world.  Us people of Big Top Circus were excited.  Our boss also said that only one person would be annonced the best out of all the circuses.  They would be famous all over the world too.  Now we were really excited.  I wasn't really sure if I would get to be the best.  I knew my friend, Drew, should get it.  She was the best trapeze artist out of the whole circus.  The competition was on Saturday, August 21.  That was only a week from today.  I really needed to practice my acrobatics.         It was Wednesday, August 18.  Only two days left to practice.  I almost broke my ankle trying to land back down after doing my last acrobatic practice yesterday.  It was a good thing I didn't.  Then I wouldn't be able to participate in the competition.  I was doing a really cool routine high in the air with Drew.  I would spin and turn and twirl on a rope and then Drew would come down on her trapeze and get me.  I would fly in the air with Drew, let go of her and do a backflip, and then land clean on my feet.  It was a hard routine.         It was now the day of the competition.  I couldn't wait.  Our circus would be judged last.  We had to perform exellent to impress the judges.  It was finally for our circus to go on.  Drew's and I routine would be going last. We really had to impress the judges.  Maybe Drew would get to be the best performer.  If it wasn't me, it should be her.  It was now our turn.  I was nervous and so was Drew.  She was actually shaking.  I walked over to my rope and started spinning and turning.  Drew then came down on her trapeze and I grabbed her legs and flew with her.  Then I let go of her legs, did a backflip, and landed clean on my feet.          I hoped the routine looked great.  It was time to give out the awards.  So far we haven't been called and they were now going to announce who got first place....'And the circus who got first place is..... BIG TOP CIRCUS!'  I was so surprised I started crying a little bit.  Now they were going to announce the best performer.  'And the best performer is....ZOIE BAEZA!'  Now I really started crying.  I was now so shocked ans surprised that I got it.  I would be famous all around the world even if I died right now.  A week later we were already traveling all aroung the world and many people wanted my autograph at the same time.  The Big Top Circus was now a world wide circus, and so was I.

You are very afraid of hights, but you have to do it anyway. So you climb up on the ladder and get on the rope. After a few minutes people start to notice you are hanging on a rope. A few people walk by and clap for you and tell you to do a trick. You don't know what to do so you put one foot on the rope and the other in the air. Then you do the same thing with your arms. You balance for about 8 minutes with one foot and one arm in the air and one foot and arm on the rope. People clap and tell you to come back tomorrow. After that day was over you walk home and go to bed after a long day of hard work.   The next day you go to the circus to be an acrobat, but then your boss says you ar going to be a juggler instead. he told me he wanted me to learn to do everything so then I could do different things each day. So before people started showing up I practiced. I didn't notice for a few minutes but out of the corner of my eye two people were watching me practice. They started telling me to juggle bananas, so they gave me some and told me to try. I tried and I was actually really good at it. i could also do jumping jacks while I juggled.       After a couple of days I wsa getting tired of doing acrobat and juggling so I asked if I could try tightrope walking. My boss said of course. So i got up on the tightropoe and tried balancing. I could balance pretty well so i tried a trick. I did a flip and a back flip. People were so amazed. everyone was smiling and it made me smile.       The two days after it was Saturday. It was my day off. I spent the whole day practicing. I loved being at the circus. I couldn't wait till Monday so I made my own circus at my house. I made myself look like a clown. I juggled, did acrobats, and did tightrope walking.

Ever since then i have been doing gymnastics.I have always wanted to be in the circus,but i am to shy.   You have to be very brave to preform infront of hundreds of people.Every time i get on stage i freak out,i get nevous.To be in the circus you have to be athletic and not afraid to preform.   being in the circus is not easy.You get to travel around the world and all,but you have to have responsability.If you are not careful you could get hurt really bad.If you are an acrobat you could do some dangerous stunts.If you are a tightrope walker you have to have balance and courage.If you are a juggler you have to be very good at handling things.If you are a horse trainer you have to be careful or you could get kicked in the face.   A clown can just be funny and dress silly.Most clowns have huge shoes,wacky hair,a big bowtie or tie,and paint on there face.If you are a lion taimer you have to have responsability if not you might get injured.

Acrobats have to be safe to cause if injerys they can't do it ever again. The clowns kind of scear me because they pop every where.               2It takes alot  of practic to get it right  if I was in the circus I wold be a  acrobat because it lookslike alot of fun to do it. also I would also want to be a person trains he horses.but I  think that being a jggler cause you can jggle alot of things like chinesaws and glass bottles its fun being in the circus it s alson abot how many people is there to watch you perform!

So then the next day we went.With my sister and mom too. When we got there it was huge with red and white stripes.    I gave a huge man my ticket. He put it in a box that said tickets. Then when I walked in I ran to get a seat up front. So I got the very front row. Then a man with funny shorts a mustache and a tall hat went in the middle of the room he said''Welcome to the cicus.'' every body clapped there hands and screamed.   First a tiny car came out and five clowns was in it.I was amazed. They had a pie war with each other.I loughed so hard.Then the circus acrobats came out the swung from tall ropes and did flips in the air. I screamed and clapped for them.   last they had elaphants come out and do tricks and funny things. Then it was all over that was the bes circus in my life!

You shouldn't be one if you're scared of heights obviously.  you have to have great balance to not fall.  It's amazing being up here though.  You get a great veiw,but don't get distracted and fall.  If you fall luckily there are nets to catch you,but still be careful.  It's a real challenge to ride a unicycle across it while juggling. I'm not that good of a juggler but I can ride a unicycle across it,but it's still hard work.  Being in the circus isn't to easy but it sure is fun.

I ate my cereal and got in the car. Sadly my parents were not in the car. I ran inside and dragged them into the car. We were on our way to the circus. I was so exited all I said to my parents was, 'are we there yet' about one thousand times. I finally got bored of saying that, so I just sat there quietly.                             Then in the horizon I saw a tent, at first I thought it was just some campers but as I got closer and closer I realized that we were finally here. I was so exited that I couldn't speak. we found a parking spot as quickly as we could. I jumped out of the car and ran inside. It was every thing I dreamed it would be but better. On one side there was the snack shop and on the other there were performers giving out signatures. i ran in the doors there they were our own reserved seats. Once I sat down the lights turned off.                              A small man came out he said,' welcome to the Circus Ole, we hope you have the best night of your lives.' As soon as he finished He turned taller and taller. Then something came out of the sky it was a mini plane, it was awesome. Then acrobats came fling out then landed on a trampoline were they started doing all of these cool moves. Out of no were these performers swinging on these glow in the dark ropes. The strangest thing happened, a elephant was riding on rollerskates.                              Next balloons started falling out of the sky and then got real quite. A mime was stacking chairs in an odd way then I couldn't believe it, he started climbing them. I new he was going to fall at the very top he started staking more and more, he was insane. At the very top he jumped! He was going to die but when he touched the ground it was water, it was impossible.                               Then he started raising from the water and started flying! I never wanted to leave because there was more they started swinging on bars and doing flip. it was the best night of my entirer life. I hope I get to do this agian.

I never did want them to go back. They said they had too and they were too weird to get a job somewhere else. I did not want to follow in their steps.   Since I was known as their kid I guess everyone thought that I had to be in. Nope all of those people were wrong I hate the circus. Even though I would be in a store and everyone would rush to me and say ypur the famous kid Mr. Johnson! I told them i was always someone else so they wouldn't bother me.   I sat in the croud watching my parents flipping all over the place and dancing and twirling. I thought it was dumb. So I owned a company named Johnsons Rugs. After the show I told them what I owned and they were so disapointed but the circus wasn't for me.

First, not just anyone can go and become an acrobat or trapeze artist.Next, one of the upsides of being in the circus is that you get a chance to travle the wold.Last of all, go back home and say I miss home and I want to see my famiy and enjoy your family.

Well it is not all fun and games you have to practice and keep trying until you get it but i think it is a little hard on what you aare suppose to do. I am a acrobat i get thrown into the air and someone catch me or i swing on to a pole that moves back and forth.           You have to sleep in a trailer and you get to travel to places like Japan, or other places in North America. Also because a lot of us don't speak the same laungage we need to learn a lots of laungages.The circus can be hard but it is still so fun to see all the people watching you and wishing they could do that.           But i think the best part of my job is when it is show time and you get to preform in front of all those people all the time. I start to feel a little nervous until i know it will be ok and i will do a good job and i make people happy. 	NNP PRP RB VBN CC NN TO DT NN .

I saw a notice in the news paper that said 'Help Wanted, Come if You're Talented'. I am going to miss my family and my best friend Sophie. But when i'm done in the circus i will have a giant mansion and i will invite my parents to live with me. Sophie will have a sleep over with me every night. I would be famous! But first, i need to get in the circus. I already left a note for my family saying that i will be back soon.        I was waiting at the bus station when i saw a little boy come up to me. I asked him if he was lost, but he shook his head. He said that he was going to the circus tryouts. Then, i asked him where his parents were. He looked down at his feet sadly and told me that he didn't have any. I wasn' t just going to leave him there to starve to death, so i brought him with me to the journey.               We both didn't end up getting in the circus. But fortunately, my parents adopted the litte boy and named him Antonio. People call him Tony the Terrific.  That how i got my little brother.                                                                THE END!

At the end of the day the circus was really fun and cool.Maybe someday I will join the circus but I definately won't be a clown or acrobat.

Mostly because sometimes I dream of me becoming a star, in fact to be on Broadway, so I can be found by a famous producer and everything. Maybe even my own personal assistant too. Oh how I dream of this happening. Time for bed  my mother said.                                                                                                                                                                                    The next day I saw on t.v. a wonderful thing coming to town, guess 'The Circus'I said happily. I asked my parents that if we could go and they said yes. I was bursting with joy, but that wasn't all they said Hector could join us to the circus. Then it got better he came over and I told him all we were going to do but, when he said'wait wait I still have to ask my parents if it was o.k.'he said to me. And that was when he left and I was sad that he did.                                                                                                                                                                                                    The next morning he came back and said 'I could go I could go' yes I had a feeling you could. That night was the best night of our lives we had the best time ever. And it doesn't all end there a man from the circus saw us preform when they asked for 2 volunteers and said you two were amazing out their how would you like to work part time here so of coarse to still see your family. So we talked to Hectors family and mine and what do you know they all said 'YES'.        The next performance was in Wyoming and that was out of state and a little bit far from Wisconsin. So we had our very own ride in a privet  jet, and my family and Hectors family got to come with us and see the performance. And until we grew up we were known as the 2 glued sticks because we always sticked together the whole way through and stuck up for each other.        In conclusion this is what my live would be like if I were in the circus.

A time to be amazed to think WOW how cool is that.   Now to the animales there is a zebra named Marty a lion named Alex and garafe   The lion does trapeze with the jagwar .   The garafe does tightrope with a hipo.The zebra  does afro circus.       The bear does the unicycles.   And the elefent juggles  clown balls and they put a red big ball on his nose.   Alex the lion is my favorite because he jumps through hoops and flips through hoops. By the time thats over wich is around10:00 because the circus starts at 11:00 in the morning we eat before it starts and after when it is over.                Thats all for today  so good night to all. The next morning I was useing the unicycle and I fell and broke it so I sold my ring for a 250 kowasocky ninja. And then he thought he could do the tiperope and he could.And thats my story for today.   today i get to use the trapzez. to be contenued...

The circus that I am in is called 'The Best Circus On Earth' and we are performing in California. I have not been to California, even though I travel all over the world. The circus will be here all week so I get to perform 10 times! One show on weekdays, but Wednesday there are two shows and two shows on the weekends.       After I ate breakfast, I went to the school room. The school room is like any other regular school only, it travels with the circus. School is over at 3:00. We have 6 hours of school because we need to train. Besides performing, my favorite part of the day is the after school break. I usually play with the clowns and they teach me how to juggle. After my break, my friend and I feed the horses. Today, I am working on leaping onto horses, and then jumping off of it. My friends are working on juggling and acrobatics. Other acts are training their lions, elephants, and monkeys.       It is 6:30, dinner time is finally here. My family and I go to the pie car to eat, but we can't eat too much because of the show. Now it is time for the show! When it is time for my act,  I pull it off perfectly. I love seeing the crowd get excited and enjoy the show. The show is over at 10:30 and I am very tired. Even though I am tired, I can't wait for the next day so I can perform again.       Being a circus performer is lots of fun. I love being around all the circus members and I love to perform. I would be happy if I could return home to New York but as long as I can be around my family doing what I love I would be happy.

What was it i was day dreaming about ow ya what was i going to do for summer. But i fowned out i was grounded because my mom asked what happen to my grades well i said that i wasent paying attention on the test so i got an F on my test. But after one weak my mom said i was going to a circus. I was so supprised i even saw my friend Carlos. First thing we did was go jumping on the trampa lean doing back flips. Then we had to srech out our legs so that we can go tightrope walking well first few times i fell off then the 5th time i made it across! But at 8:00pm we had to go to our trailer and sleep but Carlos and I went to our tent to play. The next morning i went to the animal trailer with the animal trainer to get a baby lion to trian and it was not easy well i was running away because i was getting scared but when i was ready i went to the baby lion and peted it then i got to make it jump through. After a while we went to watch the man train a fully grown tiger. But after a while i got bored so i went horse back riding and we went on our first real performance it was a sucses but i had to go home so early because school was in 2 days so i had to go. But next summer i will go back and this time i will go and do the acrobats. NEXT SUMMER   Well i got focused in class because i new if i focused i could go for an extra weak instead because that weak was the acrobat lessons! So the moment of truth i will be learning how to be an acrobat! This time i brung a few of my friends so it wont only be me and Carlos this is gonna be the best summer ever. So first we had acrobat lessons then we went horse back rideing we also learned how to juggle. After we brung our parent to watch all of us perform we put all of our acts together and it was wonderful so when i grow up i want to be in the circus . So almost every summer i ask my mom and friends if all of us can go to circus camp. But my mom decided almost every winter,summer,and fall we are going to circus camp! So lets get back to the story so my mom said at school i have to get an B or higher or no camp and so the camp moved so we have to travel to New York! Maybe we can visit my uncle because he nose a lot about circus because hes bin in one his name was Billy the silly clown. I think hes still got some tricks up his sleeve.

Most of the time she will have the same routine, but sometimes her routine could change due to what is planned for the day. She is always on task and she is a straight A student even with all the circus practicing. Her mom Tracie Gapol is one of the circus acrobats, her dad is a circus juggler, and her two brothers Christian and Kolten are the ones for the tightrope walker. Her family is very busy most of the time. They have 12 shows to attend in 1 week, so of course it is going to be hard for them, especially Kolten because he's only 5. But he is good at those things so is th rest of the family.

I am going to tell you about a typical day as being a performer in the circus.         6:30 A.M.- I wake up, get dreesed in normal day clothes, and go to the pie car for whole grain toast, bacon, and eggs. The show crews are setting up tents, lights, music,and the stage for tonight's show.         8:00 A.M.- School time. Since there are is no actual school around all of the kids go into a one-room schoolhouse that travels with the circus. Like normal schools we have computers, tests, and the worst, report cards. Most of my classmates don't speak English because the performers come from all over the world. As do our geography lessons.         2:00 P.M.- Finally, school is over. Time for a quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and other silly equipment. I also get to play with my Afghan Hound, Sparky. I'd like to join a tennis team, but we're never in one place in order to stay on a team.        3:00 P.M.- Chores and practice. I have to feed and groom all of the animals, except for the ones that the trainers are taming. Today my dad's girlfriend and I are practicing out tricks on the silk ropes. When we are done we have to do some extreme stretching.          6:30 P.M.- Dinnertime. My family and I go to the pie car to eat, but we don't eat much because we're performing in two hours. We do ten shows a week: one each weekday, plus a manitee on Friday, and three on the weekends.          8:30 P.M.- Show time. During the show the clowns's are first, second, and third. After, the clowns's first act come the acrobats, that's me. Next, the clowns again.Then, the tricksters, the random and dangerous tricks people go. Finally, everyone comes out and goes bananas.          9:00 P.M.- Bed time. I'm thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be nice to go back to our real home in Maryland. When I grow up, will I still be in the performing industry like my parents? Who knows? The circus is fun an all, but it is a tough life.

All of the clowns, acrobats, and trapeze artists are getting ready for the big show. I step out of bed and run through all of the big tents set up for the circus. I keep running until I bump into Dad. 'Hello sweatheart what are you up to,' he said in a nice voice. 'I want to help you groom the horses for the big show. Everything must be perfect,' I replied. 'I just did that. Why don't you go get some breakfast,' he said back. So I start to run and run again.                 I keep running until I make it to the pancake booth. 'Can I have a chocolate chip pancake with surup?'Of course you can Sophie. anything for the circus owner's daughter,' the pancake guy said. It's funny how every body knows my name when I don't know their's. I then ran back to my bed and took a long long nap.                    I woke up again at three a clock. Our firs show started in five minutes! I ran to the big tent and found a spot in the crowd. The circus was great with dancing elephants, flipping acrobats, and swinging trapeze artists. It was so amazing. After it ended I went to congradulate the preformers. they work so hard. I was so pleased and couldn't wait until the next show!

THE first thing I'm going to tell you about is acrobatics ,FOR EXAMPLE, acrobatics is when you jump from rope with plastic bar hanging from the bottom and they hang over a big net and swing to a another rope with a plastic bar hanging from the bottom.Also,in acrobatics the jump in a big net from a crazy height. Lastly, in acrobatic it helps learn balance.This concludes my essay about the circus acrobatics.                                                                                                                                                             THE second thing I'm going to tell you about is lion tamers,FOR EXAMPLE ,loin tamers get locked in a cage with a lion.Also lion tamer hit tigers with a whip and chair and say 'back beast back'.LASTLY being  a lion tamer is hard work you have to not let the tiger maul you to death for like a whole twenty minute.                                                                                                                                                                              THE last thing I'm going to tell you about is tightrope walker, FOR EXAMPLE, tight rope walkers walk on a very thin rope over a big net. Also some times there riding unicycle on the rope.lastly type rope walkers even run on ropes.                                                                                                                                                                                               and that concludes my essay about the circus                                                                                                                                                                        THE END                                                                                  	DT NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN JJ NN WRB PRP VBP NNS , NN NNS , CC RB NN -NONE- JJ VBG TO VB PRP IN NNS NNS , NN NNS , NN NN NNP NNP JJ NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN VBZ NNS , NNP NNP , NNS VBZ WRB PRP VB IN NN IN JJ NN VBG IN DT NN CC PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN CC VBG TO DT DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBG IN DT JJ , IN NNS DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN NNP NNP , IN JJ PRP VBZ NN NN VBZ PRP$ NN IN DT NN NNP NNP JJ NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN VBZ NN NNS , NNP NNP , NN NNS VBP VBN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN VBD NNS IN DT NN CC NN CC VB JJ NN RB VBG DT NN NN VBZ JJ NN PRP VB TO RB VB DT NN NN PRP TO NN IN IN DT JJ NN NNP NNP JJ NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN VBZ NN NN , NNP NNP , JJ NN NNS VBP IN DT RB JJ NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP DT NNS RB VBG NN IN DT JJ NN NN NNS RB VBN IN NNP CC IN NNS PRP$ NN IN DT NN DT NN

I have been a circus performer since I was ten years old. I had always wanted to be in a circus. Once my parents found out my talent for balancing on a tightrope, they knew that instant to sign me up to be a circus performer. My dream came true that very day.             When I started performing in the circus I was very shy and always nervous before a show. I didn't make any friends when I first started. When ever I practiced I would always be nervous and fall down. I don't know how many times I fell down, but I knew I fell down a lot. Next week I didn't make any friends, but I was falling off the tightrope less. I was feeling more confident.

One of them is tightrope walking. Tightrope walking takes a lot of balance and determination. You need to walk carefully and try not to fall a lot. But if you practice a lot and maintain a lot of balance, you wouldn't have to fall a lot. You'll still need determination.  Determination leads you to a better life or a better try to stay on balance.                         Another thing that happens is clowning around. Clowns try to annoy or scare spectators with getting in front of their faces or squirting whem with squirt guns or those prank flowers that shoot out water. You wouldn't have to have determination. You need annoyance. So it'll be a lot easier to clown around.                 The last thing that happens is shooting out of a cannon.You won't need annything but firepower. Firepower helps circus actors fly( or rocket) out of the cannon and probably blast through the tent. Rocketing out of cannons would let actors know how it feels to fly aimlessly in the air.

You have to spend a long time away from your home and practice really hard. But circus has some upsides too, like traveling around the world and meeting new people. One of the most exciting things is you learn new things along the way!       First, I wake up really early and get dressed. After I am dressed I go to the pie car for breakfast. And when I have gobbled down all of my food I go up to the trailor and practice my performance while the crewmen outside are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.       Next, it is school time. We have a one room schoolhouse travels with us. Our schoolhouse is like any school, it has computers, tests, and report cards. Many of my other classmates speak other languages because we circus performers are all over the world.       Then, when school is over it is time for a break. The clowns let me play with their equipment. I also play with my tiny animals; our trailer can not fit large animals.       Furthermore, it is dinnertime. We go to the pie car to eat, but we don't eat much because we are performing tonight. We do ten shows a week, so it is not all fun and games.       Finally, the show is over. I am so tired. I just want to plundge into bed. Two days from now, we will all set up in another town.       Last, I am in bed. I am homesick. I can't wait to the end of our touring season. It will be great to go back to my home. When I grow up I want to be a great circus performer. The circus life it fun, but it is a busy and tough life.

Well not really clowns and other people at the circus have to do chores too. I will share my list of chores with you.       6:00 am I get up and eat breakfeast and get dressed for the day. I throw on my big red shoes my white pants with red stripes and a yellow poket dot shirt.       7:00 am I go outside to see my family and friends doing there chores. I say hello to everyone then I get to work. I brush the horses, sweep the floor, mop the floor, and wash the windows. Thats not all I still have to pick up horse poop. The worst of all.       1:00 pm I help put tents and conseshon stands up for the show. We all work on puting the tent and other things up.       3:00 pm we give tickets out for the 4:00 show. Then we practice entill the show is about to start. We got in are positions for the show and waited for everyone to get seated.       6:00 pm we take down the tent and conseshion stands and we put everything away       8:00 pm we all hop in are beds and get ready to go to sleep when we start to get hungry. We get up and get something to eat than we hop back in our beds and go to sleep. When ten hours later we wake up and do it all over again. 	NNP PRP RB VBD DT NN VBD DT NN NN PRP RB VB JJ DT NN .

The other reason why she does not likle the circus is you still go to school.The only best part about going to school is your just learning how to do diffrent things like acrobatics or walking a baby leopards on a leash.       Then when your done whith practiceing all of that.You fet wiped out so she had  to walk back to her trailer so she passed the circus offices,concession stands,stables and the other trailers.       Then she had some good days becuse she got to perform and che had fun whith it.

First of all, A circus performer puts time and effort in his/her practice. They have to practice all day and all night for every show. Even though they know how to do it by heart, They still need to practice because if they mess up then he gets booed off the stage and the circus will make less money and might fire him. They might even leave the circus because they messed up on their performance                      Now back to the life of a circus performer. A circus performer cannot just join the circus. They need to test him or her to see if they have special talents. They can't just join if they do one or two tricks. they have to be able to do many tricks not just one. He or she has to do at least 10 tricks so when the show comes and they do the same trick over and over the audience would be bored and leave. The circus performers have to wake up early to practice and eat pancackes and bacon at the pie cart.                      The pie cart is the place where all the circus performers eat. The little kids have to groom the horses. The adults have to practice on doing acrobatics and other stuff. Other people set up the tents,put up music for the circus, and get the lights ready for the circus. They all have to sleep at 12:00am                                               	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NN VBZ VBG TO VB RB DT NN CC NNS IN DT NN NNP NNP IN DT , DT NN NN NNS NN CC NN IN JJ NNP NNP VBP TO NN DT NN CC DT NN IN DT NNP NNP IN PRP VBP WRB TO VB PRP IN NN , PRP RB VBP TO NN IN IN PRP VBP RP RB PRP VBZ VBN RP DT NN CC DT NN MD VB JJR NN CC MD VB NNP NNP MD RB VB DT NN IN PRP VBD RP IN PRP$ NN RB RB TO DT NN IN DT NN NNP DT NN NN MD RB RB VB DT NNP NNP VBP TO NN PRP CC PRP$ TO VB IN PRP VBP JJ NNP NNP MD RB RB VB IN PRP VBP CD CC CD NNP PRP VBP TO VB JJ TO VB JJ NNS RB RB NNP NNP CC PRP VBZ TO VB IN JJS CD NNS RB WRB DT NN VBZ CC PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN CC IN DT NN MD VB VBN CC NNP NNP NN NNS VBP TO VB RP JJ TO NN CC NN NNS CC NN IN DT NN NNP NNP NN NN VBZ DT NN WRB DT DT NN NNS NNP NNP JJ NNS VBP TO VB DT NNP NNP NNS VBP TO NN IN VBG NNS CC JJ NNP NNP NNS VBD RP DT NNS , VBD RP JJ IN DT NN , CC VB DT NNS RB IN DT NNP NNP DT VBP TO VB IN CD

I know, I know, i should be in college but my parents were so obsessed in their love life they forgot to and the last word my mother spoke was college.

When I first got there I saw a tiger being tamed by someone who looked alot older than me. I asked them if I could have a job then I got the job so I became a tamer. After one week I saw hundreds of people surronding us. So we started the show alot of people were buying cotten candy for their kids. Some adults were even buying soda then it gotten a little dark and the show began I saw lights from toys. Some basket ball players came out riding unicycles there were two teams red and blue they shot alot of baskets. Then after that we were all singing songs some guys were going to to mess around thats what they were supposed to do.    Up next was my turn but the annouser told everybody that we were going to have a break so people could go use the bathroom or just buy stuff they wanted. After that break everybody came back to their seats I came in and brung in the tigers and my partner did too so we began.    These tigers were tamed so people thought that they were going to hurt us tear us apart or something. After a few minutes we manage to pull it off. Then two guys came out and they started to walk on above.    At the end of the show we sang a ending song everybody loved our show because alot of people liked alot of parts or the show.

In fact I come from   ?long line of circus performers. Since I was born here, the circus trailer is kind of my home. Also, I've been working in the circus for three years as a magician, and I'm only eight years old. My normal day is I wake up, eat at the pie cart, go to school, and practice for tonight's show. I especially like school because since we travel around the world, our geography lessons really come to life. In practice, I practice mostly basic magic tricks such as taking a coin of an empty sleeve, but I sometimes get to do advanced magic. Then after the performance I feel super tired and I sleep. Today, is a big day for me, and I don't want to blow it. This is the first day I perform an advanced trick, the vanishing act, in front of a crowd. I am nervous, but also excited. 'Now its time for Cris, the Kid Magician!' says the announcer. My hearts thumps with excitement. I enter the stage do my routine. I take out my 'magic' smoke ball and throw it to the ground. I stood middle stage to make the crowd would see me if I just went left or right making it seem more magical when I vanish in front of the crowd, making them cheer to their heart's content. I re-enter the stage and say, 'Thank you, thank you everybody!' After my big achievement I celebrate with a great meal, too excited to sleep, despite the time.

A circus is a form of entertainment with many different performers.   There are many things you could do there. You could take care   of the animals, be an acrobat, or even be a clown. Even children perform. They have school in a one-room schoolhouse.   A circus eels fun, but it could be hard because you spend a lot   of time away from home.

I had just entered the circus. It was crowded with trapeze artists, clowns, people walking on stilts, and animal trainers with elephants, lions, and other animals. I walked into the stand to wait for the show to begin. Suddenly, it began. I was suprised to see many clowns juggling, tigers jumping through rings, and men walking on ropes. After it was over, I realized that I wanted to be part of the circus.           As I grew older, I still wanted to be part of the circus. I started training, but most of all I wanted to be an animal trainer. I had always loved animals, and I wanted to train them to do tricks. I also practiced juggling in case if Ididn't get the job. I went into the circus and talked to the manager of it, and I got the job! I was so happy and started to help with the animals. My favorite was an old tiger. I fed them treats when they did tricks correctly. Soon enough, they were ready to perform after a month of hard work. One night, I performed with my animals. It was fantastic. The crowd screamed when they saw the tiger jump through several hoops. The monkeys juggled tiny balls and fruits. After the show, I was exhausted.           A few weeks later, I had always remembered that night and always trained with the animals until the next show.

There were many many funny, hilarious looking clowns that did many funny tricks. One asked me to come down and kept pulling money out of my hair. It was very humiliating. Since then, my parents kept teasing me that I was hiding money from them in my hair and that I let that clown steal it when hey could have used that money to buy something. next we went to the stunt show. There, I saw many stunts. Some of them were the tight rope walking, jumping from a trampoline onto a horse, somersaulting from a horse, and riding on a unicycle. But, my favorite stunt was when one performer was shot from a cannon onto a whale's back and then rode the whale. In the end, we went to eat lunch. After having a spectacular lunch of cheese pizza, we decided to head back home. 	DT NNP NNP . NNP . NNP . NNP .

In the story it said that you have to wake up like at 7:00 am that is early .  You also have to train yourself for all the dangerous stunts . I think being in a circus is not a good thing for me.                                                                                                                                                     If you are a performer you have to keep your strength and balance in every thing you do . If you are someone who balences on a rope the main things you need to have is strength and balance. If you are going to be a person who rides in th circle with motor cycles have to go fast so you dont fall out of the motor cycle .Thats why being a performer is important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Waking up early is one of the most important tasks in a circus . Waking up to go practice every day . The people who work in the circus are really tired of working every day so early. Lots of people wake up early to go see the circus animals when they put them outside so the people can see them .

I work from sunup to sun down.                                   Here's a typical day for me 7:00 A.M I wake up, get dressed, and go to the pie car for pancakes and bacon. The crews are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show. 9:00 A.M. school time. Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school, ours has computers, tests, and report cards. Because the circus performers are from all overheat world, many of my classmates speak other languages: french, Russian, and Italian, like my family. As we travel around the country, our geography lessons come alive.                       3:00 P.M. School's over-time for a quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling  balls. I also play with my tiny dog, Noodle; our trail is too small for a large pet. I'd like to join a soccer team, but we're never in one place long enough.3:00  P.M. Chores and practice. I feed, water, and  groom the horses. I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration. Other kids are     practicing jugging and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.

The person was tied with ropes, chains, a strait jacket, and he was placed in a closet with loced doors. He was given a minute to escape. As soon as 45 seconds were over he escaped.

So, she wnt in and there was the Sanoochie Family  and the Great Davillinger them selves for try outs! The Great Davillenger and all the Sanoochies turded and look at her. Then Dannica the younges Sanoochie said,' Look, look theres a girl my age here for try outs!' ' I see her come on in little girl tell us your name.' said the Great Davillenger. Saamntha slowly walked closer to them. ' Hello my name is Samantha Handimer.  I'm here for the try outs.'

They take their seats while others enter.             It's five minutes until the show starts. We are waiting patiently for the show host to come out. Some people are already eating their popcorn and snacks. Others are talking to their family and friends,and others are getting more popcorn and snacks.           The show is about to begin. The lights get dim and the stadium gets dark. Then there's a big bright light that shines on the host on stage. Everyone starts clapping welcoming him.          The host announces the clown and a funny looking clown comes out on a elephant honking a honker while doing tricks.           The clown finishes and everyone claps an throws money on stage.          The host then announces the circus acrobats when the clown leaves. The circus acrobats come out from above the tent tied onto the tight rope.          They do many types of tricks and jumps still hanging onto the rope. It seems like a pretty scary thing to do especially if your scared of heights and if the rope isn't really tight.          Everyone claps and throws some money. The host then announces the circus horses. Two horses come out and two large hoops are brought in. The host then goes up to the large hoop and sets them on fire. The horses back away then start running towards the hoops and jump.          Everyone claps and throws money and the horses leaves.  The host then announces the circus juggler. A guy in a clown outfit comes out with seven balls. As he throws them into the air, they flame up. He starts juggling the balls that are on fire and starts walking towards a small pool of water. He lets the balls fall into the water and they stop burning.          Everyone claps and throws money. The juggler laves and the host announces the circus tight rope walker. the light moves up the tent to reveal a guy on a edge getting ready to walk on the line. He walked really quick then sow then quick then slow. He made it and the crowd starts clapping and throws money.         The host then announces that it's the end of the show. Everyone who took a role in the circus act came out and bowed while the horses danced, and they gathered the money and said their good-byes.

But, airfare was too expensive, going around $400 - $1,100. For a few days, he searched online and newspapers to see what jobs could let him go around the world while working too to make some more money.                       Finding The Final Job                        On the next week, Vince found an ad that needed new, experienced circus performers that get to go to more than 150 cities in less than 9 months on plane. For the whole day, all he thought about was the phrase,'More than 150 cities in less than 9 months'.He didn't care about going on plane, having to do tricks, or maybe even getting hurt so he went to the circus manager and asked if he could be part of the circus crew.  After a little interview, the manager, Taj, congrated Vince, and told him he can go see the other people and the whole circus family. On that night, Vince got ready all of his clothes, belongings, and etc. and headed to an airport and met the circus crew there.       Vince's Schedule For The Circus                         While on the airplane, Taj came to Vince and gave him the everyday schedule which looked like this:       7:30 A.M.= Wake up + eat breakfast 8:45 A.M.= Feed, water, and etc. for animals 12:00 P.M.= Practice tricks and acts 2:00 P.M.= Lunchtime 3:40 P.M.= Relax/have some sleep 5:30 P.M.= Dinnertime 10:45 P.M.= Show's over       When Vince looked at the schedule, he was surprised how long the show was, but he was satisfied with it. Now, it was the first day he is going to be in circus with a big audience. Later, instead of being scared and having stage-frieght, he was happy and confident with doing this. Vince was even happier when he remembered his dream for doing this job was to get to go around the world, but also his crew treats him nicely like family. He guessed that maybe he could do both things at once (doing circus + traveling around the world).       After 3 Years In The Circus                      Now that Vince has turned 16 years old, has gotten used to the life of a circus performer, now made contact with a big circus family of his own, and also made more than $100,000, he have had some oportunities that some famous circus managers like Tej would give him a chance to show off his tricks and acts, but he declined them all because he already has his own circus family/team and his great manager Tej. Vince and his team has been going far with the circus road and most of the world has known them for almost a century, so they are almost famous worldwide. This isn't just the end.       At The End Of The Circus Life                     Now that Vince has turned 24, he still sometimes goes back and tells these past stories to relatives and visitors, but also he sometimes goes to the circus and play a show or two to let the 21st century know what he has done in the past. His team has gone and passed to other things because of family and business problems, but Tej is still with Vince to help, but they don't really do any circus shows anymore. Now they still have a good life and all, but in their souls, they still have some drops of circus life in there, and they will treasure that great moment until they perish.

I work in the circus. It might sound strange and fun, but it is a very difficult job. I'm a tightrope walker and it takes skill and effort to do that. I'll tell you the life of the circus.         You see we travel in a train. First, we wake up, dress up, and we eat at the pie car. A pie car is where we eat. We also keep up with our education because we have a place where we learn like a school.After that, I practice my tight rope walking and it is very hard and I haven't mastered it,yet. Last show, I failed and fell off the tightrope. It was very devastating I got a serious injury in my leg, but now I recovered ready amaze the crowd.         My stage name is Black Jack. In four hours is the show and I am determined to master that tightrope. four hours has passed and my act is up next not even having on butterfly in my stomach. Now, everyone is watching me, sweat going down my neck. I stepped onto the tightrope and walk steadily then the crowd gased at me doing a 360 spin and land perfectly safe. Then I amaze the crowd with tricks until I'm at the end of the tight rope. My heart  was happy when I heard the round of applause. The show is over. I'm walking to bed now, feeling wiped out and I collapsed in my bed resting for the next show tomorrow.

Then I flipped again and landed on the platform. As the crowd applauded me and the rest of the trapeze act we made our way backstage so the clowns could go on.          After the performance we went to the pie car to eat dinner. When we went to bed the circus tent seemed small as they packed it away. I thought that life was tiring at the circus but I also knew it could be worse.          For the next week, practice daily and perform at night was the schedule as well as school.Make sure you finish your homework and make sure you practice your flip over and over.Everybody was always so upbeat all the time, with the exception of the poop scoopers.          Every performance same thing, the introduction, next the lions and elephants, then the trapeze act, and finally the clowns. We do the same act for a year then change it over the summer. Everywhere we go the crowd loves us, but it gets lonely after awhile even with all the performers.
