It is 7:00 A.M. and I am going to the pie car for breakfast. I order sausage, eggs, and pancakes. I get some orange juice to go with it. Right now they are setting up the tent for tonight's show.              Now it is 9:30 A.M. and it is time to start practicing for tonight's show. I will be walking above a pool of sharks. I stumbled a few times but never fell.              It is now 3:00 P.M. and practice is over. I get a break time for 30 minutes. I am going back to my trailer to take a nap.              3:30 P.M. It is time to help set everything up for the show tonight. I help set my tightrope and the pool of sharks up for the show.              6:30 P.M. Now it is dinnertime. My friends and I go to the pie car to eat. We are all talking about the big show tonight.              10:30 P.M. Show time! I am the last act of the night. I wait for a hour to go by and I am finally up. The lights face towards center stage. The announcer says,'Now what you've all been waiting for Tylar Johnson!' I step onto the tightrope and I keep my balance until halfway. I look down and I see the sharks going around in circles. I start wobbling and everyone in the crowd gasp. Then I think to myself pull it together Tyler. I get my balance back and walked the rest of the way. Hurray! The crowd goes wild. Everybody applauds and shouts,'Tyler, Tyler, Tyler!'              12:00 A.M. Ah, it's nice to be in bed. It's been a long day. Circus work is hard.

As usual he was sitting at his school desk wishing he could be in a circus just like his best friend Po Sushi. Chang is 14 years old wich is a perfect time to join the circus. But his parents say he should focus less on the circus and more on school.                  'Chang, Chang,' Chang's teacher was calling him as he daydreamed about performing in the circus. Then his teacher took her stick and slamed it on chang's desk. '' WHACK!''  '' Huh, oh sorry mrs. pai pai I didn't know you were speaking. ''Yes yes, thats always your excuse.'' ''what were you daydreaming about this time?'' ''oh nothing really just get back to teaching.'' Mrs. Pai Pai went to the front of  the room and started to speak again. ''In a couple weeks the  CIRQUE DU SOLEIL'S CIRCUS SHOW, QUIDAM, will be visiting Tokyo.'' ''Also, one of our former cassmates will be seen at the circus, Po Sushi!'' 'I will notify your parents and also you need to have good grades in all subjects to go to the circus!'' Bring, Bring the bell rang and that ment school was over.                      After school chag ran home as fast as he could so he could get ready for the field trip to the circus. But, when he got home his parents were standing o the front porch holding a sheet of paper that looked like his REPORT CARD!! Oh no, he probabley had horrible grades! Chang's father Bohoke Hokamaty had his serious face on, which ment chang was introuble.                 ''Chang what is this on your report card!'' Chang looked down at the card and saw a F in geography! '' An F in geography, father please don't punish me, i'll make it up to you!'' 'NO,'' '' thats right chang you can't go on your feild trip unless you have good grades,'' Chang's mother, suru Hokamaty, now spoke. ' I do have goo grades, see in math I got an A+ and in science I got an B+!'' 'In every suject chang,' '' unless you bring up your grads you will not be allowed on the feild trip,'' yes now go get changed into your pj's, dinner is going to be ready soon.''                                                        FOUR WEEKS LATER...                     ''Hay chang, do you want to play tag?' 'sorry can't I have to get ready for the feild trip tomarrow.''   'Hello po, it's chang,' ' chang is that you, it's been so long, how've you been?' 'wonderful, I can't believe i'm going to my first circus! Po what countries have you gone to?' ' There so many I can't name all them, but i've gone to Austrailia, Europe, Africa, and, my favorite one of all the united states!' 'awsome!'                          'WOW!'' 'this place is amazing' 'now class sit down the show is goig to start!' Mrs. Pai Pai shouted over the noise.                     'Welcome everyone, today is where the circus begins.'

She had two kids of her own. All her life, Mrs. Dunmore    wanted to be a circus performer. She had many talents but she had one that she was perfectly good at. She was good at being an acrobat. One day when she was driving to work, she passed the circus that had a sign that said,' NOW HIRIRING' in bold letters. She was thinking about applying for the job.               Mrs. Dunmore worked until 8:00 pm so when she came home, it was already nightime. Her kids were getting ready for bed. Mrs Dunmore ate dinner and after that, she took a shower. Once she was done, she had to talk to Mr. Dunmore about something. She told Mr. Dunmore about how she just quit her job today and how she was going to apply for the job. Mr. Dunmore was mad. When he saw Mrs. Dunmore's big, happy smile, he was happy.                    Today was the day Mrs. Dunmore was going to apply for the job at the circus. She walked in and to her suprise, there were eight poeple in line. She had to wait for almost half an hour until in was her turn. The boss of the circus asked her many questions. After the interveiw, she went home. She was very worried about the letter they are going to send to let you know if you got the job or not. Mrs. Dunmore was tired so she went to her bedroom and took a long nap.                      Once Mrs. Dunmore finished her nap, it was time to pick the kids up fom school. She got in her car and drove over to thier school. When Mrs. Dunmore got to thier house, she got a snack for her kids. She helped them with thier homework if they neded help. Then Mr. Dunmore came home. The family ate dinner and got ready for bed. Mrs. Dunmore got on the bed and fell asleep.                        The next day, the mailman came. Mrs. Dunmore took the letter from the mailbox. It was the letter from the circus. She went back inside to the house. When she read it, she was suprised. She couldn't believe it. She got the job. She had to start tommorow. From that day on, she was a circus performer. Her and her whole entrire family was happy. They were proud of her too.

She goes to school at Forest Park Elementary. She lives with her uncle Bozo, his real name isn't Bozo everybody calls him that because that's his clown name. He has a partner named Marty and he's a monkey! Alexis had always dreamed of being in the circus. Everybody said that she wasn't old enough yet. You have to be twelve. She told them well my birthday is coming up soon maybe she could start practicing. Her uncle told her that they would star practicing next week           It has almost been a week since Alexis's uncle said that they could start practicing. She couldn't stop thinking about it. She was so excited that she was going to practice with her uncle tomorrow that she was bouncing off the walls. It was the next day and she woke up very early. When she woke up she ran to her uncles room and shook him until he woke up. He asked her why she was up so early. She said 'we start practicing today.' Oh  I didn't even remember. Alexis said ' I couldn't forget.' He said that they would go down stairs to eat breakfast first. they had pancakes, eggs, and bacon.         After breakfast they went out side the first thing that they did out side was stretch. Alexis's uncle said that it is very important to stretch before doing anything in the circus. Then they practiced on their juggling but Alexis didn't know how to juggle. Her uncle had to teacher. After about thirty minutes she finally got it. Then they worked on the balance beam, it turns out that Alexis was pretty good with the balance beam. She had very good balance. Then they had to work on the trapeze but Alexis couldn't do it. She kept trying and trying but she couldn't do it. Since it was getting dark they went in side.          She didn't relize that being in the circus was so hard. Her uncle told her that it is very hard work. He said that since we just started practicing you won't be able to be in the circus even if you are twelve. Alexis said that she didn't want to be in the circus anymore she thought it was to hard. Her uncle wouldn't let her quite he said that he had to do the same thing and now he's in the circus so she can do it to.          It has been three years since Alexis started training and now she's in the circus to. She does so many things inthe circus she's a clown, she's a trapieze artist like she always wanted to be, she a;so works with the elephants and tigers and she couldn't be any happier.

It would be fun to see the gymnast doing the tightrope or the swing thing. One thing I'd like to see is the lion taming.           in this paragraph I will tell more about there life like when they get up when they go to sleep. Okay so when they wake up it is 7:00 AM at that time they also go to the pie cart where they eat. 9:00 AM they go to school and since the circus travels around the world you often go to school with people who speak a different language. 3:00 PM school is over when it is over the kids play on the unicycles, tightrope, and juggling. 3:30 is when they practice and do there chores which is usually feed and give new water to the horses.         I will continue what I saying 6:30 it is time for dinner they go back to the pie cart but they don't usually eat because it is almost time for the show. It is 10:30 the is over and they go back to there sleeping area. Now I will tell you about how bad it is at the circus everybody thinks the circus is great but it is not most people of going back home because on tour they don't get to call a place home. Most people in the circus ran away from home so they could do what they wanted.       Now I will tell you about the good things on of the circus the good things are you get to travel the world  and you get a thrill from doing stunts. You also get to have a family of 100 people because they all act like a family. Most people have to join when your young because you can develop your skills young rather than later. It also gives you more experience from the circus. Now you know about the circus so have fun.

We live in New York, well, at least right now. Being a circus performer means lots of time on the road. You don't really have a place to call home. You also have to practice a lot. Falling during a show would be pretty embarrassing... Don't think you get out of school either. I'm 11 and I have to go to school on the road. Dinner's aren't as huge as you'd think, being a circus performer and all. Sleep is a little low too. I don't get to bed until about 12:00.         The circus is fun. You get to ride horses and other animals. If you are a acrobat, you get to hang upside down and swing around. Clowns get to honk horns and be silly all day. Imagine that! You can be a tightrope walker, too. They walk on skinny ropes high in the air, and sometimes perform tricks while doing it. Watching the special circus animals is a blast! They're trained to do lots of cool tricks. So, it's not all bad being a circus performer.         Don't let all this ruin your dream if you want to be a circus performer. Hard work isn't always a bad thing. I love life being in the circus, but it's nice to be home every once and a while. All that being said, Circus's are great, and so is being in them!

I at first was not sure if I wanted to run away but my parents were very mean so I decided to run away.Now I am part of the North American Circus. I am a lion tamer at my circus, but I am not very good yet seeing that I just joined a while ago into the circus. I am working on teaching my lion Pedro how to jump through a hoop! He is not quite ready for it though so we are still working on it.       When I first joined the circus I thought it was going to be easy but boy, was I wrong! In the circus I have to get up at 7:05 every   morning so I can get to the pie car to get the bacon and eggs before everyone else. So, after I finish eating my breakfast I have approximately 15 minutes to get ready for school which is at 8:00. That is just my morning, I will tell you more about my afternoon later but right now I am going to take you to my circus school. Well, first I only really do have American classmates, so I don't really have to worry about having to speak any foreign languages. My teacher Mr. Nussbat is really funny and is a great teacher. He really likes to teach math even though I am not that big of a fan of math. Yet today is a special day and Mr. Nussbat knows it, today is my first day of performing at the circus! So today Mr. Nussbat says that today he is going to lets us all out early so we can practice our acts.       So, after we get out of school early I quickly make my way over to Pedro my lion so we can work on our tricks for tonight's show.   Me and Pedro then work on our hoop trick and Pedro has finally got it, now we are in good shape to perform tonight. So then after that it is about 4:30 so I head over to the pie car to grab some early dinner because I want to  be able to get some food then head over to the circus tent to get all set up for the circus show. It is now 7:00pm and me and Pedro are about to go on, I hope we can wow the crowd! It is now a bit after ten o' clock and I can still hear the crowds cheering from outside the tent in the trailer where I live. The crowds loved me because they didn't believe that A boy my age could be a lion tamer, but did I show them that I could be! So, now i am sitting in my trailer listening to some music from my iPod since it helps me cool down after an intense night.       I hope you liked my story       The End 	NNP , PRP$ NN VBZ NNP PRP VBP DT NN IN NNP NNP WP VBD RB IN NN TO VB DT NNP NNP IN JJ VBD RB JJ IN PRP VBD TO VB RP CC PRP$ NNS VBD RB JJ IN PRP VBD TO VB JJ PRP VBP NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP VBP DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN , CC PRP VBP RB RB JJ RB VBG IN PRP RB VBD DT NN RB IN DT NNP NNP VBP VBG IN NN PRP$ NN NNP WRB TO VB IN DT NN .

The first thing you can see at a circus is animals that are performig. Kike a monkey riding a bike on a piece of string. A elephant entering some indians,               The second thing you can see at a circus is humans performing. Like those humans jumping from rope to rope. And lots and lots of clowns.                The third thing you can see at a circus. Is clowns pranking people. And blowing their horns at the other clowns.I love that part.                 And those are some things you can see at the circus.

Ben said that you guys have talents in you but you just cant find them .So every night he looked up many great circus's then at world's greatestcircustricks.com he found a move that the adience would never forget. then he said that they should do th trick but when he got back there was a problem.       One of each pefomers was sick then he saw someone run out of the ring. the man disiperd then he started to wonder who did this than he saw a botell with the lable of big bang cuircus. he knew that cuircus they allways win the best cuircus year award that's because they cheat.       then he thought about the trick he raced to the place it was it was gone. Ben got so angry that he said we are perfoming for the best cuircus of the year award.so they competed then so many people there but Ben said that you guys will be great so they perfomed and won Ben's father said I can't be with someone more than you Ben so they kept winning over and over then the cuircus's new name was Ben's greatest cuircus.

A person doing a backflip off a tightrope onto a trampoline that was only a foot wide and a foot long. He was doing all of that while jugling five bowling pins on fire. He did the same trick every day since the first time he did it. He even still does it today at this circus. I know all of this because I'm the ringmaster of this circus and the person who did the trick.

I come from a family of Russians, and all of my other family members are already in the circus.I have had to go through alot of training                     I am at my audition, and I am very nervous. I am dancing with my partner, Alonzo, who is the best ofv the best. He taugth me everything  I know, and we have a special bond.                   I am watching the judges carefully to see the expressions on their faces. So far they look good, but anything could happen. As they are watching and writing, I  start to feel nervous. Alonzo conforts me.                       As the judges tell us our scores, I feel as I am to explode. When I hear our scores, I am amazed. We are now a part of the circus. I run to tell my family, who are overwhelmed with the news. I guess dreams really do come true.

You almost never have time see your family or get to visit home.When you get up you have to go to the pie car to eat breakfast lunch and dinner. You have to know how to do alot of stuff to join the circus. You have to know how to juggle at least and you have to be good with animals like horses and elephants and dogs and other circus animals. You have to have serious talent to join the circus. It doesnt matter if your a boy or a girl you can still be in the circus. If your in a circus you know that you will be in a giant tent all through the afternoon and the night.

The second performence was elephants with monkey's riding on the back of them.After the elephants got to the dark blue line the monkey's did a somersalt off of the elephants and landed on thier feet.The third performence was an amaseing juggler!He was pretty darn good.He juggled 2 balls than 3 rings next 4 chiansaws finally 5 flaming batons!               Than the last performence was 4 men on dirt bikes went into this huge metle ball and drove up in it then down in it,and the coolest thing about that is that they didnt fell off once while they were driving like 100 miles per hour!Oh wait I almost forgot.There were 16 bears dancing on balls with cute little tutus on them.                   That day was the most amazing day ever when i was 8 years old!After that long day I ate dinner than whent to bed and dreamed that day all over again.

If your score is good you and your family will have front row seats. You will begiven circus treats and a speacial photo with a circus performer of your choice. Then you will watch the show but first the circus people will have to practice their juggling and other really good tricks.

Bella has school every day she has one room in the trailer that has a computer test and other school things.she likes taking school and learns alot!but she wants to play soccer but they are alwys on the move.she wishes that she could play but they just arnt in one place long enoug.they supposably visit 150 cities a year.but drive 20,oo miles too.       After doing all of her daily things she has to do her chrores and groom the horses.then once she does that she can get ready for the show.they have 10 shows every week.one each week day 2 on wensday and 2 on saterday,and 2 on sunday.thats alot of tiring shows.i wouldnt be able tomake it!you would have tpo have a bunch of energy.       Then once the show is over.they head back home to the trailer.they walk past the offices,concessions,stables,and the other trailers.finally they all lay down!at 12:00 p.m!why would it be so late?       Off this selection ive learned that alot of tings go on in a circus!their is alot of running around to do.so like i said if you want to be in a circus u better start practicing!because if u dont ull be sorry.

Then you have to do so much work and go to school after that  you have to train and do hard work.  last you have to get ready for the show and stay up a little late.     If  I where in the circus I would be a well it is hard to choose I could be a acrobat, clown, tight rope walker or a Circus Juggler. What would you like to be.

He gets up and says,'Today is the show for the circus,' He walks to the pie car to eat breakfast. As he eats breakfast he realizes how far away he is from home and how much work he has. Then he heads towards class. When you are in the circus you have to learn to speak different languages because of  how many places you go.            School is over Tom uses his oppurtunity to take a break. Tom knows that he is not likely get another chance to relax when he's in the circus.He starts to practice his stunts for the show. This his last time he gets to practice before the show.He has to wlak the tightrope and dive into deep water. This is a though stunt to achieve.            Tom sits down to eat dinner he doesnt eat much though because he has to peform tonight. He does a final practice of his stunt. He is very nervous that he will fail. The show starts. Tom is very nervous now. He knows his stunt is coming up and if he fails it could ruin his career.        Tom is up. He climbs up the ladder and starts walking on the tightrope. He is trying his best not to lose his balance. He nervously steps ont to the other platform. Tom suddenly is reliefed. He dives into the water. He tries to make suspense so he waits in the water a while. Then he comes up. The crowd starts cheering. This was certainly a show to remember.

You have to practice some new acts every month. I think it is fun too, but I do a lot of exercise every once in a while. Last week I went to Italy to perform. I had lots of fun there because before the show I went to many gift shops and bought stuff.                       You also need to wake up early to eat breakfast. I eat breakfast at eight in the morning.  At nine I get ready to change into my normal clothes, at nine thirty I go to school. School is as fun as being in the circus. I like reading, writing, and math, but my favorite part is going to resses. Then at ten through three I prepare for the next show. Next, at three through seven I prepare dinner. And Finally it is show time at eight.                    Today in my show I did a lot of flips, but my favorite thing to do is make funny jokes at the end of the show. My family's favorite thing to do is play with the wild crowd. They like to give out free stuff like t-shirts, toys, and small glow sticks.                     This was the best show I have ever done in my whole carrer. If you were in the circus I bet you would love it here. I liked sharing my story with you guys!

Like you need to go to school if you are a kid and you need to go to work if you are an adult. You also have to have a talent that you are very good at and that you will practice every day.        If you want to be a tightrope walker you need to practice every day. Tightrope walkers have to be consentrated the whole time. So if you want to be a tightrope walker you have to be very consentreated and not be distracted easily.        If you want to be a circus clown you don't really need to pracctice. All you need to do is be funny. You have to natrully funny and dress incorectlly. You also need to make people laugh easily.

Personly I don't think I got what it takes to be an acrobat.  It might involve hights, and I am afraid of hieghts.  Although gymnastics (witch I have been in) on the other hand, being an acrobat could be 6 times as hard.                                                          Joining the Circus (Opinion)                                                                         It seems like a buisy day  for a circus performer.  The first day I might be alittle excited, but as the days pass, it will get a little tiring.  One hundred and fifty cities is a lot of cities to do.  If it was 10 cities then I would do it.  it will be to much to memorize.                People will expect to see everything done right.  Doing everything wrong is easy, but doing everything right is a chalange.  but if involve being goofy, I'm not in.  Some people don't like clowns.  there is a pie car but it's for actors to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  It can cause injery.  Like someone fell of a tightrope and broke something in there body and canceled.

I went to the curcuis once and the were doing a lot of cool things like walking on a tite rope and they dress really funny to I am sure they practice practice practice and takes a lot of concentration to preform all of that stuff and not mess up on any of it if someone asked me if I wanted to go in a curcuis I would say NO!!! because i could not do any of that stuff I like going the curcuis and seeing the amazing tricks they do i wonder how long the curcuis has been around? And they get there animals well tamed.               They have to go every where in the curcuis in one year they go to 150 cities they travel 20,000 miles in seven mounths and school is on the road where ever the curcuis they have elephants, monkey, lions, tigers and snakes sometimes at the curcuis they have A.T.V.s and dirt bikes there doing tricks and jumping them some of the preformers evev do magic tricks it seems like a hard life for all of the preformers.

I did not want to do this, but now this is my life. I was born January 28, 2002 in La  Circusa, the most popular circus in Paris. My parents, Lucy and Francessco,are trapeze artists, my big brother, Max, is a tightrope walker and was in high school. I am an acrobat performer and am in middle school 6th grade.         When I was 4 years old all kinds of dancing classes at the school built in the circus. Ballet, Jazz, Tap Dancing, The Salsa and Break Dancing . Then when I was 7 years old I became an acrobat. At first I thought all the training and late night shows was all fun. But then every night I seemed to get more and more tired  and stressed, then along with that I had to go to school and wake up at 7:00 a.m. in the morning.           I don't know why but I could never go to sleep. Then one night I heard the ring master yelling and  animals roaring and whimpering. The ring master would never do that I thought, so my brain told me it was all just a dream. So I settled down in my small bed and slowly drifted to sleep.             'Bellina', called my mother. 'Coming', I called. I checked my clock, 6:05 a.m.!! 'Mom, why so early', I shout. Your school starts early today because you have an extra hour of acrobat classes', my mom shouts back.Uhhhhhhhhh, I think.               'I.....am.......so......so..............tired'!!, I say. Sulking into bed, I am soooooooooooooooooo tired. But then I perk up, once again I hear the ring master shouting and animals roaring and whimpering. Then I think the animals had been very scared when the ring master came close to them, know that you think of it, the ring master had been glaring at the animals.             I had to see what was going on. I slippedd out of bed without making a noise and look at the tents, until I see a tent with animals and the ring master in it. I peek in, oh my gosh. He was trying to teach them tricks, but then one did something wrong and he whipped them!!            I had to report him, it was mean to sabotage animals. I had to run and tell my parents.           The next morning the ring master was in chains and would remain that way. 'We are so proud of you', my family says.

Everything was OK until he slipped and fell 4 stories to the floor and then he hits the floor. There is a perfectly logical explanation for what just happened.          This morning Steve didn't want to eat breakfast. After that he wasn't paying attention in class because he was hungry, and in class they where teaching tight rope walking. When school was over he didn't practice his tight rope walking. He was very hungry since he didn't eat breakfast. He started eating allot. Right before the show he didn't practice like everyone else.when it was his turn he was so nerves he slipped and fell. When he was in the hospital he wished he would have practiced more.

Glenn asked his parents if he could join the circus, and they  loved the idea, because he was in gymnastics, had the right body type, and had all the right skills. When he joinef=d the circus the realized that it wouldn't be all fun and clowning around. It was hard work. When he wakes up at 7:00 he gets dressed, and goes to the pie car for breakfast while the crews are setting up tents lights and music for tonight's show.          Then later at 9:00 is time for school. They have a one-room schoolhouse which travels with them. They did a lot of traveling as a circus. It is just like any school with computers, tests, and report cards. There are circus performers from all over the world, so many classmates speak French, Russian, and Italian.          At 3:00, school is over so it is time for a quick break. The clowns let you play on their unicycles, and juggle. He likes to play with his tiny dog, Seymour. Glenn really wanted to join a soccer team, but they were never in one place enough.          At 3:30, he had to do chores and practice for the show tonight. He took care of the horses for the horseback acts. He was working on leaping of a trampoline onto a horse's back. Other kids were working on juggling or acrobatics. His neighbor was walking baby leopards on a leash. The trainers were working with all different kinds of animals.          At 6:30, his family at dinner at the pie car. They try not to eat much becausetheir show is tonight. They do 10 shows a week: one each Wednesday, plus a manitee on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.          At 10:30, the show is over and he is wiped out. Walking back to his trailer, he passes the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. Two days from now they will be in another town.          When it is 12:00, he is in bed. He is thinking about the end of the touring season. It will be nice for him to go home in Florida. When he grows up he still wants to be a circus performer. The circus is fun, but it is a busy and tough life.

Have you ever thought about playing a sport well if you are in the circius you can't because you do not stay in the some place so long.You would have to do alot of chores if you joined the circius like feed, water, and groom the horses so we can use them for our horses back riding acts.If you want to join the circius you have to put your heart into it and be certain that's what you want to do. There are some good parts in joining the circius like you get to travel the world and see now things and you will have fun performing and when you look in the audience's face they will cheer and scream. Now have you rethinked your plan or not.

I know someone who works at one. My best friend Alexis is an acrobat at the Big Blue circus. She has lots of work to do, but she has fun doing it. One summer day she told me every single thing she dose!              First she gets up at 6:46 A.M. every morning. She gets her clothes on and goes to the Pie Car to eat a scrumptious breakfast, if she is not all the way awake, sometimes her mom throws a pie in her face to wake her up! Then she goes to training in the Train to be a better acrobat car. Alexis and her partner Joshua swing from trapezes and jump into each others arms. At approximately 12:13 P.M., she hurries back to the pie car to eat a yummy lunch, it is usually a stake burger and seasoned french fries with a sweat tea on the side. and then she does her chores. She has to groom the horses, dress the monkeys and elephants, practice her part of the show, and get the stage ready. And finally at about 4:35 P.M. the show will go on! It starts with the tamer and lions, followed by the courageous motor cycle drivers, and then the hilarious clowns, then the magical musician, and last but not least the amazing acrobats, Alexis and Joshua! After the show the circus has games and they let you ride ponies, and elephants, and they even let you play with the amazingly bizarre monkeys! When everything is done, she goes to her trailer, which she shares with her mom, brother's, and sister, and gets ready for bed. It is 11:59 P.M. when she gets in bed and starts to fall asleep. The next day she does the same thing over again, whenever she has time she writes me a letter. Most of the letters just say how she has been doing, when she will be in town next, and she asks how I'm doing. I can't wait to see her next week, I think I want to be an acrobat someday, too.                I've been thinking and I think I'm going to join the circus. Do you think that is a good idea? I think it sounds pretty fun! Maybe one day Alexis and I can perform together, that would be fun. I'll have to think a little bit longer. 	NNP PRP RB VBN TO DT NN .

It was May 5, 2000 the day of the circus act. My amazing performers and I are practicing our rutines and stunts. The show is about to start, but there was noboby there so they looked and they looked for there fans.                So, the performers looked at the flyers. The bus driver had read the flyer wrong and they where in New Jersey instead of New York. However, they where to late so they just started to head back to New York.              That next day thay they got to New York and said there sorries and wanted to make it up to the New Yorkers, so they put on the best show they possibly could they were swinging, dancing, flipping, hopping and all and the people were happy and that was a circus day.

My dad, mom, sister, and I scrambled into the car. I was so excited That it felt like i was going to fly out of my seat.       When we finally got there, it was amazing. I was able to see performers practicing amazing stunts. There were clown-like people going down the isle interacting with the crowd. And then it all began.       It was so amazing seeing people flying through the air, walking on tine wire, and riding a horse trough a ring of fire. I was so sad when it ended, because I didn't want to go back to my boring house, but I had too. I hope I can go to the circus again. 	NNS POS , PRP NNP PRP VBD IN TO VB TO PRP$ JJ NN NN . . .

Then my favorite animal came out.horses.I could instantly tell what breed they were.They were so pretty and they moved so gracfully.Then they came out with tigers.I think the guy was brave to go into the enclosed area with them. Thout they were going to hurt him but they didn't and they did some pretty amazing tricks.       I had an amazing time at they circus and It was so fun. I hope other people can expirence this work of art.

My sister then came in to my room and told me that she was going to drivers ed that day and couldn't come to my Ariel practice.That made me even more unhappy.Quickly I through on my dance shoes and sprinted out the door.          As we were driving I told mom how hard it was going to be for me to be away from her, dad, my sister and my friends for what seemed like forever. Really though it was only a couple of weeks while I was in Las Vegas preforming in Cirque Du Soleil. I was so exited, it was going to be the best weeks of my life. But I was also scared. I knew that it would be really, really hard to go all the way. What if I mess up. I said silently to myself.           Finally, we were at the dance and Ariel studio. When I walk in I see all of the amazing people on the tight ropes and people holding themselves up on little ribbons, like scarfs,one hundred feet up. 'That's going to be you.' mom said as she was looking above to see all of the people that do Ariel. 'I know' I said with a scared face. She told me not to worry and not to be scared. But how could I not worry, i mean I don't have a spotter in the show and I'm still learning. She kissed my forehead, and my coach came out to come and get me. It was time,time to train. We started with lots of stretching. Leg up and down. Left leg splits now right leg splits, lots of middle splits and a ton of conditioning. 'Climb that rope girl, faster faster.' came my coach's voice. So faster I went. I was at the top, i rang the bell and slowly, to make sure I didn't tear up my hands, came down. Next it was time for the real work. I harnessed up and in the air I went.       I flipped and there were definitely a few flops. But over all practice was all right. When I got done I said goodbye to mom and now I was in the hands of my coach. For th next few days I trained long hours. Now it was time to go. we got on th bus and away we went to Las Vegas. Today was the day. My parents were coming to see me preform and so were a whole bunch of my friends. I was nervous, but I knew that I could do it.     It was time the audience was getting seated. They were announcing that the show was to begin. up up up I climbed, then the music started. It was amazing I was going crazy flips and everything was going so well until, My best friend Alisha's harness broke. She was doing the kind of move here you are required to wear a harness. In a split second, she fell to the ground, the hard stage. There was a massive and ear splitting scream that came from her.Quickly, I descended from my ribbons. She was lying there, for what seemed like forever until someone got to her. She was screaming. I asked her what hurt but she wouldn't say. I helped her sit up and finally, she was taken to a hospital.I had to go with her so did her parents. When we got to the hospital, they took lots of e-rays of her entire body until they were positive at what was broken. She had a fracture in her lower back, a broken ankle, and a sprained wrist. the doctors said that she was lucky to get away with only those injuries. She was finally awake, but she woke only to find herself in pain and we had to tell her that she could never do Ariel again.       So now you can see that there are many tragedies in this beautiful sport, but it is amazing and should be kept alive forever. When I got home I told my mom that now I had a reason to be scared but I will still keep dreaming. Soon i joined the Cirque du Soleil. I have never looked back. And guess who will be joining me my next show, Alisha! She had lots of surgeries and a ton of physical therapy, but now she's back, and better than ever. 	JJ JJ NN NN VB JJ .

I was really excited, I couldn't wait to see the different animals, and clowns. When I got there, there was a problem. The circus lost the main elephant. It had been 15 minites ago when the show was supposed to start and they still couldn't find the missing elephant!                                                                                                                                                                                                  They later asked us if we could look for it. I soon got out of my seat and started searching.I looked around the snack bar, but didn't find it. Then I found a door that had a sign on it that said Keep Out. I went inside, there I saw an elephant, with an engured leg. I soon got the staff, and tried not to panic.When the staff came in they took the elphant and put it into an animal hospital. The veternarians were able to heal it's leg. The trainer said I may have saved it , and gave me backstage passes. I was real glad I saved the elaphant,Maggy. That was my crazy adventure to the circus.

I am in one of the best circus groups.  I travel every day.  I am a juggler and tonight I will be juggling bricks while on a unicycle.      My family has been practicing just for this day.  It took us one month to get here.  Our performens is two hours long.  My uncle Brown the clown takes up most of the time.  Since I am the youngest I only have one act.        My parents get very nervous.  I turn my nervousness into happiness.  If you get too nervous you will mess up and you will mess up the show.  If you get nervous easily take deep breaths.       The most important thing is confidence.  You need to beleive in yourself.  If you beleive in yourself you can accomplish anything.  If you say you can't do it then you won't be able to.

Like having to practice all the time.  Having to do shows all the time.  Having to travel all the time.  Not get to play with your friends and you have to travel alot from city to city.  If you fall dering a show  you feel like you roind the show. That is some of the problems with the circus.         They're some good things about the circus.  Like going all over the world and to city to city but it is boring when you have to sit in the car for ever.  A nuther good thing is that you are makin a bunch of kids happy.  You get to ride animals like elephents and hourses and all sorts of stuff.  That is some of the good things about the circus.

That is my life in the circus.

When I was 8 I was a juggler.I loved it because I always got to do a famous trick at the end , throw the ball in back of me and catch it in my pocket.I loved it so much I did that till I was 11.Then I got bored of it.       When I turned 12 I went to doing acrobating it was hard but my dad said I would do good on my porformance.When it started so far I was doing good,but when I was doing the big flip I fell.So thats when I didnt want to do acrobating anymore.       When I was 13 I didnt do any thing because you know teenage years.So all I did was go to school and go home,text and watch T.V. I did this unill I turned 15.       When was 15 and a half I went back to acrobating because my mother change my mind she said Annie you secseeded in every thing but acrobating so do you want to try to do it again?so thats what changed my mind.When the porformace started I was doing good so far then the big flip came and I landed I couldent belive it I did it.       I did acrobating till I was 23 then I fell in love with a colledge teacher Frank Willson.When we married I queit being a circus person and became a elementry teacher.I noticed that life was pretty easier.       When I had a son,Jason Willson, we always was went  to the circus every saturday.Then he told me that he wanted to be a circus person I told him, trust me its not that easy.

The Banzini Bros. is an amazing circus to watch, but not so fun for a ten year old little girl to preform every three days on summer vacation. It is very difficult to tame lions to do tricks that make the crowd go wild. I go on tours to preform all the time with my aunt and uncle because they say I have 'talent' for teaching their lions to do tricks. They call me, 'their big cat whisperer'.               The first day is always the most fun. I get to play with the lions that smother you with their long, shiny, and golden manes. I have to keep a journal about the lions writing down, Day one: Lions happy, brushed, and fed.                      After playing with the lions, I go to see what my uncle is doing. Since he is the director, he is practicing what to say and what order to say them in. Watching him talk to himself is boring, I thought so I went to see what my was doing.               My aunt walks the tightrope so it is a lot of fun to watch her. She teaches me a lot about tightropes and how she can balance so well. She says the key is concentration, watch something that is moving still, and you know it will not move. ' DO NOT look below the tightrope. If you do, you will be afraid at the height you are at, and fall.' she tells me.              It is ten o'clock, I usually go to bed at midnight, but my uncle says I have to get some more sleep than usual because I have to preform tomorrow. I am pretty scared because what if I mess up? What if the lions attack me? Well, I guess I will figure out tomorrow.             ''Wake up sleepyhead!'', says my uncle and aunt. ''Todays the Big Top day!'', they coo. They try to make Big Top day sound like a joke. Got to go see the lions and feed them. ''Goodbye, got to feed the big cats!'', I say to them.             The lions look so happy to see me! They growled at me in a playful manner and played with my tangled hair. ''Show is in thirty minutes, feed them, brush your hair, and  get on your costume!, my uncle yells. ''OK.'', I shout back.              UH-OH! Time for the circus! I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach. As I go backstage, I hear,  ''Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages! Welcome to the Banzini Bros. circus!!!!'' My uncle sounds happy this morning to preform. ''O-o-okay,'' I stutter to myself, I preform after my aunt.''             It's my turn. The lions are ready for me out in the areana. I just need to remember what order I practiced in. 'Introducing.... The lion tamer!''

Ok well what I like about the  Circus is the Acrobats because what they have to do is they have to practice every night before the concert so they will be really good during their performance.I am going to write a story abot the Acrobats!       Once apon a time there was a little girl named Lilly. She lives in Dallas, Texas with her mom. One day Lilly went to school, she walked in and saw a poster that said 'Dallas Circus is here!' she was so excited because she wants to be in a circus.Under that it said 'Help Wanted' so instead of going home after school Lilly went to the place were the circus needed help.       Once Lilly got there there was a lady at a desk and said 'How may i help you?'Lilly said 'I'm here to help.' th lady gave Lilly the form for the application. Lilly filled it out and gave it to her.The lady said nicely' Ok Lilly we'll give you a call to let you now if your in the circus.' Lilly said 'Ok have a nice day,' the lady said' You to.' Lilly left and when she got home her mom said 'Where have you been younge lady?''I may have a job!' Lilly said excitedly. 'Well what kind of job?'her mom said a little mad. 'At a circus.'lilly said.Her mom said ' Ok is somebody going to be calling here for you?' Lilly said' Yes mother.' The next day after Lilly got home from school, her mom said sadly ' Lilly come here.' Mom why are you crying?' Lilly said. Her mom said ' your dad is dead.' Lilly started crying too. Her mom held her until they stopped crying and said ' Lilly I have good news!' Lilly said 'What mom?' Her mom said ' You made the circus!' Lilly was so excited. On Lillys first day of practice she got to the building where they had to pratice Lilly got inside and thought wow theres all different kinds of things here. Then Lillys first show came and her mom and friends were in the audience after the show every body clapped and cheered. Her mom bought her flowers and said ' These are from daddy and he wanted me to give these angel wings to you before he died.' Lilly said ' Thank you mom and dad I love you.' after that Lilly had the best 8 years of her life with her mom and dad before he died. Lilly grew up and had a family just like her own family.

We travel  20,000 miles in seven months each year visiting 150 cities. we all work tell sunup to sundown. My typical day for me7:00 ami wake up, I get dressed, and go to the pie car for pankcakes and bacon. the crews are setting up tents,lights, and music fir tonight's show. 9:00 A.M. School time. our one room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school, ours has computer, tests, and repoort cards. Because the circus performers are from all over  the world many of my classmates speak other languages: French, Russian, and Italian, like my family. As we travel around the  country, our geograph lessons come alive.                           3:00 P.M. School,s over time for a play with their a quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I also play with my tiny dog, Noodle; our trailer is too small for a lage pet. I'd like to join a soccer team, but we're never in one place long enough.                           3:30 P.M. Chores and practice. I feed,water,groom, the horses we use in our houseback acts. Today, my dad practices   somersaultting off a running horse. I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration. Other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants,lions,and chimpanzees.                                                                                                                                                              10:30 P.M.The show  is over. i'm wiped  out. walking back to our trailer, we pass the circus offices,concession stands, stables,and trailers. Two days from now, we'll all set up in another town.                                             12:00 A.M. In bad. I'm thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be a nice to go back to our real home in Florida. When I  grow up, will Istill be a circus perfomer like my parents? Who knows? The ciecus is fun, but it's  a busy and tough life.

I ask my parent what it was like but they didn't tell me very much about it.     So the next day at school I went to the library and checked out some books about the circus. The book told about clowns, acrobats, and tightrope walkers it all looked really cool.     When the day of the circus finally came I was really excited. I had even started thinking about joining the circus. The circus was really cool I saw clowns, acrobats, tightrope walkers, elephants, and even lion trainers.      When it was over I didn't  want to leave but my parents told me we would go to a circus again sometime. While we were walking out one of the performers asked me if I would like to join the circus. I told him yes but when I came the first day I knew that I wasn't going to like being in a circus. The reasons I wouldn't like it is the fact that I wouldn't get to see my friends or family very much and I would get to rest very much and I would have travel a lot so I wouldn't have a real house to live in.    I didn't end up joining the circus but they told me that since I tried to join they would get me free tickets to all their shows that was awesome.     Now I still go to the circus and watch them perform and I still get free tickets but I still haven't joined. But last summer was great for me because I found something I like to do. And if I wouldn't have gone to the circus I never would have found out that I liked to go to the circus and I never would have got to try something new. That's why last summer was one of the best summers I have ever had.

When you are in the circus you have to get up early and eat breakfast after you eat breakfast you have to set every thing up then you have to practice for the show.           The circus is a fun thing to do you just have to have good balance and be in the right shape. You have to be used to heights if  you want to ride the unicycle so the tight rope you have to have really good balance to.               You can also be the juggler but you have to be really good at juggling. you can even juggle on the tight rope  while you ride the uni cycle. That's just few of the things you can do in the circus.                                     	DT NNP .

I was watching a movie called Dumbo. At the end I decided 'I want to work with elephants at the circus.' I had made up my mind. Even when my friends said I could not make it, I never lost my dream. When i was 11 I started gymnastics, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.I did gymnastics for 6 more years. When I was 17 I got chosen to go to circus school. At the age 19 I was in the circus. I am now 24 and still in the circus,and guess what I do i train and work with elephants. A dream I never lost.

'Please welcome our professional trapeze artists, Angelique Banquet and Cecile Dockers!' announced the announcer. Just as I finished praying that I wouldn't fall off the tightrope, the curtains opened with an approving applause. Angelique and I cartwheeled and flipped to the base of the ladder and proceeded  to mount it. 'We can do this, we can do this, we can do this......' I muttered to both reassure and encourage us. When I reached the top, I mounted the unicycle that I would be riding across the 24-foot long tightrope in just a few seconds. This is my chance. Now or never. All my hard work for months and months and months will be useless if I don't make it, I thought. I started across the tightrope. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. When I reached the end, I dismounted the unicycle and proceeded to take a bow. Now Angelique was up! She did not ride the unicycle, but she did walk on her hands. She reached the end, took a final bow, and the curtains closed.                  As I was laying in bed thinking about my next act, I heard Angelique humming in her sleep. It was such a soft, gentle song that I let it gently rock me to sleep.                  '6:00!,' cried Clooney the loony clown, 'Heading to the         Pie Car in 15 minutes!'Pancakes! Bacon! Eggs! I thought excitedly. After a breakfast of bacon and eggs, ( it was a bummer hat they ran out of pancakes!) it was trapeze time. I headed towards the arena where we practiced and then realized something. Today was the matinee! I checked my watch. 11:55!!!!!!! Oh No! I sprinted to the arena. 'Good thing that you got here just in time! We're on in 5 seconds!' said Angelique.                  After a perfect performance, I took one final bow. I love circus life, I thought.

I was sweting like no tomerow. I was about to die!!!!                 Then I saw a curcus. It was very colorful. I went in looking for a phone but they did not have one. So I worked there as a clown.

As I wait for my turn to perform in the morning show I watch acrobats, clowns, and jugglers all dominate the stage, every moment that passes I get more and more nervous.  Finally, my turn.  'You can do it Emma!'  My dad calls from below as I step onstage.  I jump up with the help of  a clown onto a white stallion.  As I stand on the bareback horse a small, pink feather detaches itself and floats down from my skirt and around the horse's head.  Spooked by the sudden surprise that lands on his nose, the stallion rears sending me flying!  My eyes wide I fall into the clown's arms.            The crowd cheers as I stumble offstage thinking it was all an act, but no, it wasn't.  Later at the afternoon show I tremble. I don't want to take that fall again!  I walk out onstage breathing heavily, about to mount I suddenly can't move.  I run offstage as fast as I can.  As soon as I exit my dad walks up to me, 'Emma what happened?'  'Dad I just can't do it',  I say with a shrug,'I am not going to mess up again.'  He looks at me and says in a lower tone, 'Emma you can't give up your dream because of a little mess up!  Look all  performers have their ups and downs but you can't back down.'   I smile, maybe I should.  'Alright lets do this!'            I waltz onto the stage, mount the stallion and grin to the world.  Consentrate, I tell myself, I can do this.  As my horse walks parallel with Alisha's we both do a flip ending up on opposite horses.  I do a bridge as the person who guides the horse slows to a stop and I do a kickover off.  I pump my arm in the air. I, Emma, am triumphant.

I go get breakfast at the waffle cart and eat. Afterwards I go to school. At 3:00 we get out and I go back to my home the wide world  circus.               I'm an acrobat, I ride horses swing, on the trapeze, and do high-wire.At 3:45 I do my chores and practice for tonight's show. the crowd is big as usual and as usual the lion tamer a.k.a my dad tames the lion then the the clowns a.k.a my twin big brothers get each other with water then the acrobats go and do our tricks.                After the show we clean up and go to bed. The next day we pack up and head for the next town.We move a lot so i never get to have many friends unless they join the circus.                 We have three shows a week three weeks of the month. we travel all over the world so I get to see all kinds of places. there are lots of ups and  downs to circus life.         	NNP IN .

Would they think my performance was good enough for their team of acrobats? Probably not, I thought. Was all just a dream? Of course not! Alex is here, you can feel your heart pounding, and the cut you got on the rock yesterday is still there! True, I told myself. No point trying to convince myself this is 'only a dream'.             Then, just as soon I stopped arguing with myself, a man with a long beard called out stiffly 'Ledwin, Jeff!'             I stepped forward. Would I make the acrobatics team? I looked at the jury. The jury consisted of 3 people; the man with the long beard who called out the names, a young man around the age of 21, (and to my own personal horror) Mr. Rudel Yuo Lungson.             I panicked. If I didn't make the team this time, someone else would take my spot and my parents would go bankrupt! What should I do? I thought. I've got to do something! And then I realized how long I had been just standing there.             'HURRY UP!' roared Mr. Lungson. 'I want to give you 2 poi--I mean see your performance!'             Then something slid into place inside my brain. Mr. Lungson is the one that robbed my parents! He's trying to make us go bankrupt! Before I knew it, I was lunging toward Mr. Lungson. He gaped at me (as was everyone else was) for only a few seconds before I had collided with him. His head had collided with the hard dirt floor. Then a horrible RIP! was heard.             The metal pole was crashing down on Mr. Lungson! I lunged once again, but this time not toward Mr. Lungson, but toward the metal pole. I jumped up, grabbed hold of the pole, and brought the pole down as I landed square on my feet. 'RUN!' I commanded Mr. Lungson as I strained to hold up the heavy metal pole.             CRRACK! I let out a shrill scream. My arm was searing with pain. It felt like someone had lit my arm on fire!             'He broke his arm!' yelled the young man. 'Call an ambulance!'             The last thing I remember is Mr. Lungson sneering as he stepped on my broken arm. I called his name again and again until he ran out of sight with the young man chasing after him in the summer air. Then I felt a sharp blow to my head.                 I then woke up again in a hospital room. 'You're safe,' said a doctor. ' He's been arrested for causing serious injury and inflicting serious pain consciously.' That had lifted my spirits. Then, without warning, my insides seemed to be celebrating. And then I knew that I had done the right thing be saving even my enemy's life.                                                                 The End! 	JJ , NNP .

Next, she has to feed and water the horses and practice. After that, they eat dinner.They do 10 shows a week. After the show is over she goes to bed.   Another circus performer says that you just can't run away to be a circus performer their are specific requirements like body type and a determination. You have to have certain talents to join the circus. their is an upside to being with a circus like you get to have fun and see new places. You can go to Japan or France. You get to meet new people.   There's also a downside. you don't get to see your family. You have to work long hours and weekends too. You don't get to talk to your family on tour.

A man floating in air, one on a lion's back. He heard the ring master call for a volunteer to help him with the next part of the act. Brady stood up and waved his hand in the air frantically, he had no idea what he was in for. The ring master walked right up to him and said, 'Son, you ready for the time of your life?'      He lead Brady down the steps and on to the stage. Brady saw a cloth looking thing fall from the ceiling. The ring master said 'Grab hold for a wild ride.' with a gleam in his eyes. Brady looked at the ring master and grabbed hold of the cloth. The ring master secured him in place and started swinging the cloth.       Brady was lifted out of the air and was twirling around. He remembered watching this the last time he came. As he was twirling around it felt like he was flying, the wind rushing at him it felt so good on his face. Soon it was over. As he returned to his seat he made a promise to himself, that he would be in the circus.     He convinced his mom to let him join just when he turned 11. He didnt know what to do but he got himself in a very famous circus. They tested him on many things and decided that he woiuld be a lion tamer. Nothing like it, a kid who tames lions. It would make millions.     As he came close to the first beast Brady trembled with fear.He had a whip and a chair in a fancy costume.The lion bared his teeth and lunged. He tried his best to look brave and lashed out with the whip. The lion whimpered and recoiled in fear. Brady went straight up to it and stroked its mane.     Brady went to the pie car to get some food and saw an old man drinking prune juice. He didn't understand why the old man was there. When Brady went over to the man it seem he allready new what was happening. He stood up and said 'I'm here because I'm the old lion tamer, when they run out of lion tamers I take their place, I'm very good with lions.'     He sat Brady down and they started talking all about lion taming and what that man did before he was a lion tamer. The old man shared many stories with Brady and Brady liked them all.     As he listened he realized that this man had been with lions his whole life and he never wanted to stop. Brady said thank you for the stories and raced off to find the ring master. When he finally found him he told him about the old man and his plan, the ring master loved it. So when Brady's mom came to see the show, she didnt just see Brady, she saw Brady and the old man side by side doing what they loved. That night, as Brady lay in bed, he dreamed about being an old man and telling a new child all the stories of his past.

For example they shoot water at you pull pranks and sometimes even make balloons for you.Also there is the circus tightrope, what they do is the there's a rope 70ft  from the ground and they have to walk on it all the way across with out falling but if they do fall there's a giant net to save them.             When i went to a circus there were a lot different act then usual like for example these big people and elephant  went on these huge balls and try to balance themselves on it without falling. One person fell and broke his arm.then they brought tigers. They were so cool they had white, brown, and light brown. They  jumped through hoops then they lit the hoop on fire and the biggest tiger jumped through it. The crowd went crazy but that was a bad idea  the tiger got scared  and it took the a lot of time to put it in the cage.         Then there was a guy he went on two horses backs and rode them and he didn't even fall. Also there was the acrobats the went hundred feet high  on a rope doing back flips, front flips,and etc. So if you want to be part of a circus crew think about the effects.

I am Bill the Amazing and I work in Atlanta's Great Traveling Circus.  I will tell you of a turn of events at the circus.  It was a clear morning in Atlanta. Everything went as normal and everyone was getting ready for the big show that night.  Some people that were getting ready were Jill the Trapeze artist, Henry the lion tamer and Dominic the Man that can walk on Fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Everything went as planned that day until the show.  All the performers did a great job, Henry surprised the audience by doing tricks with the snow leopard instead of his famous lion taming act, Jill did a great job, and Dominic was pure amazing.  Everything was great until my act, the grand finale.  This night I was going to do truly amazing, something that had never been done before.  Anyways, while the stage crew got the stage ready for my act but the snow leopard acted up and it broke Jill's arm.  She had to be transported to the hospital and everyone wanted to be with her because we are like family but the director said that the show must go on.  They also had to get the snow leopard out of the building in case it acted up again and seriously injured someone.                   Everyone was waiting for my act, so I toughed out the longing sensation to go to the hospital and I came out to perform my act.  Everyone cheered so loud when I came out it was such a great feeling.  I started to perform my act when, and very surprisingly a giant elephant came from supposedly the neighboring traveling circus that was also in town it came right through the opening in the tent and was raging like a bull.  Instantly I reacted.  My circus training really paid off, I jumped out of the way just in time before the elephant came and would've killed me.  Next, Dominic came out and tried to distract the elephant before it went running into the crowd but even with all his efforts it could not be stopped.  Then I jumped into action and jumped right onto the top of the elephant.  It reared up and I almost fell off but I managed to stay on and grab the reigns that were on the elephant I pulled them as hard as I could and the elephant instantly stopped and was looking very puzzled.  At that moment everything went silent and the chaos stopped.                  Then, the elephant just collapsed and the whole crowd gawked at the sight of the beast lying on the ground.  Meanwhile, I had to get off of the elephant which was quite a tricky task.  Right when I got off we could hear the sirens blaring.  Then the animal control came and god bless them.  We all wanted the elephant out of the tent and they did a tremendous job of that.  Soon, Jill heard of this news and the staff at the hospital let her come and see us.  She was so glad that none of us were seriously injured   and everyone else was too.                  Soon enough everything was back to normal and luckily no one was hurt during the elephant incident.  They finally let me do my awesome act.  I swallowed 50 swords and 1 lead ball.  I got such a big applause from the audience you wouldn't even believe it and after that night no more incidents occured at Atlanta's Great Traveling Circus.

As a trapeze artist you swing around on something that is kind of like a monkey bar that moves back and forth. When you jump off a bar, you can do flips in the air before grabbing on to another one.

This is what me my family and my friends and their family do on circus days:                          We wake up at 7:00 to get ready and eat pancakes, and bacon, then we set up the circus things, and if we are not done with that then we keep on doing that on the next day in till we are done. When we are done then we will make the posters and every one is invited but they have to sign piece of paper and put how many people is going.  While we are waiting we are going to practice our old circus moves and magic tricks.We also rent animals to do tricks ,and we use the old ones, but if they died then we just rent a new animal to replace that one. When we are done then we will count how many people are coming and we will put the chairs in a row and put their and names on the chair.                                        When the circus is starting I will be the host and the other people will be the performers. It is from 7:00 to 12:00 so it is 5 hours, we are also selling popcorn, peanuts, and soda. So their clowns juggling and their are bears riding a bike, and magic people disappearing, their are also other circus stuff that are funny and dangerous.That is what my circus life is like.

Acrobats flipped and twirled and trampeze artist flew sky high from rope to rope.  What caught the attention of the audience was their work ethic and how much fun the performers seemed to have, but the real show stopper was a 15 year old girl acrobat named Elizabeth, who everyone could tell hed that spark and it factor, here is how her journey started.           Elizabeth was 14 years old when she joined the circus.  Before she joined she practiced 24/7 to be in the circus everday for two years.  When Elizabeth was 4 she got her side and front arieal, 7 back tuck, 8 needle, 9 became a competitive dancer, and at the age of eleven could do 58 turns.  When Elizabeth was 12 she said ' I love dance and want to inspire dancers around the world and I want to be in the circus'.            Elizabeth tried out to be an acrobat at 14, 178 other girls wanted that only spot too, but the spot was handed to Elizabeth because of  her flexibility and desire.             Elizabeth started training two weeks after she got the spot.  She loved working hard everday, doing so many shows, and traveling the world.  The one thing Elizabeth didn't like about being in the circus was that she had to leave her friends and family.  Elizabeth's favorite place to perform was Idaho because her family would come and support her.             Even though Elizabeth was always working she still got an education.  Today Elizabeth is 19 years old, really smart, and is now in Cirque Du Soleil.  Whenever she thinks of performing she says outloud 'Fun, fun, totally fun.'

I know how hard they do their balances and concetation when they do their acts. I know they have to travel 20,000 miles every year and go vist 150 cities. They barely have enough time to sleep. They have to work at sunup intill sundown. I really love the circus like the lions, clowns,and trapeze artist. If i was in a part of the circus i would probally have to work hard intill my act was good and i didn't ever did it wrong. The clowns are good they make me laugh i always wish to meet a clown circus in real life and ask them questions.Once i tried to do a act like the clowns but i got tried.

How is my life diffrent from a life that normaly isnt in the circus? Well, for one, I know my best friend goes to public school, and most everyone that goes there speaks the same langusge! Me, on the other hand, have 12 kids in my class and they range from 6 years old to 17 years old. And i and 12. I speak english but also a little spanish and french. The langues range from spanish, french. german, and english.  I also have way more chores than people, such as grooming. Also, thuogh, i spend LOTS of time with my family.

Their life and jobs are harder than you think. The 'fun' jobs you could choose from are Acrobat, Lion taming, Clown, Juggling, Ring Master, and Training Animals. These jobs seem fun but they're actually hard. Keep reading and I'll tell you more details about life in the circus.                  An acrobat is a thrilling and difficult job. I think it's cool how they can balance on tight rope. Sometimes they use bicycles and carry people on the tightrope! Sometimes they launch each other out of cannons . That is what an acrobat does.                  Being a trapeeze is hard. You  jump from rope to rope while doing flips in the air. Sometimes 3 or 4 people are all in the air at once. Then they go back on the ropes with out anyone falling. That's what a trapeeze does.                   The ringmaster is basically the host of the show. He makes the announcements about the performers. He usually wears a black. red, and white costume. The ringmaster is always the last act of the performance.That is what a ringmaster does.                    Lion tamers teach the lions to do tricks that a lion in the wild wouldn't do. The tamers have to put a cage around the center of the tent just incase one of the lions would jump at the people. Some of the tricks that the tamers teach are to stand up and jump through the hoops.                    Animal trainers have the job of training the animals that perform in the circus. They train animals such as horses, lions, snakes, leopards, elephants, seals, and monkeys. The trainers have to make sure they are properly trained so they don't attack the trainers and audience. Trainers also have to make sure that the animals are fed, given water, and groomed.                      Now you know how hard it is to work in a circus. The people in the circus have to do their jobs every day. It gets tiring having to do that every day. If you want to join the circus you have to be determined and hard-working daily.That's life in the circus.                                                                                                                               THE END                                                              	NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP IN DT NN VBZ RB DT IN VBG IN CC VBG NNP NNP NN CC NNS VBP JJR IN PRP NNP DT NNP POS NNS PRP MD VB IN VBP NNP , NNP NN , NNP , NNP , NNP NNP , CC NNP NNP NNP NNS VBP JJ CC PRP VBP RB NNP NNP NN CC PRP MD VB PRP JJR NNS IN NN IN DT NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN CC JJ NNP PRP VBP PRP VBZ JJ WRB PRP MD VB IN JJ NNP NNP PRP VBP NNS CC VB NNS IN DT NN .

If you think living in a circus is fun your crazy.So let me tell you a story that happened to Alexis and I. So, it all started two weeks ago.I get up from bed at 5:00 am to feed Alexis and to groom her. Then I get ready for the show. Next, I go get food from the pie car. next comes practice.                                      Then, the big show comes on. First the clown act comes on. Next the acrobats do their thing. Then, the jugglers come on.Last but not least me and Alexis. So when we went on i went blank. the good thing was Alexis know what to do.Alexis was doing flips and amazing tricks.                                          Last the show ends. I was wiped out. Once I got on the circus bus I went to sleep.The one thing i dream about was the next circus show.

It is tough time for you.Somtimes the flips the flips you do scares you because you don't know what might happen that is is why you have to practice and practice. Once you do it you will get used to it but when you more flips it gets harder and harder. The tricks that you have to do are amazing and dangerous.               You have to work so long and somtimes you probaly might fall asleep doing one. You can even kill yourself. The fun part is when you get to meet other people around the world and try their new foods. You can even learn about their culture. There are some fun parts and some dangerous ones too.

They were traveling through the mountains to get to their next performance place . The group was called 'the group'. The group was going to be in an all elephants show .            One of the girls said , ' I cant believe we are going to be in an all elephants show !' the group decided that they were all very exited . Someone said that they should all get some sleep , because tomorrow was the first practice. Everyone went to sleep.              The next morning,the group had pancakes and talked about what they were going to do first.The first thing they decided to do was go to their performance area and look around.A few people went to meet the elephants , and the rest went to practice tricks.               One of the girls was new in the group. she wasn't very ' used to the circus '. Well, now she is better . She went to check the unicycles and tightropes .               In the last show , a girl named Catherine was in the group. She fell off one of the tightropes and is in the e.r. . Now we have Ashley to keep her place until she is better . Hopefully she is better soon.               'tonight is the show !!!!!!!!! ' Ashley said .the group just couldn't wait . later on , they went out on stage and performed awesomely .they each got paid 1000 dollars ! they were so tired that they all went home and slept.

There's alot of things you can do. Like be a regular circus clown, acrobat, juggler, tightrope walker, or you can tame different animals. It's alot of hard work though. You may think it's easy but it's not. Some of the things  clowns do are very dangerous.       Some people think that it's lame stuff that they can probably do in there sleep but it's not like that. Can you shove a knife down your throught and not get one single scratch? That's why we have a circus to do that so you don't get hurt. it suppose to entertain you not make you think you can do it just because it looks easy. Alot of people get hurt out of circuses too even if you are trained or not I guarentee it.         	NNP PRP RB VBP WP NNS IN DT NN .

We grabed our seet in the front. 'This is cool,'Nikkia said. BOOM! The lights went out. 'Get ready to rumbal,'The speaker man said. There was people with lions, tigers, bears, horses, cows, and so much more! Now lets get our fantastick winners up on the Circus act. We started to jump through fire. Walked on a tiny rope. We had so much fun. Me and Nikkia were acrobats. I almost fell. As we went up there these great big elefents came to pick us up it was awsome. We got to pet lions and everything else. Im going to try next year. I love the Circus!	PRP VBP IN NN IN DT NNP IN PRP$ JJS NN NNP NNP VBP RB NNP NNP PRP VBD IN IN DT NN VBD PRP$ NNP NNP VBD PRP$ NN IN DT NNP NNP VBZ JJ , NNP NNP NNP .

Three years later Robinson joined the circus and he was just fifteen. Robinson loved the circus the first day he got there and he was so excited to be apart of it. The first thing they had him do was meet all of the animals so he can get used to them and so the animals can get used to him. Then Robinson ate and started to train with the other people in the circus.      After three months of living with people in the circus and training Robinson got to perform in front of a live audience for the first time ever after only training. On Robinson's first act he jumped of a diving board from fifteen feet high. When he jumped the man who created all of this Derrick Jeter grabs him while he hangs on the rope and then they flip onto the other side. So on his first try Robinson Cano had completed his first act with Derrick Jeter.      Then after Derrick Jeter had retired Robinson Cano took over as the owner of the circus and became the most talked about man in the whole entire world.

So, maybe some of you may think that the circus is always fun and games. Well, only sometimes. But, most of the time it's just work, work, work.                 Here are things that I do in the circus everyday. The first thing I do is wake up in the morning and get dressed. The clothes that I change into have to be just casual clothes. Anyway, the next thing I do is go to the pie car to eat breakfast with the other performers. The next thing I do might surprise some kids.             The next thing I do is go to school. I know, I know it's weird to go to school in the circus. But we circus performers need our education. Without it, we wouldn't have known how to do flips - or anything that we can do. So, it's not that weird anymore right? Good.             Now the next thing I do in the circus is to take a break in school. After the break, we do chores and practice. Chores is the thing I hate the most. But, it's life in the circus. Now for PRACTICE!!!!!! I love practice! Practice is my favorite thing to do in the circus.             After all that practice it's dinnertime! And boy I'm starving! But the thing is, I can't eat to much. Do you know why???? It's because it's almost showtime!!!!! And I am super excited! Wish me luck on my show!             Whew! Show's over. And boy aren't I tired! Everyone did great! Including me. Haha! So, finally it's time for bed.Well, goodnight reader!

Hi my Name is Roger the Clown I have experienced many things, but nothing like last week.   Last week was our worst Circus show yet! Everything went wrong. But thats only because somebody was sabotaging us. One of our biggest rivals.       First i'll start with what happend to me, Roger the Clown.It was the middle of July we were doing one of the biggest shows of our careers.Our show was in New England and the Queen of England was watching our show. I had just finished my first act perfectly but then came my unicycle act. I was riding my unicycle around when it broke down I checked it and it turns out somebody screwed of my bolts. I tried to cover it up with my french horn, but something was stuck in it. So I ran of the stage.       Next were the Byron Brothers the twin acrobats of the Century. They were doing all there acts correctly until the tightrope act. They climed the ladder smiling at the audience. They were doing great but for their finishing move the amazing thriple backflip. They landed perfectly on the rope but the rope snaped and they fell onto the net.       And last the Amazing and Beautiful Miss Pico. She was Dancing Beautiful on Stage.But this was the baddest thing that happened tonight. When she was dancing her heel of her shoe broke and she broke her ankle. But then we saw a strange man leaving the arena with a hat and a big coat. we also saw him with a pocket knife in his hand and a screwdriver in his back pocket. He looked backed and I saw his face  and I knew that face. It was the manager of our rival Circus .       I started chasing him and caught him. I turned him in to the cops and he had to serve 5 years of Jail  for sabotage and pay for miss Pico's Medical bill.That was our worst Circus show ever. But the good thing is the Queen of England offered us to do a private show for her because we didn't get to show her our best. So when we did the private sow we Aced it. That was the worst Circus show ever!!!!!! 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP . NNP PRP$ NNP VBZ NNP DT NNP NNP VBP VBN JJ NNS , CC NN IN JJ NNP NNP NN VBD PRP$ JJ NNP NN RB .

I was 5 when i had decided I wanted to start gymnastics.   I first had to try out. At first I didn't think I had the right body form, but I was determined. Later I got a message that said I made it. I practiced a lot until I was 15 when there were circus tryouts. I asked my gymnast coach ans she said I should go for it, because I had the highest standards in my gymnastics class. I practiced for about 2 1/2 weeks when the day came. When I performed the judge was stunned that I hadn't missed a single test. I was so happy when I made it.    Everyday is a new, hard, and well practiced day. We do a lot of   traveling we travel about 15,000 miles every 6 months and vist about 125 cities. We have been to every country so far and to half of the states in North America such as South Carolina, Hawaii, and even Florida.   Everday I wake up at 7:30 A.M. and get ready to start doing   warm ups for about 2 hours. Some things I do for warmups are jumping jacks, flips on the trampoline, and tosses. At 9:30 me and the rest of the acrobats line up with their partners. First me and my partner go. We showand tell the rest of the acrobats what they need to do. Sometimes me and my partner will teach them some new acrobatics like the triple toss and throw. Later at 12:00 we have lunch. Then at 12:30 we take class lessons where we learn about the precise angle of our throws and tosses and couple more things like that. Later at 3:00 we have our break were we have to feed and groom the horses, elephants, tigers, and the rest of the animals.Finally at 4:00 for the rest of the day until 8:00 when we leave we practice performing and getting ready.   Since, we travel a lot I don't get to see my family a lot. Plus,   there is no place to call my home when we move all the time. Beside the fact I don't ever get to see my family I live the life here with all of my circus friends and always there to cheer someone up at shows.

If he falls he will probably fall down about five to six feet down. If he falls he might brak his head open or he could die.   The circus juggler has to be carefull too because the hoops could fall and knock him out. Then he would have to go to a hospital.

So every day when he is done doing his performence wich is swolloing a five foot corndog in his mouth. He goes to his three foot by three foot trailer and look at 4 old beat down pictures of his sons Tydroam, Willised, Smhit, clifreis, That all carries the same last name as vound.

Were not just crazy people doing crazy things. Were hardworkers and never stop practicing. This is my life. My crazy life.         My dad runs the circus. That puts a lot of pure presure on me. I always have to be the best or i'm nobody. He runs my life. I never wanted to be in the circus. I want to go to a real school not a school that is in a tralior. I want to be a marine bioligist one day not an acrobat. I want to be who I want to be.         Were on our way to France right now. I'm trying to read but with this group you can't do anything. I would rather be in school then with this group. I love them all with all my heart but this isn't for me. I wish my dad understood.         A few hours later were in France. I want to explore Paris,but we have to go to practice. Our first show is tonight. I'm practicing my acrobat routine. It's really fun. The music is fast and fun. I'm really excited about tonight's show.         The show starts in 20 minutes. I have to talk to my dad though. I think it's time I do. I knock on his door and he says come in. 'Dad I need to talk to you.'I say. The way I said it sounds like it's life serious. I wish i could've said that different. 'OK, what's up buttercup?' 'I want to be a marine bioligist. I love this life that I'm living but this is not for me.' 'I know.'He says sadly. 'How do you know?' 'You are the smartest little girl in the world. You love to do acrobatics but as a hobby. Anybody can read you.' Thanks for understanding,dad.'         My life has changed scince that talk. I go to marine study school in Hawii. I do acrobatics in the winter. I can do everything I love and be happy!                  The End!

Well your wrong hi  im liberty and im an accrobat in the circus. because you see we put a whole lot of time in our show to entertain you. the things we accrobats do are really tricky.  Sometimes in practice  we usually lose our balance on the ropes and fall off. the clowns have lots of stuff to learn like i do like juggling, being funny, riding the unicycle all that stuff is complicated for them but they get through it like we do . it takes constant hours for us to get everything ready for the show its alot and i mean alot of work because most times we cant go home to see our families again cause were so busy we dont have time . Although the circus is fun its tough too. 	PRP RB VBP DT NN VBZ JJ NN .

Being up this early usually means you can't sleep, but not for us circus performers we rarely get eight hours of sleep. I walked out of my trailer and down to the pie car for breakfast which is always eggs, bacon and sausage. After eating my breakfast I went to the trailer we use as a schoolhouse to play on the computer for an hour or so. The computers we have are fairly old but they still work alright, I decided it would be wise to check my email which I regret doing now because there was a message from someone named 'clowning_around' It stated that if I didn't quit eating five sausages he/she would cut the rope during acrobatics act.           Well that totally scared me so I went to the big top leader also known as Mrs.Casto who assured me no one would cut my rope or she would cut them. I was more or less relieved to hear that even if I still though clowning_around would cut my rope. I trudged back to the schoolhouse only to find Dylan Thompson playing computer games, I quickly sat down next to him which I also regretted because he smelled like pumpkin pie 'yuck'. I told him about the email he actually thought it was funny, Really he said no one else is brave enough to go up that high but you I think you'll be safe.           Having been sadend by Dylan laughing I walked slowly back to my trailer for a nap. I didn't nap long maybe an hour before I heard a knock at my door, I got up and opened it but was surprised by what I saw it Ginechi the italian clown. What brings you here Ginechi I said, Well I heard you got a strange email from someone threatening to cut your rope so I brought you these he said then handed me a bouqet of dragon lilies. I said thank you then shut the door then placed the bouqet on my counter top.            Four hours later I was in the big top waiting from my acrobatics to do my acrobatics act. Everyone including the clowns assured me that I would be fine but I was suspicious of all of them. Moments later it was time for my act, I slowly walked onstage and up the ladder to the acrobatic post where I jumped off and onto the pedastool then listened for someone to cut the rope holding the pedastool. I listened for about two minutes before I heard someoone sawing at the rope and it was none other than Ginechi himself he soon finished sawing and then I plumetted down onto the cold hard ground.

The horses moved as i saw the cicus tightrope walker stay balanced on the rope.                My stomach needed some fuel to its engine or else it wouldn't be roaring. People were on unicycles riding down the rope. Circus life is hard we have to do chores, practice then perform                        I have a friend that speaks Russian. Peple come from all over the world just to perform. They don't the same job as me because they wanted to do something else.                      We have to leave the circus after they are done. You have to have a specific talent to get started. But the best part of being in a circus is that you get to go all over the world.

Your act is to be shot fifty feet up in the air out of a cannon, and land on a giant air mattress. You have been practicing for six months and now the big day is here. You are all waiting for the show to start.        Then you here a big, Booming voice say,'Welcome ladies and gentle men, Are you ready for your mind to be blown?' The crowd roars with excitement. You put in your ear plugs and get ready to open up the show. You walk out to the cannon waving to the crowd. You are nervous and thinking, I hope everything will turn out okay. AS you climb in the cannon the big voice says,'Opening up our show will be this fine young lady being shot out of a cannon.'    Right as the voice finishes you fly out of the cannon, and into the air. Then you find yourself plummeting torward the giant air mattress. As you hit the mattress it pops. It sounds like a giant woopy cusion, and it gets the entire crowd going. You think, What a great way to open up the show!

I even got popcorn.  My favorite part was when an acrobat jumped into an empty seat in crowd.  In another part of the show, two clowns climbed a giant ladder and there was a large pool at the bottom.  One of the clowns pushed the other clown off the ladder.  There was a large splash at the bottom.  The clown that was still on the ladder laughed, but he slipped off the ladder and there was another splash.  The crowd roared with laughter.    When the show was over,  the people who were in the show gave me a tour of the whole   circus.  They let me ride the horse.  They showed me the elephant.  They let me feed the baby leopard.  They even showed me tricks that weren't even in the show!  When the tour was over, they gave me a present.  It was a keychain that said 'No Clowning Around!'.

Life in the circus can be vary thoght. You have to dress up like a clown.   There is also a chanse of you getting lunched from a cannon.          So on thr bright side you can be with freinds. You can be on horses,elehfents. And you can juggle fire :D. I mean who dosent wanna juggle fire?         There are risks but if you walk the tightrope and fall a nice net will catch you.And you may get hurt from falling of the uniciyle.But one thing i cant do is the acrobatics ( im not flexible ).And the funnist of all is FAME!

I think you should be happy and stay positive to be a circus acrobat. I do my chores every day after school im in 5th grade and get a`s on almost all my work. I dont have a phone so I wont call my family. I have to clean up animal poo almost everyday because I have a dog that poops alot and im the only person that cleans it up.        Is the circus hard or easy I think it would be very hard to get up early and then go to school come home do a perfomence act for everybody then go to bed very late. T hen get up early then it keeps reapting. But I gguess it would be easy if you get up early and go to bed late all the time it would get pretty easy. Do you have lots of fun being and circus acrobat?            My day is like this- first thing i do is get up and get ready for the school bus . Then when im done with school. I go inside and get my homework done. After im done with my homework I go out and do my chores which is my dog,cat ,turtle, fish, rabit. It is not very hard to do all of the animals. Then I go eat a snack and go outside and play. I  hope you liked my story I would tell you more, but I got to go.

The things that can look fun are the tightrope walker because you need to balance high in the air. The scariest is the lion tamer because you can be eaten alive.

There is some parts of the circus that is fun, but also parts that you have to work hard to achive.            When you mwork in the circus you uselly work  from sunup to sundown, which is kind of hard when you work so hard during the day. When you are travling to one area of the world you learn about them when your on your way there.           It is fun when you travel, but it hurts when you miss or fall when you are training to achive something. There are alot of fun jobs a that you can do at the circus. I like all of them. You can work with the animals or acrobat, and even trapeze.            When I was young I wanted to try out for the circus so I tried and I made it. I knew I would have to leave home for a long time, but I still wanted to travel around the world and be in the circus. So I decided to go with the group there were other kids to theat spoke different languages so I had to learn them so I would understand what they were saying. The school that is there is the same that you have, we have report cards and all that kind of stuff. WE also have 30 min. to do whatever we want to do. Now I have to go and practice for my next performance, See ya.

After 3 years, at Accel Gymanstics she knew she was ready. She was 17 and was looking for a circus to join. She could just imagine the audience and the flashing lights with the elephants and tightrope. One day, when she was on Burlingame Avenue she saw a ad it was for the circus! She got so excited she told her parents.            When she told them that she has been dreaming of this moment for 3 years and she thought that it was wonderful. Fortunately, they let her go. As fast as lightning, she went a packed her luggage. It finally came the day of the audition. The man named Jake approved and she was off to the circus. She had to take on lots of pressure and responsibility. After lots of practice the circus came.          There were at least 500 people in the theater. My heart was pounding and my wrists were sweating I was so nervous. I had been waiting for this moment my whole life and here it came. I ran to the rope and jumped high in the sky. It was a marvelous feeling, I heard o's and aw's from the audience. I started going for the tightrope.. I was never good at tightrope I jumped on and danced. I was so proud of myself I wanted to scream! I knew that this is what I have been waiting for 3 years.          After the performance, I called home but no one seemed to answer. It seemed odd ,they were always home. When I looked to my right I saw my family. I hugged them and said I missed them but truly I hated to leave home. After a little bit I was off to training in the gym where the circus begins. I thought that the circus was amazing and I will continue doing it for many years.

Circus life is hard and tough, but it can also be very fun and exciting!        Hi, my name is Grace Wilson and I am part of a traveling circus! When i was just 3 years old I began practicing ballet. By the time that I was 12, I was doing ballet, gymnastics, and acrobatics. I worked very hard hoping that one day I could join the circus. By the time I was 15, my dream came true-I worked for a travleng circus!        Not anyone can just join the circus. Anyone who wants to join has to have a specific talent, a certain body type, and have determination. The circus isn't all fun and games either. Performers work very hard to get ready for the next show.        There are also some upsides to being in the circus. Performing in a show very exciting and traleving all around the globe is another highpoint. When I first started I didn't want to be so far away from my family, but it was really fun seeing all of the different countries and my family even traveled to places around the globe just to see me perform!        Performing in the circus is a very fun and exciting life. I've had tons of fun being an acrobat, juggling and traveling around the world, but I have learned one thing, is you set your mind to it, anything is possible.

These are some of the things that you could do if you were in the circus. you could ride and elephant or fly through the air. it depends on what your talent is.       One day little Suzie went to the circus. She thought it was amazing. When she got home she called her friend. They agreed to start training for the circus.  They did gymnastics and then horse back riding.  They trained and trained and trained. Until one day when little Suzie got something in the mail. Suzie almost fell over. there if was suzie and her friend were invited to perform in the circus as thier junior act.       She called her friend and they went to the circus. It was really fun but really hard. They weren't going to be home for another 12 MONTHS! that was a really long time. Later that da Suzie decided she did not want to be in the circus anymore. As she started to pack up her stuff her friend walked in and said that she hated it here. Suzie said that she did too they left the circus. Then the ring master found a new pair of kids.

It's actually hard to be a circus performer! Many people think it's all fun, games, laughing, and no bad days, but that is not the life of a circus performer. I will show you what the life of a circus performer really is.         First, I always have to wake up early in the morning. I don't think there was one day in my circus life that I got to have my own day to myself. I always have to hear an annoying alarm everyday! Well, anyways, next thing! I eat breakfast in my pie car and since I'm always with my family, we all have the same schedule, so we always have breakfast together! After that, I get ready and I go into my one-room schoolhouse that travels with us wherever we go! It's fun because my classmates are from different cultures and I learn more! When I'm done with school, I'm already starting chores and training with my father! I'm always improving and trying new things, so it never gets old. Then, I eat dinner with my family, but not too much since I'm performing tonight. When that's done, I go do my shows! Obviously, when show's over, I'm beat and ready to go to sleep! Bad thing is that in 2 days from now I'm already packing up and going to be tired in another place! Now I'm in bed at MIDNIGHT! It sucks, but overall I have fun being in this job and will never stop! Well, maybe.           So, that was my life! Now you know what a circus performer really does in this world! Hope you think differently! Bye-bye!

Our first show is usually at about noon then we have a 5 o'clock show . After warmnig up we practice the show a few times through. Right before the show every one gathers and we make sure all the costumes are ready and set then we set up for the first act.           During the show it's the stage managers job to make sure the act is ready to go on and it's my job and two clowns job to prep the animals. After the show we rejoice.

You have to get up at sunrise and work until sunset. And you have to do that all week.And not  just anyone can join the circus. You need to be confedint, have the right body,and you need to have a sepicial talent.

He wanted to go home but he could`nt he had too stay with the circus.Today he went to the pie cart to eat breakfast.He got his usual pancakes and bacon.When he finished there was a breaktime that lasted 30 minutes.He went to go see his dog Bob. When breaktime was over he went to go pratice.He was a acrobatic. He was still tranining his special move jump on a horse while it is running.It was 6pm meaning the show was about to start. Frank was putting on his costume. His act was about to start. When the ringmaster called him he was nervous. he remebered what his mom told him and got on stage. He got on the trampoline and jumped with his eyes closed. When he opened his eyes he was on the horse. Everybody clapped and he was proud to be in the circus.

Today we are having a show so the crew is setting up the tents and lights.   At 9:00 I go to school. This school is normal it has computers, tests, homework, and report cards. The circus performers in the circus come from many places and speak French, Russian, Chinese, and Italian. When we learn our geography lessons sometimes we get to see the real deal.       3:30 school is over we practice our routine for the show. I am training elephants to blance on a beam. We first try and do it on lower ground. The elephants are sucssesful. Yay, I , the trainer is proud to be with the elephants. At:6:30 we eat in the food car. After a light dinner we get ready for our show in the afternoon.       9:00 the show is over I was so nervous I almost forgot my part. Now I'm pooped. I go to bed at 11:00. I also think of my home in California wondering if we will be able to stop performing and go back and live a peaceful live at home.

When I woke up at 7:00 I was on the ground, my blankets thrown all around me and I had a hurting back. By the time I had got my trailer and myself tidy I was 20 minutes late for breakfast. Then when  went to the pie car to grab sommrthing to eat, I discovered that everyone else had finished all the food, so I had to drink only cofee.        Then when I was waking to our one room schoolhouse, I tripped on a bannnana peel and spilled cofee all over myself. When I went to study in the calssromm, everyone started laughing at me, as I was known for my flexibility and balance. Embarresed, I took a towl from the back and dryed myself off.       When I was  playing with my friend's juggling balls they all veered off course and fell on my head. In a fit of anger, I rushed off and slammed the door of my trailer. Then someone tried to pull a prank on me by putting a bucket full of water on my door. Me slamming the door had caused it to fall down and spill on my bed. I was so angry that I did not do anyone of my chores.        Then for the finalle of bad things that day, when I was walking on the tightrope with everyone waching me, i fell off!!!       It was truly a very bad, no good, stinking day.

At our circus, some of our many performences include acrobatics and tighgtrope walking. We also work with many animals such as horses, leopards, elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.       Performing is very fun. If you put your mind to it anything is possible. I started performing when I was 11. Then, I wasn't even close to being perfect but I practiced and practiced. Now instead of only seeing the performences I can do them better than ever.       Our circus does ten shows a week. Two on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday and one on the rest of the days.       The circus is always a big job. There is almost no time to sit down and relax. When I come back from school I only have a short break before I have to go back to chores and then practice.       The circus is a big job and there is a lot going on. There are many animals, tricks, performers which means a lot of practice so it leaves almost no time to relax. No matter what, being in the circus is something you won't regret. You will love everything you do.

As a boy he longed to be an acrobat. He was very flexible,has a lot of determination. He practiced as a 9 year-old when he was in gymnastics. Now he his 21 and is working in the crazy family circus with his 17 year-old sister Camile. Camile is a trapeze artiest. He got a request to work at Wriggly Bros. circus. He turned it down so he could stay with Camile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   He said he wants to retire at 31 so he can be with his family. He was always ready to give it his all. Some say he was the best. Some said he was OK. Some say he was not great. But whatever the case he didn't care. All he cared about is that he knew he was awesome.  He now works as manager at a construction site.

She couldn't fall on the tightrope, nor fall on the bars triple somersault. Even though that was a burden, Lola LOVED being in the circus. She loved rhythmic gymnastics, playing with animals, and even just training them. It was so fun watching too!       The first part of the show came. Lola jumped and did a triple somersault and grabbed onto Harry's ankles, swinging back and forth, then jumped onto the platform on the other side. The circus was fun! She bowed and curtsied as the audience cheered. Then she went offstage to find the elephant trainer. The elephant trainer's cue was when Lola walked over to her. Lola sauntered because there was about two minutes until the elephants actually had to perform. The main elephant could do a trunk-stand!       Even though it was really fun, she still had to eat really fast, get dressed and shower quickly, practice hard, and wake up early. The clown would be juggling and handing out balloons in the crowd. Lola started to talk to Isabelle after she'd finished her part. Then she had to go change for the tightrope part. She was in the middle of changing when the circus master came rushing in and said, 'Lola! We're all waiting!' Lola finished changing and zipped out onto the stage. Her dog darted out of the way, letting her pass through as she slowed down to a stop, then walked out  on the stage so she didn't look like she was in a big hurry. The circus master sighed with relief as Lola performed well then rushed to change again.       After three more hours, the show was over. The crowd was tired. They bought some cotton candy and toys for the children, then went home. Lola was dog tired. She flopped onto her bed and drifted to sleep five minutes later.       The next morning, at 7:00 am, Lola's alarm rang again. She zoomed out of bed, grabbed her clothes and toiletry, then rushed to the bathroom. She showered quickly, brushed her teeth, washed her face, and sprinted out of the door to meet her colleagues at the bottom of the stairs. The matinee circus started. While Lola changed, the torch juggler was juggling swords and torches, and riding a unicycle at the same time around and around an elephant. Suddenly Lola heard a big THUMP and heard a cry.

My dad is the coordinator of the circus, he arranges everything from designing the graphics for posters to setting up auditions for new performers. I normally don't see him come out of his office in the day, he only comes out at night to see the show and my mom and I. For someone who has to deal with so much and work so often, I'm suprised my dad dosen't get stressed out.My mom is like the nicest person ever, I swear that she is the nicest person anyone could meet. Life at the circus is fun, but really hard.I basically get only 5 hours and 45 minutes of sleep everyday. After that, I go to the pie cart and get my favorties: pancakes,muffins,bacon,fruit, and some milk. Around two hours later, I go to school it's a one room school house, we learn math,writing,reading, and science like any other school. After that I practice for the show with my mom, we do the animal acts. I learn how to train animals, it's really interesting and fun because I really love animals. Finally, after 5 long hours of practice I take a break. I play games on my dad's computer in his office, read books, or play with around with some of the clown's equipment. Last but not least, I eat a little bit and preform in the show I love the cheer of the crowd, the bright lights shining on my face, and just letting all my worries go. Exhaustedly, I drag my self over to the trailer manage to fall asleep. Then after 3 days, we pack up our things and go move to another location. I love the circus, even though it's tough  I 	NNP IN DT NNP NNP VBP NNP NNP , RBS NNS VBP PRP NNP IN , PRP VBP CD NNS JJ CC JJ IN DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN , PRP VBZ VBG IN VBG DT NNS IN NNS TO VBG RP NNS IN JJ NNP PRP RB VBP RB VB PRP VB RP IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN , PRP RB VBZ RP IN NN TO VB DT NN CC PRP$ NN CC NNP NNP NN WP VBZ TO VB IN RB RB CC VB RB RB , PRP VBP VBN PRP$ NN NN RB VB VBN JJ NN VBZ IN DT JJS NN RB , PRP VBP IN PRP VBZ DT JJS NN NN MD NNP NNP IN DT NN VBZ VBN , CC RB JJ RB VB RB CD NNS CC CD NNS IN NN NNP NNP IN , PRP VBP TO DT NN NN CC VB PRP$ NNS : NNS , NNS , NN , NN , CC DT NNP NNP CD NNS JJ , PRP VBP TO NN PRP VBZ DT CD NN NN NN , PRP VBP NN , VBG , NN , CC NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBP DT JJ NNP PRP VBP WRB TO VB NNS , PRP VBZ RB JJ CC NN IN PRP RB VBP NNP NNP , IN CD RB NNS IN NN PRP VBP DT NNP NNP VBP NNS IN PRP$ NN POS NN IN PRP$ NN , VBD NNS , CC VB IN IN IN DT IN DT NN POS NNP NNP CC RB JJS , PRP VBP DT RB NN CC NN IN DT NN PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN , DT JJ NNS VBG IN PRP$ NN , CC RB VBG DT PRP$ NNS NNP NNP , PRP VBP PRP$ NN IN TO DT NN NN TO VB NNP NNP IN CD NNS , PRP VBP RP PRP$ NNS CC VB NN TO DT NNP NNP VBP DT NN , RB IN PRP VBZ JJ PRP	1		20131022100314	562	2		20131022123219	690	1		20131023211050	543	1

The next thing that happens in a circus is entertainment like jokes and tricks.Most clowns do both jokes and tricks,some jokes that they do are on the microphone and tricks they do are like magic tricks.The other tricks are juggling,circus jugglers juggle things like rings,bottles,and knives.They even juggle stuff like that while riding a unicycle.                                   In conclusion that's acually five things that happen in a circus,that's crazy that they acually do those things.

First of all, Dave was suppose to feed, water,and brush the animals, instead he was messing around. He was riding on the clown's unicycle, Dave fell and broke the unicycle. He thought he was dead meat, and the show was about to start! An idea popped in hes head. He grabbed the sticky glue and glued the unicycle, by mistake he added glue on the seat. The show was starting, he saw the clown walking by to get his unicycle, so Dave hid behind a barrel. The clown went on stage with the sticky unicycle...Dave yelled and told the clown that the unicycle had sticky gule on the seat, but the clown didn't listen. The clown sat on the unicycle and heard a splat, he tried to get up, but he was stuck on the unicycle. He tried again,but this time he was glued on the unicycle, the crowd gasped at first and then bursted out laughing. The clown ran off the stage, at first he was very mad at Dave, but the clown found out that the crowd loved him...the clown shooked Dave's hands and thanked him.            The second thing Dave did that almost messed up the show was that he forgot to put the animals back in the cage. Dave was looking for the animals everywhere, but he couldn't find them anywhere. He lost the horses,elephants, and even the lions! He thought he was going to be fired, if he can't find the animals. He saw a black and orange stripped cat running away from a brown dog, and he came up with a idea. He went outside with a net, and tried to catch the dog and the cat, but they were too fast. Dave slip, fell, and trip in the mud. Then he went back inside and brought out a toy cat and a dead fish. Daveput the toy cat in the tree... when the dog saw the toy cat, he barked and barked. Dave on the other hand sneaked behind the dog and got him in the net. Then he put the plate of fish on the ground, and waited. Five minutes later he saw the cat eating the fish, then Dave got out from his hiding place and got the cat! He went back inside and sneaked in the dressing room and dressed the dog up into a horse, and dressed the cat in to a lion. All he needed was the elephant, he thought and thought, and he came up with an idea, he was going to buy an elephant from the Zoo... when he got there he saw that the elephants was for free he needed two elephants, there was five elephants left there. People crowed there trying to buy the elephants, but Dave sneaked through the people, the people didn't even notice, they were to busy fighting with the other people. When the Zoo opened, Dave ran and ran... when he got to the the elephants, he asked if he can get them, they said yes. Instead, the Zoo Keepes gave him all five elephants! Dave told the Keepers he only needed two elephants. The Zoo Keepers said 'Take it or leave it,' so Dave took all five elephants. When he got back to the circus, The show was starting... during the show, Dave was wishing that the show was going to be a hit, and it did! Everybody laugh and laugh!              The final thing Dave did wrong was that, he forgot to wash the dusty, old, dirty bicycles, he was to busy sleeping. Someone yelled that the show was about start in five minutes, Dave woked up and got soap, rags, and a bucket of water, he thought he can't wash all ten bicycles! So, he gave it a shot, when he was done with one bicycle, it took him three minutes! He had two minutes left! He looked around and around, and saw a hose and a bunkey of yellow/gold paint, he thought that it would only take a minute to paint the bicycles with a hose...he poured the bucket of paint in the hose,and turned it on. It sprayed and sprayed, the bicycles was all painted, it took less then a minute! Dave heard the speakers said 'Show will be starting in 10...9...8...,' Dave saw people coming to get their bicycles, Dave thought that the paint was still wet... the people grabbed the wet, painted bicycles, Dave tried to stop them it was no use... He heard the speakers again '3...2...1... Show is now starting,' the people rode on stage with the wet bicycles. When the show was over, the people got up to bow, and turned around... The crowd laugh so hard they almost fell off their seats! The people was so shy, that they ran of stage as a puff a smoke. After the show, the crowd said 'This is the best circus in the wrold that I have ever gone too!'and some even said 'I am coming here everyday from now and on!' The people who worked at the circus, thanked Dave, and told him to stay and work at the circus. But Dave who was tired, said thanks and when back home... when he got home, he went right to bed, and said 'Best day ever!'        As you can see, when your working at the circus, you have to work.

The acts there are also fun for example my act is being the acrobat with my partner. Another act is the tightrope walker. That is fun but it is also very very dangerous because you can fall and miss the safe place to land on. Another fun act is the juggler because you supprise the crowd. It s also dangerous because sometimes you can juggle things like saws or knives and thosse things can fall on your head and you can get injered. The clown is nice to but people realy make fun of you but dont be offended by them just belive in yourself. A differant thing to do is totrain the circus horses and make   learn new tricks                                                                                                                                       To do thosse acts you must have talent and you also have to belive in your self. Dont change just because of what people say about you. You also cant just  when you dont feel good or when you just want to give up because hear we are all family and family cant split up.Now you can see that becoming a circus actor isnt easy.                                            The big day is hear now today we all must set up everything for the show.      We must pratice for the show or else we will be a big diapointment to the host and we will be a big embaressment.

I thought the only 'cool' animal thing would be a bicycling bear but there is also a lion tamer and painting elephants.After this visit the circus was a whole lot different to me. This circus was a very amusing one to. The lighting was nice and the special effects.               What I thought about the animal acts are either, the elephants, the lion tamer, and the uni-cycling bear! Even though I thought a bear would be thought to us a tricycle it turns out they train it to use a    unicycle which to me is about a thousand times harder! I really liked the elephants because they taught them how to paint!!! and the art was only stick figures but especially because the used their trunks!!! I also thought the lion tamer was cool because he put his head in the lions mouth and the lion didn't chomp his head off!         What I thought about my favorite acts without animals was the trapeze, tightrope, sword swallower, and the really flexible guys.   I thought the sword swallower was amazing because swallowing swords is so hard because it goes down the throat without cutting themselves!!! Also those really flexible guys are really crazy because 4 of them can fit in a small box and still fit with the lid closed!!! what I thought about tight rope was that they actually use a uni cycle holding a large stick with 2 people on his shoulders and going across a really thin rope!! And the trapeze was really cool because they swing rope to rope like how monkeys swing vine to vine but they also do flips and sumersualts to!!!         I sort of liked the clowns even though they dress wierd they were pretty funny becuse they throw creme pie at each other and they squirt water out of flowers. But I dony really liked it becuase i thought clowns were acting a bit to over reactive but like 10 clowns can fit in a tiny car. But I also like the juggling becuase they juggle like, 10 balls!!! They even juggled knives which to me is pretty risky.         But I thought the knife throwers were really cool becuase they have someone spinning on a wheel and throw knives around him. Also, the knives go just between the legs and sometimes pinning the clothes but missing the body! The acrobats are also cool becuase its like the trapeze but they do flips and they also jump and grab a rope then jumps and grabs someones hand and they jump around doing backflips and stuff. The acrobats are a lot like the trapeze but with partners. The acrobats are also really light becuase whan they land you can hear only a little of them becuase they are pretty light.         Finally, I thought  the finale was cool becuase they were standing on top of each other and balncing an a ball! There were people and a seal! It was cool becuase they were making a castle by standing on top of each other. And people were standing on the shoulders. That was pretty cool because it fell withoout anyone getting hurt!!!         That was my favorite things at my first visit at a circus. It has never been so cool until now. Before I thought it would have no that many stuff, but I found a whole lot more intersesting things thats what I thought about the circus. I now like the circus better than before! I hope you enjoyed!!!

The circus I work for is the CIRCUS!CIRCUS! place in Las Vegas, Nevada The way you see the circus is pretty funny and humorous. The thing you don't know is that under all those suits and makeup, is a LOT of hard work. Yup, that's right, WORK. When you're in the circus, you have lots of fun watching, but the question is, ' How do they do all those performances? ' Well, let me show you my point of view.       Getting Into Shape                       First, I'll tell you how I trained to do my job, being an acrobat. As you can see, you have to be very flexible. When, I first started my circus career, I wasn't as stretchy as I am now. That's because they told me that I wasn't really in good shape. I have to admit, I wasn't that athletic until now because they took me to a gymnastics class. My gymnastics class was held at a special circus training area in Vegas. In gymnastics, they trained me to become as flexible as an octopus. They also trained me how to be balanced and concentrated, too. That's how I'm able to do as many flips as I can, jump, and land on those elephants with my other acrobats. After taking that class 8 hours each day, I became one of the most flexible acrobats in the circus. All in all, that's already a lot of work just to get myself in shape. Now, here's the REAL deal.       Acrobat Routines               Like all performers in the world, we have routines. A routine is a type performance that requires lots of practice, determination, and talent, such as doing a dance, or a cheerleading. My routine as an acrobat sounds really easy if you watch, but very hard if you know what to do.           In the acrobat routines, most of the time, you'd see people make pyramids and stuff like that. What others do is nothing compared to my most favorite routine. First, we hang on a tight rope and make a long ladder by hanging on to each other. Next, we climb down the human rope and we each get a normal-sized red, bouncy ball. Using our balance and concentration, we step on to the ball, and flip on to our hands. It sounds fun, but it's not easy. Then, we roll ourselves by a gigantic, red, porcelain ball and carefully flip back onto our feet. After we do that, we jump onto the ball and hold each others' hands. We then do a hand stand, link legs, and we're finished! Right after the audience applauses, we let go, slide of, and bow, and of course, we do these routines at CIRCUS!CIRCUS!          The really difficult thing about this is that we practice our routine almost 24/7, until our next performance. Another thing to worry about is that we have a performance almost every 3 days, twelve hours, for 7 months. As I repeat, it's not easy being a circus performer. Oh yeah, let me tell you what we acrobats get to wear!       Crazy for Clothes                First off, you know that acrobats can't use their pajamas as a costume. It would be really silly. Yes, I know that a circus would be all about silly, but in the circus world, it would kind of be considered improper. The acrobats' costumes are spandex coveralls with polka dots. The girls get a tutu &amp; silly cap included. On the other hand, the boys get a spiral slinky belt and a pointy cap.            I'm really crazy about this because it's not like you can get these anywhere! Circus costumes are made especially for circus performers ONLY. We get our special costumes made by the ringmaster's special business.  That means they are very rare in the world. Although, it's not like we where these in practice.            In practice sessions, we wear spandex footed tights and a spandex t-shirt. It's very similar to what we wear during shows and mantinees, but simple. Now you see why it's very difficult to be an acrobat because spandex can slip off a polished, porcelain ball easily. Also, I'll bet you're wondering why we wear spandex. Acrobats use it because it's easier to stretch and use our flexibility. That's what we acrobats get to wear.                 So you see, living a life as an acrobat isn't easy. There are difficulties, billions of practice runs, shows and mantinees, and LOTS of hard work. Being a performer requires talent, determination, the right body, and confidence. If you can complete those tasks, you're ready to go! But don't forget, it's not easy at the circus!                           	DT IN DT NNP . . . . NNP .

I WILL GIVE YOU ALL A BREIF LOOK OF MY LIFE AT THE CIRCUS. MY LIFE IS VERY HARD. MY WORK AMUSES CHILDREN, AND MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID AGAIN. EVERY SHOW THAT I PUT ON FEELS GREAT. I FEEL AS IF I WAS A PART OF A BIG FAMILY. WHEN YOU JOIN A CIRCUS YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW, THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS WELCOME YOU NICELY, BUT IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE A GREAT TALENT THAT MAY IMPRESS THEM, THEY WILL ACCEPT YOU. WHEN YOU JOIN A CIRCUS, IT IS LIKE JOINING ONTO A LEGACY. WHEN YOU HAVE JOINED INTO A CIRCUS YOU WILL FEEL LIKE THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING YOU BACK. I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE WORKING IN A CIRCUS BECAUSE OF MY FEAR OF CLOWNS, BUT I GOT OVER IT. MY FEAR OF CLOWNS ENDED AFTER I MADE FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CLOWN SUITS. THE REASDON THAT I HAD A VERY BAD FEAR OF CLOWNS IS BECAUSE OF A SHOW THAT I WATCHED AS A YOUNG CHILD. ONE OF THE SHOWS THAT I USED TO WATCHED WAS A SHOW CALLED SUPERNATURAL. IT WAS A VERY CREEPY SHOW. THIS SHOW SHOWED CLOWNS THE CLOWNS THOUGH WERE KILLERS. THE CLOWNS WERE ALL NOT KILLERS I NOW KNOW THAT AFTER MEETING ONE OF THEM. I AM NOW A CUTORTINATIST I CAN BEND MY BODY IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. THIS IS MY JOB, THAT IS MY ACT. I HAVE HAD MANY, MANY TORN MUSSCLES. BUT IT IS ALWAYS WORTH IT!

We wake up in the morning at 7:00 just like you. We even have to go to school.       Now I am going to talk about training animals. Training animals is not super easy it is super hard. You have to teach them how to do tricks and how to dress them for the when they go out on stage. This is the hardest thing to do that I think in the circus.       Then they setup is very hard you have to drag every thing on set so the circus can use it. Then you have to get the animals on stage which is very very hard.       So that is the life of the circus and to show you that it is not all fun and games in the circus.

It's hard because you have to have no fear of hieghts, faling, accedently geting hurt, or the tent catching on fire.Itis also hard because it's almost always nonstop and you don't get to see your family a lot.You have to practice a lot and train animals too.                                   It's hard being in a circus but we the circuspeople make it look easy.Everybody has a fear or aweakness.Mine is hieghts that is why I am not an acrobat I am a clown.What I don't like thogh is people make horror movies of clowns.Now if I say Hi to acring little kid to make him feel better he jut screams even more!Anyway in the circus everything is harder in the circus when you have a fear because it limites you from a lot of things people would do like the acrobats who get  all the glamer.                               Another thing that is hard is that you have to wirk and work and WORK!everyday weekdays weekends every day of the week.Don't you think I would quit by now,but no!there is one thing that keeps me going. That is the stage. Oh....How I love being on stage. Well that one passion keeps me going Oh and the people are tere are like family exsept Rebecca Van Husan is mean to me,but she is stilllike family.                                 I also have practice every morning.I wake up super early to practice.I also go to bed super late because the shows.My teacher is really nice her name is Violet she has been a circus performer since she was 10 the year she ran away from home.She says she would of died from the cold if Bill (theguywho runs this whole thing.)Didn't save her and take her under his wing.After she tells me her stories of her childhood we practice the acts for later that night.                                                later in the afternoon if there is no show I will train the baby animals.I have two fears one is hieghts and the other is getting eaten by animals.                                 That why being in a circus is exstremly hard. 	PRP VBZ JJ VBG IN DT NN .

My job was with the Lions, Bears, Monkeys, and Elephants. I was a very talented girl. I was 10 when I had tried out. Before, I was the girl who danced before it started and after it was over. Then they moved me over just with the Monkeys for 6 months. Then they moved me with the Monkeys and the Elephants for another 6 months. They noticed I was very talented and was working hard so they moved me to the Lions and Bears.   They had try outs so a 7 year old girl made it, her name was Valerie. She was talented, but needed alittle help so she was my assisant  for 7 months. In thoughs 7 months she was moved into Lions and Bears.Then I was moved to Tigers and  Chimpanzes.A few months later she was moved to Monkeys and Elephants. She didn't appear for the 3 shows. Then her doctor had called because she couldn't got to the next 10 shows because she had gotten in a car crash and broke her leg. We were sad, but we couldn't do nothing.   My ruteen was not very tiring. At 8:00 we got up and dressed. At 9:30 we got breakfast.  At 10:30 we got droped of at school. At 4:00 we got out of school, at 6:00 we ate dinner and at 8:30 we went to bed. Then I got tierd of ding the same thing for 10 years so I started working at a resturant called El Pescador.

You have to master all the things you need to know for the show. It's fun becuase you can hang out with all your friends paly with all the animals like the lions and the elefants. You get to do all the shows with your family you get to spend time with them. You have to be ready for every thing that come at you like the shows.   The hard thing is that you have to remember all the things you learn. You have to ready for the next day because and for all the shows that there going to be.You have fun becauseyour with all your friend and your having while your doing it. You get to performal in front of all the pepole and you get a lot of money while your performing and you grt payed alot 	NNP IN DT NN IN : NNP NNP NNP IN DT NN VBZ RB VBN CC PRP VBZ RB JJ IN DT JJ NNP NNP VBP TO RBR DT DT NNS PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NNP NNP POS NN NN PRP MD VB RP IN DT PRP$ NNS RB IN DT DT NNS IN DT NNS CC DT NNP NNP NN TO VB PDT DT NNS IN PRP$ NN PRP VBP TO VB NN IN NNP NNP VBP TO VB JJ IN DT NN WDT NN IN PRP IN DT NNP NNP NN NN VBZ IN PRP VBP TO VB DT DT NNS PRP NNP NNP VBP TO RB IN DT JJ NN IN CC IN DT DT NNS IN EX VBG TO PRP VB VBN PRP$ IN DT PRP$ NN CC PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN NNP NNP NN TO JJ IN NN IN DT DT NN CC PRP VBP DT NN IN NN IN PRP$ NN CC PRP VBD VBN NN	0		20131022100442	541	1		20131022112802	539	0		20131024083702	552	0

Let me tell you some are and some aren't. My name is Bob Evens I am a clown. I travel 20,000 miles, I go to around 150 city's. We work form sunup to sundown. The circus life is good.            Do you want to know what my schedule is? Here it is, At 7:00 A.M. I wake up get dressed,and go to the pie car to get some breakfast.While the crew sets up the tent, lights and music for tonight's show.            At 9:00 A.M. it's school time. The one room school house travels with us. It has computers, test, and report cards. Some of the circus performers are from other country's  they speak different languages. In the circus our geography lesson comes to life.            At 3:00 P.M. school lets out. We get a quick break. We play with some of  circus toys. I play with the baby leppords. I shot spit balls at the lions. I give the elephants peanuts.            At 3:30 I put on my make up and practice my tricks like the others. Somtimes I feed, water, and groom the horses. The trainers train some of the animals. Somtimes goff of for practice.             At 6:30 P.M. it's dinner time. I normaly don't eat much. some of the people eat enough to fill a elephants stomach. their belly normally hurts after the show. If I mess up my make up I have to redo it.             At 10:30 P.M. The shows over we go to bed that night. most people go right to sleep I don't. I love my circus life!

Like stay away from your family and going from place to place.   then you haft to get up reel early. And you haft to have very good talent.                One thing good about it is that if you want to follow your  dream you can . Llike flipping jumping riding on horse stuff like that. Our doing weird stuff like putting a sword in your mouth our breathing fire.                        So if you like traveling our doing cool and weird stuff like that do it but if you don't do not do it. Me Alexis does not what to do that.But go ahead be adventuresome.

I don't know where to look in this big city. But then I noticed a truck coming out of the parking lot. Someone stole the lion.       I hopped on a zebra end chased after the truck I finally caught it and the main clown stole the lion. I was suprised and the clown ran away and I couldn't catch  him. Eventually he was aressted and the circus was saved.

Do you ever think people in circuses have a nice relaxing life with tons of fun and play? Well life is not like that. My name is Darwin and I work at a circus. I have to work for more than 12 hours a day!       Working at a circus is hard work. I must train for a few hours and perform in front of a live crowd. If one person is injured, the whole event is ruined, and everyone will feel ashamed. There are many consequences of not practicing well, so we need to train for many hours.In a circus, we still have school and other programs. We live in trailers and we learn things like other students.       Even though circus life is hard, it is a fun job that we still like. 	NNP NNP PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NN CC DT NN WP NNS IN DT NN .

Michael was it so Sergio and i hid at the creek . We heard someone laugh so we went to see who it was . We saw a tall clown and he knocked us out with a bat . When i woke up i was in a small room . I looked out the window and saw clowns all around . I went outside and asked a clown ,'' Where am i .'' He said ,'' Your at a circus ''.I looked around and thought Sergio . '' Where is my friend '', i asked . He pointed to a car so i went there and saw Sergio on a bed . I told him to wake up and said we were at a circus . We went outside and a tall clown and two body guard clowns were in front of us .The tall one said ,'' See me at my office ''. We went to his office that had what he calls '' art '' and alot of clown tools . He asked us if we could be his new clowns . Sergio always wanted to perform with circus horse an i always wanted to be launched in a cannon so we said ,'' Yes'' . He offered us pancakes and bacon and i ate my whole plate . I guess i was hungry .                       After we ate he showed us around the circus . We saw the schoolhouse , circus office  , concession stands , stables , and trailers . After that we inside the circus and saw clown practicing their act and some were practicing with animals . When Sergio saw one of the horse he started riding it and doing stunts . I asked him what i'm supposed to do and he asked if i wanted to be launched in a cannon and and i said '' YESSS '' . He said i could but first i had to train first . I had to jump in a pool and ride a unicycle . After we trained we had to go to our trailer but first the boss said there was a contest the next day . The next day we ate waffles and sausages and got ready for the act . We practiced for a little while then we left .                         It took us 10 minutes to get at the circus . When we got there the announcer said the winners win 5,000 dollars . Our circus went first . When Sergio went he was doing tricks on a horse and he jumped through a hole with fire . Then it was my turn and i got launched on a cannon and landed on a trampoline . Then it was the other circuses turn . In the end we won 1st place and won 5,000 dallors . The boss took off in a unicycle with nitro with the money . We chased him on a horse and caught him . We took the money and left to our house . The next day we told everyone but they didn't believe us . 	NNP IN DT NNP CD NN PRP VBD VBG NN NN IN PRP$ NNS NNP , NNP , NNP . NNP VBD PRP RB NNP CC PRP VBD IN DT NN .

When you get there you will see that people will be setting up tents,lights,and music for your show. At 9:00 am it is time to go to school you will learn about how to behave in a circus and any geography lessons that will come to a point in the circus.            You think that all you do in a circus is do all sorts of crazy stuff but really you aren't you have to follow a routine that you get assighned for the circus. so you will have to memorize it and all the stuff you will have to do in the circus.                      Before you get ready to put on a show for the circus you have to get you costume on then put makeup on to make you look silly. The different types of circus stuff is acrobats, jugglers, and tightroping.

I go to the pie truck and have a omelet. Then I train the dogs or the horses. the dog's favorite trick is to ride a bike. The horses favorite trick is having a girl jump on their back.         Each kind of animal has its own truck. The clown's truck is pretty wacky. My truck is red like all the others with a bed and desk. The classes are pretty easy and I have quiet a few friends they are really smart and funny. Most of the time we hang out with the dogs or the clowns.         It has been alomost a month since I have seen my family. They come to the circus every once in while. I miss them a lot. My friends are always their comfort me. The circus is also my family.

Being in a circus isn't always just fun and games.                              Here is my regular day.       7:00 am I wake up and go to the pie car to eat pancakes and bacon for breakfast.       9:00 am I go to the one room schoolhouse which travels with us as we go. Just like any other school we have tests, computers, and report cards. Many kids in the class come from all over the world and they speak a different language so sometimes it is a little tricky to understand them.       3:00 pm is when school gets out. The clowns let me play with the unicycles and juggling balls. It's alot of fun.       3:30 PM I do my chores and practice my act. I feed, water, and groom the horses we use in the act. Today my dad has to practice summersaulting off of a running horse. I am a little bit nervous for him but I'm sure he will be okay. I practice leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back, it takes balance and focus to do it. Other kids my age are practicing juggling and acrobatics. My neighbor takes baby leopards out for walks. Trainers work with elephants, lions, and monkeys for the show that is coming up.       6:30 pm time for dinner, I'm starving! my family and I head out for the pie car for dinner, but we are sure not to eat too much before the show. We do ten shows a week. One on each weekday, in addition to the manitee on Wednsday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.       10:30 pm the show is over and I am SUPER tired! We go back to our trailer and pass the circus ofices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. In two days we will be in a totally different town.       12:00 am I'm in bed and thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be great to get back to my real home in Florida. Then I wonder if I will still be in the circus when grow up. I have no idea what I am going to be because i am just a kid. The circus is really fun and exciting, but sure is a lot of work.

You've probably never heard of the town I live in because, well, it's tiny. In fact the population is only 382 people. If you really want to know the name, it's Bakshea. Brazil has been split into different color districts. Each color district has two or three small towns in it. The six color districts are, The Green District, the Red District, the Blue District, the Yellow District, the Purple District, and the Orange District.           My mom  asked me to go to Shealey, the next closest town to us, where all the shops were, for bread, milk, butter,cheese, and cloth for the next two weeks.I left home at sunrise, even though I was about to fall asleep just talking to my mom. I walked the two miles to Shealey, bored out of my mind. Once I got to Shealey I walked into the Bakery. There wasn't much to gawk over since the baker didn't have a glass counter to put treats in, but he did have a plastic case for a cake. The cake that was in the case was a strawberry cake with chocolate icing and strawberries to decorate the top. 'How could anyone afford this cake?' I thought. I ringed the bell on the cold stone counter. After a few seconds a bald plump man with a dirty white coat came up to the counter. 'Hi Mr.Trumpers,' I said.           'Hello Dellak. Do you want the usual?' Mr.  Trumpers asked.           'Yep. Three loafs of bread,' I answered.           'Okay. Hold on a minute.' Mr. Trumpers replied.           As I waited for Mr. Trumpers to bring me the bread, I thought, 'I wonder if Mr. Trumpers has any children.' I decided to ask. Mr. Trumpers walked back into the room and I thanked him for the bread, payed him and asked, 'Mr. Trumpers do you have any children?'           'No, why'd you ask?' Mr. Trumpers replied             'I don't know, I guess I just wanted to meet someone new,' was my answer.            I left the Bakery and headed for the Dairy Farm. The walk wasn't bad since it was only two blocks away. When I got to the Dairy Farm's lobby I saw a sign that said Win front row seats at the Bellini Circus! I thought,'The Bellini Circus! In the small town of Shealey! I can't believe it! But it would be so expensive. I have to win this contest!' I walked in to see Rosy, the farmer's daughter.           'Can I help you?' Rosy asked.           'Yes. I'd like four pitchers of milk, with lids, in a container, two sticks of butter, and two wheels of cheese, please,' I said trying to sound polite not rood and pushy.           'Okay, Dellak. I'll go get that for you,' she replied.            She was almost out the door when I shouted after her, 'Oh and, Rosy, how do you enter the contest for front row seats to the  Bellini Circus?'.            She turned around and walked over to the counter. Then she answered my question, 'You write a story that takes place in a circus and turn it in to me by May 28th.'            'Today's April 29th so I have a little less than a month,' I thought. 'Okay, thanks Rosy.' I said calmly even though inside my heart was pounding so hard it was a bomb's timer counting down until it explodes.           'Your welcome. Now let me go get your stuff,' she said sharply, but also being goofy.           'Okay, okay,' I said, which made her giggle.           After Rosy gave my my things I paid her and left. I went to the fabric shop got the cloth my mom wanted and headed home, never stopping thinking about the story I was going to write.           By the time I got home it was clearly afternoon. I walked inside helped my mom put away the groceries, and ran strait to my room to start writing my story. It was harder than I thought it would be. I had only gone to a circus once, and it was a long time ago. I could remember that there were men and women with painted faces and big red noses. There were also lions, tigers, and bears. Another thing I can remember is that there were people that rode a bicycle with only one wheel on a rope really high up in the air and people who swung on bars and did tricks up in the air.       I ended up writing the winning story. I title it The Mysterious Trip of a Lifetime.

I got Chloe, my tiger, on my sixth birthday. Chloe and I have been working on the preformence  for our biggest show happening tomorrow in Kansas City. All the performers of  our circus are so exited and ancious, yet so nervous.       In the early morning, every body is getting up, eating, practicing,   and are setting up for the big show tonight noticing that it is a sad rainy day. we are post poning the show to tomorrow. since everybody else's act could be inside, we still have to practice today. I got Chloe ready and we are going outside to practice. As I was running in circles with Chloe, I slipped and broke my ankle.       Mom and dad found another trainer to fill in for me. She and I   spent a little time so she could get to know Chloe better. Before the show Chloe got a angry that she was performing with her instead of me, but they did great together. Everyone in the audience stood and aplaused. the night turned out perfect.

My mom's a trapeze artist, and my dad is a juggler. We get to travel all around the world. I go to over 150 cities per year! The whole circus is like my family.                 The circus isn't always that fun though. The shows are long, and some tricks are hard to do. I miss my home in California a lot. I don't have a regular home. I'm always moving around. I never see my family except for my mom and dad. I don't even have the weekends off.                   My daily schedule starts off with school. I wake up at 7:00 AM and go to the pie car to eat. At 9:00 AM school starts. It's like any other school, but my classmates come fro all around the world. They all speak different languages, like, French, Russian, Italian, and English like me. 3:00 PM, I take a quick break. At 3:30 PM I do my chores. I feed and water my horses, Belle and Jack. I use them in some of the circus's acts. Then I practice for the show. I always wanted to join a sports team but I've never had the opportunity. At 6:00 PM I have dinner. It's very light though because we're about to preform. I do 10 shows a week. At 10:00 the show is over, I'm very tired.                  The circus is very fun, but it is also very busy and tiring.

Some of it is actually enjoyable. The bad part about it is that you are away from home. 24/7 and you are always practicing so you dont always have time to contact home. You can have many different options in the circus that best fit you! My option would be acrobatics. You also have to be okay with the scheduale that you have. If you are interested in dance, gymnastics or otheractive sports that might be in the circus you might try out for the circus!!!

I am nervous but I know I can go across the tight rope which is 60 feet off the ground. I have gone across it before but this time, my father told me to make a twist to the act and wants me to go across the tight rope while doing the hula hoop. Even though I practiced walking on the tight rope while hula hooping, I am scared because the whole circus is depending on me. Only if the European promoter is pleased with our show, our circus will be able to go on a world tour to Europe.          I slowly take step by step on the tight rope and began to hula   hoop. I close my eyes and think about how I will feel when the European promoter promotes us. I made it across the tight rope! The crowd cheers as I climb down the ladder. I walk back into my dressing room with joy and nervousness. I can hear the promoter talking to my father, the manager of the circus. When I hear the promoters foot steps as he leaves back stage my father knocks on my door and tells me that the promoter loved out circus act and promoted us to the Europe world tour. I do a cart wheel with joy. I help my dad pack our stuff because tomorrow we have a long drive to Europe.                The next morning the whole circus loaded their stuff into the bus and we all ride on the bus for seven whole hours. Even though I am bored, I am excited about my first performance in Europe. When we arrive at our designated place, I help to set up the tents. Since we finished setting everything up earlier than we planned my dad says I can go and explore the city.                I come back at seven o'clock, right before show time. I dress up and hurry to my spot on the tight rope. I easily make it across the first time. The crowd cheers and wants me to go across again on the tight rope but this time with two hula hoops. I ask my dad what to do and he says I should give it a try so I do. I almost make it across the tight rope when I loose my balance and fall off. I fainted. When I woke up, I was in a hospital. My dad came up to the bed I was laying in and told me what happened. I had broken my neck and leg. My dad told me that I had undergone a surgery and turns out I will not be able to perform ever again. I was so disappointed that I started crying.                I went back to the circus and after a few days I got over the fact that I cannot do the thing I love most, perform.

Even if you are one you can practice than you can become a better circus performer. Anyways, In a circus you can choose a job that you want to do. For example, you can be a Acrobat or a juggler but if you choose these jobs just remember practice will make you to victory. Many people have to practice a lot like a tough job for example leaping on a trampoline onto a horseback. It takes balance and you have to put effort into the work many of you people do.       Now lets talk about how to become a circus performer. If you    want to be a circus performer you have to do step by step to get victory. alright lets get started. First, you have to have good body type and a specific talent. If you are a juggler, You need have good talent because the balls that you are going to juggle cannot fall down and you need to have good body structure also. Do you know wwhy?  The body type can determine how good or style you have and how fell you are doing.       Now lets talk about the things you do in a circus. You will have   some chores to do like grooming the horses and practicing somersaults like want I do to practice and to perform well in front of the audience or everybody. And so you see that circus is hard life and plus on the other hand you get to go to many places or have fun.

My best friend has a wonderful job so I want one too.I have been looking in all the news papers for 2months and still can not find a job that fits me.Today in computer class we were going to learn about how to get job on the computer because I asked my teacher for help so hopfully there will be a job that is hiring people, so wish me luck!   Well, turns out that there were no jobs I was interested in but just because I did not see one today sometimes if you add a little faith you can accomplish anything. That morning something unexplainable happened! Today was when the news paper came so I jumped out of my bed and rushed to get the news paper in the driveway.After 2 min. went by there was a page that had a big pictre of an elephant and people training them and under it was big bold letters..................                          NOW HIRING at THE CIRCUS   As soon as my eye caught the big bold letters something was telling me that this job might work so I called the number!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                         910-555-7689                                         Getting into Buisness       When I called my mom to tell her what happened she was so happy that she cryed.She said that my father used to be in the circus when he was about 13 years old and I said no wonder something was telling me to check it out and see if I like it.The next day I went to the circus because it was the day that I might get hired.When I got there they were examining me and I told them that I was confedent and very positive and that I was very determined to do anything.Then they asked me if i did gymnastics then I said'' When I was 5 to16 but now I am 18.'' When they said thank you and I left I was so ancious to see if I was hired. The next morning they called me and said that I was hired!   As soon as heard the word HIRED i almost exploded like a volcano!   They wanted to see me at 9:00a.m. and I said how about a little early   ''Ok Great''.                                     The World's Grandest Show       When I started my new job everyone there said that I was the leader because I was never afraid of anything pretty soon after a few years the circus was the most popular in the world. I was the main person doing everything but even though sometimes I felt like giving up I tried my best to make it through and when you beleive in yourself great things could happen so never give up on anything,even though it is hard sometimes.               Moral: Never give up on anything 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD VBG IN NN NN PRP VBD VBG IN PRP MD RB VB PRP$ NN NNP NNP JJS NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP CD NNP VBP VBN VBG IN DT DT NN NNS IN NNS CC RB MD RB VB DT NN WDT VBZ JJ IN NN NN PRP VBD VBG TO VB IN WRB TO VB NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN NN RB RB EX MD VB DT NN WDT VBZ VBG NNS , RB JJ PRP VBP .

You might see felxible people,dancers,animals, THAT HAVE BEEN TRANED, and other kinds of things.Also if you ever get to go to the circus you might be in a tent or maybe in just a eally big building. In my oppinion I recomend you to stand back away from the wild animals because some animals are not treaned,but if you want to get a closer look you may. First of all, I would want to tell you many performers travel all around the world . they are very bussy and they are nonstop. Also all performers speak different languages not all of them are the same. The preformers have to wake up early.They have to wake up like around 7:00am. Being a preformer I can tell its hard work. They have to practice all day long.	NNP IN DT NNP DT VBP RP NNS PRP VBP JJ NN , PRP VBP NN IN NN CC NN IN VBN NNS .

Anyways this can be my big move to see that circus show.This circus only comes once a year.My friend Jacob he has an uncle who works in the 'THE AMAZING CIRCUS'.Jacob might get us tickets but the tickets cost $00.25.Do you know how much money that is I can't afford that neither can Jacob.We might have a plan.We can contact his uncle , but how are we going to get to him?        Today we went to school and our teacher was also talking about the circus coming to our town 'Brooklyn'.We asked her if we can help in anything.Well she told us we could post these posters around town.        Well we did so many people got interested we got scared that there wasn't going to be any more tickets.After posting all that we hurried up to the circus.There wasn't enough time.       We ran till we reached the circus.We saw his uncle Jorge just walk inside the huge tent.We ran but then a big bodygaurd came and got us from our shirts an yelled 'NO KIDS ALLOWED AROUND HERE'.He put us down but instead of running we went under him and ran to the big tent.It was 4:00 p.m.        We saw so many people they were all chasing us but then Jacob's uncle Jorge got us and said I know these kids there fine.Why did you come here said Jorge.Jacob said we wanted tickets for show.Oh,said Jorge I already sent tickets to your houses.Thank you Jorge,Jacob and me told with a big hug.Jacob and me went to see the show.My big wish happened.

In this story, you will learn about what it's like to be a circus performer as a young person. it's a hard, rough, and exhausting life.       Marlla Mandora was an active and performing loving 12 year old girl. she was never shy and loved to perform anywhere anytime. She was a dancer, performed ballet, and even musical gymnastics. She would enter every talent show she could and anything she was good at.        Marlla's parents were proud of their daughter. They supported her in anyway they could. 'When I get older, I wanna join the circus! Oh how fun it would be doing acrobatics and swinging from high! It would be a dream!' she said to her mother. Like I said, her parents supported her in anyway she could.       When Marlla was 18, her parents signed her up for circus tryouts. Marlla knew it was gonna be hard. There were many people trying out. Some breathed fire. Some juggled chainsaws. Some even did funny acts! but only few were chosen. And one of them was me!       Marlla was happy and sad at the same time. Marlla got her dream but she had to leave her supporting parents. But her parents knew that their little girl had to leave. With that, a circus member took Marlla and gave her a tour of people and animals and equipment.       At 10:00 P.M., there was a show. But Marlla wasn't in it. She had to watch to see how the showed worked. Marlla was thrilled at the stunts and funny tricks. She couldn't wait for her first show! She especially loved the stunts on horseback.       Marlla woke up a 7 in the morning and went to the pie cart and had breakfast. She asked the animal keeper if she could help with anything. the keeper said yes and gave her a job with the horses. She groomed and fed them and mucked out their stalls.       Something excited is happening today. Today will be Marlla's first show! Marlla was doing acrobatics. She was very excited. But first, they had to setup the Big Top Tent and then a bunch of others. it was hard work setting up all the tents.       By the end of the day, Marlla was wiped out. She was so exhausted. But then she had to help put down all the tents and put away the animals and give them their dinners and fix their beds. Then Marlla got to finally sleep.       The next day, it all happened again. Marlla performed and loved it but it was too much work everyday, having to perform 10 times a week with four shows on the weekend. She missed going home to her parents and performing for them once in a while.       She decided to quit and go back to her home in Alabama. She surprised her parents by returning without them knowing. 'What. Why are you here?' her parents asked, 'Oh, it was too hard too keep up with all the shows and taking tents down and taking care of the animals,' she said.       With that, she lived with her parents and still performed.She eventually found a husband and had two children. She inspired her children to act and surprisingly...her children became movie stars!

Oops he forgot he was in school he was day dreaming.         He got back home his parents were packing up?His parents are called Lily and Jake.Johnathan said 'Why are we packing up.'Lily said 'Your going to be a circus actor.'Johnathan said'Yippee.'The next day they had everything in their RV they had to go to San Diego for their first circus act.Johnathan he had to be on the unicycle juggling balls it was very hard for him.He wasn't going fast because he might fall and get hurt.He was nervous really nervous.After the show he was tired he wanted to go to sleep.Jake said'Hurry up you need to go to sleep for tomorrow.'          The next day they were already driving to Las Vegas but Johnathan did not know were they were going.Johnathan said 'Where are we going.'Jake said'Were at Las Vegas.'Johnathan said'For what'Jake said'For your circus act at Circus Circus Johnathan said'Awesome.'When they arrived to the hotel Johnathan saw a pool he wanted to go to the pool, but he had a circus act to do at night.Then he was going to the circus.Then he saw a big giant circus tent right behind a building.He got the chills in his bones,he was afraid what kind of act he was going to do this time.              When he got inside there was a lot of people on the seats.I was so nervous I just wanted to run and hide some where dark.So he went back stage with the other clowns and the acrobats .When they told him what he had to do Johnathan told his parents and Johnathan said in a slowly voice'I have to do the tightrope walker.'He kind of froze when he had to do that.Slowly he walked to the middle of the circus tent climbed up the ladder onto the platform.He had to hold a long stick.He started to walk on the rope every one was clapping he started to laugh.Then he was losing his balance every one gasped and the cushions weren't there but the clowns were barely coming out then he fell.The clowns barely came on time, he was saved.he did not want to stop doing circus acts after that fall.

Some circus performer are funny doing there job because they like it when they do it .some of them like it, some of then don't like it and when you are with them you feel all sorry for the person how gets hure or don't get the job sometimes.       When you first help them with something and you feel like you don't want to do it any more well for a couple of days you feel like you want to do it agin foe a few dayes they onlt perform in the summer or the springs.you will see the amazing first thing will be great that you came there you do it and this is my life in the circus.

Also,they do all sort of thing but everybody has to help each other so it could come out well. For  example one takes care of there places.I think they most get really tiered because some have to wake in a rope that most be hard and tearing. I think it most be fun to go see but what if you had to work every single day at the circus.I wonder if it is fun to work at the circs.                     Then,I am going  to talk about how to become a circus performer.Have you ever thought of running away from your house an going to a circus.I think everybody think it is fun to work at a circus but it is really hard.I wish  I was a trapeze performer I think it will be fun.Not every person gets to join a circus because it is really hard.I wonder how people do this kind of jobs it is super hard working at a circus don't you think.

And when he went to work every day he had a blast, His job was to look after the circus animals. There was 2 elephants,5 monkeys, 8 horses, 1 bear  7 tigers,3 lions and 4 zebras. And jack had to feed ,water, and look after all 30 of them every day.   One day in the fall when jack was counting the animals, there was only 7 tigers.'oh no!' he thought'the tiger has escaped. I must tell the ring master and quick!' jack told the ring master 'Call the fire department and get all the performers .We got a tiger to catch!' said thee ring master calmly.So every body got something to ride on and set out to find the tiger.       It took hours to find the lost tiger but they found him at last. They had cased that tiger around and around the hole city. But at long last they finally found the missing tiger.

First, when you do the circus acrobat it is really difficult it takes a lot of practice to do it. for the circus acrobat you need strong teeth and really good balancing. not just anyone can be an acrobat proffesional. It is hard, you need the right skills talents,and every thing you need to know.         Secondly, juggling involves alot of concentration and and fliping. When juggling you have to look up in the air and make your eyes frozen.

Some circis performers have some different jobs.One is magic.They must be realy talented to do that job.Another one is acrobats.What they do is basicley flying with ropes.The grossest one is pooper scooper.They pick up the animals poop and its realy discusting.Then theres the juggler.The juggler juggls diferent things at the same time.The last job is a tight rope walker.They walk on a rope and keep there balance on it.                  To get the people to the circis they will put up posters on buildings.Then they will pass out tickets so they can except that you are going into the circis.Tomake you stay they give you popcorn,cottoncandy,and soda.Then its there job to entertain you to get the money.To know that your at the circis you there will be a strang looking building like a triangle shaped building with red and white stripes up and down it.And there will be a sign that says CIRCUS.                            Thats what they do so go ahead and go to the circus and see whats there for you.I know there are other jobs but I dont know them so go to it and tell me what they are.PLEASE.

You have to do whatever your trainer tells you to do.           At 6:00 am I have to get up and be ready by 7:30 am and then go to breakfast. At 8:30 you have to go do chores and after that rehearse. I rehearse till two hours before the show. The show starts at 3:00 and ends at 6:00. I am exhausted after the show. I have dinner and then go straight to bed. That is what circus life is like.

So I got up and got dressed and then ate we live and stay in Wisconsin. We perform tonight at the coal center in Madison I am so excited I could blow up. this evenning I helped the crew setup the lights and music then I practiced for the big night. It was time for the big show I was doing the balance beam tonight 110 ft. up! Now it was my turn. I started out very well but once I got closer and closer to the end it got harder I was only a couple of feet away until I fell. I let go of the stick and ploped onto the net down below I was sad that I didn't make it that night I would try harder next year I said and I did.

Some people think all fun and games but no it's HARD.When Lola started she was about eight-teen.She new she had what it took to do it.But what she didn't know was how hard it really was.       So she started practicing and became very good.So they let her on the team.Done over five-hundred shows!

You have to be away from home for a long time and barely get to see your family unless they are with you.You have to live in a RV to travel places.Your going to have to wake up early have to wake up early, do chores, practice, have fun for a little and go to school. Then you clean the animals practice over and over till you get it down. Then at night  you eat a little bit so that you don't throw up or feel dizzy while your performing on the stage. On  the next day you get ready practice and restart the whole day over again until the week has gone by.           Once the week has gone by everyone  packs up the circus you pack up your stuff and move to the next town. Then everyone sets up again keeps doing the same stuff all over again but not everything the same all over again because every day is a new day. On tour you really don't stay in one place for so long so you cant play sports in a team, go to the mall with friends, or go somewhere awesome.          That is my wonderful story about the circus and thank you! Life is a circus!	WP PRP VBD IN DT NN NNP NN NN NNS IN DT NNP NNP .

But no, you're wrong, the circus clowns and acrobats do so much in the daytime to impress you. They get up, get dressed and spend all day getting ready, while you just sit their and watch T.V. or whatever. 8:00 P.M. is show time! you get up to the tent, seating everywhere, concession stands and the big ring stage. After the performance the clowns and contortionists get a large standing ovation from the audience. When you leave that tent, remember, you have it good, clowns don't because they spend all their life and dedication to make you laugh.

'Well maybe... the only lead we have is that some one ate them...All,'.  Olly stood still he thought he was going to have a heart attack!   'some one ate all my pies...that's impossible only I can eat 6,038 pies,' suddenly Olly gasped 'I know who did it!'    'Really,' said the ring master sounding surprised 'who?' He asked       ' Jolly Joe,' said Olly 'He knew that he could never make pies as good as me, so to even the score he stole mine ,' He explained  'Now why would the circus chef steal your pies?'                                 'I just told you !' said Olly as his temper stared to rise that's it,' Olly said aloud as he grabbed a hold of the ring master by the hand and dragged him all the way to Jolly Jo's trailer just as Olly was about to knock the ring master interrupted him 'Olly stop... I ate your pies,' the ring master confessed       'But why,' Olly asked       'Oh no I didn't really, I just wanted you to get over it,' The ring master replied        ' I still need to know who ate them,'Olly said as he barged through the door of Jolly Jo's trailer but instead of finishing his sentence he froze his mouth gaping open there in the middle of the room was Jolly Joe takings Olly's pies apart piece by piece and studying them so that he too knew how to make them.        Then he looked up from his work and muttered the word busted ' Olly this isn't what it looks like!'.  But Olly was already on the floor weeping.   'how could you do this to me?' Olly asked       'Olly I never meant to hurt you,' Jo said trying to explain 'I didn't think you would teach how to make your pies so i took them... I was going to give them back       ' Really?' asked Olly standing up and wiping away tears       'Really,' Said Jolly Joe now smiling       'Well now that this mystery how about we all go out for pizza ... it's on me,' Suggested the ring master and they all left the trailer, piled into one of those tiny clown cars and drove of.

I am a performer in the circus. My act is lion taming. It looks easy but actually it is very hard and a bit scary. First of all, you always have to have pure concentration because if something goes wrong, you will be a lions dinner for sure. When you are up there with the lions,always remember not to get on their bad side. Other then that,it is not that stressful. As I always say, become one with the lions. Let hem understand that you are their friend.   Over the years, have become very close to these big cats. in fact now all the guys at the circus call me the lion whisperer because I have this connection with them. I sometimes go in their cages and fool around with them. I sit with them while they sleep next to me or lick my face. To me, honesly their just a bunch of house cats. Big house cats. I like to hear them purr when I stroke them and brush their wild manes. If you feel like I do, like you feel like you connect with lions, dont be so sure that you feel like you can just walk right into a lion cage and expect them to be all friendly. Actually,in my case, it was not love at first sight. I remember when I first walked into the cage. The biggest male lion,Muzala, growled at me and bared his teeth. Afterwards, I kept my distance and was patient. Now they are like my cats. I love my job and intend to keep doing it for as long as I live.

I think that kids should learn more,when there are in kindergarten.But the can not eat or drink around it because if they drink around it it could spill the drink the computer will not wok anymore and if they eat around it they would leave a mess and i would have to clean it.           Kids should know how to go on computers.The kids need to know how to get on the internet and to play games on it.So when they go home and play on there computer if they have a computer or a laptop.

I, Carry Smith know what its like being in the circus. I live with my family in a circus trailer. We travel around the world almost every year. And over 200 different citys every year, maybe even more then that.           Mostly likely a day for me:           6:00 A.M. I wake up, Take a shower, Get dressed. And go to a gastation or nearby food truck for breakfast alot of times bacon and pancakes. Then help the circus crew get set for the show for tonight.               11:30 A.M. Time for school:              There are many different things then in a regular school like yours. Many people in my class speake different languages like german,french,and italian. My family only speakes french,german and english. As we travel around the world every different lesson seems to comes to life.             4:15 P.M. School is over:            Time for a quick snack and a break from school until tomorrow. The trapeze artist let me play on the trapezes. Also the clowns let me play with there clown cars and juggle. I also play with the tiger, Cuddles. I want to play on a cheerleading team but, we never stay long in one place for me to play a sport.             4:30 P.M.  Practice:         My dad and I feed,water and groom the tigers and horses.We use in the tiger act and horse act. Today, my mom practices taming the tigers more I help her it is sometimes really scary. I'm also working on doing a horse back trick.         5:15 P.M. dinner time:          My family and I usually go to a resturant to eat some a gas station if we cant find a resturant.We dont eat very much before the show that happening tonight anyway. We do 8 shows a week. one each week day and a special one on Saturday.            9:45 P.M. Show is over:         I'm wiped out. We walk back to the circus trailer, We stop at the concession stands sometimes. But, we really pass the other stuff like the stables,circus offices, and other trailers. Now when I'm asleep we'll be in a different town tomorrow.          11:45 P.M. In bed:          im thinking about the end of this season of touring. The circus is fun and all But, I miss my ranch in South Carolina. When I grow up, I think I'll still be a circus performer. The circus is fun but, it's not so easy as a life.

There are upsides and downsides to the afternoon but its all worth it.           After school you will have to rehearse with the animals and feed them. Doing this will help prepare them for the performance. When you finish practicing with an animal you will have to move on to a different animal so this might take some time. While you're practicing with them you will also be learning more yourself. When you have finished rehearsing with all of the animals you will need to practice your own routine. You might think that this sounds silly but  you do need your practice too.              When you are finished practicing with the animals and yourself, you will need to get ready  for your performance. You will also need to eat but do not eat such a big meal before your performance because depending on what you are doing you do not want stomach cramps.  After the performance you are wipped out so it is time for bed and boy will you be tired in the morning!               Being a circus performer is tough but it is all worth it if you are having fun and doing what you love. If you do want to become a circus performer I reccomend you  stick to your mind and try your best.

Anyone can join th circus but you have to work at it. To be in the circus is fun but not evey thing is all fun and games somethins you have to take serious. Like when you are on the tight rope you have to make sure that you stay balence. The circus is almost like gymnastics. When you are balencing on the tight rope it is like balencing on the balence beem. Or when you are making flipping over stuff it is like doing flips on the bar in gymnastics. I li ke doing gymnastics because it is fun and amazing. I hope you think that the circus and gymnastics are amazing  and fun too. That is why I want to be in the circus on of these days when I grow up to be older. And Ithink you should want to be ain the circus too. And if you do I hope you go for it and have fun.I think that everybody should try to chase there dream no matter what people say.

One adult was putting fire into his mouth it was creepy. After a wild afternoon it was time for the real thing.The circus was starting, our family got the front row tickets and got the coolest view talking about lucky  the show was starting it started with a lion jumping through firing hoop an a woman was balancing up high with sharks below her I was afraid she was going to fall but she didn't and she also did a really cool back flip while balancing talking about entertainment so the show went on with elephants, tigers, and mouses who you may think can't do anything but if you were at that circus you would be really surprised. So we returned home and happy.????

Well, you had come to the right place I will talk about the animals, people,and when they get ready. Then what they do? how long they work? So that what I will talk about and answer the question.                    The first thing I will talk about is the Circus acrobats. They are the hardest worker they fly in the air, and a rope hold them on to them and they practice every day, and the boy have to hold the girl with his two bare hands! But sometime biting on the chain and the girl too they can hold on. Then sometime they have to do flips and they have to hold stuff sometime and hold the person, and they wear pretty cloths. Then they work hard Intel the grand opening so they practice every day and sometime breaks and that why they work hard. So they work hard, what they do,  they work hard,and some breaks.                The next one is the horses. They work hard too the person that train them have to be very good and train the horses but sometime the horses don't listen sometime and miss up and they have to practice what they miss up and practice a lot. They are real good,after so that is hard training. They work hard and they practice every day.            The actors are good and they have in side the circus their are games and fun activity's and the performers practice long days and sometime spend time at home. They are hard working and never stop or give up. Being accountant,but there are some drawback.                              They get ready for the show they get the performers ready in place and everyone can get in. So the show get ready so they inter-dos the show to the people but, when the clowns come in some baby get scared of them because there makeup and style and there laughter. So that how they get ready.                The first thing when they get ready the first thing is:            1.)  Pie car: where circus performers eat so they won't get hungry when they do the play or show            2.)  Unicycles: a bicycle with one wheel so the clown or juggler gets on            3.)  Groom: clean and brush so they can look good            4.)  Matinee: afternoon show that when they are doing their play            5.)  Wipe Out: very tired that when they are ready to leave the circus                     In conclusion the circus was fun and I talk about what they are and when there break and plans and get ready so it is hard to be in the circus is tough. You try your best and there are line by line never stop. Then you spend time with your family when you are do from the circus and you can be together so that's all about the circus and it is fun there so see you at the circus.

It takes a lot of practice, talent, and work. In fact, much of the life in the big top is working and practicing. Here is what a day would be like if I were a circus performer.       I would start off the day by waking up, getting dressed, and going to the pie car, the place where circus performers eat. If I have time, I would go help the performers set up for tonight's show. Next I would go to the schoolhouse car. So, if you think circus life is all play and no work, you still have to go to school. After school, I get a short break, but after that, it's chores, chores, chores, and time for practice, practice, and more practice. Next, it is time for the show. I must do my act, which could be tightrope walking, juggling, lion taming, or even being a human cannonball. The show would last for hours, but after that it's time to rest and sleep. This same schedule would last every day. As you can see, circus life can be tough, yet it's all worth it in the end.       However, before you even step into this wild life, you must become a circus performer. You must have talent and determination. Sure, you get to travel the world, but it could be months or even years before you see your family. There are also many people in this world, so don't get your hopes up about joining. However, if you have a special talent, like being flexible, super strong, or fast, you would be a great candidate. In short, preparing for circus life is just as exciting.        In conclusion, there are ups and downs to performing in the circus. A day for a performer is hectic, yet amusing. It takes a lot to get in the circus, but it is most definitely worth it. The circus, from my point of view, is a tough profession, with fun and work all in one. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN VBG IN DT NN .

Philippa road to circus stardom stared when she was five years old. 'I did musical theater and ballet and all kind of music ,singing ?? , acting and everything to hone my craft,' ??Philippa also gets a thrill from performing in front of a live audience isn't all high-flying fun and games and clowning around.                                Despite what many people think, the life of a circus  performer  isn't all high-flying fun and game sand clowning around.It's more glamorous than being an accountant, but there are some drawbacks.Circus performers work long days and spend a lot of time  away from home .'On tour, you don't really have anywhere to call home and you're always thinking about that night's show,' says Philippa.I miss my home and garden and I don't see my familey.

He wanted to do something different he wanted the rope to go higher! He put the rope higher and longer but her couldnt do it! Everytime he would go on the rope he got scared. He asked his friends what to do.              So her asked his friend she said to put a net under the rope so u wont be scared so the next day he went and put a net under his rope and he wasnt scared! He walked through the rope just as he would if it was a normaly!             He  did his new trick the next day at a performance everyone was scared that he woudnt make it because they didnt think that there would not be a net under the rope but he they didnt know so when he went through the rope everyone was amazed!

AND that trick was me throwing six creme pie's in my partner's face the crowd was howling with laughter. The circus was so great we became#1 circus in town. I did flipping act's with the acrobat's then I got to a higher level and started taming class.AT first the lions wanted to kill me but then things got better. so they asked me again and I said yes but I said will I be able to see my family the owner said yes.thing's aren't hard if you try them,so go make positive choices start today.

We have three performances to go to', my mom said. 'All right', I yelled back. Your probaley thinking what does she mean by performances? Well I work at a circus. Now, let me tell you one thing it`s not that easy. First you got to have a talent for something to be in a circus. You also should start young so you can build up your learning so when you get older you`ll know a lot about circus see I started when I was five, now I`m twelve. That`s seven years of being in the circus and I`ve learned a lot.       Now let me tell you about the bad parts of being in a circus. You`ll have to travel to a lot of places and by the end of the day you`ll be beat because you traveled to so many places in one day. Believe me it`s tiring. Sometimes there could be at least four performances in one day that you have to go to.       So in the end I recomend you to join the circus because it`s a lot of fun, but there are some faults about the circus. So I`m off to my first permormance of the day!

The circus is amazing what they do there like they might even have magic shows there you should go to a circus.  The clowns get out of a small car and there is a bunch  of them in one small car. At a circus  jugglers can juggle fire and  knives. Maybe when you grow up you might want to be in a circus in some circuses they have knife throwing never try that at home the knife throwers are pro at it that means they have a good chance that the knife thrower won`t hurt anybody  that there throwing at.

But then I tryed it on the tightrope and as I started to grow up I got better and then one day I found out that I wanted to be a tightrope walker.       So I looked for a circus who needed a tightrope walker for months and after a while I found one and I thanked them so much because I told them that I had been looking for circus that need a tightrope walker. So a few weeks passed and I go a littel scared but I said to my self this is what i wanted to do and i cant give up now then the show start the man in the white shirt yell get ready and so every body got ready and the show begins.

And people will laugh and just be plain rude but thats life.  Also there is something abot training tigers in that as well. And you sign a contract that clearly states if you die the circus is not responceable.

Klaus was confused as he woke. He thought he had messed up. The rips on his shirt, his broken bones and the unconscious heap of the clown  proved it. Yet they were cheering. Suddenly realization dawned on him as he saw the pistol in now officialy sociopathic Tennyson's limp grasp and the braying horse next to his body with his startled Father on it, the reigns tight in his hands...             The air was tense in the tent. This would be Klaus's first big act with the Giavanni circus, and it was odvious the other performers doubted his aptitude to perform. Especially Tennyson. Tennyson had been a limber clown when he started, so it was said, but after years of eating in the pie car and lying on the train's cozy couch, a potbelly had protruded and now all that was left of his formerly skinney self was the thin face that resided under the wig he wore. Rumor was that he was bald, but this was yet to be proven due to his never removing his fake purple curls, even when asleep. Tennyson also was growing increasingly jealous of Klaus's father, who led the circus, because he thought he was the rightful leader. Under Tennyson's sneer, he emerged from the tent and out onto the ring, feeling genuinly worried. Here I go, thought Klaus as Father emerged on horseback for their act.             Klaus's act was going reasonably well. Their act was simple, but hard. Clowns would be juggling around the ring, and inside it Father would be riding around the ring, going clockwise. In the center, on a trampoline, Klaus would be doing flips, cartwheels, and other tricks until Father rode around the ring for the sixth time. On the sixth round, Klaus would backflip off the trampoline and onto the horse and land standing. They were now on the fith rotation, and Klaus could feel his heart rate increase. He had done well enouph to recieve roars of aproval from the audience after each trick, but now he was only faintly hearing all background noise. Clip clop, clip clop went the hoove beats on the ground, as the horse was nearing the end of its sixth time around. Boom Boom, Boom Boom, went his heart, which was now in his throat. He bounced, his legs went over his head, and...             Klaus heard bones crack as he hit the recipiant of his leap. Only they were not just his ribs that had broken, but another person's, too. That was all he remembered before he blacked out.            Tennyson was angry before he was knocked out. His plan to avenge himself had been ruined by his nemesis's stupid son, who he was supposed to shoot, had accidentally timed his jump wrong? Inconceivable. This was his last rational thought before he would awaken days later in a prison cell.

Bring all your friends we'll have food and candy for everybody. The opening starts on this 20th. The circus will have: funny clowns, circus animals, and other fun circus material.  This is where I work at the circus it's not that fun since i'm the trash boy. Of course you might already know that a trash boy always picks up trash around the circus. that is true but my story is different. You see I was an orphan and I got adopted by a circus man named Tod. he is now my dad but he is no longer with me. He died off just like my regular family did  didn't know what happened to them. That's when I began working at the circus. The circus is like a family to me a family that picks on me of course. I'm more of the feeling type. I know how people feel alot and try to be friends with them but I don't have any.  I always think of escaping but something deep inside me just makes me stay. I always wanted to be a juggler but the downside is I don't know how to juggle. So today is the day I ask to be a juggler. It's 12:00PM I go to the manager's office and I tell him. He said 'I'm sorry Sammy someone has to be the trash boy.' then at that moment a miracle happened someone came in the office and asked to be the trash boy. So from this that on I was a circus juggler.

When you get to the circus its still no fun you still have to fix everything until it is all ready for the show and for the kids there not much you can do at first .People train the wild animals like tigers,lions,elephants. monkeys, and sometimes people.       When the people start arriving now the fun starts some people finish up the last minute details you start getting nervous unless you already done it .all the animals get out and in there positions.when the show starts all the beautiful light go on the fresh smell of newly cooked popcorn and hot dogs ?.you start the start of the show the audiences is amazed with all the tricks you do the jump op an down as they watch .       When the show is over your not done .you are starving but right now you don't care when you finish early then you get to eat but for right now you have to help out gather the animals the elephant are the hardest to get in there cages you have to help out to sweep the circus its dirty work its really gross you have to sweep up all the nasty stuff on the ground then you pick up all your stuff and put it in your trailer and go outside .       After everything is cleaned you go outside and you finally eat you eat you good you are full you go inside get dressed t go to sleep the next the your traveling to another circus and the whole repeats it self over and over and over and over but there is one good thing about this you get to meet a lot of new different faces but you also really miss your family.

With lots of new people inside that world.You can see typical circus animals,acts,and people  such as clowns,lions,trapeze artists,tight-roping, and more. Some Circuses are amazing like Cirque du Soleil. People from all over the world come to see circuses when they come into town.  People from all over the world also participate in the circus.                           OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH, AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH fill the circus tents. Everyone is amazed on daring, incredible tricks everything can seem like an illusion in the circus tents. Elephants seals, lions zebras ,cheetahs a lot of unordinary zoo animals all participate in the amazing show. Five clowns in one small car?! AMAZING! A man diving into a small pool thirty-five feet high?! INCREDIBLE! A man tight-roping from the top of the tent?! NERVE - RACKING!!!!!                  Being in the circus isn't all fun and games for the performers. Most of the time they practice almost nonstop.They do this because in a show you need to know exactly what you are doing. If you aren't practicing you will typically be doing things like what you do at home...chores. Everyone has a job to do. Whether it's grooming the show horses, or setting up the tent , people will always be doing something.                                  Put yourself in the shoes of the lion tamer or the ring master. You would be a big mess wouldn't you...I bet some of you would hide and run, or just stand there not knowing how to do anything that you intended you thought you knew.To avoid this that's why all members in the circus practice.( in the paragraph above ) Has anybody in the circus mess up? Of coarse they have. Anyone can mess up in a play or performance.ANYONE  Anyone can mess up , but only a few people can cover up a mistake by going along with it.                Traveling around the world is what the circus does. Pretending to be in a circus or be a lion tamer at home to entertain is one thing, but being in the circus is another. Some people can get this one in a lifetime chance of being in the circus, but they have to commit to all the practice,being away from home, and constantly traveling almost nonstop.                   Imagine having a closet full of clothes for all different acts. people in the circus have that .You can't just have one pair of costumes for every act so that is why they have so many costumes.How many places can the circus go in a year? Perhaps hundreds.In a lot of circuses they have a highly trained man or woman who may do magician tricks. Such as Houdini's water tank trick. In this trick someone has to go in a tank full of water while they are in a whole bunch of chains wrapped around their body.               Circus animals are highly trained before acting in the circus. Especially the wild animals such as the leopards and tigers. All these animals need to be trained in order to be in the circus. If not the people working with them might get seriously hurt or even die.

We won!' I yelled to Cameron, jumping with excitement.   'What did we win again?' Cameron asked.   ''We get the front row seats to the Bellini Circus!' I screamed with joy. 'Its at 6:30 pm.'   Cameron checked her watch.   ''It starts in seven minutes.' Cameron said. 'We gotta hustle.'             We could hear loud clapping and cheering right outside the entrance. We walked to the front row, and saw a  man tight roping on a unicycle 50 feet in the air!  Clowns were throwing pies at each others faces and a woman was taming a hungry lion with a whip.         Then, we could hear a 'THUMP, THUMP, THUMP' coming from behind a black curtain.   'Elephants!'' We could hear a little girl say. Six of the huge, gray, elephants come stomping out in a line. There is one trainer sitting on top of each elephant, giving it instructions. Then, we heard a loud squeal.   'Its coming from one of the elephants!' Cameron yelled. An elephant lost control and ran into a section of people. There were screams coming from everywhere. The elephant rammed through the red and yellow striped tent and ran away. Cameron grabbed my wrist and started sprinting in the opposite direction.We ran behind a tree and waited until it was all over. 	DT NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP . PRP VBD .

I'm doing an act where I do a handstand and crawl across a tightrope, jump off, do a back flip off a trampoline, and then land on a horse. It is a hard act, and I haven't even completely mastered it yet.                 I'm half way through when my stomach starts to hurt, It feels like to bears fighting inside myself. What could I have done? I think to myself. I've never had stage fright. No, it has to be something else. I only ate what I always eat, So I know it wasn't that.                 I realized that I was tilting on the rope. I try to fix it, but that makes it even worse. I start falling off. Well, might as well make it work. I think to myself. I launch myself off the ripe and did a double back flip. I'm going towards the ground at an alarming rate. I could see my self going towards the ground. I brace for impact.                 Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see my bright white horse, Charlie, running out. My ringmaster must have seen what had been going on. My horse saves me right when I was just about to hit the ground and carries me backstage.                 'Well, that was...interesting' I say as I approach my trainer. His face cracks into a grin. 'I can't wait for the real thing.'

You cant just get into it for nothing, you need to have the flexibility and the right body. You also need have a certain talent. Responsibility is key to being in the circus. You have to be able to go to school and do different chores. The circus is a lot of responsibilty but it is so much fun!                            Seeing all the amazing tricks and stunts aren't easy for the acrobats.      2.They have to practice and practice throughout the rides. School, practice, chores, and more is needed in being circus person. Jumping into the sky fells liek your flying and jumping on the trampolines is better. You can have sooo much fun at the circus.            3.                      With all the practice and stunts you learn you have a great time out there. Its fun to see all of the audience staring into your eyes and telling that they are having fun! It is a great way to have fun and go there for the first time.

My little sister had wanted to see a special group called the 'Many Men' group.  When she found out that they would be preforming so close to where we live around her birthday she begged my parents for days and even months.  They said yes after making her be patient and then things got better for her worse for me when she won 5 tickets from school.  The reason I said worse for me is a whole other story.      I was seven years old and getting to go to my very first circus.  I was so excited because My parents got very good seats and I had been saving money up for snacks.  I had enough for an ice cream cone, a medium drink and three bags of skittles with $20.00 left.  The minute that I woke up, though, I knew that today was going to be terrible.      We were going to leave my dog at my neighbors house while we were gone those two days.  My older brother and I both felt like we should take him with us but our parents told us to let them handle it and everything would be alright.  We didn't listen.  We were getting into the car when we heard a screech.  We looked up to where the sound came from and gasped at what we saw.  A black  and grey cat dangled from up above.  We mom ran over with her arms out-stretched as if to catch the cat.  It fell after 20 minutes of my mom doing that and we finally got to leave.         After that delay we were keen to leave and miss one of our bathroom breaks.  That wasn't a problem for me because I never drink a thing but my brother drinks at least a liter.  The bathroom break was going to be at the 1/4 mark of the way.  We were about at the halfway mark when it happened.  My brother had an accident in his pants and we had to pull over to let him get into clean clothes.  That was a delay that took 5 minutes. Eever since my brother won't go near a drink while we're on the road.        We had just gotten to the circus, not bothering to go to the hotel after all of those delays.  I grasped my coin purse that held my money and we headed inside.  My dad took my brother to go get our seats and my mom took me to the consesion stand to get us snacks.  I ordered for myself  a small chocolate ice cream cone and a medium slush.  My mom got a big pretzal with cheese and a large sprite.  We got my brother two bags of ms and my dad a water.  We found my brother and my dad a minute later and the show began.  Halfway in the show my brother fell over the ledge and into the arena.  We had to go home early because we disrupted the show.  My dog was fine but that was the worst experience that I had ever gone through in entire life.  That was the reason that I didn't want to go with my sister to the circus for her birthday.

Get up Mary!'My mother called as she walked out of the tent. I blasted out of my bed, and was ready in a snap. I walked out of my tent and hoped in the pie car. As I get in my mouth starts to water when I started to smell bacon and pancakes. As I was eating I watch the crew set up for tonight's show.        'Mary come on.' My best bud Jane was calling for me.' Mary I am going to leave for school without you... if you don't hurry up.' I quickly got to my feet and ran over to Jane.'Ready?' I called as I ran over to her.'You bet!' She called back. We started walking to school.         'Jane what time is it?' I asked. 'Well...8:53!' We looked at each other then started running! Are school starts at 9:00 am. 'We are almost there!' I shouted as we ran. Finally  just before 9:00. As we settled at are seats we both were panting and heaving in the air. The teacher came in a minute late. Ok class lets start are session...         ' See you soon class!' Are teacher said as we walked out of class. It was about 3:00 now. Jane and I hugged and said good bye because we had to get ready to do are chores and practice for tonight's show.            It's 10:30 the show is over. I'am so tierd!!! As I walked back to my tent I thought about how being in the circus is not all fun and games it is also a lot of work. As I opened the doors to my tent I said to myself 'Another long fun day is watting for me.'     	JJ NN IN PRP VBZ NN TO VB JJ , PRP VBP DT JJ NN RB IN NNP NNP IN NNP .

So its nit really tha scary when you get  on that rope. Also when your on the rope you cant be scared. Also when the show is over you half to keep practing.       Also when your practing you still cant be scared. Also when you practice you half to do 12 or 15 times. The only good part is when you practice you could fall off the rope. Then when the show starts i fill like its only about me. To me my job is every thing scary,fun, and hard but then again its a really fun job to do. The only reason i stay here is because i have a lot of friends here.

Jo gets up and gets dressed for the day, then he goes to the Pie car to get breakfast. He helps set up for the show. When he's done he feeds the lions. He then talks and practices till the show.       He gets ready for his grand entrence. Everybody screems as he lets the lions out of their cage and he does his show. When the show is over he goes to the pie car and eats his dinner and goes to bed. He cant stop thinking about the show and more to come.

I was so frusterated that I wanted to leave, but my mom told me to stay put.  So I did and she took care of my little brother.  yeah!!! After that day I have been hoping that he will never get a toy like that again.  Also it is kind of cool but annoying.  So Thank you mom for making hime stop pushing the button.   Now at home I dont need to hear it.  Because mom told him that he can only do it in his room.

But really they train hard to make the Circus fun. A woman named Elyssa Angles travel to many cities everyday with her family.                 Elyssa Angles was a Circus Horse trainer. She loved horses very much. When Elyssa was only 6 years old, she had a white horse named Starlight. Elyssa trained Starlight to do many things such as jumping hurdles, standing up in her hind legs, and dodge obstacles. She loved training Starlight so much she continued training her with another horse.              At the age of 21, Elyssa joined the circus. She trained with her fellow friends Mikayla  Anson and Madilyn Kolhart. They were acrobats. They perform around the world for 5 months a year. She trained 2 new horses named Sunshine and Star. Elyssa and her horses were wonderful performers nobody will ever forget.

It is 7:00 A.M., the time I have to get up every morning for the circus. 'Why so early! This isn't fair!' I groaned. I swung my feet over my bed and put on my rosy red clown shoes, my polka-dotted suit, and headed outside for the pie cart.       'Ummmm...' I mumbled as I sat down with the other clowns to enjoy some green eggs and ham.       'What's with the green eggs and ham?' I said.       ' It's Dr. Seuss Day!' Wilbert answered.       'Oh.' I replied.       I gobbled up my breakfast and went to the schoolhouse.       9:00 A.M.- I sat down in the middle seat just before the other kids Henry, Joseph, Maggie, Beatrix, and Ralph sat down.       'Good morning class!' Ms. Calif  the acrobat said. Before Ms. Calif was a acrobat, she was a teacher.        3:00 P.M.- As the day went on, I got more and more awake. Brrriiinnng! goes the bell. School was out, and so I raced back to my trailer. I had taken all the clown stuff off, and went to sleep.       6:30 P.M.- 'Time for dinner!' my little sister Maya shouted.       We hurried off to the pie cart, shoved dinner in our mouths (we're late..) and went to go set up. Make-up, check. Suit, check. Shoes, check. Smile, CHECK! I thought as I went over it again and again to see if I was forgetting something.           10:30- The show was great! My trick was a success! Flipping off a running horse was a great idea! I wrote in my journal. 'Lights out.' mom said. I turned the lights off and drifted off to sleep while mumbling:   Sweet Success, Sweet Success. 	NNP NNP CD -NONE- NNP , VB , VB .

I'm 2'1, and 20 years old.I'll tell you about my life at the circus.          Sometimes life at the circus isn't just fun and games. Being the world's smallest man just isn't very fun sometimes.Sure I have 1,000,000s of fans all across the globe.But there's a down side too.              There a lot of bad things about  being the world's smallest man. People always cut in line because they don't see me.The cooks at pie car can't see me so I almost never eat. Worst of all no one takes me seriously because I'm so small and I have a high pitch voice. But there are upsides, and a lot of them.              The upsides of  being the world's smallest man is why I keep this job. I get to go all over the world and meet so many people, it makes my head spin! I get standing Os at almost every place we go. I get paid thousands of dollars each year.Those are the upsides.          Well now you know what's like being the smallest man on earth. Even though there are upsides I don't recommend being the smallest man on earth.( Even though I don't you could help it if you were)                       P.S. Don't become a clown either, they don't get taken seriously either. 	DT NN .

Jumping off animals, flying off ropes in the air, and people launching themselves high into the air. The whole time i was at the circus i couldn't believe my eyes was looking at this stuff. It was like all these circus people were monkeys. Everything was so crazy i don't think i blinked once till the end of the show.                          The scary part of the show was when the clowns fell right on to There unicycles. [By the way i absolutely positively hate clowns with all my heart] I still can't believe that there are actually cool things that were in my town. My seat was in the front row next to the cotton candy stand. My little sister was next to me. My best friend jimmy was next to me about to pee his pants. He wasn't the only one. I could've had a heart attack when the lion jumped through the ring of fire. That was by far the scariest thing I've seen. Even more scary then my neighborhood haunted house. Thats why why i liked it. I bet big jimmy felt the same. My sister probally liked all that gymnastics stuff.                               After that i was wiped out. My eyes still hurt from not blinking. My town has never had an event that exciting since a while ago. The only thing that was that exciting was when i was born. I am so happy i got a chance to go to a circus. When i get older i want to be in a circus family!

I am the animal tamer and I love my job. This is the story of how I became a kangaroo.                  One day on a sunny tuesday I woke up in my bejeweled trailer next to my pet baby tiger named Ggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Then i rode my pet ostrich to the circus ground to talk to the nice magician named Lola, but everyone calls her The Great Bannana.We call her this because its her stage name. When I got to her I jumped off my ostrich did a triple flip and land on Lola. I said sorry but she was mad so she punched me in the face and went to kick me  but then Wallllllprido my pet elephant whacked Lola in the stomach whith her trunk. Now she was steamed she vowed that she would do some thing horrible to me. So i went to my bestfriend Marshal the acrobatic to ask for advice he told me to say sorry. Then i went to her tent and said sorry but she did not acept it she said i would have to do a lot mor to makeup with her. Then the time came for our circus show so everybody ran to the tent getting ready. Thats when i got the idea to makeup whith lola. When lola was doing her act I came in riding a purple camel with one thousand flowers being holded by my friend acrobatics then the spotlight went on lola and i said sorry. Then something horible happened she started bloating up yelling thatsshe is alergic to camels and flowers. Then she took her magic wand and shot a rainbow bolt of light at me and i was turned into a kangaroo.           This is the story of how i became a kangaroo.

Oh you might think that it's fun to hangout in the circus with a bunch of clowns that might even be your mom and dad, but no. The circus is much different than what you think. The typical that is for you is the same as for us:             Every day at 7:00 A.M. We wake up, get dressed, and go to the pie car for breakfast, which is where the circus performers eat. The crews set up the tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.             9:00 A.M. is when the school starts. Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school, ours has computers, homework, tests, and report cards. because the circus performers are from all over the world, we get to learn new languages during class.             At 3:45 school is dismissed. time for a quick break! since most of my friends are clowns and acrobats, I get to play on the trampoline, I get to juggle, and play with their unicycles. I usually take out my bunny ginger and walk her around the circus.             At 4:30 I start my chores. I comb the horses and do my homework. After doing all my chores, I talk to my mom about ever going back home. Usually she says, 'but honey, I thought it was your dream to be here.' but I can't take all the tears I've been holding just suddenly come out. 'But mom i want to go back home. It's too hard to live here.' I cried.                  I have been here so long. Will I be leaving soon?

You can also be animal tamer.         If you want to be an acrobat, tohave to be trained by an expert. The easiest thing to be in an circus is a clown. The spot for an animal tamer is easier if you are nice to animals.         The circus master is the hardest of all. You cannot be scared when it is your turn to talk or show somthing.

I mean do you really think that you could get talents like ares from one lesson. Working with the circus isnt as easy as it looks and you can learn about me and what I do, emotional feelings, and just the fun of it in the following paragraphs.               First up hard work, the reason all this happens.In this circus we have actrobats, clows,trapises artists and so much more.Now that takes hardwork. As for me ,well Im all about the stunts.I walk across ropes, diveboard into a little pool and I sometimes train the elephants to do tricks too. But what makes this show is hard work.The typical day is pretty much training and im not talking about mentoring someone else, you have to train youself. After a long day of  doing that I go and eat at the pie car and conserve my energy for the mantinee.At the end of the day im completly wiped out and take a long rest for tomorrow.                Next, im going to tell you about what happens here a lot, emotional feelings.You may not know this but we are a long way from home, we rarely see are families and we can never stop in one place for too long.During shows you see us as people who are always happy and i guess you could say that but ther is also a downside to living with the circus.We work long days and are always thinking about that nights show.So now you see that the circus isnt all that you think.           Last I want to tell you about the fun that ive had with the circus.   I have seen so many things while being at the circus. I enjoy seeing the clowns ride on thier unicycles and juggling balls.Every night I go and see one of my old friends act, summersalting of the back of a horse as for his daughter shes trying to leap off a trampoline onto the back of a horse.The circus is so fun and nothing can spoil it                 So now you see that even though the circus isnt all fun and games its still the best thing ever and ever day ends with me smiling and knowing I made someone smile back.Thats what the circus is all about.This has been WORKING WITH THE CIRCUS.

That IS what it feels like, I thought. I got out my storybook and wrote down that thought. I am Jenelle Handler. I am a part of the Golden Globe Circus. We travel around the world performing. I am a trapeze artist, and the youngest one too. Many people come from around the world just to see the youngest trapeze artist in the world. But there is one thing that I wish could change. I wish I did not have to work all day. But it is very fun! I get to perform for many young children, and it is truly magical seeing them gape in wonder. I have so much fun everyday. I practice my routine on trapeze everyday with my other trapeze friends. They are very good, and sometimes I have trouble keeping up with them. But they always see me struggling and they always are glad to help me figure out one of the steps.           We have a performance every other night. It is great fun, flying around doing flips in the air. It is almost like I can fly! Tonight we did a spectacular performance, and Lady Electra was especially amazing. She was in a very good mood today, so she asked for more electricity in her ball of electricity. She even made the electric strands different colors!!! It was truly amazing. What else do I have to tell you? Oh yes!! The costumes were phenomenal!! We had turquoise leotards with a little tail that was so soft and fluffy it was like having little wisps of clouds trailing behind me. We had a small head piece with a turquoise jewel in the middle and little feathers sticking up behind it. Yes, our costumes were the highlight of the day.           I have yet another thing to tell you, yet it is not quite as good. One of our performers had landed on the netting a tad bit strange, and she twisted her ankle. She could not participate in the show tonight, so one of the trapeze parts was cancelled. Oh, how she cried! She told me that it was to be the most spectacular performance the world had ever seen, and now she was in a cast watching us! It must have been horrible for her. I know it would have been devastating for me. I watched her as she sat in a chair, watching us with longing eyes. I wish she could get better as quick as a bunny can hop!           So, with that, I end this story of one of my days in the circus. Don't worry, there are plenty more coming. I have about 13 more! I hope you enjoyed this story, Dear Diary. There's meny more for me to tell you, but right now I have to go to sleep. It already took me about 15 minutes just to write this small story. Goodnight, Diary.          Lovingly yours,               Jenelle Handler 	NNP , WP DT NN .

My family moved to the U.S. from Russia when I was five years old and began in the circus thre months after we got here. Life in the circus is fun but there are always downsides to everything. I will be telling you about the life, the upsides and downsides in the circus.            I will first tell you about the downsides for being a circus preformer. Well first of all, you never stay at one place for very long because your always moving. That means that you can never make friends there because you wont see them for another year. Another downside is you dont get enough sleep sometimes because the shows are so late. Those are the downsides for being a circus preformer.           Now I will tell you the upsides for being a circus preformer. First of all, its like being able to play infront of a big crowd. You also get to meet different people from different countries because so many people join the circus internationally. Being in a travelling circus you get to travel the U.S. and sometimes even the world! Those are the upsides for being a circus preformer.            Now I will tell you about the schedule in the circus. I usually wake up around six or seven A.M.  and go get breakfest at the pie car (were we eat our meals) and then help the crews set up the tent's and stuff for the preformance. Just like any other kid, I have to go to school at about eight A.M. It's just like any other school only it has one room. School usually ends at three P.M. and I usually take a break before I have to do my chores and practice for the show. For chores I usually groom, feed and water the animals sucha s elephants and lions. I also practice my skit, I am a lion tamer. Once I am done I eat dinner and then go to the show. After the show, I go to bed while the crew packs up and then we are headed to another town. That is a average day as a circus preformer.          I have told you the upsides, the downside and the schedule of being a circus preformer. It is really fun and hope to do it all my life. When I get older I hope to be a acrobat. Thanks for reading this and I hoped you learned something.

To be in the circus its really hard work. Just because you think your in the circus that schools out but its not. After school you do chores and clean then when your all done you have to practice a lot. Some things you have to do is feed and clean the horses. Then you have dinner and then the show is over.          You just can't come to the circus and just become a clown. You have to be ready for the rhode ahead of you. Plus you have put your heart into being certain that you want to join the circus. You give everything up to join the circus and concentrate on dancing and performing. Plus theres an up side to all of this you get to travel all over the world. thats the life of a circus life.

The next day came and we were telling our family and friends that we were having a party at my house.It was at 8:00pm. So then it was 8:00 and the house was packed with friends and family,but then my mom told them that I was going to a circus but it was different its like american idol but not with animals.So then they asked me to sing for them but i said if you give me money,and they said ok.So i sang When I Was your man 	CD NN RB VBD NNS VBG RP NNS VBG IN DT NN PRP VBP DT NN TO NN IN PRP IN DT NNP RB PRP VBD DT NN CC PRP$ NNS VBD NN IN PRP VBD -NONE- RB DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBG NN CC PRP$ NN VBD IN DT NN CC VBD VBG TO PRP VBG CC RB VBD IN CC VBD PRP MD VB CC PRP VBD DT .

There is an upside and a down side on being a circus performer.                  First, one of the upsides of being in the circus you get to travel the world. It gives you the opportunity to go to many places. You perform in front of a live audience. You get to have fun and play every night. It also great to see the faces of the amazed audience.                   Second, are the downsides. The life of a circus performer isn,t justfun and games. Circus performers work long days and stay away from home for a long time. On tour your always thinking about the show. Also you don't have time to calll home. You also work on the weekends.                    In conclusion, the life of a circus performer is hard. You have to have special skills and talents. There are also lots of ups and downs of being a circus performer.

I, John Parker, know that the circus is not crazy, even though it may seem like it. I live in a trailer with my family and friends. We travel all across the world visiting 100,000 cities a year! I help set up the circus and I perform in it too. My act is the tightrope walk.       This is a normal day for me:                6:30 A.M. I wake up, get dressed, and head to the pie car to eat breakfast. The breakfast is usually pancakes, bacon sausage, milk and cereal. After breakfast I have to head over to set up the circus tents, lights, and music for the show.                8:30 A.M. It is time to practice our acts. Like I said before my act is the tightrope. On the tightrope it is important to keep your balance so you don't fall. You also get a pole to help keep your balance. It is actually really fun once you get the hang of it. There is also a net at the bottom, so if you fall you don't get seriously hurt.                 10:30 A.M. After we are done practicing our acts, it is time for school. We have a one room schoolhouse that travels with us everywhere. We learn things that we would learn in a regular school, like math, science, social studies, and language. In the schoolhouse we have computers, tests and report cards.                 2:30 P.M. After school is over we get to practice our acts again. I enjoy practicing my act, so I don't care how many times I have to practice it. on my first try on the tightrope it was scary, but now I've gotten used to it.                 6:00 P.M. We head over to the pie car for a small dinner, because we are doing the show soon. We eat tacos and some salad for dinner. I have a big stomach, so I don't get full easily.                 10:30 P.M. I am completely wiped out. When I get back to our trailer I get undressed and go to bed. I have to get a good nights sleep because we repeat the same thing tomorrow.          That is a normal day for me at the circus.

We go to a one room school house with anything a normal school would have. We hang out with people who speak different languages beacuase they are from all around the world. At 3 P.M. school is over and i get to have a quick break. They other clowns let me play with there stuff too. 3:30  i have to do chores and practice. I feed, water, and groom the horses we use in the circus.   Its six thirty P.M. and we have to eat dinner. My family and I go to the pie car to eat. We do 10 shows a week which is tiring.10:30 and the show is over. and im so tired. I walk back to our trailer, as we pass the circus offices and other circus stuff. 12:00 AM im in bed. Im thinking about going back to my old home back in florida.The circus is fun but tiring. This is circus life.

I think that being in the circus is kind of cool. One reason is because you get to go to different kinds of cities and meet new people.     Something else about the circus is that the new people you meet might not even speek your language that is kind of another reason i would like to be in the circus. You would also have more friends because of all the people that would be helping.     Some of the jobs are the circus clown, acrobats, tightrope walkers, trainers. Those are some of the jobs you can get if you ever be apart of the circus.

Here is my most dangerous one ever.         It was a tipicle day, get up, eat, practice, show, and sleep. I got up and felt wierd, so i ate my most favorite breakfest, freanch toast.         It was about 10:00 Am and I was practicing my act for tonight when I thought it. I could jump off a 50 foot high board, through to burning rings, and into a pool.         I went up to my conducter and told him. He said it would be dangerous, but he knew I could do it. We got out all the stuff I needed and I tried it. While I was falling I felt scared, but after I got through the first ring I felt great. I landed it perfectly.         That night  I was all ready to jump. It got quiet and everybody looked at me and I looked at them. I jumped and felt the same thing as before then one, two three rings I was about ready to get to the fourth and last one. SWOOSH right through it and landed it perfectly. Everyone cheered and I was proud.

We have many people in our circus family, that include clown, acrobats, trainers, and many circus animals.      We travel to about everywhere you can think of. Even though the circus is fun games we still do school work. Not like teaching us how to paint our face and walk around with a big red nose or tripping over giant shoes. We learn math, science, reading, and more.     My favorite animal here is my pet elephant Rosa. Our circus first got her when she was only a baby. Rosa  was a little shy at first. Now she walks out in little tutus and struts her stuff.     I wear bright colored leotards and do acrobats with my sister Molly. My younger brother Jamie does tricks on circus horses. My father is a ring master. MY mother she does tight rope walking. Scary right.     Many things come across here on the road. We have always been in the circus. I was born in Nashville. Molly was born in Honolulu. Jamie he waas born in Austin, Texas. We have been everywhere i guess you can say.     Well i could write all day but i have a show tonight like always.

I like being in the circus because it is fun,and it gives you a rush when you are flying through the air. All you can do is smile and have fun. One thing i dont like about the circus is that you are away from home alot and some people have to drop out because of homesicknes. then we have to do addishions 1 day befor the circus. I do tite rope walking and i also do rope spinning.             It can have 2,3,or even 4 people in one act. Have you ever been in a circus or went to one? If not you need to we look forwerd to haveing a big crowd and people coming to watch as out there doing what we love!!!!!!!! What i want to learn in the futer and do as an act is 'tamming a lion' i think I would be happy and worried because one,*it would be fun to tame a lion and 2nd *it would be scary because the lion could go CRAZY and hurt you.  There are so many diffrent acts in the circus and they can be tiring at some points. some people dont get to call home. Ok i think that is enough from me on to Jenna.        Hi my name is Jenna i am one of theperformers in the circus and i am a lion tammer. i like to train them because i think with me growing up in  Texas and i like diffrent tyips of wild life and yes,yes i no there arnt lions in texas. I got into the circus by going to the circus and when i went in they wanted to know if i was good with animals and to this day i dont know why they asked that question. well i have told my storie so now it is on to Cole.        Hi my name is cole. i like hamburgers. They are my favorite food and this has nothing to do with the circus. Ok, so back to the storie i like to do tite rope walking and i find it fun and it gives you a rush whale you are tite rope walking. Have you ever wanted to tite rope walk? If you haven't, well you should. so i grew up in New Jersey. I LOVE talking in a jersey acsent. I  never grew up with any animals and i didnt want to be a tammer i came to the try outs and got in because i was THE BEST out of EVERYONE. I am awsome and everybody nows it but wont admit it.             I am lion billy bob mammi jo and i like to eat EVERYTHING they wont feed me 205 times a day and i think it is unfair!!!!!! Did you know that i am i the world record book for being SO fat. hahahahaha i should NOT be proud of that. Well i have to go by. OH, Cole Jenna AND most enportently KARA  says by.

You would also travel many diferent places preforming lots of nights and have really no friends.   You would have no pets that are auctully yours and your home is a trailer or  R.V.           Life of a circus would be kinda fun but you might get very frusterated trying to learn everything in one day.You also might only get to do school work for a couple hours.        Lots of people might think of it as a vacation all the time and it might be and it might not be. You get to ride horses, in little cars, elephants, and swinging back and forth on rings. You get to meet lots of new people and clowns. So I think circus life is a fun life.

Today, I am going to a circus and it is going to be so much fun! It will take about 35 minutes to arrive at the circus. Well my dad told me to pack all the stuff I needed for the circus. I packed three water bottles, a camera, and my stuffed elephant, Joey. My mom put all the things we are going to bring in the trunk while my dad started the engine. I hopped in the seat and put on my seat belt.             My heart was pumping with joy! I held my stuffed elephant, Joey in my arms and whispered to him, 'You will see lots of other elephants at the circaus, I promise.' My mom checked if I had my seat belt on and she gave me a thumbs up. 35 minutes has nbeen past and we are at the circus! We just need to find a parking space and pay.             We found a good parking spot and then paid for it. So we went in the circus and gave our tickets to the ticket man. Our seat were in the middle column in the middile row. I could see very well. And then the announcer spoke into the mic, ' Is everybody ready to have some fun and watch these amazing performers?' 'YES!' Everybody shouted. My dad told me the show was about to start in 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1... The show started!             I saw a juggler on an elephant and the guy on the elephant were juggling 5 bowling pins! And then we saw people doing trapeze on high distances! 2 seals were spinning red balls on their noses. All of a sudden, a women with big hats stacked on top of each other and threw the hats to the audience! One came to me, and there was a note on the hat that said. 'You are chosen, you may come up on the stage and learn many tricks from the clowns and our crew. Come on down with us and have some fun!' I went down to with the performers!             My mom and dad smiled at me in a happy mood. Then a friendly man approached me and taught me how to juggle three bowling pins. I got the hang of it and it wasn't actually that hard! Many people were cheering for me! I was so happy and proud of myself! So now I knew how it felt to be in a circus. The feeling deep down in my heart was full of passion! 10 minutes later, I went back to my seats with my parents. They gave me a kiss on the cheek and gave me a hug. It felt warm.             The circus crew is going to do the grand finalle! They brought out a flag and one person was holding a green flag and went to ride the bike. One by one, people at the crew jumped on the bike and waved their green bike! There were like 27 people on on bike waving their flag saying, ' Hoped you enjoyed our show! Thank you all!' When the show was over, I had a really good mood and told my parents, 'mom, dad, I want to woek at a circus someday.' They smiled at eac other and then looked at me. They said, 'Of course you can dear.' They gave me a big hug and told me to get in the car. I put my seat belt on, held onto Joey, and went back home.

This was the perfect job for her. so she bought a ticket and watched the show. It was amazing, she wanted to be in the circus too after that. After the show she ask the ring master if she could join the circus and they said yes. she got the job of a usher. It was soooo boring. she wanted to out there, showing off her magic.                           Then one day she wanted to make a bet with in the ring master, to let her be a magician in the show if she can clean the tent in 10 seconds flat tomorrow. He accepted the bet, he thought that she couldn't do it. She practice all night. The the ring came in the tent with his stop watch, then he started it when she was ready. She cleaned the tent so gracfully and fast it was 5 seconds flat.                            The ring master was impressed and shocked to see that she did it in 5 seconds.

So, most people think that the circus is a crazy place but it is not that crazy it is just people as a cast working together to get the show.When it is time to get ready for a show at the beging of the day they eat in a pie crat if you are in the show and are not a kid then it is time for tranning.       Acrobatices is something you have to wrok hard on with the rope and the fliping and up in the air it takes a lot of partices.Some people have to tran with loins and horses.

You have practice very hard, you work long hours and weekends, and you spend a lot of time away from home. Some people spend over seven months away from home!       First,   You have to get up early to get your food at the pie car and get dressed. You also have to do chores and practice your act. Some chores include grooming the show animals. If you want to be an acrobat, you can't just sign up with no experience. You have to have a fit body, lots of energy, and determination. You also have to do a lot of shows. You almost never get a break.       Next,   In the world of a circus, you just don't do chores and perform. You have to go to school, too! Since there are some people in circuses from around the world, they might speak a different language. Sometimes they might know english and they can tell you about their country! That's one way to learn more about a country that you would like to visit.       Afterward,   Some people never have time to do what they want. They have so many shows a week that there isn't enough time. When I was in a play called, 'The Little Mermaid, Jr.' I wanted to spend time with my friends, but with rehearsal I never had time. The good yet bad newsis that it's eventually going to end. If you wanted to sign up for a sport, go for it. The bad part about it though is that you'll have to part with your castmates, unless you give them some way to keep contoact with them.       In conclusion,   Being in a circus isn't all fun and games. It takes a lot of determination and a lot of time. You have to get up early, have enough energy to get through the day, and you have to go to bed late. It takes a while to get used to it, though it's lots of fun. I would want to join a circus, would you? 	JJ NNS VBP VBG IN DT NN NN VBZ DT NN CC NNS , CC PRP VBZ RB JJ NN .

There is alot of trayning you have to do.       First, You would have to get ready for the day and go to school. Now, it wouldn't be all circus school, its just like regular school. Math, Reading, Spelling, Sciance and every thing else.       Next, You would have to practice all day till that nights show and that would be a very long afternoon. You won't realy get to eat much cuse you would be doing a circus in a cuple hours. And how ever you pracise it, thats how you are going to do it.       Last, You would be so tired after doing that circus thing and dont forget you have to do chors. So, inconclusion, its realy not that easy.

Not a scary clown from the movies, I'm just a clown. I like it when little kids laugh. I also like when I get to do things with hula-hoops and stuff like juggling around, Walking on tight ropes, acting like a monkey, and others. So to become a clown you need,   Lots of training Good breakfasts Healthy Not over overweight (as in 300 pounds) And must like to entertain people   So the first thing you need is makeup. Then you need a costume. Finally, you need a prop. When you need to train, just go to the circus and copy what the clowns do. When you do that for 2 years you will officially be a clown 	DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBP DT NNP NNP DT JJ NN IN DT NNS , PRP VBP RB DT NNP NNP IN PRP WRB JJ NNS NNP PRP RB IN WRB PRP VBP TO VB NNS IN NNS CC NN IN NN IN , NNP IN JJ NNS , VBG IN DT NN , CC NNP NNP TO VB DT NN PRP VBP , NNP IN NN NNP NNS NNP NNP IN JJ NN IN IN CD NNS : CC MD VB TO VB NNS RB DT JJ NN PRP VBP VBZ NNP NNP PRP VBP DT NNP NNP , PRP VBP DT NNP NNP PRP VBP TO VB , RB VBP TO DT NN CC VB WP DT NNS NNP NNP PRP VBP DT IN CD NNS PRP MD RB VB DT NN	2		20131024095447	556	1		20131024112709	541	2		20131025145742	543	2

I Katherin Pearce a horse trainer in the Mistic Falls Circus am nerves because the horse are all scared and nerves they won't stop yanking the rope. All of the horse trainer are nerves too. If we don't get them to calm down the hole show will end.             So before we start this is my story. I was born and rased in Texax. When I was little I always had a love for horses so my parents got me 1. I named her Jersey. So after that I begain to learn trikes on her. So before I new it I wanted to be in the circus. Like my great-great-grandad, but my Mom and Dad said know !!!NO!!!. So I had to finish scool and go to callage so I did. Then after that I rain ran away to the circus.                  It was hard to find the write circus for me. I wanted to be in the one that my great-great-grandad was in. Sadly I couldn't find it. Then out of noware it showed up.                 Then I ran right over to and asked'Can I be in your circus?'. They said yes but I had to tell them what I can do. So I did I told them about them all my tricks with Jersey. Also that all I need is my trailor and Jersey. So I got them  and went.            So now that you know my story I can tell you how I am going to get the horses to calm down. First all the hoses here have a great brian that we all trained so we just need to find the right comand to calm them down.  'Wait I got,'I say. We all have to get on our horses back and tell them to calm down. We all do it and it WORKS!!!!!. After that we preform and it's perfect.                     Thats the story on how Katherin Pearce and her horse Jersey saved the Mistic Falls Circus.

It's always been my dream to travel with a circus, and now it has finally come true. But your dreams come with a price. I had to leave my family behind in Sister Bay, Wisconsin. I told them I didn't have to go if they wanted me to stay with them but they told me to go follow my dreams and that I would see them again every once in a while when the circus went to Wisconsin.           Apart from my family, I have plenty of other things to worry about. Tomorrow is my first show. Ever. I've been practicing for for months but I'm not sure I've mastered the final trick to my act where I'm on a rope hanging from the ceiling and I have to twirl my self around in every which way and then at the very right second I have to let go, land on a trampoline and land in the arms of a clown who will be waiting for me. I know, right.            Well now they are going to make me go have some last minute practice. When I get there they'll be all over me. Making me put on some makeup and a costume then making me paractice my final trick. I don't want to go to practice. At least not today. But still I somehow  drag myself down the hallway and into the tent where everything is set up for tomorrow's show. 'Katie!' I hear my best friend Bella call my name from the corner where she is practicing her juggling routine.             She knows I'm nervous by the look on my face. 'You're going to do fine tomorrow.' she says as I enter the juggling station. I sigh. 'I hope you're right I say.' After a lot of juggling and practicing my little tricks before the final one  I finally get to practice what I came here to practice. My final piece. The rope falls and I grip it in my hand. Before I know it I'm being lifted off the ground and it's time for me to begin.             I spin in all different directions. Up, down, left , right. Now comes the hard part where I have to let go at just the right second. I take a deep breath and let go. I land in the clown's arms. I exhale. I did it. Before I know it tomorrow is here and I'm backstage getting my makeup and costume put on.  I head out and for a moment the lights blind me and then I hear the roar of the crowd.            Then I'm spinning in the air and the moment comes. I let go and fly through the air. I land in the saftey of the clowns arms. I did it. I have finally made my dream come true.           \ 	NNP , PRP$ NN VBZ NNP NNP NNP NNP CD NNS JJ CC PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP POS RB VBN PRP$ NN TO NN IN DT NN , CC RB PRP VBZ RB VBN NNP CC PRP$ NNS VBP IN DT NNP NNP VBD TO VB PRP$ NN IN IN NNP NNP , NNP PRP VBD PRP PRP VBD RB VB TO VB IN PRP VBD PRP TO VB IN PRP CC PRP VBD PRP TO VB RB PRP$ NNS CC IN PRP MD VB PRP RB DT RB IN DT NN WRB DT NN VBD TO NNP NNP IN PRP$ NN , PRP VBP JJ IN JJ NNS TO VB NNP NNP VBZ PRP$ JJ NNP NNP NNP NNP VBN VBG IN IN NNS CC PRP VBP RB JJ PRP VBP VBN DT JJ NN TO PRP$ NN WRB PRP VBP IN DT NN VBG IN DT NN CC PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ NN IN IN DT WDT NN CC RB IN DT RB RB JJ PRP VBP TO VB RB , CC IN DT NN CC NN IN DT NNS IN DT NN WP MD VB VBG IN NNP NNP VBP , NNP NNP RB PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP VB VBP DT JJ NN NNP NNP NNP VBP RB PRP MD VB DT IN NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT NN CC DT NN RB VBG PRP NN PRP$ JJ NNP PRP VBP RB VB TO VB TO NNP NNP JJS RB NNP CC RB PRP VBP JJ NN IN DT NN CC IN DT NN WRB NN VBZ VBN RP IN NN POS NNP NNP .

Today we are getting in a new animal.  Nobody at the the whole circus will tell me because they want it to be a surprise. At first I was like 'What! To surprise me with a new animal! Come on people, I've been working around Barku, the dog that is half dolphin!  And what about the Okapi that can fly with the wings of a bird!!!'                                                     I heard a truck pull up and ran outside. 'The shipment is here, the shipment is here!!' I exclaimed, loud enough to wake the man who can sleep through any thing. They opened up the u-haul truck's latch in the back, and went inside to reveal a lizard the size of a medium dog. 'Wow, so bizarre.' I said sarcastically.                                                               They took the little lizard into one of the cages designed for changing to fit the animal.  Later, I went to feed the thing a dead hare, and it spread some thin strips of skin on either side of it's scaley body, and flew to me.

Its six o-clock in the morning my family and I just woke up and we're all exited to go to the circus today, so because we're going to the circus we have to travel far and I mean far. We live in California and we're traveling to Florida, I know thats far but the circus in Florida is really good, and cool, and the only way I know that is because my friends told me, and we looked it up on the internet.Well anyway we woke up, took showers, and packed our things.We packed a lot since we're staying in Florida for a week.We left our house around seven-thirty and went to airport and arrived near eight. Im so exited because I never been on a plane so we went on and the plane was really nice we were in first class it was the best so fancy, and cozy.We were on the plane for about eight hours, we arrived in florida at four o-clock.The first thing we did was check out a hotel it was really nice, then we had some fun for alittle bit, Then after that we ate dinner at olive garden, and went to bed.                                                                                                                                         The Next Day                      ' awwhhh,'  We just woke up from our hotel and ate pancakes and eggs for breakfast. 'yumm' Then we went shopping for clothes to wear tomorrow, then we went to go check out the circus there wasn't a show we were just seeing them practice they were really good, I have a feeling that their gonna do a great job tomorrow, then we left and went to a fair we went on lots of rides, and booths.We had a great time today. Now we're gonna eat dinner, my mom is making spaggetti with prego tomato sauce and ground beef we have a meat sauce with our spaggetti. Fifteen minutes later dinner was done it smelled so good, and it tasted so good because we all finished like twenty minutes from when it was done getting cooked.All of us went straight to bed after that.                                                                             The Big Day                         We woke up all excited. Right when we woke up we all showered not in the same shower a different one.Then we got dressed, and ate we had Dennys, after that we relaxed for alittle and then left to go to the circus, 'yayyy.' Then we were at the circus and it was amazing there was a great introduction. Now the show is starting 'yayy.' It started off with a magician who pulled a bunny, and snake, and fifty dollars out of his sleeve, and hat.Then he disappeared.Then there was a lady who was cartwheeling, and doing tricks over, and with a lion.Then there was a guy who ate fire how can he do that without burning his mouth'HOT ,' and a guy who was a tight ropewalker who didn't fall it was amazing how can you stand on a thin little rope.Then there was a guy who ate a sword without getting cut, and a girl who was riding a lion. Then there was a guy who a elephant picked up, and then there was these horse that were doing tricks, then a guy made the horses disappear, Then there was clowns, 'ahhhhhhhhh,' clowns are my worst nightmare. ' ahhhhhh,'    'whoo' its over now its a little girl doing tricks with a bunny.Then there was a girl who was taking care of animals, and there was these guys who were doing comedy acting, and then there was nice acting  no comedy in it and then the last part is the magician reappeared and all the performers came out and did tricks in a circle.                           Now you know how my day at the circus went, and what i had to do to get there.    Didn't the circus sound fun.Besides the clowns.

The TV was on, and an advertisment was on the screen. They said, 'Do you want to see some real entertainment? Then grab a pencil and start drawing, because your anual circus is having a contest to see who can draw the best circus drawing in the history of the world. The winner of the contest gets three tickets to go see a circus near them. They also get their picture to be an advertisement all over the world.'            I turned off the TV, grabbed my drawing pencil, and got to work drawing the best picture I had ever drawn. It had elephants on it, trapeze flyers, and even a clown on a unicycle! It was very cool until I had accidentally misplaced my drawing the day I wanted to turn it in. We searched all over town when we finally found it by the toy shop. It had flown out the window, and the wind carried it over there.  I had turned my drawing in just as the deadline had arrived. It was the most wonderful drawing they had ever seen. I could tell just by the look on their faces.            When the time had come for them to announce who the winner was, my eyes shot right out of their sockets. They had called my name! When it was time for us to go see the circus, I took with me my dad and his friend. We all had a very good time there.We saw everything I had drew on my poster, only even cooler.  I still couldn't believe that I won the contest when I saw my poster on the wall of a building. I was always happy when I remembered the day I won those tickets.

I have been performing since I was five, I am eleven now and I have been riding and doing stunts off and on top of elephants for four years. when I was little, in my first years of preforming, I used to be the smallest and most-loved clown in the show. I used to wear a big fluffy red nose and with white face paint, red dimples, and a big fluffy rainbow-colored  head wig.                                                                              Show Time   Show day is my favorite day of the week. We woke up at seven o'clock this morning, ate our breakfast, then started getting ready for the show. Even though most shows start at night,we're different, and our show starts at ten in the morning. I went down to the trailer that I shared with my best friend Kayla, who was also an elephant performer. She was already dressed in her sparkly pink tee-shirt, black skinny jeans, knee-high white boots, white top hat, and a white walking stick with black tips. I know that this seems like a weird outfit to wear for riding an elephant, but we all have to mach the certain elephant that we were riding, so for me that meant white, black, and lime green. I walked over to my closet, and pulled out my outfit that i had had custom made for the biggest show of the year, and i was the opening act. My outfit consisted of black spandex pants, a white ruffled top, an elbow-length lime green jean jacket, a black and white top hat with a white rim, and a black walking stick with white tips. Kayla and I had to use walking sticks because as the opening act we had to open with us on elephants then doing a back flip off and then doing a dance. My dad is the ring master, so he is really important to my act, he needs to be able to direct the elephants in the right direction so i can do my tricks on its back without worrying about actually riding it.                                                                                                Lights, Camera, Action!                                                    I am waiting for my elephant to be brought to me when one of the handlers comes and says,'Becca, come quickly, we can't find Leafy!' I could barely hear him but I was so worried about my elephant that I couldn't think, then I came to my senses and ran as fast as I could toward the elephant stables. When I got to the stables I ran as fast as I could toward Leafy stall, but he wasn't there. This had only happened to me once before when I was nine and I forgot to latch the stall all the way, then I remembered where i had found him last time, eating hay! I was so happy that I had an idea where he might be, I took off running again calling his name as I went. When I thought that he was gone for good I reached the hay stack, ant there he was.                      The show ran smoothly, and I was the star of the show.  Everyone was amazed at how talented Leafy was and at the end of the show when they called my name i got a standing ovation that lasted for five minutes! This had to be my best show yet, and I was so sad to see it end. I love the circus, we are one big, loud, crazy family.

I had never been to the circus. I was going with my parents. They gave me five dollars to go get a drink. While I was walking, I saw one of the clowns. I went up to the clown and shook his hand. He said his name was Sammy. I left, but before I left he gave me a big red nose.        When I came back, the show had stared. I sat by my parents. I was lucky to have front row seats because I could see everything. A few minutes later I saw Sammy. He said he wanted a volunteer. I raised my hand as fast as I could. He saw me and called me. He told on to his hand. I jumped on. Then he put us through a ring of fire. I was really scared. It was getting really hot so I was slipping. Suddenly, I fell and part of my leg was on fire and I had broken my leg. I screamed really loud.        I think I had fell unconcious and just had a dream. When I awoke I saw I was in a hospital bed. I saw my parents and they  rushed to me. My mom was sobbing a lot. I looked on the other side and I saw the clown Sammy. Sammy was holding 'Sorry' balloons in his hand. I was really sad for Sammy because he could have lost his job. I asked my parents how long had I been unconcious. They said for three days. I looked down at my right foot. I saw part of it was cut off. The other leg was broken really bad. Then I asked Sammy if he had lost his job. He said yes. I felt bad for Sammy.        Few weeks later I had had surgery. I had got a mechanical right foot. I had crutches for my leg. I was walking with Sammy down the sidewalk. He was looking to get back into clown business. He walked to his old circus. They said he could join but he had to have a professional volunteer for his tricks. Sammy said he would join. Now everybody was happy. Just how I liked it.

I have a very tough life one reason is because I have to wake up at six a.m. and start practicing right after breakfast. I have a show every night at nine and they end at ten thirty it is really tiring.        Plus I walk the tightrope it takes years of practice to know how to actually walk on two inches of rope. It is fun and all but another thing is I have to stay away from my house and my family it is actually pretty sad when I think about them.        One thing that I love is that we travel around the world. We go to Japan, China, and all over Germany. In my free time I usually help the lion tamers work on there act. It is pretty fun to watch the lions roar.        By the way if you would want to be in the circus it takes a lot of time to practice your special talent. Because they dont let just anybody, and you have to work and work. Remember never give up!

For at least Bella Castini she knows the truth. She works at the circus and knows it is alot more work than many people do. She wakes up early and eats breakfast and gets ready. She sitll has a day at school. Like any school she has computers, tests, and report cards. Later she has to do many chores and start practicieng for the show. For Bella Castini she does en shows a week: one each weekday, plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday. Life in the circus is not what many people think, but in some similarities like school we are not that different from a circus crew.

Than you go over to the animal cages and feed the horses,elephants cheetahs ,lions and chimpanzees. then you groom them and water them so they dont get thirsty.           Later the trainers come and help you train the animals. The cheetahs get walked and the horses run, and somtimes the elephants practice standing on bouncy balls.               Its 6:30 and it's almost time for the show you and your family eat very little so you can get ready for the show, you put on your outfits and get started.while your walking out theres a homogaous croud of french people croading over the red and white tent. You feel butterflies in your stomach.               You go inside the tent and your doing your performace the people clap there clappers and eat cotten candy while your doing your act ,and then when it's over peole scream and shout saying thats amazing . and it wasent as bad as you thought it would be.

Have or have not I'm gonna tell you all about the circus! first of all there are alot, and I mean alot of cool acts.       One type of circus preformer is an acrobat. An acrobat is a person who does things like flipping off a trampoline into a net, or flips off of those swings that have a bar instead of a seat. That's the kind of things an acrobat does. Acrobats do things that you probably wouldn't do, as I just explained above. The things an acrobat does are kind of scary to think of, but they're really cool.       Another type of circus preformer is a clown. Clowns dress funny and do all sorts of crazy things. Some funny things clowns do is about 20 clowns climbing into a really tiny car, or honking a horn, and spraying water out of a flower in their shirt pocket. Clowns are really funny and cool.       In the circus there are also animal trainers. Animal trainers do things like making elephants do funny tricks and getting lions or tigers to jump through a ring of fire. Really they just work with animals. Some things they do with the animals are really cool.       There are alot of other circus preformers such as a juggler, or a tightrope walker. I want you to go to a circus and see them for yourself. Trust me. The circus is awesome.         	DT NNP IN NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN TO DT NN NN . NNP CC VBP RB PRP VBP JJ NN NN PRP DT IN DT NN .

Those people are wrong. we have a very busy and tight schedule.        In the morning, I get ready and go to the pie car for breakfast. Later, a few hours before the show, i rush out to the animal car and start training animals one by one. after i train the animals, i give each animal a treat. i give them a treat because that way they will cooperate with me.               the circus show is over. all the workers go for dinner. then, we pack up the circus and get ready to sleep. In the morning, we leave and go to another site. then we start all over 	NN PRP VBP NNP , DT JJ NNP NNP DT NNS VBP VBG IN PRP$ NNS IN NNS IN DT NN VBZ NNP NNP NNS VBP NNP PRP VBP DT RB JJ CC JJ NNP NNP DT NN , PRP VBP RB CC VB TO DT NN NN IN NNP NNP , DT JJ NNS IN DT NN , PRP VBP RP TO DT JJ NN CC VB NN NNS CD IN NNP IN PRP VBP DT NNS , PRP VBP DT JJ DT NNP PRP VBP PRP DT NN IN DT NN PRP MD VB IN NNP DT NN NN VBZ NNP DT DT NNS VBP IN NNP RB , PRP VBP RP DT NN CC VB JJ TO NNP NNP DT NN , PRP VBP CC VB TO DT NNP RB PRP VBP DT IN	1		20131022164534	693	1		20131023100038	562	1

There were so many clowns, one wheeled motorcycles, a trapeze and many acrobats. The crowd was wild and there were more than 20,000 people! Let me tell you a full view about it.            Our first act was the trapeze act. The trapezist swung between both ropes and hung upside down. Then his partner lit a torch and set the rope on fire. The trapezist then ran on top of the rope and he jumped back down.            The next act was the acrobatics and the act I was in! I swung on the rope and my partner lit a hoop on fire. I quickly flung and went right through the hoop. After this the crowd cheered.            Our final act was the animal act. We let out the horses and lions. The lions jumped through a ring of fire and then were bouncing on the trapeze. Then the horses ran through the crowd and balanced on the balance beam.            This show was great and I hope our next one is like this one too! 	NNP , NNP NN VBZ NNP CC NN DT JJ NNP NNP NN PRP VBD DT NN CC PRP VBD JJ .

The dangerous stuff might hurt you because they are vicious. It is fun because you get to do amazing things. The amazing things are like becoming a tamer,acrobat, and clown. There are other activities you can do like ride a horse.

There were clowns, unicyclists, actors who did the trapeze, acrobats like me, and many other people. Let me tell you all about it.       Our first act was the trapeze. The actor who did the trapeze swung upside down and right side up near the top of the tent. Meanwhile, a tightrope walker walked across a rope at between two towers. The crowd applauded.       The next act was the animal trick act. Five tigers stood on top of each other and the one at the top waved a flag. The crowd liked this a lot. There was huge applause.       The act after that was the act I was in. Me and my trapeze partner, Bob, did loops forwards an backwards in the air while swinging back and forth, while at the same time, clowns did acts like walking into each other to make the audience laugh. The audience liked this act the best. They applauded very loudly.       The last act was when all the actors came onstage and did their acts at the same time. The audience was laughing and applauding at the same time! After this act was done, the audience gave us circus performers a standing ovation. We bowed.       This performance was great. I hope the next one is like this one, too! 	NNP : PRP VBP NNP , CC PRP VBP CC NNP NNP NN PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP , CC PRP VBD JJ .

Matt was stuck with a rope tied that tied his hands together, riding an elephant. Matt was born into the circus, like everyone else, his dad is the boss. He had got up every day at 5:00 just to practice this act and make his dad proud . But every time his dad id there he turn into a colossal wreck. It was now breakfast time (7:00) I went to the pie cart I picked up some cheese bagels with clueberry cream cheese and hot chocolate.       School time, I am the best in the class I answer very question corectly. 7+9986= ? I knew that. Soon it is over,       Chores the one thing I hate, I have to groom all the animals, I love our baby leopards. More practice I am still not getting my act and it is the spotlight of our performence. Finally I get it but I fall down. Then I try it for the last time, with my heart, and I suceed with the last bit of effort, my dad sees me. He says,' Wow i am impressed I can't believe how good you've become lets wait for tonights show, lets see.'       Soon it is dinner time I am queezy an didn't touch a single thing, I got butterflies in my stomach. Finally it is my turn, my father was crossing his fingers, my mother is confident, and my brother is teasing me. Uncle Hoppy ties my hands together, and puts me on the elephant.  Finally I do my stunt , again with my heart I and pull it off. Everyone is applauding I was the star of the show. My father has earned my confidence.

Some people don't like workin in circus' because they get hert by animals that are not trained by a profesional.They not only play with animals they also do tricks there is also clowns lets go to the theme of the clowns.Clowns are funny and cool.Some people think clowns are cool and funny and some think that they are scary.I think they are hilarious.

Whats funn about being in A sircus is that you get to travel to alot of diffrent places.And meet alot of new people.You can get very hurt if you don't practice.If you want to work in A circus then go for it.

You have to know a bunch of difficult things like knowing how to trapeze, flexibility, and knowing how to acrobat. It's fun because you get to travel all around the world and showing the audience what you got. Even though you are away from your home and your family you got the circus as your home and family. That is all the things you have to do at a circus.       The circus is a fun place to be. You can see a bunch of funny things. you can also see many exciting things. There are also surprising, cool, and interesting things at a circus. This is how you would experience a circus.

It takes a lot of practice, too.                   The circus is filled with many acts. Like the acrobats, they are the flexible ones. They can do many things that we can't. There are also circus jugglers. I don't know about you  but I can't juggle. It takes hard work to practice every day and get it perfect.                   The circus also has funny things to watch at the circus. Like the clowns . The clowns are supposed to be funny its there job. Thats why they get gigs at circuses and parties.

The relaxing part of the morning is that you can have pancakes and bacon, everyday!       Even though you live in a circus, yo still have to go to school. But the cool thing is when you do geography, your lesson can come alive. Now that is cool. Also since you are a circus performer your classmates are from all around the world and they can speak other languages like French, Russian, or Italian.       Sometimes, you can take breaks and do other cool things like play with other circus performers. After that, it's back to work. You do your chores and practice your acts. Then you eat and get ready for the night's show. After the show. You pack up for the ride to the next town. Life in the circus can be difficult.

'The lion will be in front of the elephants which is in front of the zebras,' I said. 'We'll also need to get that spotlight in place, Alvin. Yes, it'll come on right after the animals leave. 'Now, Rishabh, remeber to give yoiurself a bath after rehearsl.' Sigh. 'Yes, you have to Rishabh, you're always getting yourself dirty. Brandon, please take the cheetah, the leopard, and the tiger out for a walk. Hurry up people! We only have a few hours left!           I'm Steven Ho, the circus manager, and we were having the biggest show of the year. We were going to have the chance to perform in front of the presidents all over the world! If they liked our circus, the Wonderful Animal Circus, they would spread the word around and we could be performing all over the world! Not only that, they would give us a lot of money to upgrade our circus!           I had thought that it would be easy, like every time we perform, but it was a lot harder than I had thought. We had to make sure that the place was clean, unlike before, and we also had to make it so that it looked fancy, also unlike before.           Finally, it was time. They appeared just very fancily, wearing clothes made from the finest material. I began, 'Welcome to the Wonderful Animal Circus! Today, we will show you the wonderful skill of our performers!' They then applauded, to my surprise.          We did the best we could, going through the whole thing without a single mistake. After it was over, I went over to them and asked,'Well, what do you think of the Wonderful Animal Circus?' They looked at each other, agreed on something and said,'It was wonderful! We were amazed and will spread the word as we promised! We will also give you the money that we also promised you.'           A few days later, I received some mail from each of the presidents. Inside each one was $1,000,000! I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe it! There was enough money to create two more circuses! We soon attracted a lot more people, and made more money. But the only reason was because the presidents had watched our circus.

My story is a very sad one. I used to be a rapper with  my friend Macklemore, but we got sick of the whole business, because rent started becoming high, and we were drove out of our store. So we joined the circus.       I used to be well known for my balance and rollerblading skills.   So I decided to be a tightrope walker.       Life is full of pros and cons for me.   Food is not a problem for me, and enjoyement is plentiful.           I have 7 shows a week.       Once in a while, I mess up and get fired, but getin again, for the show has only me as a tight rope walker           Some day I hope to be famous, for my goodwill and rapping business was ovesr forever.

Most circuses hire me to entertain the audience. I was once called as a tightrope walker from Europe and I fell of the rope. Luckily, there was a trampoline under me and I bounce back up and caught the rope. 	NNP , DT VBZ VBZ NN NNP NNP .

The truth is, circus life is hard, and you need to have a specific talent and train hard. Thats why your friend don't just run away from home and become a famous trapeze artists. That's why, I, Bobby Chan, is here to warn you not everyone could be part of a circus.          Usually, if your a circus performer, you are rarely at home. Instead, you are on a train, traveling around the world. I would rather stay at home than ride on this train, having a headache while typing and reading this story. There's not enough space to play any kind of sport. It's rather boring around here.          During the afternoon, we feed, and groom the animals. we also spend the time training for tonight's performance. We do all kinds of tricks such as juggling, and acrbatics. As I said, it is not as easy as you think. We had to train for years just to get a perfect flip.          I'm wiped out now. It's right now 10:30 P.M., right after the show. I just walked back to the train for a nice long sleep. It's much more conforting to sleep at home rather than over here. I'm warning you: Being a circus performer is not conforting.

It is hard to work in the circus,people get amused by all the trick we do but they dont know how hard it is and how many days we htave practise and to be in the circus you have to be flexable to do the fancey tricks.We have to almost around the world to entertan people and peform in front of lots of people.It is hard to work in the circus because you should already know how to do tricks or dance or eny thing else that is extremly talented.     To be in the circus your gonna need to learn quicky the moves a clown or an acorbat or even a magition to be in the circus.Your also gonna need to be flexable and tall to be an acorbat.If you wanna be an clown,you have to be funny or silly,if you wanna be an acorbat you have to be flexibal,if you want to be eny thing else your gonna need to be talented.      Not just eny animal in the circus is not normal some of them are domesticated.Its like if you train your dog to do cool tricks that is the same as being domesticted.Like some of the lions you see at the circus and also some clown dogs that are doing tricks are domesticated.      Most people want to be a doctor,a dentiset or a teacher but they forget that being in a circus is also a job.Like me i wanted to be a computer person but then i went to a circus and i liked it now look at me now im a funny clown who works at the circus.      i love my job and i think my clown friends do too.almost every one in this planet loves the circus because it is so much fun when you see it and when you in it.

Hi I'm Bob and this a story about me and my circus life.       Well at first, there was a town in circus that needed people with special talents and good confidence, they should be confident workers. So I said to myself, ' Why not try out. Right?' I didn't know that this was the start of a new life for me, but let me tell you what happened.       After a lot of stretching, I was finally ready to get in the circus. I was a super great juggler so I tried to for the clown that juggles. I was one of the two clowns that made the try outs.       After that I had a daily schedule and it was pure circus life after that. After a few months it was time for my first show. Me and my partner were juggling together and everything turned out great.       This was a clown circus so everyone was a clown, but the main clowns were me and my partner. We had the star act which came at the very end.       We tried even harder for the next show. Our starring act was even better. We were juggling flaming torches together. There were six of them.       At the next show there was a sign saying:   CLOWN CIRCUS:   STARRING BOB AND HIS AMAZING PARTNER BOBBY       That is my story, and now we are in the present. I finally retired after 10 years of performing. Although being in a circus is hard, if you are determined and hard-working, you are a recipe for success.

This is unusual for me because usually, I sulk in bed for at least thirty minutes before I drag myself out of my bed. Anyway, I threw on my clothes and clumsily brushed my teeth. I accidentally got toothpaste in my eye but couldn't help rushing. Today, I was going to the circus!                 Once  my parents and my sister woke up, I nagged them until they got out of bed. I flew down the stairs and probably set a world record for the fastest time for running down the stairs. I poured myself a bowl of cereal and accidentally poured milk on my shirt. At this point, I decided to slow down a bit. By the time we all ate breakfast, the show was about to start. We sprinted to our old Toyota Prius and started the one hour drive to the Afro Circus                  By the time we got there, I could hardly contain my excitement.We grabbed a few bags of popcorn and leisurely stalked to our seats. As we nonchalantly chatted away, we didn't notice the ringmaster come out. Suddenly, the crowd stopped talking as the ringmaster talked about the acts. The show was about to start!                 The first act started a few moments after the ringmaster left. An acrobat named Tom came out and did some flips that seemed impossible to human kind! As the acts went by, I watched every one intensely. One of my favorite acts was when a clown juggled on a unicycle while holding a beach ball on his nose. My all time favorite act happened at the end of the show. By then, I felt like anything was possible. For the end of the show, a performer set a ring on fire, and had a tiger jump through it! I watched wide-eyed as the crowd went wild.                 As we left the circus, I longed to see more. I asked my parents if we could come back. They thought about it for a moment and said, 'maybe another time.' As I think about all the circuses I have been to, I always think the Afro circus was the best of them all. You're probably wondering how this circus got it's name now. Why, that's because all the performers wore a rainbow colored Afro on top of their heads!

My names Ruben and I am a tamer for the circus. I realized I wanted to be a tamer when I was 7 because I went  to see the circus. Then I saw the tamer come out with a huge lion, and the lion did what the tamer said. So I went home and told my mom that I wanted to be a tamer. She told me,'If I wanted to be a tamer I would have to practice all day every day.' She really didn't want me to go to the circus, but she knew it was my dream.                                                            I'm 11 now and I've ben in the circus for 2 years. I've loved being in the circus but I haven't performed yet. But I can't be sad because today is my birthday and my friend Travis said he'll give me my present before tonights show. I've been wondering if I could ever perform in the circus? But everyone says I can't becauger thse I'm younger then them. I asked Travis if he could tell me what he got me for my birthday, but he wouldn't tell me. So he kept practicing for the circus, but I never knew what he does in the circus. He said,'That it was one of the biggest jobs in the circus, so I started of what his job could of been. I thought that he could of been the conductor, but I knew he was to young to be the conductor. But all the other jobs were aready taken so I thought he just helped around the circus.      It was 4 hours before the circus started and Travis still hasnn't gave me my present, and I couldn't find him. So I just went to help other people get ready for the circus. It's 30 minutes before the circus starts and everyone is ready for the circus but Travis. But then I heard Travis's voice really loud then I figured out what his job is. He was our new announcer! Then he said to the croud,'Please welcome our new tamer Ruben!' Everyone cheered for me as I came out of the back and I saw 100's of people all staring at me. I've never been more scared but excited in my whle life! So if you ever wonder what its like to be in the circus, remember it might be hard but in the end it's always worth it.

She was doing great until one day.She got sick because she was verry nervouse and scared.She was scared because if she made a mistake everyone would lagh at her and then leave but then she had a solution.If she was to scared to look than mabey she should put a blind fold on so then she wouldnt see and she could just do the walking on the tight rope trick.So she went when they caled her name she was a bit nervous still but she faced her fear and went out there. she went on the rope and did her trick and she made it she was so proud of her self of doing that in front of a million people.         So then after that she was never afraid to do the grand finales.After that expireiment she went to all of the other grand finales and did them whithout a blindfold.Sometimes she had the chills but she faced them and went on whith the others like the acrobats and the jugglers and the rest of the show case people.

When it starts a boy or girl will welcome you to the circus and it will begin. The first act will come out and do what they are practicing before the show. When they are done the audiance will clap and then the next act will come on.        When the act is done there is a break so you can get food and the acts can relax and wait for the the break to be done. When the break is done, they will welcome you back then the next act will come on. After that act the last act will come on. Then when its done all of the staff will come out and bow. When the show is done you can take pictures with the acrobats and the clowns.            This is what you can do in a circus if you go. When you go, it can be scary when the tightrope walker goes on the rope but it is fun to watch. I like th circus and can't wait to go to the next one.

I always practice in the mornings and afternoons. In the mornings i wake up and  have a great big morning breakfast then i go to training and there i stretch and start warming up and i practice as much and as hard as i can because trapeze is very very  hard to learn and it takes a lot of practicing.             Right after that i meet up with my trainer and we work on my routine that i will preform at the circus annd that i travel all around the world to many different places. it can take very many months and even years to come up with a routine, to memerize it, and to preform it infront of millions of people. Inbetween that (since i work on it for many hours) i get a big healthy lunch.          Thats my life.

It was the son of Hephaestus, God of fire. He told his son, Bobby, to never go out of the volcano, for he was not developed enough to defeat the evil Zara and his army chubby, cute, little kindergartners. The most vicious of their kind. They may look cute and cuddly on the outside, but on the inside, they're lean, mean, pinching machines.       The young Bobby was curious. He decided to take a peek outside. What he saw froze him. A land of big, brown, frozen beasts... TREES! They were amazing. He has never seen anything like them before.Then he walked in burning everything in his path. Then the unbelievable happened,to be continued...

First , I would not want to be a worker because you need to stand in the sun all day and people would complane how long the line is.Also you would be pressing buttens all day.                Secondly,If I worked in the circus I would work as a elephant trainer. The reason I would want to be a elephant trainer is becausethey are aesy to train and they are my favrite animal.                In Conclusion, I have reasons why I love the circus and hate the circus.

There are lots of fun things to do there like talking to the performers (if you get there early enough). You can also play games at the circus. The most fun of all is actually watching the show.            There are many fun activities to do at the circus! You could talk to the performers, play games, and best of all watch the show. There are also many different things to see at the circus. You can see elephants, clowns, trapeez, acrobats, tightropes, motorcycle cages,and many more. The circus sound pretty fun doesn't it!            I really hope this essay will win the contest! I would really like to see the circus from the front row too. Plus I would love to have the photo, and meet the performers too. Thanks for reading my essay. 	DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB TO VB DT NN .

Doing the stunts that we do in the circus takes time to learn. You also have to be very fit to do these things and you deffinatly need to have rock hard abs.       Doing these stunts in the circus may get you injured but atleast you aren't just sitting on the couch with a pizza in one hand and a soda in the other, you are out having fun. To be in the circus it takes time, dedication, and you have to believe in yourself. Being in the circus we get to see alot of wild animals but the best thing is doing all of the stunts.       I have always wanted to stay in the circus because it is to fun to leave it. Although we have 10 shows a week I love it. I know I might get to old in a couple of years to be in the circus but I can always sit in the audience and watch. It wont be the same but at least i'll get to watch the circus.

As I was walking I happened to see a poster that said 'Circus in town, get your tickets before its to late!' I was so exited I went right home and told my mother. Unfortunately my mother didn't like the circus. I begged her and told her it would be at a fair, finally she said yes.            It was a week from now but I was still so eager. I bought three tickets one for me, one for my friend, and one for my mother just in case she changes her mind. It was Friday now and tomorrow was the show. I could barely sleep soon I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up it was already 8:05 and the show started at 8:00! I was late!              I quickly woke up my mother and we drove off it was 8:09 we made it there with just enough time to meet Daisy. I begged my mom one more time and told her I bought her a ticket, she said yes. It turns out the show was also running late we made it just in time!           The show was amazing it had acrobats, monkeys, clowns, juggling,elephants, and so much more. It turns out my mom loved the performance she was cheering and clapping the whole way though it! afterwards we played many games at the fair I even got a goldfish! When it was 9:00 P.M. I headed home.             I said goodbye to Daisy and went to bed. My mom told me she thought the circus was a fraud and thanked me for showing her what a circus was all about. I will never forget the day I went to the circus with my mom and Daisy! The End!

The next day, I get to rest.It's Saturday morning,I have no practice until next week.Sometimes when I go to school kids ask me how it's like to work in a circus.I tell them it's easy I say at certain times I get to juggle easy things like bean bags,rings,and bowling pins.In harder times I have to juggle either in high places or walk on a rope while juggling.        On Monday, I have to start my routine all over again and have juggling practices.When I get to practice today my teacher tells me I am old enough to juggle objects that are a little more harder to juggle for my age.I got excited but nervous at the same time.I told my parents what they told me at practice.They told me they were excited for me and to try my best.So I did what they told me.The next day at practice I did try my best.My teacher told me I am going to try to juggle three objects and shes going to throw things in while i am juggling.                         Next week is my first annual circus show in Los Angles.I am so excited to perform in this show.My teacher told me I can try my new juggling trick in the show as a grand finale.Today I am going to practice for the show.The first three objects I am going to juggle are a ball,a bean bag,and a ring.                Today is the day that I perform in the circus show.It's close to the end of the show and I'm all ready to perform.It's the end of the show and I get my things all together.I'm done with the show.I did it!I performed in the show.Finally I'm done with the circus business until next year.

I will tell you whats its like to be in the circus.              If you want to be in the circus you must not get home sick. You have to travel miles away for a long time. You have to wake up early to make sure you dont miss breakfeast, but im sure you will catch on.            You need to have a talent. Once you have one you need to prectice. Precticing is very important because you need to be good. When you practice you must be carful to not hurt yourself in a way. You could look up some good way to practice your skill.            As you can see practice makes perfect and getting used to the circus life may be hard. You really want to be in the circus, and its your dream. I would go for it just belive in yourself. When you belive in yourself it will take you a long way in life. Never give up!

You could also train on a special talent that you excell at. In the circus, you wake up at sunrise and go to bed at sundown. Also if you are a kid traveling with the circus, you have to go to school in a one room schoolhouse that travels with the circus. After school, you have a break before practice for the actual circus. After practice, you have dinner. After dinner, the real circus show begins.People go on unicycles, go on horses, swinging acrobats, yelling hyenas, and dancing elephants. After the show, all the circus preformers, clowns, animals, and kids go to sleep in their trailers. By then, it is past sundown. The next day, they will be either be having a regular day or they will be traveling to an other city, or state, or country, or continent. Maybe someday you will grow up to be a circus preformer.

I get to see a bunch of the circus members do  amazilng tricks, like walking tight ropes or doing acrobatics. Even though living in the circus seems really fun, it is also really hard work.       Today I got the chance to perform with my family members. I got to walk the tight rope. I trained the whole day and I did did it. I would walk  across a tight rope and then, clilmb down and do a flip from a trampoline on the one of the horses.       Tonight was the night of the performance. I was walking the tight rope. I thought I was doing good, then I fell off. I landed on one of the horses and she was very startled. She bucked me off and I dived into a pool of water. I was  fine, but that was a very scary circus expeirence.     	PRP$ NN IN DT NN VBZ VBG .

My mom and dad were acrobats they were very good.They spin around just by one rope! My job is horse men or horse girl, the job is very hard but after a while it gets easyer. At the stables I train the horses to do tricks, like them jumping in mid air or bow with reaspect. I also train other pets but the horses I mostly train.                        At practice all the clowns,acrobats,and horse men go and practice there perform for the nights show. We all get ready but most of the time I would fall off the horses and fail, but I get right back up and do it over.

First thing as a circus you wake up really early in the morning you have to wake up at 7:00 A.M.  you have to travel 20,000 miles in seven months each year ,visiting 150 cities. We work to sunup to sun down.   By the way my name is Jojo that's my nick name our school room travels with us we have a dog named tank he's very playful.We practices a lot to get ready for the show.We don't eat much because we are going to performing tonight.    We do 10 shows a week  one each weekday,plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.   12:00A.M. I am in falling fast asleep.Today we are getting ready for the big show to night it's the big show because more people are coming then ever and so we are going to make the show even long then we had it  and we are going to more practicing then we ever done.   We are going to New york I never gone to new york my dad said 'this show is very different'I didn't know till now when I heard my mom said 'if a lot of people don't go the we are going out of bisness' so when I heard that made me want to do a big one like  jumping off a horse, or jumping 40 feet in to a pool of water or something like that. So i Started thinking of something I can do and then I got it I could jump throw a hoop and when I jump throw that hoop ill fall in to a pool that is inches tall so I got to work.   That day it came i made more flyers I' put on those flyers I said the big one is coming to night to 9:00P.M to 10:00P.M. come see it to night at the circus'.       I was so nervous i told them the show is going to be a little longer so when all the perfoming were done I went up I took a deep breath and jumped I closed my eyes and next thing I know is I am in the water I hear every one cheering my mom and dad came running and that's the big one.

She had been performing in the circus since she was very young. She loved to perform in front of audiences and wasn't very shy. She rode in trailers to go to new places and was usually busy when she was going to perform that day. Her mind was also very full on the days she had to perform because she was always trying to remember her performances. But every year she is always very excited to perform.          Every year when Lizbeth performs she is excited when she goes to California because she gets to see her friends who live there. When she is there Lizbeth also has time to hang out with her friends when she has time. Sometimes they even stay a little longer so she can have more time with them.          When Lizbeth and the rest of the circus performers visit California they usually do the same type of theme,which is animals. Here is one of the schedules Lizbeth did while in California:             7:00 A.M. They all wake up,get dressed, then go eat breakfast. While they go to the breakfast are there are circus people already setting up the area for the performance. The area is green with some trees surrounding it. Everything they are setting up is red and white. We sometimes help them set up some things if we have some spare time.                 9:00 A.M.- 3:00 P.M. Lizbeth has school, it is kind of like a regular school. The school goes everywhere they go since they don't spend much time in one place for Lizbeth to go to school. She learns almost the same things other people learn at other schools, but she learns about performing and other things about the circus the most at school.             3:00 P.M. Lizbeth's school is finally over she gets some time for free time. For her break she sometimes practices for her  performances. Lizbeth also sometimes plays with some of the equipment there. Some of the things she does would be to juggle, play with her pet cat, Fluffy, or just watches some of the circus animals. She sometimes even gets to go hang out with her friends.             3:30 P.M. Lizbeth practices some more for her performance until she thinks she has had enough practice. Lizbeth is going to be involved on riding a horse her performance. She very happy because she loves to ride horses. For that performance it will mostly be about horses.             6:00 P.M. Lizbeth and the rest of the members eat a little bit of dinner, then they get ready to perform.             6:30 P.M. They wait a while while everyone is entering. Lizbeth takes a peek to see if she sees her friend, which she does, and she is very excited to perform.There are many lights there but as the show starts the lights lower just a bit. They all enter riding a horse. Lizbeth's horse is white with some brown spots. As she looks at the audiences she smiles big at her friends.             10:30 P.M. The show is finally over everyone just wants to go back to the trailers and rest. While everyone is getting ready to sleep Lizbeth is just thinking when she will see her friends again.          As you can see, Lizbeth was very happy to see her friends in California and can't wait to go next year again!

Circus performers train and have to be in shape and practice to get it right.            The upside is that you get to show off your skills as a performer and you can be seen by people from different cities. you can also visit different cities you otherwise wouldn't see.You can even go to different countries.But with all that travel you have to stay away from home allot and don't get to see your family.             You have to usually wake up at 7:00 a.m. and go to bed at 10:30 p.m. and your tired way earlier than that because you have been training animals an performing for people all day.             That is how circus life is and i hope I can experience it if I win.             	IN DT NN PRP VBP TO VB VBN CC DT JJ NN CC EX VBP DT NNS CC PRP VBP TO VB IN JJ CC NN RB VBZ PRP IN PRP IN DT NN .

Now read the story about a boy who gets trapped in the circus.       As I walked down the hall of my school, I was tripped and fell out the window. As i regained counciousness, I noticed i was not alone. Many performers from the circus were around me and carrying me to a train. 'No way am i getting on that thing!' i screamed. so then i was off to see the world, and the performers took care of me. Then one day i heard a loud buzzing after a show, and woke up. 'GET UP NOW!!!!!', i heard mom scream for the hundreth time. So i just went back to sleep.       Was it funny? Yeah it was!

Then, he slept and slept and he slept right through rehersals and dinner and he even slept RIGHT THROUGH HIS OWN SHOW! All of the crowd was ferious with the ring master. 'Where is Caster!' they shouted.                Then guess who walks out while rubbing his eyes and yawning Caster and the crowd goes wild roaring and chanting CASTER CASTER!

After schools over I do some chores like polishing the tricycles and feeding the circus animals. Then after my chores I, practice my act and my feats.   Finally I end my day with dinnertime.   But NO, I head over to the show and let the audience see my amazing act!   After the show, I take a shower, brush my teeth, and head to bed. Then I think to myself: All in a days work at the circus.

We both agreed to do it and if only one of us gets accepted the other doesn't go unless we have no choice what so ever.'I can't wait for the auditions.' Vanessa said. 'Niether can I well oh yah did you read when the audition is and where or even what time it is?' I asked ' Umm maybe I'm not sure if I did or not.' 'Vanessa come on, I'll look at it tomorrow.' 'Night' 'Night'.   The next day we  went to the form and it was that day so we went to the auditions and I got in but she didn't and she told me that if I didn't go she would hancough me to the circus owners car.   So I went it lasted for six months I txted her every night before I went to bed. In the circus i did trapeze and I always got the most attention. The six months where over an I finally got to go home. I think I'll do this next year. And that's my circus story.

We are a part of the circus called the Luoma Circus. Every week we perform at least 7 shows, each one in a different town. I love performing as a circus acrobat but there are some different ups and downs of the circus life. We have to stay up late and rise early, plus amongst all of the commotion the children still have to go to school. I also have chores which aren't so bad because I get to work with different animals that most people don't get to see. Another good thing is that I get to travel around the world and see many places and meet different people who speak different languages. I guess overall I really like the circus life and think that it is better than regular everyday life. If you want to join the circus do it quick because it is lots of fun!

You also need to get the tent set up and get the animals ready.                When you start you need to get out their and have fun. their would be horses,elephants,lions, jaguars ,accrobatics,clowns and much more.                At the end you would have to clean up after the watchers,animals, and yourself. When you get home you take a good rest and prepare for the next circus act.

We were setting up our tents and as we were doing so a family came up.'We are the Jeuffers and we would like to buy front row seats to spectate your circus, Cirque De Lo, and its acts.'As I heard that, I shivered. I just knew they were inspectors. If they gave us a bad review, the circus would be ruined.' Okay sir. ' I took the money and gave them their tickets. Hopefully, they wouldn't come for the matinee. And then they were off, as quick as a blink of the eye. I called David, our lion tamer, over and told him about the inspectors. He looked scared, and may I remind you he was a lion tamer, so he called the owner.The owner, whose name is Lou, warned everybody, all the clowns, acrobats, tamers, and all the rest. 'We better make a really good show tonight for if we do horrible we go out of business!' yelled out Lou. And that didn't take a nanosecond for everybody to get practicing. I was just watching, for I just sold lemonade and tickets. The show was going to be a spectacular. Everybody looked so graceful practicing, but I,Timmy, just knew something was going to happen.                                                                                As the day went on, the tent got fully set up. Dawn was coming and everybody was on their toes. 'Everybody it's showtime!!' exclaimed Lou, who look like he wasn't scared, but everybody knew he was shaking inside. Then dawn came. Cirque De Lo was about to start. The Jeuffers were the first people to come.Then everybody else came. We started with are opening act with the clowns doing jokes and skits. Then we showed our four graceful acrobats, Trixie, Daisy, Melissa, and Dave. They did amazing stunts in the air and on the ground. Then, they came out with all of them combined, with a pyrotechnic end.The review from the Jeuffers was ' Wow!' and 'Amazing!' The Cirque De Lo became a big hit. We got even more costumers from that point. A couple years later, a fire broke out and Cirque De Lo became a end. I survived the fire to tell the story.

I hope it will be fun because I drove from Alabama to New York.                                                                                                                                                                       I got in my seat and waited for the show to start.Finally the host spoke in the microphone and said,Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our circus. There was something coming out of the curtain but then i realize it was a big elephant.I guess I'm going to be scared for the rest of the show,because i have never been to a circus.                                                                                                                  After two hours of horror i remembered i had a backstage pass.  I didn't want to see more horror but i spent a lot of money on this.The man looked at my pass and said i could go in.  I saw people taking pictures of clowns, petting animal, and  people feeding a lion!                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I  was scared of lions i just wanted to leave.When i was trying to leave a man spoke to me and said, Do you want to work in the circus?  I wanted to say no but something made me say yes.  The man said fallow me and i fallowed him.  He walked inside a big room, the big room had costumes and masks.The man finally said his name, it was Ian Smith.  He was the host.                                                               Ian asked me what i wanted to be in the circus.  I really don't know, I said. I saw a mask it looked like a mask that a wrestler would wear  I said i could be LJ the man who could wrestle a lion.  Ian was impressed, he said put on the mask we'll give it a test run.         The lion keeper unlocked the lions cage.  The lion ran at full speed i knocked it down when it came to me.  Ian kept clapping, now he was really impressed.  He said if i could sign a contract to work at the circus.                                                                                                     I  said yes to the offer.  The next day, I got to meet everyone. They said that were going to Maine to preform.  I was a bit worried because the only time i drove to a different state was Alabama to New York.                                                                                                      12 years later,  I'm still working in the circus business.  Everything has changed now its a family business.  I still love wrestling a lion and i always will.

He has seen a lot of people walk on a rope  and her thought that, that was a cool thing to do. So he started to  doing that and had so much fun.When Pablo was sixteen he officaly started working at the cirdcus and by that time he was really good at what he did .But by that time he knew how to do things that nobody ever knew how to do .So he was the first to ever do that typ of thing with a tightrope.When Pablo did his first real live show, all the people that where there loved him and the way he did all of his tightrope work.Pablo was so thriled that he said to himself,'Man I had so much  fun doing this ,I am going to make this my job, to work at a circus.'   At is next show he did even a better job and someone came up to him after the show to get his autogragh.He was so happy and by that hew knew that he was  getting real famous even after just two shows. Man, he was telling everone what happened and everyone just started laughing because they didn't believe him.After many many more shows he got old and retired. Two years after he retired he died of cancer.After all he was 82 when he dided so he was preety old by the time he died.Pablo worked as a circus tightrope worker for 43 years.THAT A LONG TIME!!!!!!!And that wasb the the great life of Pablo the best tightrope walker.

It would be delicious to have pancakes at 7:00 o'clock to get started.  Then I would juggle apples plastic plates, real plates and super hard ones.  Then bowls and even sticks. Balls rubber balls.  My dad is not doing anything that's in the circus, nor my mom.  I hope that if I were big I could do juggling when I'm old enough.  My brother Zack could do the circus tightrope walker.  My sister's Aloha and Kayla could do the acrobats and my litte sister Melissa could do the circus horses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The show is ready to start we get lined up and then choose who we want to be!  First my sisters come out to begin their acrobats they twril and twirl LIKE CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then I come out and do my stuff like juggling.  Then my other brother zach comes out and does the tightrope walker.  By 6:00 o'clockpm everybody becomes dizzy.  We each get a bag of popcorn take one out and then start trying to toss it around and as we pass it around by smallest to biggest the last person get's to eat it so faster and faster where trying to eat, eat, and eat.  Until all of It's gone.  Now for the final test the man said who can catch, throw, and juggle.  I raise my hand and he call's on me.  He says give me your name.  I said my name out loud for everybody to hear.  My sister's are cheering and my brother.  I take two steps back.  And he says,'' stand on my shoulder.  So I stand on his shoulder but he doesn't lift me up.  Everybody says ohhh awwww!!!!!!  And that's how I got so excided.  He hands me a pencil. close your eyes he says so I close my eyes and now open.  Everybody's talking about how everybody saw the pencil in my hand.  Tdaaaaaaa!!! he says.  The pencil was back in my hand. Everybody was cheering for me.

Before a show you have to were a costume like a clown, and acrobats, and jugler.If you work at the cricus you will get tired becuse the shows ends at 10:30. so pick wisely if you want to work at the cricus because you have to do so many jobs. Trust me you'll get tired at a cricus and you won't see your family often because your at many diffrent places.

Lizzy lives an amazing life at a circus. She got to travel around the world. She see's many different places that have very different people with interesting cultures. Another thing about Lizzy is that she has a best friend that performs with her. Her best friend is a white tiger named  'The amazing Tortellini.'.               Lizzy and Tortellini do a very fun act in the circus. They do a trick  where Lizzy rides in on two white horses. Tortellini is stuck in a cage on the other side of the area being laughed at by three clowns. Lizzy dodges a number of different obstacles and jumps of off the two white horses. she land on a big rubber ball and works her way over to the cage. When she gets there she jumps off of the ball sending it forward and knocking out the first clown. then she uses karate on the other two. She saves the tiger and the crowd go's wild. She often does photo's after each act.                one day Lizzy got out of bed and went to see Ttortellini but, he wasn't there. she asked the worker that was on cage duty if he knew where the tiger was but he didn't. She looked every where and asked every single worker that she possibly could if they had seen the tiger. They all let her down. The next day her parents,(who were clowns putting on all their makeup for the big shoe tonight), let her go to town. She hung posters up all over town. Soon the news about the missing tiger was every where even on the news. the animal catchers were every where, patrolling the city, dart guns in hand. Lizzy decided to go search for the tiger her self.                  In just seven days she had been to three different states looking and asking people about tortellini. In approximately two months she had been to two different country's and to so many different states that she lost count, and she still had no sign of the tiger. Meanwhile back at home, Lizzy's parents had sent out three search party's every day, three times a day. they were worried sick about their little girl.                 A couple of months later , Lizzy had made it all the way from AAustin Texas, to some where in London. She had not even seen a hair from the soft, furry, coat of the white tiger. ' It's like he just dissapeared.' She thought. Then all of the  sudden some thing knocks her over from behind, and starts licking all over her face.  When the licking finally stopped, Lizzy looked up and saw some thing that was very unexpected.  Tortellini was standing right in front of her looking as happy as could be. ' Tortellini!' screamed Lizzy. ' I thought I'd never see you again!!!' And Lizzy took her best friend and went home.               After about five months of walking, jogging, and running, Lizzy and the tiger finally made it back home. Lizzy was thinking about how her parents were going to act when they saw her. Were they going to ground her for the rest of her life? Were they going to make me clean up elephant poo for a month or two? Well there's only one way to find out. She thought. So she tied Tortellini to a post and went into her parents trailer.  As soon as her parents saw her they jumped up and gave her a giant hug. They told her that they missed her so much and how they wouldn't let the circus go on without you. They also told her how they new that she would find her way back home because she was such a determined young lady. But the two things they didn't do was ground her or make her clean up the Elephant poo.              Lizzy grew up and started a circus of her own. She had a lot of animals and people doing very different acts. but the best act out of all of them was the one including a little girl and her best friend. The white tiger.

That was her favorite thing to do.  They were in line and saw a clown.  Both the son and the daughter got a balloon animal.  They got their tickets and took a seat front row.       During the circus, they saw a tiger, a lion, and a seal.  It was so fun balloons everywhere.  The daughter got scared when the seal jumped through the ring of fire.  At the intermission, the three of them got snacks.  The rest of the circus they had fun watching.       After the circus they drove home.  They told their mom all about it.  They had enough time to tell her.  They fell right asleep at 12:00 a.m.  It was the best night of their lives the kids said.

Once the guy was done, I saw a picture of elephants and many clowns, all behind a  yellow back splash with the elephant dressed in a royal blue rug around their waist and the clowns had on their regular poke-a-dotted baggie genie uniforms that make them look like there sixty year old trying to put on a show.          ' Hey Maggie.' said Leo as he looked up to see what I was looking at. ' Hi.' I said unenthusiastically. ' I...um... see they have a circus going on in town tonight.' ' Ya, isn't lame. People dressed like there sixty and there trying to put on a show!' I said as I realized my temperature was rising and decided to tone it down.' It's stupid.' I murmured.                   Leo obviously didn't hear me because the next thing I know Leo's asking me if I want to go.' Wh...wh...what?' ' Ya you know go to the circus.'                    Then, off I go to the circus and me going to watch the elephants.                    'That was great!!' I said,' I'm definitely going next year!

Me, Kautious McNeil, loves working at the circus. Me and my family live in a gigantic mansion. We travel all over the world every 6 months. We visit 250 cities each year.                  This is the time I get up every day to work:                        6:30 A.M. I get up and brush my teeth, wash my face , take a shower and get dressed.Then I go to the kitchen to get some pancake and sausages.We all setup the lights, the tents, adn music for tonight.                                      9:30 A.M. is school time, I get all of my books and things for school. Then I put inside my bookbag just in case I need it for school. Just like any other kind of school we had computers, desks and ect. Because, I was a circus performer all over the world, some of my classmates had different languages:Chinese, Japinese, Russian.   The more we would travel the more I would learn about it in school.                      3:30 P.M. it is dissmissal time in school, meant that it was time to go home. The clowns let me ride their small cars and their juggling balls. I also played with my puppy,Pluto. Now its almost time for me to practice for the circus. so i put up Pluto and began to clean up.                          6:30 P.M. dinner time now. after I have finish dinner, now it's time to go to the show. We do a show every saturday and friday.   now the show is over at  10:45 P.M. I am so tired now, I am so ready to go home and get in the bed and go to sleep.                    1:30 A.M. Now I am in bed. I'm dreaming about becoming a acrobat this time. I can not wait until it is time for the touring season. I cannot wait until we go to Flordia for the summer break. Still when I grow up I want to be an acrobat in the circus. Do you think that will happen? It's still tough, busy, and fun just like always.

Later you have school in a one room schoolhouse with other kids who speak different languages. After school you have a brief time to play. When playtime is over, you do chores and practice your acts. You do a show, eat, then go to bed. Goodnight!

Some people keep there equipment.It takes a long time to clean up because of the trash people throw on the ground.Most circus performers like to stay up and do other stuff.we also use animals as performers such as lions,tiger,bears,birds and other wild animals.It is fun to play with the animals sometimes.               we travel all over the country italy,south america,north,america we travel almost all over the world.We travel by trains and ships.we sometimes dont have to travel.I sometimes miss home because i never get to see it i always have to travel from one place to another.my family have really fun time at the circus because they always get to watch for free cause  my siblings and my dad work there.Everyone that work there really like how it is.I always stay with my brother because it is fun to play around.Circuses look small but they are big you have to be very active to work at a circus.                People think it is easy to work at the circus but it is not.You have to practice alot to be able to get better at it.It takes hard work determination to be able to do tricks.Most of the tricks are scary.It takes a long time to get better at it.Some peoples parents are people are circus performers at the circus so it is easy for them to do tricks and stunts from there parents.The circus is alot of fun.Once you see a circus it will be alot of fun.

If not well don't worry today I'll tell you all about the circus. I'm Jane Parks I'm originally a Circus Acrobat from Circus Town you may or may not have heard of it but I travel all over the U.S. My mother and father Mr and Mrs Robin and Mike Parks Travel with me. They're also in the circus. My mother is a tightrope walker, and my father is a circus juggler, but lets talk more about the circus and not about me.             The circus is a terrific place. We travel about 20,000 miles every year, you think that's a pain in the neck take a look at my schedule below.           Here's my schedule:          7:00 A.M. - I get up brush my teeth and my hair get dressed and go down to the pie-car to eat breakfast while the crew sets up for tonights performance. (The pie-car is where circus performers go to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner.)          9:30 A.M.-2:30 P.M. - Time for school. Our school isn't that big it's a one room school house but we still have just about everything regular schools have like computers, tests, report cards and reading logs. Sometimes as we travel we perform with people that don't speak our language like once we were performing in Mexico and most of the students in my class spoke Spanish, I know a little Spanish but not enough to communicate with them so I just stayed quiet.          3:00 P.M.- School is over. This is usually the time to take a break and relax and play with friends or pets. I usually go to play with the my dog Snowball.          3:30 P.M.- 6:00 P.M.- At this time I would probably be doing daily chores and practice. I water, feed, and groom the three horses that we perform with. Then I have to put the head and body piece on the elephants.          6:30 P.M.- Time for dinner. Before our show we go back to the pie-car for dinner, but don't eat to much because after dinner we perform and the last thing you want is to get a stomach ache in the middle of the show, trust me its happened to me before.          7:00 P.M.- Getting ready for the show as I put on my performance suit.          11:00 P.M. - Show is over the day is done. I am exhausted and ready to fall back on the bed and go to sleep.          12:00 A.M.-In bed ... falling .......asleep... Zzz... sorry dozed off there for a second. Well I better end this before I doze off again.              Well there you have it, a nice little schedule about what happens in the circus everyday. I'm getting a little tired myself I better hit the hay before I fall asleep too. 	DT NNP . NNP PRP RB VBN TO DT NN .

Also if you get accepted you must train and folow the instuction they give you to do.And you also have to keep practice with a asistant or partner to make sure you done it right or everyone that is watching will laugh and your boss will be mad. If you keep on trying you would probably make the audiance go wow , cool, and how did they do that.But with hard work you probably wont even get booed off the stage . And for my opinon i think being a circus performer is actuall hard thatn you think .But to the circus performer who practice it probably isn't challenge .But with the hard work you can and will get accepted to be a circus performer, and you would reach your goal.

Another reason why you should not have a circus job is because you would not have a fun time. One more ligit reason why you should not get a circus is that it would not be fun.  That is why i think it would not be fun.

If you want to enter the contest you have to know alot about the circus.   Like they travel 20,000 miles in seven months each year visiting 150 cites. You have to wake up at 7:00 A.M to get dreesed and get ready. Then they go to school at 9:00A.M. One room travels with them place to place.  Sometimes they go to the circuse or the circus comes to them.  And its very hard because kids speak different languages like french , russian , Italian ,like her faimly is Italine.         After school and all that they do chores. These are some of the chores, feed water groom the horeses that  they use in the horseback acts.  Today we are practiceing summersalting juggling and other fun stuuf that is some of our chores we do.       6:30 is dinnertime.  My family and I go to eat pie car to eat,  but we dont eat much because we are performing tonight.  We do 10 shows a week : one each weekday plus a matine on Saturday, and two on Sunday.  At 10:30 the show is over and im wiped out from all the stuff I did.       At 12:00 am in bed im thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be niceto go to a real home in Flordia .When i grow up , will i still be in the circus.  Thats what my life is.       A clown is one of the activeds in the circus so is ring tossing, and horse teaching gyamasticks with a guy is another one that is the life living in the circus .

I stayed out for a little longer and went in the talked and played some football. I went in the house and didnt come back out until the next day and it kept going on and on. THen my cousin came over and then we played the game and went outside and made a weird video it was fun. When it was easter was fun too when he left I went bowling he was suppose to come with me too but then he left and went home. and I had an easter egg hunt after that day with my friends out where I live.

At 7:00 they have to wake up and get dress.Then they go to a pie car to eat breakfast.Then after they have o prepare for the show that going to happen tonight.So they first have to set up the tents.When there done doing that they then go fix the lighting.Afterwards they fix up the music and make sure everything is going just fine.                          At 9:00 after they are done setting up for the show tonight,they have to then go to school like any other family.There school might not be like ours but they still have to do test,reports, and a lot of homework.They also have computers like any other school.They don't just do that they also have to speak many different languages  because they travel around the whole world and the countries they sometimes go they speak different languages like French,Russian,and Italian.As they travel around the country their geographic lesson comes alive.                         At 3:30 they have to start doing a lot of chores.First they feed,water, and groom.then they also sometimes practice while doing there chores. So like your dad might uses somersaulting off a running horse.You would work on leaping on a trampoline onto the horses back, it takes a lot of balance and concentration.The others are then practicing juggling and acrobatics.Their neighbors walk baby leopards on a leash.The other trainers are working with the animals such as elephant,lions,and chimpanzees.                        At 6:30 It is dinnertime and the family and they go to eat at the pie car, but they don't really eat much because they are performing and they might do flips and they don't really want to bommet.If you work at the circus you have to work 10 shows a week so if you are going to be a circus person it might be tiring.                        At 10:30 when the show is over you might be wiped out and you have to walk it back to your trailer passing the circus office,conssesion stands, stables and trailers.Then two days from there they would go to another town and setup.                       At 12:00 you take a shower and think about how you did in the touring season. You might want to move back to your hometown where you were born.Then you go to sleep.                        When you grow up you may want to be a circus performer and think it will be fun but it may also be a hard challenge because you have lots of things to do  in the morning throughout the night and get to have a little sleep.The circus is fun but is a busy and a tough life.

Today were in Las Vegas,Nevada and I just got up and right now I'm practicing for the circus , I'm a lion tamer.The lions are very friendlily and sweet, what I do with the lions is very fun.What I do as my act with the lions is I put them on their stands and they walk around on them and then it's time for the fun ,they jump off the stands and stand on their hind legs for a second and then come back down  they walk around me a couple of times then I go on the stand then,  and one of them follows me up then I sit on that one that came on the stand and ride on  it back stage.     I wake up in the morning and me and my friends meet up and practice,a couple of my friends are trapeeze artists and some of my other friends are dancers their acts are amazing! tonights another show and I got to watch my friends what an awesome job they did!     As people say practice makes perfect .You just have to practice. So if you want to be in the circus practice hard.      And thats my story of how my life is in the circus.

Although most people think that being in the circus is an easy job, they're wrong. I have a very busy schedule. I'm occupied for most of the day.                 In the morning, I go to the pie cart and eat breakfast (7:00 A.M.) then I go to school at 9:00. I learn geography and math today. Soon, my geography lesson will come alive when we move to another city. At three school is over. I get a break for awhile. I get to ride on the unicycles and juggle, but soon my break is over. At three thirty I go do my chores and practice, I groom the horses and give them oats and a bucket of water. I have to keep my skills up so I can do the shows.                  Three hours later at six thirty I go get dinner with my family. We don't eat too much because we have a show and don't want to get cramps. I go to the main circus tent and get ready for the upcoming show. Lights. Camera. Action. The stage comes to life as everyone moves about. I brace myself and do a triple back flip of a diving board into a tub full of water. As I do this I think that it's really strange that my parents want me to do circus. They never get worried that I would fall or sprain an ankle, or even break a bone! I wonder why. Is it because they believe I have something for circus and I'm very talented? Or maybe they're just careless. Whatever the case they don't worry that I'll fall. I come out of the water and a lion jumps over my head. The crowd cheers. I leap out of the water and run up a ladder. A tightrope comes into my field of view and my heart starts thumping. This is my favorite part. I start walking across the tightrope. I pretend to lose my balance halfway through. The crowd gasps. Just as it seems I'm going to fall I grab the rope with my feet and lift my arms up to pull myself across. I get off the ladder at the other end and leap onto a horse that then throws me right onto another horse. That horse throws me up in the air and I come falling back to the earth, but, a lion comes and breaks my fall. I get off and take a bow. The crowd goes wild. They talk with each other and make gestures with their hands.                  All the performers go back to there trailers. I'm exhausted, but I can't wait until the next show. Now it's ten thirty so I go back to my trailer. On the way there are lots of venders and booths, but most don't have anyone in them. When I get back to my trailer I plop down on my bed, exhausted. I can't wait until the next show. I think about how in two days I'll be leaving this city and move to the next. I drift off to sleep on a matter of minutes.

That day I started to train and I would not stop till I got my tricks down.But when I did a trick that the worlds best clown did I felt like I was doing the wrong thing.So I said to myself I just can't do this thing so I said to myself I give up.But then that would mean I would let him down so I said to myslf again do it for the worlds best clown. Plus the worlds best clown would be proud of what i am doing cause i am doing it for him.                  It was time for the show then I said wow everyones here for me no I mean the worlds best clown.So when I got out there I did the trick of a lifetime telaporting out of here.When I got back in I saw the worlds best clown and I said no way but how then his mask came off.It was my Dad but how he died 4 years ago but 4 years ago the worlds best clown came which means he is my Dad so I ran to him as fast as a cheeta and said why did you fake your deaf to save you boy thank you Dad.

Yesterday we went to the circus and it was a lot of fun we saw stacking elephants and tightrope walkers and even clowns they were really scary.Yeah ,it was the best experience ever! Me and my friend Kristin went together to the Puyallup circus and we had a blast, me and Kristin were both in the front row and it was scary because when the elephants stacked they just about fell our way and we both screamed it was a bit embarrassing everyone was silent.                      The circus is a lot of fun but when I talked with one of the clowns I felt kinda bad I mean he never gets too see his family anymore there just in one place for so long and with the hours they work and the only day they get off it would be really hard to live like that.That night me and Kristin had a sleep over she was asleep but I just layed there with my eyes wide open just thinking what it would feel like to not be able to see your family.                  That next morning me and Kristin had break feast after I asked her about how she would feel if she were that clown she said ' I don't exactly know?'.Kristin left that afternoon it was still bothering me but I sort of let it go when we went to the circus again I don't know how so don't ask me.                    I asked my mom if we could go to the circus again just me and her she told me 'I guess so'.That next day we went to the circus but I didn't see that one clown that did the juggling I asked someone who worked what had happened to him he said 'he quit and he said something about going up to California to see his family his wife Teresa and his daughter Jordan and his little boy on the way Daniel.'                           I was shocked but so so so so so so so sooooooo happy for him!                 In the end everything turned out good I called Kristin and told her the news she felt the same way I did so when you go to a circus make sure you don't make fun of the people thank them for giving up there family and friends to travel all around the world to entertain you.

It had all kinds of animals, elephants, lions, tigers, bears, ponies, horses.  We have kids on motor cycles riding in cages shaped like a ball, the bear juggling on top of a ball, the horses and ponies dancing to Mexican music, the elephant squirting water to the audience, lions doing the hula hoop, and the tiger goes through a hoop, but, the hoop is on fire.   One day Melanie went to school and handed out flyers for the show.  The flyers worked because a lot of people came.  But this show was not good because the tiger got on fire when he went through the hoop. Then the whole tent got on fire. It was a disaster.  Then they lost the job.                                                        It was a month later, Melanie's dad got a call on his phone. It was they circus company.  They said that will give them another chance but, if they mess up, no more chances.  Melanie and her dad were so excited. They called everybody so they can start practicing as soon as possible. They got the animals back. Melanie handed out papers at school and her dad handed put them on walls. They where back in business. Today was the show. Both of them where supper nervous. It was the beginning of the show, everything started out good. Then it came to the tigers performance. Tiger made it through with out catching on fire!  It was a perfect show! They get to keep the job!  Yay!

People go to the circus to see great tricks that clowns do.   Not a lot of people join the circus the people who talnets can join the circus.

They are my favorite because they are really flexible and good at doing cool piramids and all the tricks are very cool. If i could be in the circus everyday i would cause i love the circus its very entertaining to many kids and adults. Circus performs encurage many kids to be in a circus. When i first heard of a circus i thought it was just a bunch of random people dancing and singing but when i finally saw it my chin dropped it was the most amazing thing ive ever saw. After that day i kept on waiting intil the circus came to my town again. Some people think that we work hard and they forst and beat the animals i the circus to do what we teach them but we dont we keep practicing it with the animals til they can do it right. Like most people sy practice makes perfect.

Philippa has worked all over the planent, including Australia, Japan and all North America. The circus has given me the opportunity to go so many different places and meet so many different people. I travel on the road with 100 people who are like a circus family to me, who are with me the whole time. When you're young, it's the time to do it. It's the time to travel, the time to grow and experince your life. Philippa also gets a thrill from performing in front of  a live audience. I get to play and have fun every night. It's great to see the faces of the audience just jump alive when I make eye contact with them during the performance. You can see the audience being transpoterd to antother world. Despite what many peoplr think, the life of a circus performer isn't all high flying fun games and clowning around. And more glamores than being a accountant, but there are some drawbacks.

I said to Mr.Pamper.Hi,I'm Katherine,and I'm,in the circus.I'm an acrobat.I can do flips,jumps and a whole bunch of  other things.               'Yes you may.'he told me.I knew I wanted to be an acrobat when I saw my first circus show,I was 10.I saw the acrobat doing those jumps,flips and other things to.So when I got home from school everyday,I went outside everyday and stretched.By the time I was 15????? I was able to stick my feet over my head and make a circle with my body.               You guys might think being in the circus is amazing as people say,it isn't.You have to practice all day and practice is all i ever do.It might be different for other people but for me it is always going places and having fun.Here is my schedule.                 5:00:I get up around 5:05 and then take a shower.eat,brush my teeth.7:30:Practice bending my body and practice retinue.Go around the city and take pictures.11:35:Eating lunch.Go back exercise some more.Bend body some more.Practice retinue again.I do that for about an 4 hours.4:00:Getting ready for show.6:30:Showing starting,still practicing.Ready for retinue.Show starting.                The show has started.                    'Now for the amazing Katherine and her lovely friend Jared!!!!'Mr.Pamper said.We did our retinue.It was awesome.So that is what usually happens in my day at the circus.

I'm in my yard right now practicing my juggling which I think I have the hook of! It is kind of like I have a second family. Alot of people want to be in the circus but aren't very determined, you have to be determined if you want to be in the circus.       I love to being in the circus because it is very fun and challenging, and I love a good challenge. I love all of the traveling and seeing all of the different places in the world. I also love all of the animals but they are a little smelly. I love alot about the circus but my favorite thing about it is performing!       The thing that I don't like about the circus is that there are alot of long tiring days. You are away from home alot. You also don't see your family alot either. The only thing that you really think about is the show that night.        The circus is really fun! Don't let the down sides keep you from trying out the circus. You would probably have alot of fun if you were in the circus. I hope you like the circus just as much as I do and I hope you try it out someday!

I look out the trailer window to see the birds are still chirping for the sun to rise and I can smell the sent of pancakes and bacon coming from the pie car. My favorite! I run over to dad's bed and tug his covers off with a rip. Oops, i probably shouldn't tell him about that, good thing he was asleep. I walk away like nothing happened, suddenly i hear a loud roar. Uh oh was a lion loose. I turned around to see my dad was the one making all that noise. Seriously. 'Somebody was bugging me in my sleep!' my dad says loudly. I start laughing so hard I fall over. He does this almost every morning, it's hilarious. We walk over to the pie car and gobble down our breakfast. School starts at 9:00 A.M. so i have to get ready fast. In our school people speak different languages. Another thing cool about our school is that as we travel on tour for our circus our social studies lessons come to life. 3:00 P.M. School is over and I get to play around a bit with the clowns. This is the only free time I have during the day. 3:30 P.M. and it's time to practice my act. Today I am practicing jumping from a trampoline onto a horses back. My dad is practicing somersaulting off of a running horse. 6:30 P.M. is when dinner comes around I can't pick out the sent of what the cooks are cooking, but I know it is something light on our stomachs because we can't eat to much before the night shows. Today especially because it is a Wednesday and we have a matinee after the main show. We go through the show with no problem. During the show it is fun to see the audience come alive with you and your acts. 10:30 and the show is over I am wiped out. It is late at night now and I'm thinking if I will stay in the circus like my parents or not. 'The circus sure is fun,' I think to myself, 'but it can definitely be busy and for sure tough.'

When you are getting stared to become a circus performer you have to have a talent.That just getting started their are so much more to learn or to see.       The circus has so many thing to do.At the place you can oddishen to be part of the circus. They jump on ropes,juggle things,train horses,and other stuff. I find it interesting to watch people that try so hard to do what they love best.       I learned how hard it is to be a performer.Before i read this i thought it was easy to be performer.the reason why is because the wake up so early in the morning.They have to get dressed put make up on and they probity have no breakfast.       The thing i like the most is that when the show starts you can see their talent when they do the stuff they do most.They travel a lot with about 100 people that are like a circus family.Some audience jump alive when someone makes i contact to the performers.       Circus performer work day and night they spend a lot of time away from home.Not all the time they have fun working some times they miss some one and their lonly.I would miss my parents now and then if was that long away from home.

My dad is the ring master my mom is a trapize artist. I can do trapize, horse things, tight rope, but the one thing really want to do is dance. My mom always says,' Your to young to dance with the big girls.' But she doesnt get it. It is my dream to dance with them. They do every type of dance from hip-hop to ballet. They can even dance on top of horses. They are so cool personaly they are the best act in the show.               I always sit in on their practices and some times they even teach me things and maybe they will let me become an honorary member of their group.The one thing about the circus is that you never really have a normal life.

Not everyone can be in a circus and if you are going to be in one you need to know that your scudele will be filled. Every minute counts.       Your morning will be similar to this. You wake up at 7:30 get ready and eat your breakfest while the other staff sets up the tents and other things for tonights show. If your a chiled around 8:30 is when you go to school and learn about things any other student would along with the history of the circus.       School is done at about 3:30 and i help out with the chores and rehersal. I tend the animals by feeding them, bathing them, and getting them show ready. At rehersal we go threw all the acts and make sure everything goes smoothly. Finnaly at 6:00 sharp the show starts and we perform in front of our audience of 600 people. Let the show begin!      At 8:00 the show is done and we are all tired. We eat a big meal then shut all the lights of and wash all the makeup on our faces. Im in bed by 11:00 and I think about the show and my home back in Arizona.       Its 7:30 and I am ready for another day at the circus.

Maggie had been in the circus for a long time but she had never been in a show before. This was her day and she was determined to make it perfect. If she messed up she would promise herself never to go into public again.                 She got herself dressed into her nicest clothes and decided to go out into the fresh morning air. Once she got outside she ran over to the gym to practice her part in the show. When she got there she noticed her dad was already there practicing tightrope walking.                When she walked in she startled him and made him fall. She wasn't afraid for him though because she knew her father was a great acrobat too. She watched him fall and then bounce off air as he grabbed the rope to stop himself from falling all of the way.                 That night, the night of the show, Maggie was more nervous than ever. She kept on trying to run back to her camper but her dad stopped her every time. Maggie had to be an acrobat and didn't want to have to do that in front of millions of people because she was afraid she would mess up.                 It was finally her turn and she went out onto the stage. She jumped up onto the rope and started to climb as high as she could. Then she started to swing the rope and hung upside down while it was swinging. She heard ooh and aah as she did the rest of her part without any mistakes.                 At the end she was so relieved that she had done it right she decided she wanted to be in the circus forever. Even though she did make mistakes sometimes, Maggie grew up to be a famous acrobat.

The hard thing is that how you have to live in a moving van and how they eat on the road and do thing's like one day here and one day there.                                                               The verey bad thing is how  you can't see your faimly also if you are married you cant see your  husdind or wife.Another way that is bad is that if you have kid's you cant see them or be there for them.                                                   The mane resign is that you cant see your family at all or friends or thing that are close to you.Then you also don't really make a living because you don't make like any money, you would have to travel so you couldn't stay some place were you like and you have to get to the live stle before you can do it for many year's.                                                                      So the verey mane raisen is that you will have to get youst of the lifestley and you cant see family or friend's that you are close to or anyting like that so that.... So I think that's going to be the end of this Life in a circus.....that's all.

Every day of her life is full of tamed lions, flexible acrobats, horn hoking clowns, and cheers from the audience when she does a show.                     Stepahanie's act in the circus is the tightrope, cannon balling, and doing acrobat acts. ' The cannon balling is my favorite act because, when my brother lights the cannon with a match, I feel like I'm flying.' qoutes Stephanie.                    If you thought Stephanie travels alone in the circus, well, you thought wrong! she travels in the circus with her older brother Scott, older sister Samantha, younger brother Jimmy, mom Jessica, and dad Brian. Each year, Stephanie and her family travel hundreds and thousands of miles.                   Being in the circus can be fun and games and all, but there's also your studies and dedication that you put into your act in the circus. Stephanie and her family also travel with lots of helpers that help with putting up the tents, music, lights, and training for their acts.                     Stephanie and her family live in an R.V. during the circus. They eat in there, play games, and eat. When the Roberts family are not doing the circus, they spend thier time in thier two story house on the beach in Miami, Flordia. The Roberts family do the show 7 times a week. One each day of the week. They do the circus for 2 1/2 months and then go home. That is 'THE CIRCUS'                     	DT NNP IN : NNP NNP NNP NNP , DT CD JJ NN , WP VBZ IN DT NN , VBZ DT RB JJ , JJ , CC VBG NNP NNP NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ JJ IN VBN NNS , JJ NNS , NN VBG NNS , CC NNS IN DT NN WRB PRP VBZ DT NNP NNP POS NN IN DT NN VBZ DT NN , NN VBG , CC VBG NN NNP '' NNP NN VBG VBZ PRP$ JJ NN IN , WRB PRP$ NN NNS DT NN IN DT NN , PRP VBP IN PRP VBP NNP POS NNS NNP NNP PRP VBD NNP NNS RB IN DT NN , RB , PRP VBD JJ .

Me and my mom was excited because we got speciall treatment and we were waiting on our favorite thing to see was the Circus Acrobats and we never got a chance to see them in real life and it was great for me and my mom to see .So as me and my mom were trying to keep quite from being excited the host asked us are we ready and everybody  said 'YES,' and he said alright then and that when something special came out.                When some of the lights cut off i was scared but when two lights came shining on two people on ropes everybody in the crowd was like 'OOOHHH,' 'AHHHHH,' then the lights got darker and darker because when the lights cut back on they were hanging upside down meaning they were really upside down.               So yea it was fun but, it got funnier because the Circus Clowns came out and they were on little bikes fighting each other with balloon swords and one of them had fell off of the bike and the one that didn't fall off of his bike got up and squirt the man in the eye with a flower and the they just kept falling it was just really 'FUNNY,'  and it was so funny that when my mom was laughing she was crying at the same time and it was just funny the whole time.                The next thing we saw was a Circus Juggler and it was cool because the man had 6 bowling pins and 2 hoops and then he started to juggle everything all at once and he went in a pattern like over and under , up and down and even round and about all over the place then he ask for a volunteer, lucky me because he choose ' ME'!! and guess what he ask me to do? He asked me to go and hold a hula-hoop and he had 6 bowling pins and 2 small hula-hoops and then he jumped threw the hula-hoops and then started to juggle it was amazing and I thought he was going to hit me but he didn't. 'WOW,'                   The Circus Tightrope-Walker came out and it look like he was going to fall way up there but he didn't he was very careful and then he did a split up there and laned right on the rope i thought it had hurt but it didn't and after the show me and my mom got to take pictures with the performers and we got a free snake on our way home so i told my mom that we must be the luckey ones today and she said yea and then that was it  for today                                                THE END!!

Then at 9:00 A.M. you would have to go to school.The one-room schoolhouse would travel with you.Like other schools your school has computers,tests,and you get report cards.Circus performers are from all over the world, many of the performers speak other languages like French, Russian, and Italian.As you travel around the world,your geography lessons come alive.            Then at 3:00 P.M. school will be over,you will have a break.you might see clowns there sense it is a circus school.If you do see a clown they might let you play on their unicycles and juggle their balls.You can also play with one of the circus dogs.They might even have a tiger there, but I would stay away from that if I were you.            Then at 3:30 P.M.Time to do chores and practice.You would have to treat the horse.You wiil have to groom it and feed it.You might see people somersaulting off a horse.You might see people jumping from a trampoline onto the horse's back.            At 6:30 P.M. It would be dinnertime.For dinnertime you have to go to the pie car again.You don't want to eat alot because you have to preform at the circus.You would have to do 10 shows.After the show is over,you would walk back to the trailer, and wipe off all of the makeup.After you wipe off all of your makeup you would go back home and do all of that stuff the next day.

Its also really cool because you get to see animals do amazing tricks and you might even laugh if there's something funny.                                 I went to a circus ones and i in joyed it My favorite thing there was the acrobats people. The circus itself looks unique because its shaped like a tent, most building look just square. In a circus there are clowns,lions,tigers'acrobats people, and more. If your in a circus you mught have to work 7:00 when you wake up to 9:00 when you go to bed!                                 And in a circus its not just doing tricks you have to feed and take good care of the animals. And even when your traing it can be lots of fun. So next time theres a ticket or a poaster to go to the circus you should use it. :-) 	IN PRP$ IN DT NN PRP$ NN NN TO VB NNS VBP JJ NN IN IN PRP VBP CC VB VBN PRP MD VB VBN JJ NNP NNP RB RB JJ IN PRP VBP TO VB NNS VBP VBG NNS CC PRP MD RB VB IN EX VBZ NN NNP PRP VBD TO DT NN NNS CC PRP IN JJ PRP NNP NN NN EX VBD DT NNS NNP NNP NN PRP VBZ JJ IN PRP$ VBN IN DT NN , JJS VBG NN RB NNP NNP DT NN EX VBP NNS , NNS , NNS NNS , CC NNP NNP PRP$ IN DT NN PRP VBD VBP TO VB CD WRB PRP VBP RP TO CD WRB PRP VBP TO VBN .

Here a typical day for me:                            7:00 A.M.    I wake up,get dressed,and go to the pie car (1) for pancakes and bacon. The crews are setting up tents,lights, and music for tonight's show.                           9:00 A.M. School time.              Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school,ours has computers,tests, and report cards.Because the circus performers are from all over the world, many of my classmates speak other languages:French,Russian, and Italian, like my family. As we travel around the country, our geography lessons come alive.       3:00  P.M.  School's over.   school's over-time for quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles(2) and juggling balls. I also play with my tiny dog, Noble; our trailer is too small for a large pet. I'd like to join a soccer team, but we're never in one place long enough.               3:30 P.M. Chores and practice.   I feed, water, and groom(3) the horses we use in our horseback acts. Today, my dad practices somersaulting off a running horse. I'm working in leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration.Other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leopardson a leash. Trainers are working with elephants,Lions, and chimpanzees.              6:30 P.M. Dinnertime.   My family and I go to the pie car to eat , but we don't eat that much because we're preforming tonight. We do 10 shows a week: one each weekday,plus a matinee(4) on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and tow on Sunday.            10:30 P.M. The show is over.   I'm wiped out(5). Walking back to our trailer, we pass the circus offices, concession stands, stable, and trainers. Two days from now, we'll all set up in another town.                 12:00 A.M.  In bed.   I'm thinking about the end of our real home in Florida. When i grow up, will i still be a circus performer like my parents? Who I still be a citrus performer like my parents? Who knows? The citrus is fun, but it's a busy and tough life.                  This is how you can be a circus performer go to htt://WWW.kidzworld.com/article/4481-becoming-a-circus-performer                Becoming a Circus Performer                Have you ever dreamed of running away from  home and joining the circus? Think you have what it takes to be a acrobat or a trapeze artist, you think you have what it takes? To find out some of the ins and outs of becoming a circus performer, kidzworld  spoke with Philippa Handball, an acrobat and dancer with Cirque du Soleil's circus, Quidam.                Circus Performers - Getting Started            Not everyone can get in the circus and become an acrobat or a trapeze artist. You have to have the right body type and a specific talent. When Philippa's was five years old she stared in the circus. She did  Ballet , and  musical theater and all kinds of music, singing, acting and home craft. When Philippa was 11 years old she know what she want to be when she grow up a performer. So, she went for it. She gave up everthing else and concentraed  on her way for dancing and performing.                   Circus Performers - The Upside              Philippa got the change to go travel the world.  she go to see many different places and meet many different people. she traveled with 100 people.      Circus Performers - The Downside          The circus is not high-flying fun and games and clowing areund, but it is more than  just fun and ggames you have to work hard every day. But you can have some fun but you have to work. The circus you have to send time away form home. You have to do shows on the  weekdays and on the weekends. You do not get to seeyour family. You have to work long hours and weekends as well. You have to want it if you want to be a perfomer because you do not get to  see your family and you have to work long house.

It is all just really hard work.          My life in the curcus is tough.  You have to wake up really early every morning.  Right when you get there you have to do some drills to get you pumped up.  Those drills are so tiring though. Those drills take up about a half hour of our time already.         The good things about the curcus is you wilol meet a lot of partners in your group.  They are all really nice too.  Your group is the one you will be working in.  There is usually about ten people in your group.  It can be really fun sometimes.

All Mia wishes is if she could be in a class with all Americans. But Mias class come true like the geography because they travel around the county.           3:00 PM Mia's classes are over and she gets a break before the show. She plays on the clowns unicycle and plays with her cute little dog named Noddle. But Mia wishes she had more to her life. She wants to join a soccer team, or play a fun sport. She wants to go back to her home state Michigan, But she is to busy working in the circus when she feels like she does not belong beacuse she is only 11.           4:00 PM Mia does her chores and practices for the the circus because she has 10 shows a week and when she is done she is wiped out because there shows are so long. But this show was going to be  her best show because it was time for her to step up her game and become a acrobat!       6:00 PM My family and I eat dinner but not to much dinner because tonight we had a show coming up. We eat like that on a normal basic scedueal.           10:00 PM Mia comes back from the circus and she was so happy and tired. Happy because she did so great in that performance she wishes she could do it again. Then she thinks that she can do it again because she will do it tomorrow and that made her think being in the circus is what she is good at and that she is going to stay in the circus for now and see that happens next!           12:00 PM Mia is in her bed thinking about how good she did last night and how she wants to do it again because she never gave up on what she did so she could be moved up to a trapized artist acrbat or even a tightrope walker.

They open their sleepy eyes and stare out at their magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower. The sun is just coming up and is peaking through the holes of the Eiffel Tower. The crisp autumn air fills their lungs as a breeze enters through their open window. They drag themselves out of bed and into the bathroom. They are in a circus in Paris, France and are the famous twin trapeze artists with an act called Fire and Ice.            Half an hour later they are roaming along the cobblestone streets of Paris looking for their favorite chocolate shop, A Dream in Chocolate. Finally they spot the chocolate shop. It has old stone walls, a wooden door, a small sign above the door with fading purple paint, and three stone steps that lead up to the shop. It has a strong aroma of cocoa that you can smell from a mile away. They walk up the steps and into the shop. The store is amazing! It has rows of truffles, chocolate eggs, chocolate bark, chocolate hearts, chocolate covered strawberries and more all sorted by milk chocolate, white chocolate , and dark chocolate. The twins walk up to the counter and order their favorite, dark chocolate hot cocoa with milk chocolate truffles dipped in it.           Once they finish the hot cocoa they sneak back into the circus arena. They are not supposed to eat at chocolate shops, they are supposed to eat at the circus's pie car. At 8:30 they rush the circus's school where they learn French, English, Math, Spelling and much more. They listen to their teacher drown on and on until finally at 1:00 schools over. They walk to the circus arena to start practicing. The circus arena is a large tent rainbow colored with bright gold stars and flashing colored lights. During the show it is where everyone preforms, where all the seats are, and where they will be selling sickly sweet cotton candy that dissolves in your mouth faster than any other kind and buttery popcorn that smells so good you just can't resist.             James and Lily harness up and practice dancing through the air, flipping and catching each other. Finally it is time for the real show. James and Lily watch eagerly as other people preform tricks with lions and juggle swords until finally the announcer calls, ' And now introducing the fantastic, the amazing, the thrilling, Fire and Ice!' James and Lily hold their poses as they get hoisted up into the air , then finally the break their poses and burst into a scene of dancing a flipping and spinning in mid air so magical that it transports you to a different world.              At 10:30 the show is over and James and Lily get out their costumes and curl up into bed until tomorrow when they wake up and go through the routine all over again.

When they all sat down the show began and POOF came out the clowns and they were being chased by a lion. They hoped in there tiny car and road off.then all of a sudden the town's people were laughing for the first time. They felt so happy when the circus did more tricks.        But they had to leave the day after  and the town's people started getting sad because they had to leave. Before the circus left they gave them a special gift which was fun,laughter, and joy.And that's all  they could give since there a circus so the town was  not boring anymore.

She was inside practicing to be a acrobat.That was the only thing she wanted to be.She had gave up everything else but being an acrobat.She specifically wanted to be a acrobat.Not a lion tamer,not a ring master,not a clown,NO,she wanted to be an acrobat.

The rest of the week went by fast.All she could think about was the circus on Saturday.By the time it was Friday,She did her homework faster than usual,she ate her dinner faster than usual,and she even went to bed earlier than usual.It was Saturday.Mackenzie couldn't wait to go.She was so eager she kept telling her mom to wake up at 6:00 in the morning and telling her the show already started.It was 10:00 now,the show starts a 12:00 noon.Mackenzie was already ready to go.By the time they got there it was 11:30,perfect timing to get their ticket,buy some snacks inside,and sit down.The lights started to dim.Mackenzie was starting to get goosebumps.The show started with clowns,acrobats,and ring masters.It was just like Mackenzie dreamed.The next act was some elephants and a lion tamer.The last act was a tightrope walker.He was so high,he gave Mackenzie and her mom goosebumps.The show was over.       'Now it's time to meet some acrobats!'And we get to take a picture with them!'Mackenzie was so amazed when she met them.When she got home,all she would talk about was the circus.Her mom didn't mind Mackenzie talking about it all day.But she would get annoyed of Mackenzie if she talked about the circus for the rest of the week.Mackenzie yelled,'BEST DAY EVER!!!!!

Im in the circus by the way, and i do tricks on the tight rope. It takes lots of skill to get up their and not fall off. Im so nerveous because tonight is the very first time in this circus. Mom and I make our way to the pie cart and have our breakfast. Pancakes and bacon.            Once we are done, i have to practice, practice, practice. It takes talent to be in the circus and mom says that is what i got.  I am extremly nerveous because I have to stand on chairs, and ride across on a unicycle, and walk across on my hands. I am pretty good at that but I just think I might fall off if i get distracted.            We are almost ready to leave for the big tent. Mom is in the circus too. She works with dogs and trains them to jump through hoops and stuff. We are getting all our make up and outfits on. I practice one more time, then we take off.              Its finally my turn up their. 'Up next, The great Sarah!' The ring master said. I go up and start off with my back flip. Im good so far. Now i do my unicycle act. Thats good too. Now i need to climb on chairs. I stack them up one by one, untill I get to 6, then I do the handstand. I am done.            My mom and I did good.

At the end of the day all of the kids were lined up to see who was the lucky winner to get the tickets.....And the winners are drum role please bum,bum,bum,bum,....Billy, Samantha, Jayson, Julie, and..'please tell its me',said Todd..............Todd! 'WHO HOO!'said Todd in an enthusiastic voice.               The night of the circus Todd's family came to the circus. 'oh this is so exciting'said Todd's mom as they entered the big tent. Todd found their seats. All of a sudden it went dark, a little beam of light shined in the middle of the middle.'LADY'S AND GENTLEMEN GET READY FOR A SPECTACULAR SHOW!!'.......(clown music starts) Clowns come out of every direction they come from the smallest car I've ever seen! They put on a really good show.                     For the next act classical music starts acrobats swing off of one rope to another it was really amazing! As I raised my hands one of the acrobatics grabbed me out of my seat and swung me from one acrobatic to another it was kinda scary but in total it was AWESOME!                 After that Elephants came out of the end of the huge hole that was on the other side of the tent. Elephant tamers came out on the Elephants and lead them to a really smallish wide stool. Carefully they lead them onto the stool.              After that act the circus was over in total the circus was so,so,so,so,so,so, AWESOME. I hope that I win agian next year.

I took the phamphlet and looked at where the circus was. I was pretty good doing flips and somersaults I thought if I joined the circus I could go all over the continent. I registered to practice and see if they'll hire me. Next, it was my turn to perform for the judges. I said to myself quietly 'I can do this'. I did some cart wheels then a somersault, jumped on trapoline then flipped in the air. Then the judges talked for a couple minutes and said that I was hired to do the circus. I had to pack my stuff to go on the world tour              On the way I packed my clothes and things I needed and things that I could remember about my family. I took my suitcase outside and said good bye  to my family I thought to my self if  I really want to do the circus or stay here with my family. I went to the person who was in charge of the circus I was hired to. Then I asked hime if I could my family a few times a year here and they said only once a year or twice a year. I told him that I'd like to do that so I could come visit my mom and dad and my sisters. I was really excited because I LOVED traveling but I love my family too. But I would send the some of my money that I earned from performing in the circus to my family so they'll remember me.              Me and some other people from the circus got to go to Japan, Australia, Wisconson and lots of other places. I stayed as a circus performer to earn some money and have some fun with it I also got to visit my family. It was really fun to do this job because you get to learn about each other and it's like my circus family on my trip. We stay'd together on our tours we were never left behind or been mean to each other. It was a fun time doing this and having more friends but I had to leave my best freiends behind after I left for the circus.             One Monday night I thought to myself I have'nt gotten to see my family and friends in a while I quitted my circus life after 4 years of being in the circus. I missed everyone in my home town and some new neighbors came to move in. I thought I could open a little circus show once in a while with no tours. That means I could live on my dream and stille stay with my family.   I hope some of my circus friends come visit me some times. I sure miss them too.

When it came, the performers barely did anything. All they did was jump from one trapeze to the other until they reached the tightrope pole. It was simple as that. I told my friends that I could learn how to that in a couple of hours. As soon as I finished my sentences, I got transformed in to a circus performer! I was in practice, doing the trick I saw the performers doing. I then started doing the trick, but I missed getting onto the first trapeze. I brushed myself off, then tried again. this time I made it to the second trapeze. I realized this would take a while to learn how to do this.               When I got back from the schoolroom (I was about my age when I was in my own body) I learned how much free time I had. About a half hour. At home, I had a few hours of free time. I realized the circus life wasn't so easy.                Eventually, After a couple hours, I learned the trick. It was just in time, because the show was about to go on! I had a bit of time to eat at the pie car, but only a few minutes. The food was hamburgers. Not the best I've had.                At the show, I was after the tigers, and before the clowns. The tigers were a big hit, I got a good bit of applause, and the clowns were a riot. (a good type of riot) After the show, I cleaned up like everybody else. Sure it was quick, but I was wiped out. I got in bed at about twelve thirty (12:30).                The next morning, I packed up to go to Belize. Wherever that is. The show was easy, but I really couldn't understand anything. I was part of a South American tour. I went to Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. I wonder why the circus was such a big thing there.                The circus life is a lot harder than I expected. I thought it would take an hour or two for learning the trick, but this was a lot harder than I expected. Suddenly, I turned into myself again! I wondered how it happened how it all happened, but I was happy that I was back in my old body again. I learned that the circus is harder than it looks.                I learned not to underestimate anybody or anything (especially the circus). I tried to explain what happened to my friends, but decided to not tell that. Nobody really knows what happened right then and there. I guess that I froze time or something. Strange!

The first thing that you train for is to be a Circus Clown, the second thing you train for is Circus Acrobats, the next thing you train for is a Circus Juggler, next you train to be a Circus Tight Rope Walker, then for your lat training session you get to train 2 horses to do different trick everytime you make a the signal with you hands.

Also know how to balsnce your contolably and make sure you won't end up in a body cast because you fell from a pretty high up distance.

My first show now that I'm a pro circus entertainer!  According to my paper i have to meet at the pie car for breakfast.  Do I get pie for breakfast? Aperantly no, how sad. Turns out i just get pancakes and bacon.  More healthy than pie of course but I'm sure that everyone would want pie for breakfast.        What I have to go to school?  i thought that going to the circus would get me out of school!  Wow school ends at 3:00 instead of 3:15?  Awesome kinda.   We still do have to learn all the subjects but our school day is a little shorter. I have to do chores too?  Why i thought the circus was a no rules zone no fair!    I have to feed brush and groom the horses enven though I don't even ride them.  So not fair!       Dinner time but why not so much? I don't think any of us can eat that much cause 1.  newbes might be nervous and some might be sick if they eat too much.  Why cant we eat after we preform! Oh ya I'm in the circus but why can't I eat anything it's not like I'm on the trapezz I'm a tight rope walker!         Time for the show! I'm a little nervous but the anounser said its compleatly normal to be nervous before your first show.  The show was a complete success!  But is 10:30 it takes us hours to clean up!  Ok maybe hours is a little exarting but it did take us a long time!           OK fine I'm in bed bu 12:00 am but i am in the circus!  I wonder if anybody ever ran away from the circus instead of to the circus!  Funny thought!  As i close my eyes I think about how my life has now been changed! And I even got to change it by myself with no parents input! Now I might even one day get over my fear of clowns!  After a long day I'm happy to go to sleep!  That is  a first for me normaly im so full of energy but now I'm just tired!   So after a lot of thinking I think that being a circus performer is  nice but also hard work so never just say one day 'Oh I think I might join the circus today!'  Think about it it isn't all just fun and games it's hard work too.   	NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP RB VBP RB IN PRP VBP DT NN NN NN .

Lessons are for if you need help or to learn something like doing tricks at the circus,. They help you do tricks and flips and jugging and all of that fun stuff that they do.well lets get to what kind of animals are there,there is an elafant and a zebra, hippo, horses and pones and fish and lot of other things my personal favorite is a zebra because zebra have strips and i love strips but sometimes they can hurt my eyes very bad to were i cant see for a while, and that why i don't have a lot in bedroom well lets get back to the story. anyways a circus is very fun and you should go sometime if you have never bin there because you can win stuff and you can play with stuff and lots of cool things.

When I got to the circous I was so happy I got out of the car and ran to the other side. I remember that there was a perfesional singer, and every body was dancing,but i was more attracted to the circous performers they were really good at gymnastics and there was a clown with really bushy blue hair, I think it may of been a wig cause I have never seen hair like that befor.Then out of nowhere two clowns came from rops and landed on there feet and started riding bikes.                       After I saw the circous performers I went over to the rides.Me and my dad road this one ride that was 30 feet up in the air and was going back and forth at 120 miler per hour. My dads and my heart started beeting fast, so we decided to take a break for about 30 minutes and head over to the games. There was this one game that you had to trough a horse shoe around a bottle three times and my dad actually won something for me. He asked what I wanted so I said ''That big teedy bear in the leather jacket.''                          After that I got tired so we went home. The circous was about an hour away from my house so I fell asleep in the car using the teedy bear as a pillow and using his coat as a blanket.

You get to see clowns dance. You get to see people walk on tight rope and many other things to see and do at the circaus.                                                    At the circus you will see eliphants, hores, and much much more. At the circus you will see hores jump over sticks amd fences. The eliphants will do tricks on wooden blocks. And lions  will jump though hoops with FIRE on them (I think). Most of all you will see like tuns of clowns walk out of a flat  and I mean flat cartboard car.

Mo can't be in the circus, she's only 10! Well guess what. I can! But it's not all fun and games. My life is a lot like yours. But you know, In a clowning around type of way. I go to school just like you were we learn and play. But I do something you probably don't! I perform!                       I have to perform 10 times a week! Once every week day and twice every weekend day. But it's not too bad. I get to do awesome stuff like tightrope and trapeze and my personal favorite, Horse back riding! Horse back riding is when you do stunts while riding on a horse. And that's hard!                      Another thing I get to do is travel. I travel to different places every week! The bad part is I don't really have a place to call home. And I never really get to see my family. Sometimes I wish I was back home when I lived in Kentucky. but then I would never get to see my parents and little sister Hannah. I still just wish my agenda wasn't so crowded.                      So in conclusion, My life is ruff tough but fun all at the same time. 	NNP DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP . PRP VBP IN DT NN . PRP VBP WP PRP$ NN . NNP MD RB VB IN DT NN , PRP VBZ RB CD .

First, You have to be in a good shape to become a circus person you cant just come in and say'hey i like the circus cant i join' well you know what their going to reject you they dont know  if  you know anything about the circus.Its very hard to be a cirus person you need years of trainning.        Next, I will tell you how its like to be a circus acrobat. Well to me it seems very difficult but it might be easy to other people because i bet they practiced for alot of years to do every thing that they can do know than a couple of years ago.Also to some acrobats it very scary to them what happends if they fall will some one catch them will they die or will them fall and break their bones.       Now, I will tell you about tightrope walkers, you have to be really balanced to be walking on a tight rope like that and you have to have on the right shoes.

I am a very busy circus performer because being in the circus is lots and lots of work. I do many different things at every show. For example,sometimes I do comedy as a clown,train animals to do tricks,flip as an acrobat,and most of the stuff you usually see in the circus. Today, I'm in the trailer lounge,while a show is going on,eating pie and resting because I broke my leg being an acrobat yesterday. So the story is when yesterday my mom and dad were finished riding the elephants while I was dressing up with my older brother , Mike who was a clown that day, in the dressing trailer. When the clowns were finished with their act then it was my turn to perform. So I started of on a tall balance beam flipping and standing on my hands. Then I climbed up a mountainous ladder to a thin rope with a huge net under the rope about 100 feet below and then started hanging off of it with my legs and doing flips with catching the rope again with my hand. On my 6th trick, I tried to do a trick that I've succeeded before where I hold the rope with my mouth and spin in a circle with my body. It was all fun and games when I then noticed that the rope was bigger than the ones I've used before. I suddenly let loose of the rope because it was too big for my mouth and fell to the net painfully on my leg. The good news was that the audience thought that was the end of my act and clapped without noticing my slight tears. But the bad news was that my leg was broken and I tried hard not to limp on my way back to the trailer which had made my leg hurt even more. So it was very hard but, I've still got a show today just being a clown on a wagon while my brother and dad (who are clowns) fall while pushing my wagon. When the act was finished, my brother helped me do chores when  a week passed everything was perfect until my mom got pregnant and had my baby brother,Joey. He turned out to be the funniest clown while only being 4 years old. So life as a circus performer is hard  but I managed to get through. I wonder what's going to happen next in my circus life.

They also have clowns in it they have lots of fun in the circus .  They tell funny jokes. It is very hard to work in the circus but is very fun in it .  They throw pies at eachother.   All of the jobs they have look fun but i wouldn't be fun it would be hard to . I would be hard and fun at the same time .  It would be hard to go to school and go after and after that it would make me fell stresss.  It would be hard to go to school at the same time to.  It would be hard to walk on a rope that skiny.  It would be hard to go time to time .  It would go to 6 am and then 7 am then 8 am I wouldnt be able to go to all of those times.

Grace went to go check it was her  best friend who yelled Mary. Both of them worked as acrobats up in the sky high with Jason there best friend.Grace asked 'What had happen Mary?' Mary said that someone stole her costume made out of fancy gems. Grace remembered that she had one too and even Jason. There costumes were to be used that night. So she search in the trailer but no where to be found but something didn't seem right in there.Then she found it a small but white glove in there.Who could have a small glove?she thought. Then she ran out to see if they stole her costume and they did she couldn't find it no where to be found.By that time it was almost time for the show and still didn't have a clue who could it be.        Jason still had his costume and the others did but why did they didn't have there costume. A note was flying down to Mary's and Grace's feet Grace picked it was a to do list.                                                      To do list           First get gems Second still costumes Third sell gems Forth get rich    Grace said'I'd seen this writing before but where?' Mary thought and thought but couldn't remember. Then came there answer it was Larry the janitor. He was the one who did it now that they knew they needed a plan.        The plan is to try to get the janitor to get the costumes and get him fire. 'You know what to do right.' 'Yes I do!' said Mary. Mary went to distract the janitor and Grace went in to his office.When he was gone Grace went in his office and fond there costumes she tried to get them. But then came in the janitor and with Mary, he smiled but the evil kind h. He didn't seem worry at all he just was clam and told the girls what he is going to do with them and why. He locked them right in his office and went out with the costumes. Mary yelled'You won't get away with these!' but it was to late he was gone. Grace thought and thought then told Mary that she will climb up in the air vent. That she will go get help and Mary can yell to see if any one can hear her. So they did that it was there only plan they had when Grace got up the vent and fond her way out even though it was gross and dirty. She fond Jason and Larry together talking what they were going to do with the costumes. She hid behind a tree once they got out of the way she ran as fast as her legs could carry. She found out that the show already started and that the ring master (manger) was intruding the aerobatics and Jason still wearing his costume. Grace ran out to the stage and told the audience that Jason and Larry stole there costumes that was valuable. Once Larry and Jason heard they ran to nearest exit they could find 'Stop them!' yelled Grace.Then it happened he police came with Mary in front of them. 'Mary!'yelled Grace they hugged each other. The manger fired Larry and Jason and they got sent to jail for a year.Grace and Mar got there costumes back and they got to do there show.

I have been in the circus for about 10 weeks now, and I haven't seen my family for a while. I got into the circus by hard work, and dropping everything I did so I could just focus on the circus. There are some down sides to being in the circus. you have to work about 24 hours a day and you almost never get to see your family, but I'm OK here because I have a friend my age named Dan.              Now I will tell you about my day. It all started at 6:00 am when I went to the pie car to get some breakfast. As usual, me and Dan met up in the hallway. 'Are you ready for the big performance tonight.' asked Dan. 'I sure am.' I replied. Oh yeah, I forgot too tell you about Dan. He is ten like me, and we are both jugglers. We have a juggling act together and, it will be the grand finale in tonight's show.               Me and Dan finally get to the pie car, and eat our pancake breakfast. We talk about what we should add to our performance. ' I think we should stick with the flaming torch juggling act.' said Dan, and I agreed. We had worked on it for a while now and the grand finale was a good time to reveal it.                                                                         ~               A few hours went by and we were at school. Today, me and Dan just wanted school to be over so we could practice the act, but we still had geography left to do. Geography comes alive in the circus because you study the places you travel to. Mrs. Worm, our teacher, does a really good job of it.                After school me and Dan practice. Practice goes fairly smooth except for one mess ups. In the act, me and Dan are tossing pins to each other. Dan accidentally threw it when I wasn't looking and it hit me in the face. ' Sorry Bart, are you OK?' said Dan. I was OK, but I wouldn't have been if the torch was lit!                                                                       ~                                                     It is 7:00, and it is time to start the show! The clowns come out first (Maggie, and James) and get the audience rolling in the isles. Next comes out Phil the tight rope walker, and he rides a unicycle across the tight rope. Next Pablo does an amazing trick where he gets a horse to sit down! After that, Bob the acrobat, did a triple back flip of a diving board into a kiddie pool. Now, its finally our turn. Me and Dan are too nervous too explain. We start to juggle, and we we get into a serious juggling rhythm. Before we know the act is over, we didn't mess up, AND THE CROWD GOES WILD! We did it!

Joining the circus is hard you have to have the right kind of skills and everything.  You have to learn how to juggle good and to ride a unicycle.  For me joining the circus was just part of my family so basically I had no choice.  Oh yea and I forgot to mention that you if you want to be an acrobat you have to be at least a decent dancer, but you definetly have to be very flexible.                          I guess im pretty good at dancing, but definetly most of the adults there are a lot better.  I keep my head held high because I know I wll get there.  My mom is an acrobat.  She is the best one I have ever seen.  It really isn't fair to me, because I try my hardest all the time, but like I said I keep my head held high.                                 My dad has one of the most fun jobs, well, I think it would be. He is the announcer that may not sound very fun but my dad makes it look like fun.  When he does the announcing he makes all of these funny jokes.  Even though he has told them all to me before I laugh every single time.  The bad thing sometimes about the circus is I never get to see family or friends, but I like what I do so I deal with it.                            When I get older since im already an acrobat I want to be an even better one when I get older.  Maybe one like my mom.  She knows how to do everything when it comes to acrobatic things.  I hope  you understand how fun but hard sometimes the circus can be from my writing.

You can't just decide you want to go and sign up or audition a short speech. You have to have a purpose, a talent, and you have to be able to have fun and not give up if you do something wrong the first time. When you are in the Circus you have to be ready for an adventure of a lifetime. But first, you have to think if this work fits your personality.   There are three very important keys for being in the Circus. Number one, bravery. In the Circus, there are very scary acts that you have to put on for the audience. So you have to work hard to be brave in those acts. The second key is working hard. In a Circus, you have to work really hard and put 100% work into it. The third key is endurance. You have to have a lot of endurance when working in the Circus. Like when you have to work hard, you won't just give up if you mess up.   Despite the hard things in the Circus, you can have a really good time. You can acomplish things you have never acomplished before. You also get to go around the world to some really fun places. You can perform really fun things and you can expeirience things that you have never before.   So, if you want to join the Circus, you might want to keep this for the times you want to give up and go home.

Sarah's mom was an acrobat in a circus coming to our town so Sarah invited Megan, Stella, and me to the circus. So at 9:00 A.M. we all met at her house and went to the circus. 'Hey, I am so happy you all could make it,'said Sarah. 'Of course, why would we miss it?' I said. We all headed to watch the show. 'I am going to get some popcorn,' Sarah said. 'Okay, butcome back sorton. The show is going to start,' said Megan. 'Okay. I will come back soon,' Sarah promised. 30 minutes passed. Sarah did not come back yet. We all suspeccted something. So we left the show and went to find Sarah. So I called Sarah. I heard a cell phone ring near us. It was weird but I knew SArah ws near us. I just couldn't find her. 'Hello?' I asked. ' This is Sarah. Sorry I did not come back.. I had to um go to the restroom?' she said in a strange way. ' Well we are glad you are okay. We thought you were kidnapped or something. Anyways, where are you?' I questioned. 'Well, I am near the trash can in front of you,' Sarah said. I looked up. I saw a clown that looked a lot like Sarah. Sarah wsa making balloon animals for little children. She walked toward us. ' Hi everybody. It's me, Sarah, your friend,'she said. We all were surpirsed. ' Look, I didn't want to tell you all because I knew you would laugh at me. Sorry,' Sarah said. 'We don't care. We are your friends so we don't care if you are a clown and look silly. We care only about you. We judge on what the inside has. Not the outside. We are your friends so we won't laugh at you,' Megan replied. We all nodded. Then we all shared secrets about ourselves that nobody knew so our friendship would be stronger.

I like source 2 cause it tells more about life in the circus.          life in the circus is hard and challenging. You have to learn a lot of things like:              acrobatics , juggling , and to walk on a single rope.         Life in the circus life there is not that easy you have to be healthy.   You have to fit in those little clown cars. The circus life is really hard.

The Avengers are super  heros they help save the world from bad things like if the world was going to get crushed by a villan The Avengers would save us.                                                                                                                                             The Avengers are good at there job thats why they do there job right is because they have to do their job every day so there used to it.  The Avengers do this job so they can protect Earth.   For example, the names of the Avengers are Captin America, Thor ,Hulk, and Iron Man and many more.   They all have different powers Hulk is strong.Iron Man is made out of  iron, and Captin America just fights.   There are different things that super hero's can do.

In the night Sally was going to preform in front of many people.Sally was exited and nervous at the same time.While the show started Sally was warming up.Her father told her that she was going to do a great job and that he would always be by her side when she  ever needed help.When it was Sally's turn she was the star of the show every one in the circus loved her preformance.When the show was over Sally was very tired.Her father told her that she was great in the circus and that maybe she was going to be a great preformer in the circus.Sally told her dad that bieng in the circus is hard work an dthat it does take alot of practice to be in the circus.

You have to make sure that you do the tricks/stunts right on time.                                                 Plus, you  always live in a trailer and you never stay in one place too long.My opinion, I won`t wanna be a circus actor because you neve make friends and if you do, you don`t khow them very long.                 Plus, you always have to move from one city to another to another. You probly get home sick. And, when you get the new friends to take place of your old best friends/friends, you find the right person for you, you have to say, 'fairwell' because you have to go to another city. Then you miss them and all the other friends that you had to say fairwell to. And it just recycles and recyles till you just say,'Im not gonna make nomore friends because that`s just more friends you have to good bye angain and an again and again because it just will tear me apart.                                                                                                      On another note,think to your self,do I really want that life or do I want a peaceful life and keep the friends I already have and not get home sick and not have to move evry week or even that. That will   depress me so so much.and in the story,'life`s a circus',it said that he/she was wiped out after that day.Plus,it said that he/she went to sleep at 12:00pm and if you want to have a life at a circus think twice about it or think a long long time about in your room or in a quiet place or even, tell your parents or an actor in the circus if it's a good idea and  don't take my word for it, tell sombody you khow that is in a circus!

I really wanted to go back inside and read, but I knew I couldn't because I had a responsibility. I had to feed and groom each horse to perfection. Good thing there were only two of them. When I got to the stables, they were empty! I looked in the makeshift barn and all around, but I couldn't find them! Then I heard a:   'Nay!'       I turned around to find both horses standing a few yards away.       How should I get them in their stables? I thought.       Then I see the big box of oats and an idea was born.       I know what I'll do. I thought. I'll put a trail of oats leading to the stables! When the horses start eating the oats, they will end up in the stables.       I carefully placed the oats into a trail. As soon as I set two oats up, they were consumed. Little by little I got the horses back into the stables.       When I went home that night, I was quite pleased with myself because I thought of a soultion to a problem.

In my story, I will describe what events take place in a circus. You will also see a circus performer's every day activity. They work from dawn to dusk every single day. For a circus performer, work can be hard and fun.                                                       The sun's up and the day has begun. You get dressed and have breakfast at the pie car with the other performers. The crew is setting up for the show. After breakfast you go to school with classmates from all over the world. You learn about geography lessons and whats planned for the long day ahead.                                             After school you head on out for a break. You can play with the other performers or practice for the show. About thirty minutes later you practice and feed the animals. Whatever act you were assigned you practice and get warmed up. You can also help other performers do their activiy for the show.                                                         A few hours later it is dinnertime. You have a light dinner because of the show. Then you get some practice and head on out for the show. The show has begun and you watch from behind the curtains as the other performers do their act. Now it is your turn for your act. The crowd applaudes after your amazing act as you step of the stage.                                  Once the show ends you head back to your trailer. The long day is over.You get a good nights sleep for the long day tomorrow. Tomorrow you hit the road again preparing for the next show. This is everyday life of a circus performer.

A spotlight light flashed on me, I did my intro to the crowd and tumbled into the back of the tent were i wasnt seen. John, the anocer began to welcome the audience he talked some more then it was time for me to go back on this time with my friend,sally. We did our acrobat rountine we we hit our pose the crowd cheered. still performing out came Tom and Greg the Lion! 'Its a lion!' a kid in the crowd said exictedly. 'this is greg the lion folks!' Tom siad pointing to the lion. On my rope i flipped and landed on the ground on my feet of course.    After the act the clowns went out on unicycles and small cars. After a ton of performing the show was over in two days we would be going to a new town to perform. I was very wiped out, before bed i went to the pie car to get a snack then i was off to bed.       The next day i woke up got dressed then went to the pie car to get breakfast. I saw the crew setting up tents and lights and music for the mantinee (afternoon show).      At 1:00pm i went to groom,feed, and give water to the horses which we use for the horseback acts. At 3 it was time for the mantinee, which was amazing everyone performed so well. After the show i got ready for the next. When i was in bed that night i was thinking if when i am older i'll still be a circus perfomer. The circus is fun but its tough at times.

Living in the circus is fun and a great experience,but it can be really tough. We do fun stuff like when we perform. performing in the circus is so fun,but can get tough. you have to practice and stay fit. You don't really get to see your family either. Living in the circus can get complicated.        When you first enter the circus you must have a special talent, the right body type, determination, and you have to put your heart into what you're doing. When you are in the circus you get the opportunity to travel the world. You get to go to Australia, Japan, and all over North America. Being in the circus gave me chances to meet new people from all over the world.You become so used to the people you work with that they become your family.        Even though the circus can be fun and gives you amazing opportunities, it isn't all fun and games. You have to work long days and spend a lot of time away from home and your family. On tour you don't really have anywhere to call home. You have to work long hours and work from sunup to sundown. You practice your routine, go to school, you do chores, perform, and go to sleep. The circus isn't all fun.        The circus is very fun but has its downside.You must stay fit and healthy for performing. Living with the circus gives extraordinary chances. You get to meet new people and make new friends. Living in the circus gives me amazing possibilities and is amazing.

Not like any other shows weren't a lot of work. I roll out of bed and hobble over to my small wardrobe, tucked away into the corner. I sleepily take off my pajamas and put on a pair of jeans and the yarn sweatshirt my grandma knitted for me last summer. I slide the door aside and step out into the misty morning air.            Some circus performers are setting up the big tent while others are practicing their acts. I look at my watch. 8:55, it reads. Oh my gosh!

And the circus is really fun, but it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. You have to have all the right skills and you have to do a lot of traveling, you have to stay healthy and fit and give up things in order to perform.       Here are some pros of being a performer in the circus-   When you perform in front of an audience and they cheer it makes me feel really proud. I get to travel to places all around the world, this can be good or bad. Sometimes I get homesick, but it is really cool to meet people from other countries. It is really fun performing for a live audience and they get to see how hard that I worked.   Here are the cons of being a circus performer-   I spend pretty much all of my free time practicing for live performances. I work really long hours. I don't dee my friends or family that often. I don't get to experience a lot of things besides performing.       But, although I get homesick a lot I do have a lot of fun. I wish I could have a little more time to spend with friends, but all around I'm pretty happy with what I do.

She always loved playing with the elephants, but hated the circus. she thought that the circus was never her home and she hoped to someday be able to leave and have a life as a zoo keeper.               One day she received a letter saying someone named Gina would be joining the circus. she always thought that she would be the only child in the circus. As she walked into the pie car a new child walked in. It was Gina! Matilda could hardly wait to talk to Gina.                Gina then walked up to Matilda and asked,'Do you like life in the circus?'I only replied with a,'No.'Gina then asked,'Why not?' Matilda said,'I don't have any friends or family here, and I would much rather be a zoo keeper.' Gina then smiled and said,'I'll be your friend but only if you can stay and enjoy it here.' Matilda then thought I already am a zoo keeper I take care of the animals here. I also have a new friend. This is my home.

But theirs this new girl and everybody says that if I want to stay on top as the best dancer I better step it up. But instead of stepping it up I have been stepping it down ever since Kate, FYI the new girl got here. I really don't know what is happening! I need help really badly. I mean have a few suggestions for my self but I doubt that they would work I mean it is just stuff like quitting the circus and you know the rest.       'Hey there Lucy,' said Kate       'Oh hi there Kate,' I answered back       ' Hey Lucy I know that you don't like me and that is why you are not doing that well but I just want to say that I want you to be my friend not my enemy.' said Kate       ' That would be great Kate,' I replied       After that I was me again.

You have to train, perform in many different places, and you live a normal life to. Also, you have to be fit for the job.       Benifets of Being a Performer          The circus can be fun and exciting if you look at it this way. You will have have one specific job like an acrobat, trapeze artist, lion tamer, working with elephants,jugguling, ride unicycles, and many many other amazing talents that you will have to work with. Being a tapeze artist is my dream. I love to swing, jump, and im very flexiable. I think I wiuld be good at this job, but i have never tried it so I would have to train alot to be a pro. You also have to be brave for some talents.       Disadvantages of the Circus          Some of the disadvantages of the circus is that you wont get to hang out with friends, or learn at school,and maybe even not see your family if they are not in the circus with you. Missing your family can be tough if you are a kid. You can't hang out with friends because you will be training or performing. Also, you be able to learn about social studies, science, writing, or math. you might have a school travel with you so you can learn when you have freetime. But you never know how long you'll be in the circus. You might get tired and want to do some other career, or  you might love being in the circus and want to do that for the rest of you life. Also, you might have to put up with the animals and taking care of them.       Life Training With the Circus          you have to get up early to train, feed, and get ready for the day. You will have multiple shows in one week and multiple days of moving. Life can be hard when you trainign to be a performer, but it will be worth it. You get to have fun when your performing. Do many amazing, exciting, and fun things while you do you part of the performance but the traing is the hard part. You have to train,train,and train. Hard work for a performer, very hard work.          I hope someday I will be in the circus and get to do some Trapeze and train with the animals. I hope you will consider it too.

Well, that's not quite the truth. I, Rebecca, work at the circus for long hours and weekends, practicing for our next performance in America. The entire circus travels around the world performing for a week.              In order to become a circus performer, you first have to practice the two skills required, dancing and performing. A girl I know named Philippa, started stardom when she was five years old. She did musical theater, and ballet and all kinds of music, singing, acting and everything to hone her craft. When Philippa wanted to become a performer, she gave up on everything and practiced only the two skills, dancing and performing.       I started practicing when I was the same age as her, and coincidentally, we both ended up performing in the same circus. We would practice balancing on a rope for at least three hours, juggle for two hours, and do splits and somersaults until it was bedtime. The next day, we would set everything up for the performance like tents, popcorn machines, rings, and other tools.       We'd dress up in our shining costumes, and rehearse until it was time to start the show. Whenever I perform on walking on the rope, I feel like I'm the highest person in the circus, trying to reach the sky while balancing. It ended up with all the circus performers singing and dancing together in front of the audience. The next day, we traveled to a different country and it would repeat all over again.       To conclude, I had a fun time and a great eperience traveling all over the world with my friend, performing amazing skills that a normal person can't do. Right now, we're on our way to Moscow, Russia. I hope you'd see me perform one day! 	NNP PRP RB VBD IN DT NN NN VBZ JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN TO VB .

When i was about 15 I decided to take my talent to the circus.Well if you want to be an acrobat you have to be really strong,you have to have the right body,and you have to be determined.If you want be in the circus you have to take a big risk of not seeing your family unless they travel with you.Also if you are a dancer or acrobat for the circus you work from sun up to sun down.               For circus performers an upside is that they get to travel all over the world.The downside of being part of the circus is that its not all the high-flying fun and games and clowning around its actually glamorous.When you get in front of a huge crowd every one stands up and says your name because your famous.Also when you look a fan in the eye you can see them smiling and waving back to you.                 In the circus you automatically feel the energy running through your body as a performer which gets you pumped up.Also if you eat to much from the pie cart you will throw up if your running around like a mad man but doing part in the circus.During a circus act if you mess the crowd might say something mean but it doesn't matter the other circus acrobats have a littlel something up there sleeve for backup to help you out.                                  Well I have told you all the steps and tricks of a circus person now all you have to do is go join the circus.

My name is Johnny Simmons and I've experienced the circus life it's not to fun because every day your traveling and performing. We have a school like normal with computers, tests, math, reading, and science, and my classmates are  But we also get a place to eat called a Pie car where we eat Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We also get to practice our parts in the circus and i get to be on the tightrope. But i also get to feed the horses the only thing i don't like about the circus is always performing almost every day! Even though i don't like performing all day i like making the audience laugh. Oh and i almost forgot the clowns that perform with me they'll always make me laugh.

First, whene you walk in, the first thing you do is pay to go in to watch the performance.Then,you take a set and wait so they start the show.Next,   people start coming in and also they bring animals with theme also they might bring other thing they would   use during the show.Finilly,you set and enjoy all the fun the circus can be.In conclusion,I think curcus are fun and they could be enjoyable.

It is not the smartest act to do. But  would like to do   it because it looks cool and you get to use a whip.                                 I would be able to mess with the lion. I would also train the lion how to jump through a flaming hoop.Iwould even teach it how to do flips on a trampoline.                                                                            The downside is that i would have to feed it twice a day. I  would also have to clean up his poop. I could almost get eaten though.                              In cinclusion, i would like to work in the circus  	EX VBP JJ NNS WDT VB IN DT NNP NNP RBS JJ NN VBZ WRB PRP RB VB VBN IN DT NNP NNP VBZ RB DT JJS NN TO NNP CC MD VB TO VB PRP IN PRP VBZ NN CC PRP VBP TO VB DT NNP NNP MD VB JJ TO NN IN DT NNP NNP MD RB VB DT NN WRB TO VB IN DT NN MD RB VB PRP WRB TO VB NNS IN DT NNP NNP NN VBZ IN PRP MD VB TO VB PRP NN DT NNP NNP MD RB VB TO VB RP PRP$ NNP NNP MD RB VB VBN NNP NNP NN , PRP MD VB TO VB IN DT NN	1		20131022153224	539	1		20131022161326	556	1		20131025094849	543	1

There is always five performers, who have been practicing one special act.....but the only thing people know about the act is that it involves many animals. That is why everyone is pushing and shoving each other to get tickets. On the day of the circus, there were people holding popcorn, spilling drinks, and trying to get the best seats. The lights went dim, people froze and sat where ever they were. ''Ladies and gentlemen.... please give a round of applause for our Bellini Circus performers!'' Everyone cheered.                                                                The performers brought out lions, bears, tigers, cheetahs, bulls, elephants, and many more animals. Then, they all climbed onto their backs. Everything was going well until a lion roared. The performer jumped off it's back. Then an elephant stomped, and the bull grunted. All the performers jumped off the animals and called for help. They all looked at each other with confused faces. ''We're sorry folks the show has been canceled.'' As everyone was getting up to leave, they heard a huge bang. The animals had broken loose!                          All the animals ran around the circus, then broke out to the streets. Cars screeched on the breaks. People called 911. Animal control came with big trucks. Some of the animals were caught. others were still missing. It wasn't until 7:00 when reports of animals coming into stores and houses were all the calls police got.                                                                                                                                          Some people left town. Others.... like the performers, helped catch the animals. After two days some of the animals were still missing. Sometimes when people saw the animals, they would just scream. Most of them were caught, but then the ones that were still missing went into the city and wrecked many things. Soon after that, the town where the animals had first broken loose decided they would let the city take over.                                                                                                                                                                                          So they did. Three men came and caught the animals. Police tried to figure out why the animals got scared and ran away. they didn't figure it out, but they figured something else out. That the animals at the circus.... were stolen!                                                                      All the performers were arrested and taken to jail. So when the next circus comes to town, watch out. Those animals might just be stolen.

I was in gymnastics for twelve years and I was in the Olympics!I was really good at it because I tried.I have a chest full of trophies in the attic.I have heard circus life is nonstop crazy life.My friend bill is in the circus he said it is always busy.I know what he means because they have to set up then do the show and then take down and leave.It must feel good when they get to sit down and relax.        When I get into the circus all the plans will be new to me.The new lifestyle always busy.But I am OK with that as long I am comfortable.I am so exited!Today is the day I find out if  I'm accepted in the circus.I am in!!!I can't believe it.I am going to be an acrobat.This the best day ever!!Not will I only watch a circus I will be in one to!!!

The other two climbed  different ladder so they can use two bars.The two swung back and forth,back and forth.The other person walked on the string trying to keep balance.

Two ladies came out with fine dresses.The clowns came back in the show. They saw the ladies and started to flirt with them.The ladies were falling for the trick when a handsome man came out and the ladies started going to him. The clowns were then heart broken.Two girl clowns came out running crazy . The clowns turned around and saw the girls. The girls turned around and saw them they both started to walk to each other .They all fell in love and they lived a happy life.

Their are tipes of jobs that you can enjoy and learn like you can be a circus clown, or a acrobat,a juggler,and  a tightrope walker.it can take years to be in a circus. you can aslo be boss of the circus tell them what you want to see.hundreds of people are coming you need to be set up ready to show them that you were working hard and show the talents that you want to show off.it is hard,but you can show them that feel like that their not afraid to go and break a bone,they been doing this as more than you can imagine, it has been on for a long time and they are still here to show all the happiness they been getting people for hundreds of years that pass by and even amazying and funnier.                                                                                                THE THRILLS OF THE CIRCUS CLOWNS                       The only thing I know that the circus clowns scare some kids ands people around the world.most of people think that they are really funny.I can say that clowns are both scary and funny. well I think that lone time ago in the 18 hundreds or the 19 hundreds    when the circus just open the clowns made their mark to be very popular.of corse that was a long long long time ago. It is very cool that clowns can fit in a small little colerful car that is shape as a wagon.Clowns are very cool at what they do.                                                                         SWINGING AS A ACROBAT                                                     'Is it a bird is it a plane,NO it is a ACROBAT'!.Acrobats has lots of skills. acrobats are strong and brave and also healthy.the boys and girls will like the skills they have to show.They will fly like nothing even happen.They will  do flips they will fly through hoops,they are not scare of how high they are. they are perfect.                                                                            THE EYE OF THE JUGGLER                                                         'look at the rings fly in the air!'said ME.The juggler make things fly,and do you know how they can do they can do this?They have a eyeand reflexes so they can be able to do this all the amazing stuff that they can throw like balls, rings books and elefants.umm i dont think they can throw elefants, that will be really silly they are too heavy it is inpossible to carry one. jugglers are very skillful and talented.

I stretch and climb out of bed. I throw on some clothes and head to the pie car for breakfast. Although it's only seven in the morning, the crews are already setting up tents, lights, and music for th?e show tonight.       'Hey, Bella,' my friend, Christina, says.       'Hi, Christina,' I say, smiling.       We walk into our classroom and the majority of the class is already here. Christina and I finally get out of school and three in the afternoon. I  head to the stalls to feel, water, and groom the horses that we will use in the show. My dad practices somersaulting off a running horse. I work on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back. My classmates are practicing juggling and acrobatics.       It's dinnertime. My family and I head out to the pie car for dinner. I don't eat much because we'll be performing tonight. We do ten shows a week: one each weekday, plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.       It's 10:30 P.M. already. The show is over and I'm really tired. We walk back to our trailer, passing the circus offices, concession stands, stables. and trailers. Two day from now, we'll be in a different city.       At 12 in the morning I'm finally in bed after a grueling day. At the end of the touring season, I will finally be able to go back home, in Florida. It's nice to be in the circus, but sometimes I miss our home in Florida.

You may wonder,' Did that actor make a mistake on purpose, or was it an accident?' I have been through a similar situation.       It was Thursday and I was traveling with the circus from   Baltimore, Maryland to New York City for the Annual Friday Show.   I was so excited because it was my first annual show. I had been working on training the new lemur named Zed. Zed was not a cooperative little lemur. We worked on his dancing, which took alot of time. Now I hoped we would get it right.       Jerry was the seal. Zed hated Jerry. I don't know if they were   scared  of each other, or they just hated each other when they first saw each other.       'We are here,' my boss, Marta screamed. We all jumped out of   the trailer and into the set-up tent. 'Now,' said Marta 'We have come late, so we are not going to have any time to practice. Start getting dressed!!!' No time to rehearse! We were going to fail! Me and Zed got dressed, and I made sure to keep Jerry away from him. Then I took Zed to the waiting room. 'What are we going to do Zed?'I asked. After 30 minutes of waiting, it was our act. I took Zed to the stage, which was already set-up for us. Then, I put Zed down, and introduced us. I turned on the music, and we started to dance. Then, I saw Jerry outside his cage. This was not his act? 'Jerry,' I said as softly as I could.'Go back!!!!' As soon as Zed heard me say 'Jerry', he jumped out of the ball pit and on to me! Jerry came out, too, and started to jump with Zed.                 After I managed to get the two of them to stop fighting, I stood there, looking so ashamed of myself. Suddenly, a man stood up and cheered. Then everybody cheered! When I got of the stage, I scolded Zed and Jerry for fighting, but also I hugged them. And now, they are best friends. I am happy they became friends that way!!! 	DT NNP NNP NNP , PRP VBP NNP NNP NN IN DT NNP NNP IN DT JJ NNP NNP MD VB , '' NNP IN NN VBP DT NN IN NN , CC VBD PRP DT NN .

Now I will tell you the likes and dis likes that I would have in the circus.first I will tell you the likes  that I would have . I would like to be in the circus because I would love to tran the anaimals like to jump  from high places. And I would love to teach the seals how to jugle. and I would love to preform in front of the crowed.And now i will tell you the dislikes that I have about the cricus .I do not like that they have tto get up so so early. Thats all I dont about the circus.           Now that I am done with my story I hope you liked it and I hope you thought it was great.   Thats what I like and dislike about the story .

I said if I was in the circus I would do flips and ride in a clown car.I would eat chicken ,corn,mash potatoes, and stuffing.Then go to bed with the animals and sleep in hay.Then I would wake up feed the animals then learn how to do tricks.                                                                                                                                                    When I was learning how to do the tricks I would fall down 1 time or 2 times but i wouldn't give up no matter how many times I would mess up.When we were done pacting we would have to do a show I was nerves but if I did mess up I new my friends would bail me out.When we were done doing the show we would have to take off our makeup and me and my friends would go out to go get ice cream.                                                                                                                                                          We would go home and change into our pajamas,eat dinner,feed the animals,make our beds,brush the horses hair.We would have pillow fights and sometimes read.When we were done playing we would brush our hair,brush our teeth,and wash our face to make sure we didn't leave makeup on our faces.The next day was the same but it was still fun.                                                                                                                                          When I was done telling my story my mom and my dad said they loved my story and they clapped.

The reason I want to be a circus perfomer      is  because they get a lot of attention ,and they also get a lot of  money.But the thing that I hate is that I  am risking my life just because they want entertament.

Being a  performer you have to be able to do many things like riding a unicycle or front flipping over a running horse. Well, it takes hard work being a performer or a acrobat in the at about 7:00 AM you have to wake up and eat breakfast. At about 9:00 AM you set up the circus tent and decorations with your fellow performers. At 6:00 PM you have to go eat dinner, but just a little because you have to perform in a couple of minutes.     Finally, at 7:00 you perform at the circus and finally perform with your fellow acrobats and clowns! Flipping, jumping, and even incredible juggling all of you are doing great and the crowd is cheering loud! After many performances and it is finally the end of the tour you will think about going back to your home and rest for a couple of days, you might even even think if your going to keep performing or change to a different job. Late in the night you finally get a very long and slow sleep.

This week were performing in china. I had never been to china even though I have traveled basically all over the world. This is really exciting.       After when i got up and got dressed, it was time for breakfeast.I next went to the school room to trian and learn. Like normal, are school ends at 3:00. We have about six hours of school trianing, it is hard work. Than Finally we have the show. The show ends at about 10:30 and at that day, I'm really tired. But, what we performed today. I'm happy about it.           I had fun today and I'm happy to have done the circus. It is hard work but fun. I'm at least all ready for another day of the hard work. Now I'm going to sleep dreaming of the circus. Goodnight.

My parents are acrobats at the cicus, and want me to be working at the circus to. I hoewer have no desire to spend my life preforming. My wish is to become a doctor. No mater what happens, I will try my whole life to become a doctor or atleast a nurse.                We live in a trailer and don't have a particular home state. We travel everywhere for our prefomances. I have to stick to a boring life of a circus girl and my parents that I wont be a doctor. I am dissapointed, but I wont give up.                                (Twenty years later) I did it! I became a doctor. I ran away from my old life to the luxury of being a normal citizen. When I came to Washington it applied to a college for doctors and entered. From now on my life is going to be wonderful.

It took many years to master this. It is like a game of balancing on a rope. I have to be very careful or I'll fall. I practice by doing it on a thin wood plank, then I went to ropes.          If I fail, I would get fired because the show would be ruined. The audience would get their money back. Good thing I never fell before. I tightrope with fire, crocodiles, and spikes under me. They are just added to make it look more amazing. Of course I wear armor to protect me if I fall.          This job is really fun. I wish I had it the rest of my life. It may look hard, but it is really fun.

The feeling of the wind whipping my long, dark hair back has always been one of the greatest things about working with the circus. I'm supposed to be able to spin halfway around the trapeze, ending in a position where I'm standing on my hands, legs stretched like I'm doing the splits. I'm having a hard time centering my balance over the bar, but suddenly, it just feels completely perfect! That's when I remember that I wasn't supposed to stay like that the whole time, and that I need to make a full circle. Once that's done, I leap down to the tightrope, walk across on my hands, and execute a perfect backflip down to the ground.                                        ***************       'Holly, that was amazing! How did you do that?' My best friend, Sammy(her real name is Samantha, but she hates it when people call her that), asked me. 'Sammy, I told you a million times, practice using something closer to the ground, and gradually work your way up!' She asked the the exact same question every time I finished a show. It gets really annoying really fast. I never really have time to ask her to stop, I'm always practicing, or doing a show with my family and friends. In fact, I met Sammy while we were doing a show in LA. She's been part of the backstage crew for years! we're both fifteen, and she's had to assemble the big top with the rest of the crew. Believe it or not, she's actually in charge of what goes on down on the floor. She's also in charge of the sound systems.                                        ***************       THWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACKTHWACK! 'Mom, is there a deranged woodpecker living by the door that I don't know about?' I laughed. She shook her head. 'No, but if you don't hurry up you'll be late for practice.' Sammy's voice shouted, 'HOLLY, HURRY UP! IT'S SHOWTIME!' I looked at my watch. 'Yikes!' This was my first time performing a big act alone. 'Good luck, Holly!' Sammy yelled as I ran to the big top.

We are in Paris, France right now. I am the trainer for the baby leapords. We are playing at 9:00 pm tonight. It is going to be so much fun. This is my first time in Paris. I have played all over the world though. I am really good friends with the trainer for the lions.Tonight i think i might teach the leapords a new trick like to play dead. Oh wait im late for dinner time! We eat in the pie car. We usually eat small things.       Now it is 8:30 pm. I am so excited. We are probably going to play for one of the biggest crowds we have ever seen before. I am going on right after the lion tamer.   Right now i got my leapords on a leash so they don't run into the crowd. I know some pretty cool people in the circus like the clown with the afro, the guy with the unicycle, and the elephant tamer too. Oh no i got ahead of myself im on in two minutes. Ok now just focus and don't be afraid. So there i am walking out on the platform with my leapords. The crowd is cheering for me this is so exciting.       Now i am going to do stuff with the leapords. First they will jump chair to chair. So now jump, jump, jump, and jump. The crowd is cheering and i am crying for my hard work. Then i anounce that I am going to do something i have never done before. I am going to make my leapords play dead. On the count of three i will say boom boom boom and they will all fall. One, Two, Three, boom boom boom. It worked they all falled on to the ground unharmed ofcourse. Now my act is done and i am going in the back room withmy leapords.       I now this might sound crazy but when i was in the backroom i was talking to my leapords telling them how good they were.Then after that i went to bed.

To be in the circus you must like pancakes and funny jokes. You have to travel a lot in cars and trains so lets hope you like to change locations a lot. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication but in the end it always turns out ok and you get to do the same act tomorrow and the next and so on.          Some times the circus is not so fun and your stuck missing your family. You even have to get up early and go to bed late every night. Setting up the tent and practicing may not be so fun when that's all you do and you want to do more.          Well that's what I have to say about the circus and I hope you get a good understanding      about the circus life and what it's all about. the circus is tough and going to bed so late would not be fun for me especially if i was a child and had to go to school and do work with kids that may not even speak my language.

In  training we practice doing our acts with a partner.After that we eat in the pie car.We live in a trailer that travels to all our  shows.                                                                                                                                                                We do a lot of shows in a week.After the shows are done we are tired.It is hard work doing our acts.Our acts are even harder because we have to do them perfectly.                                                              That`s why we practice a lot daily. It`s dangerous to do some acts like acrobats and trapeze.When trapeze artists practice they have nets under for just in case we fall.                                                                 If you want to be good at a act then you have to practice over and over again.For example using a unicycle is hard.If you practice a lot you will eventually be good at it.                                                              We also use animals in acts.Big animals and small animals.Elaphants to dogs.

What I do is the funnest thing in the world.I do acrobatic stuff on a trampoline.I do circus acts with my whole family and that is pretty cool if I say so myself and I do. My dad does lion taming,my mom and my uncle do magic tricks and I do trapeze with my two cousins,Ricky and Jerry.I am the youngest and Jerry is the oldest and Ricky is the middle child.I am 11,Jerry is 17 and Ricky is 16.Finally are the youngest kids and they're are dressed up as clowns and go around in a little remote controlled car tossing out flowers and that's the end of the act.     When the show is over I eat dinner and then I go to sleep and the next day I just hit reset on my head.And that is a typical day for me.Practicing is really cool for me   probably not if your scared of heights. I just like the feeling of being mid air an doing flips it makes me feel relaxed.We travel around all over the world and we have to learn a lot of new languages and if you don't think that's cool well you are missing out.     We am also your average family.We have games we have computers and phones we even have TV.Circus kids aren't any different than your average kids so don't treat us any different than you would treat me if i wasn't in the circus.Me and my cousins also post flyers of our circus.Once we are done with everything we have to do we spend some time to socialize and have sometime to just hangout.Have to stop writing I have a show to perform in.

You also don't have much time to spend with your family.The most important thin to enter a circus is that you have to concentrate on you act.When you are practicing you have to be fully concentrated on your act so it can be perfect.The act I would like to have wold be  trapeze because I'm really interested in trapeze I would like to join a circus because I like their acts and how it looks and it seems fun to travel around the world experiences new things everyday.I also know how  hard it is to join a circus and how hard people work to get their act perfect .People who work at the circus don't get much resting because they have to work . I think being in the circus is hard work because you have to  feed the animals, groom the horses etc.Circus performers  work long days and spend a lot of time away from home.When their are at tours they they really have anywhere to call home and they always think about the show they are going to o and how its going to turn out.One of the upsides of being the circus is that u get the chance to travel around the world and know new places. Circus performers  put their heart into it  and that's why people love the circus they put work and their heart to it.

I go to a circus school other than that we are just alike.       I love my job of being a acrobate like my mom and dad,But it is like other jobs tough.I try to wander how it would be like to not think about the acrobate job,but i love it to much to not think about it. In school we learn all these different language for all these clown performances in different areas around the world.We have a circus show Friday in England thats why we had to learn how to speech in England style. My mom and dad are both realy good acrobates.They love what they do,and I love watching them to.       I try my best to be like my mom and dad,and also want to better than them.Every time I perform my mom waves at me and my dad claps for me. When I finish my performance my mom always say you always look good on that stage,and always try your best.A few days ago my dad had to do a massive move where he catches my mom on the rope.Then she falls in his arms,and doesthe big finalie then the crouds goes wild.Thats the End hope you enjoy when you read it bye.

My dad is a tightrope walker and a acrobat. My mother is a acrobat and animal trainer.I help my mother with the animal training. I also do tricks with the horses like jumping from one horse to the other one  my mom is on.           I am also a acrobat. I love to do flips on wires with my mom. My best friend name is Zeke Wake. He has been my friend since our parents been in the circus. He is also a acrobat his mom is a dancer. He does acrobats with me in the night shows. My schedule is full through the day.         The only thing bad about being in a circus is having no time to yourself. There are also a lot of good things like traveling around the world. Also meeting new people every day. I also get to play with the animals every day in their pens. I love playing with the chimpanzees all the time.         I learn stuff that only circus people can learn. Like the history of the land on which we are setting up on. The reason why we came to that place. I love circus school. We get to learn new tricks at this school.This where I learn all of my tricks.We also have a learning school.         How to become a circus freak is to go to school. You have to be able to some sort of trick. My dad first started out as a clown. Then he was a magician. Now he is a acrobat and tightrope walker. In between all that he has time to hang with me.        When I was little I love to do flips. When I was back home I was in the gymnastics team. I had lots of friends.It was wonderful. One time I did a triple summer salt into the audience. Every one was amazed. The best thing about it is the look on my parents faces.They were astonished.        I was a cheerleader in 4th grade.It was so much fun. I was always the top of the pyrmid. It was so cool. I thought i could see my house from there. I loved my life at home but, not as much as I love my life now.       The life I have now is the life I would not like to change.Never in my life will I ever change my life. Not even for 1 BILLON dollars. Well actualy I would for 1 BILLON dollars                          I AM JESSICA SWAN AND THIS IS MY LIFE                                                                         THE END OR THE BEGING?

When they got there they had to make Jesaka get out of car.When they did walked to the first booth and played a game, while they were at the booth they saw a sign that said 'EVERY 20 MINUTES A CLOWN WILL POP OUT IN FRONT OF YOU OR BEHIND'.Jesaka got real scared then,she was so scared she told her mom to hold her. One hour had passed and it was time for the show to start presenting the clowns.By that time Jesaka was in her moms lap rocking.First they presented the most funnest clown of all, next the acrobats then juggler,tightrope,and so on. By the last Jesaka was running to the car she was so embarrassed.                                              When they were on their way back to the house dad  and mom was laughing at Jesaka the whole time.When they got home they all put on there pj's and before they went to bed dad asked Jesaka ' How was her day at the circus.' Jesaka said I hate the circus and i always will. with that being said every one said their good nights and every one went to sleep.

Every day from sun up to sun down you work and you really can't call a place a home.Our bus travels 20,000 miles in seven months we visit 150 cities i like it though because i get to see things many kids don't get to see.Many kids and adults are from different countries like i am from America and some are from china and some are from Asia.For school a bus is traveling with us to it is just like regular school it has computers and desk and we even have test to.But it is not as fun because you really cant make friends like you could at a real school and you cant have sleep overs.Also you cant go camping with your family!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I am a tight rope walker it is very fun but can also be challenging at times because you can get frustrated  because it takes a lot of practice.Where we eat is called a pie car but it is not really how it sounds we all kinds of food in there.We eat breakfast,lunch and dinner.But i take breaks during the day to i have a thirty minute break and i play with the unicycles it it very fun,I have chores to though i groom the horses and muck the lion stalls muck means clean.I am very wiped out at the end of the day it is very tiring.My dad does the trampling gye he is working on jumping on a horse that is running.My mom is a also a tight rope walker just like me but she very good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          To join a circus you have to have a specific talent the right body and you have be determined at what you want to do and stay strong.You have put it in the heart and be certain that that's what you want to do.That how are family got to join the circus we never gave up.But i don't know that i will stay in the circus forever i will probably move to Kansas back home where my grampa and grama live in Garden City.

Once upon time there was a guy named Fred.He loved the circus when it was in town he went to it.He never missed it.so one day at the end of the circus he asked one of the acrobats if he can join the circus,and after waiting about half an hour they finely said yes!       So the next day he got there not a second late.First  they taught him acrobatics then they taught him to juggle while on a unicycle then they taught him how to get the elephants to get on a small steel box!Then they told him to get to bed.So Fred said that it was only 7:00!But the manager of the circus said that tomorrow was a busy day then he got the idea.So he went to bed there that night.In the middle of the night he woke up thinking of how busy and tough life in the circus was.       The next day he woke up bright and early.When he went in the pie car to eat he smelt a delicious breakfast just waiting for him to get his hands on it!When he saw what it was he went coo-coo it was blueberry muffins!When he finished breakfast it was time for the show!He was so exited!After the show he said that was amazing!

He was surprised that the circus master would ask a boy who is about to turn 11 could flip off of a wire, land on and bounce off of a trampolene, and land on a horse and ride it around the circus rink. 'Well, there will be many safety measures,' answered the circus master. Bobby shook his head still mystified. 'Go to the pie car and eat Bobby,' the circus master said. After breakfast, Bobby went to school. When school was over he raced back to the circus. Bobby loved basketball. There was a small wooden hoop and a small basketball that Bobby took with him everywhere. Soon he went to feed the elephants. The monkeys needed serious grooming so he set to that too. An hour later, Bobby was done with his chores. Bobby went into the circus arena and started training for his act. The first few times he lost his balance on the wire and fell but soon he was ready to go! At dinner Bobby barely touched his pie. He was too nervous to eat! Soon the circus master announced that the show was beginning. Behind the stage, despite his small dinner, Bobby had butterflies in his stomach and he felt like throwing up! His heart jumped when the circus master announced his name for the act. He entered the arena. Despite the heating, he was shivering. He climbed up the ladder and began to balance on the wire. The crowd held its breath. Then the moment of truth came. Bobby clenched his eyes shutand flipped off of the wire. Bouncing off of the trampoline, he let go of all the excitement he had been holding back. When he opened his eyes he was perfectly landed on the horse. He had done it!

The travel around the world which is very hard since they have to get use to the new environment. The have the same grading process and same school prosedgers as us. They get there meals from a car. Circus life is hard with all the training and all the taming, juggling, and acrobatics.

Well, now I can tell you. Many people may think that being part of a circus is very fun, but it has its ups and downs. It is very hard to stay away from home and travel to 150 cities in only one year. Also, to be a part of a circus, you need the right body type, a specific talent, and be very determined. On a typical day, I wake up at 7:00 and sleep at 12:00.                But circus life also is fun. Think about it. I perform every day in front of many people. I practice tricks such as leaping from a trampoline onto a horses back, and also somersalting off a running horse. After school, the clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls.                    Also, being a part of the circus also means traveling the world. I love visiting different places and meeting new people. Of course, that also means that I cannot go back to my home until after the end of our touring season. That is the part that I don't like about the circus. I have to be away from home for seven months each year!                    Another thing that I dont like about being a part of the circus is that I cannot be a part of any sports teams. We never stay in one place long enough to join any classes, and more importantly, I never have time to join a sports team.                    And don't forget, I also have to do chores and pratice my tricks and flips. I feed, water, and groom the horses every day so that they will be clean and ready for the big show. We do 10 shows a week: one each weekday, plus an afternoon show on Wendesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.                     Now you know that the circus is fun, but it is mostly a busy and tough life. 	NNP IN DT NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WP PRP VBZ IN TO VB NN IN DT NN .

The act was that the  horse was suppose to run and at the right time an acrobat would jump off the trampoline and land on the horse.       The horses name, Joe, was a hard to train horse. Whenever I tried to make him calm down the horse would either kick me or runaway. It was hard for me to train him, he wouldn't listen.       Not only that, I had to train a group of elephants to walk together and stand on their back legs. I had learned my lesson with elephants. The last time I tried to whip the elephant but instead, he barged out to the circus and ran away. This time I was much kinder to the elephant.       Finally, after days of practice it was time for the circus. The performer jumped on to the horse, the elephants ran together, and all the other performers did their parts.       I was wiped out after the performance, but now it was time to move on to the next show. A show miles away.

I woke up, got dressed and went to the pie cart.I ate breakfeast and went to school.I was scared for night to come, tonight was the night I was doing my famous trick, I was going to flip off a 70 foot high rope with a dragon in my hand and land on a white horse. The bearded dragon was my pet his name is Peanut. Peanut seemed as scared as I was.I had done the trick before, but at practice what if I mess up, what if everyone laughs at me.                     I ask my mom and dad to help me practice the trick but both were busy practicing the tricks, I ask my teacher but she says she has no idea what to do to help me with tricks.                  It was going to be dinner soon and I still had not found someone to help me. I decided to just try to play sick so that I would not have to do the trick, why did I say yes to doing the stupid trick.                 I went to my mom and told her and said, I don't feel good making a sour look on my face.My mom said,  ok then let me get you some medicine. I told her that I feel better now.My mom gave me a look and asked me why was I playing sick. I told that I was scared to do my trick,she said it is ok to be scared but I still have to face my fear and do it I told her what if I fall and mess up and everyone laughs at me,it's a circus my mom told me.I suppose I can do it and if people laugh so what it is a circus.                 I had already ate dinner and was getting my outfit on, it was blue with white stars.I bradded my hair back.I got peanut and the white horse by the time I got there they were setting up for me to perform.                 I climbed the ladder and walked slowly and carefully down the rope.I stood there for a while and then holding peanut in my hand I fliped off the rope and landed on the back of the horse.the crowd cheered.I got off the horse and waved to the crowd, proud of myself  I had did it I fliped of a 70 foot high rope.                 Later that night I went to my trailor thinking of new daring tricks that I could do for the next show and fell asleep.

I'm so nervous, I've never been in front of so many people. What if I mess up? Everyone would laugh at me,' I think. 'We are on in 10 minutes,' someone calls from the front. To my surprise someone opens the door. It's my mom. 'Are you nervous,' she asks me. 'Very,' I reply. 'It's normal, happened to me on my first preformance. I was just like how you are now, but I was 9 you are 11,' she said. 'On in 5 minutes,' someone calls again from the front. 'I used to hate that, it just added to my stress.'she said. 'What if I fall, what if I mess up, if I'm to nervous to move? Everyone would laugh at me,' I said in tears. 'I thought that to, but I was fine because I beleived in myself, thats what you need to do. Just beleive in yourself and you will be fine I know you can do it. I beleive in you,' she said. 'I will be right there with you' she said. She starts to walk away. 'Thank you mom,' I said just before she walked out the door. 'your welcome sweety,' mom said. 'We are on in 3, 2, 1,'someone shouts again in the front. I walked on stage and walked on the tight rope with mom. 'Do you beleiven yourself,' she askes me. 'Yes i do,' I reply.                               I'm on my way to my room when my mom comes up and said, 'you were great.' 'Thank you so much, you were great to.' I said to her. We walk in I quickly heat up a cup of noodles and get out my pajamas and put them on my bed. 'Beep, beep, beep!' I run in the kichen and pour it in a boul the steam rose I put ice cubes in it and grab a t.v. tray and eat in my room after I finish I jump in the shower.

It was because me and my family went to the circus. When my mother told me I  was very excited so the next day I got up super early to get ready. Finally we got in the car and left i couldn't wait to get there. I had never been to the circus but I always heard about it from my friends. I would always ask my parents and they would usually say maybe I was so happy today it was a yes!                           When I got out of the car there was a man wearing a tall hat. He welcomed us and asked for our tickets my dad took them out of his pocket and gave them to the man and the man let us in. Right when I walked through the yellow curtains my eyes lit up I saw the juggler and he was on a unicycle! I had always wanted to ride, or even see a unicycle. Then my dad motioned us to our seat. And that was my first memory of my first circus.                         My name is Andrew I am a juggler in the circus just like i had dreamed. When I was 11 (a year after I went to the circus) I asked my parents for a unicycle for my birthday. They must have thought I was crazy because they both stared at each other then back at me. I told them I wanted to try and ride it like the man at the circus. They told me that unicycles were very hard to ride and that the man was a professional, they also didn't want me to get injured but I didn't care.                           Instead of getting a unicycle for my 12th birthday I got a set of juggle balls. I thought if my parents weren't going to let me get a unicycle I should learn how to juggle first. At first I tried with two balls, one in each hand. I tossed the right one to the left hand and caught it so I had two balls in my left hand. After I got pretty good at that I tried with three balls but I couldn't do it. The next week I got a phone call from my friend nick asking him if I wanted to come with him and his family to the circus. I asked my mom and she said yes. When I got there we were late so we sat down immediately. During the show when the juggler came out he asked for a volunteer. I raised my hand up high. He closed his eyes and turned around and pointed straight at me.                                               Nervously I walked down to him. He told me that he was going to teach me how to ride a unicycle. I got so excited and by the end of the day I could do it, I could ride a unicycle! After the show I still couldn't juggle so I went up to him and asked him if he could teach me, he gave me his card and walked away. Later that night I told my parents everything and asked if I could call the juggler. They said that I could so I did and he said he would give me lessons.    And that is how I became a famous circus juggler. 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT JJS NN RB .

At 7am they wake up to get dressed and go to the pie car for breakfast they also have to set up tents,lights,and music for the show.   at 9am they have to go to school.  they're one room school house travels with them.  like any school,ours has computers,tests,and report cards.  Because the circus performers are from different country s.                Also at 3:30 pm they have to do chores and practice.  Bella has to feed,water,and groom the horses they use in there horse back act.  her dad practices somersaulting of a running horse.  Bella practices on leaping from a  trampoline onto a horses back ;it takes balance and concentration.  Other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics.  They're neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash.  Trainers work with Elephants,Lions, and chimpanzees.           At 6:30 pm it is dinner time.  Bella's family go to the pie car to eat but they don't eat much.  They do 10 shows a week.  They do one each week day,plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on Saturday,and two on Sunday.  They have to travel to different places in the wold to perform.           After the show they are all tired.  To get back to their trailer they have to pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers.  Two days later they will be set up again.  But first they have to travel to that place.  They begin the day the same way all over again.           Working in a circus is good because you learn different languages.  Also because you could make other people feel happy.  Clowns paint their face with different feeling like happy, or angry.  Clowns make people feel happy that's why they are the main person in the show.  The animal trainers risk them selfs to train lions, elephants, and chimpanzees....

Some familiess travel up to 20,000 miles in seven months in each year, visiting more than 150 cities. Some kids work up to sunup and sundown.       Usually  most kids wake up a 7:00 A.M. wake up, get dressed, and go to some place to eat for a light but heavy breakfast like pancakes and bacon (that way they don't get sick).        Then at 9:00 A.M. it's school time. Some circus people have a one-room schoolhouse. Like any other school theirs just the same. but because circus performers kids are from all over the world the have kids that speak different languages, like French, Russian, and Italian.        At 3:00 P.M. school's over and they have time for a quick break.    At 6:30 P.M. It's dinner time and the families can't eat much, because their performing that night. They do 10 shows a week: one each week day, plus a matinee on Wensday, two on Saterday, and two on Sunday.       Circus life is tough!

First of all you have to work really hard you have to wake up early and go to bed late every night. I had ten circus concerts every week, when I woke up me and my famley  go to the pie car for breakfest.       One hard thing is that you never can call were you are home, and your never their long anoght to play sports. Plus you never see you famley.   The schools had only one room.       Not just anyone can be in a circus you have to be a good dancer, very athletic. And you have to be good with animals an and comfident.

You have to practice practice practice in order to get all of the streches righy. You have to be very flexible. Being flexible is good for doing backflips, backbends, and frountflips. If you want to be in the circus you have to have the right body type and be very determined. You have to put your heart into it and be certain that that thats what you want to do.       The seconed reason why its hard to be in the circus is traveling all of the time. Traveling is very hard because you have to travel to Australia, Japan, and all over North America. People travel on the road with 100 people who are like family. You never have any time   for your family and pets because your so busy with your career.       The third reason why I think its hard to be in the circus is people think that being in the circus is all fun and games and goofing around, it's not. Performers work long days and spend alot of time away from home. In order to be in the circus, you ave to say good bye to your family and petsI would not want to be in the circus if I were you.

They came to watch the animals not the clowns why did the clown have to be created you know that's studied because why else would kids hate clown. I think that have a little kid clowns and have grow ups clowns because then kid wouldn't be scare or have nightmare anymore kid being scared of the clowns.

My act in the wonderful show's are an acrobat/horse back rider. I chose to be these because I get to fly through the air or jump off of horses and all that cool jazz. Also I like to be around other people (from different content) who teach me about where they come from.                                                                                                                    If you're are wondering about why I'm in the circus well.... because I love to here that people were amazed at what I do. Another reason is that I like to hang around with my animal buddies. Also I love to here oooooo's and aaaawww's in the crowd when I'm acting.            I love it at the old circus because there are now people to meet everywhere, and I get to act in front of people who actually like seeing you do life treating tricks. Also I like seeing the others do their special tricks. Another reason is that I see the animals that you don't see every day. That's my story. :)                  	PRP$ NN IN NNP NNP NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NNP CC DT VBZ PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NNP NNP NN IN DT JJ NN POS VBP DT JJ NN NNP PRP VBD TO VB DT IN PRP VBP TO RB IN DT NN CC VB RP IN NNS CC DT DT NN NNP NNP NNP IN TO VB IN JJ NNS : IN JJ NN : WP NN PRP IN WRB PRP VBP NNP NNP PRP VBP VBP VBG IN WRB PRP VBP IN DT NN RB : .

When I wake upI go eat breakfest and then go get dressed for school. I go to a one room school with kids from all over the world.           When I am done with school I eat alittle dinner and go peform two shows each week. It gets late when I get home.What I do in the circus is I do flips and dance for the adounice.It gets tirieng from time to time but I got used to.           The only thing I don't like about being in the circus is that once you move somewhere you finally get used to it then you have to move all over agian to a new place.But I do gat to see alot of new things I have never seen before.

The trapeze is my specialty. In fact the ring master says I'm his favorite trapeze artist. Even my best friend Jason the lion tamer says I'm good. I'm not so sure though.        Our circus travels all over Europe and Asia performing in places like Russia, France, China, England, and Taiwan but, my favorite place to visit is Italy that's where I'm from.We only take one or two trips a year and that day is today! When were in Italy I'll only have one day to be with my family so I'm going to make the most of it. Jason and his family are from Italy too. Jason's looks almost as exited as I am.        That was the best trip to Italy ever. First I went to my parents house where they had set up a surprise welcome home party for me. Then we went to my favorite pizza place down the street, and I was stuffed by the time we left. After that we went next door to Jason's house. He was so happy to see us. His parents had also thrown him a surprise party too. He offered me cake but I told him I was full.       We hang around his place for a few hours. Next it was time to perform Jason and I had convinced the ring master to give our families front row seats right next to each other. Our families looked so happy while we were performing. Finally after the show it was time to hit the road again. Jason and I said our goodbyes as we got in train. We were sad to leave, but I bet next time will be even better.

Thank goodness there was a net there! I would have hurt myself really bad. Well if your wondereing what I'm talking about, well then im talking about acrobat! The easiest circus performance that you could fall and probaly break something.        What I have learned from being in acrobatist for awhile, is that it takes a lot of muscles, concentration, and balance. Although it might seem so fun, its not. You could fall or if you look down it might be scary to you. So dont look down. It might seem scary at first  but trust me it gets better.          A couple years ago my parents joined the circus, my sisters and I  joined with them. At first we were juggleing. Now Im an acrobatist. Well sort of, Im really low to the ground but im still haigh enough to where i need a net under me. One of my sisters is training the horses, my other sister is on the tightrope. She needs really good balance to be on the tightrope, the good thing is that she has a net under her as well, shes gotten the hang of things but she still has fallen. My other sister, shes still trying to get the hang of things. I on the other hand, have never fell. I have slipped before, thats because i was supposed to.          When I get older i want to stay in the circus although im still in school, i dont mind the chores. I think whenever i do chores its an easier way to get more exersise. Ayway, when I am out of school im still going to be an acrobatist and I'm still going to do all my chores. Now you know about my circus life.

I miss my family sometimes, so I call my mom every week. There is some fun to it however.          I am part of a trampoline act in the circus. It is pretty fun! I have to do lot of flips then land on a horse which rides me off stage. It takes a lot of practice to get all the flips and leaps down. All while on a trampoline! If it is pulled of correctly, the act looks amazing and pro-like. Thats what I want it to look like.          There are some bad things about being in the circus. You work long hours (including the weekends) and rarely get a break. You also have poor schooling as well. Plus living in a trailer isn't the best kind of home. Also if you make friends, you will have to leave them. You can not comemit to any sports outside of the circus either.         As you can see, there are good and bad things about being in the circus. So it's yur choice if you want to be in it.

' I am telling the police, fatso!' WHIP!!! 'Owwwwwww!' 'Ow, Ow, Ow!' I said. I have just been whipped by the meanest, worst Chief Executive Officer ever. His name is Mr. Meani and we, me and my fellow workers, call him Fatso Meany. He owns the Circus of Awesomeness. We don't ever get a paycheck nor any food. Not even the children! He even put a fence around the circus so we don't run away.         Well because of all this nonsense we are on strike. The children can't work anyways because they have no food. STOMP STOMP STOMP! Yes! the law enforces are here. They are looking around the circus. Many of the workers thank them for coming here. Then suddenly one of the law enforcers asks all the kids to come to him. He sees that they are starving. So, he tells Mr. Meani that he will have to bring the children home.          There is a performance tonight and we plan to perform very poorly. The trapeze artist is going to fall of the trapeze. The animal handlers are going to forget the animals in the trailer, and I, the tightrope walker, will cut the rope when I am supposed to walk on it. Minutes before the circus, we practiced how we would mess the show up. During the practice I got bruised badly, and so did the trapeze artist because we fell down, but we still had the heart to spoil the show.          After the show, the CEO was really mad. He was as mad as a bear who had been disturbed from hibernation. He made us all stand in a line and blindfolded us. Then he whipped each and every one of us a couple times. Some of the older workers were moaning on the floor after that! We got so mad at this that we decided that we had to escape somehow. We brainstormed for hours but then with each idea we ended up realizing that we would be caught. Then I thought why don't we make an underground tunnel that leads us out. So, we started to make this tunnel.           When we were done with it we decided to make batches of ten and give them names. My batch's name was Gemini. We were supposed to be the last batch to go. The first five batches were a success. When the sixth batch, Draco, went through the tunnel they were discovered by the CEO. The CEO was outrageous he had everyone whipped three times.            Then Draco went again, this time they escaped. Now that there were only 40 people left, the CEO was realizing that the we were up to something. For this reason, we decided the rest of the batches should go right away. When we were done the CEO was outrageous. He had lost all his workers. When the law enforcers came again they saw that there were no workers and that we had left notes describing how the CEO had treated us. So, Mr. Meani was arrested and put into jail. The remaining of us escaped to the Circus of Kavish and lived happily ever after. 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP RB TO VB DT IN PRP . DT NN . DT NN . '' '' PRP VBP VBG DT NN , RB . '' NNP . . . JJ .

Other than ups and downs there are many different activities before and after a circus performence. We do many tricks like acrobatics, gymnastics, juggling, and many different tricks and fun.           First, there is waking up then going to the pie cart, which is the place where all circus performers eat. After breakfast, they go to a school on the go in the trailers. The school has computers, tests, and report cards just like regular schools.          Then they have quick breaks from work. They have fun practicing juggling, trampoline, acrobatics, and gymnastics. Then they have chores and practice for the circus performance. The chores include grooming, watering, and feeding the horses in the stable. They practice jumping on the trampoline and then onto a horse which requires great concentration. Many others are practicing juggling, acrobatics, and gymnastics          Then comes the show at night. Everyone eats before the show but not too much because they are performing later. Then they all go to their trailer and rest for the night. They do the same thing for two days then move on. That is a daily life of a circus performer.

The crowds cheering for me, as I   am also juggling. I am only a few yards away from the end. Oh no, i start to lose my balance. The crowds worried but I am determined to get across. This is my life in a circus.   Even though I am juggling I try to regain my balance. I am on   balance and the crowd cheers for me. I make it across the tight rope. I then go down and do my next act. I start bouncing o the tampoline and get ready to somersault onto the horse's back. It takes timing. 	DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNP VBP VBG IN DT JJ NN .

I got up and quickly went to change and take my shower because I knew this was another day at the circus. After a lunch of pancakes and bacon, I am at school at 9:00 am. I come prepared to school with all my pencils, erasers, notebooks, and textbooks. At 3:00 pm, school is finally over and I take a little break. After I finish my homework I then I practice the stunts I will perform during the circus show tonight. When we finish dinner of pasta and spaghetti and meatballs, we prepare at 6:30 pm and go to our three hour long circus show.          I walk on two separate tightropes while I juggle five bowling pins while my dad is walking a alleged tiger while riding on a six feet tall unicycle. My mom is walking on a ball while juggling seven bowling pins. We received a wild standing ovation from the audience. After our turn is done, the next group goes on. The next group is even more wild and receives a great applause when a person does a double front flip and lands on his feet gently. Then the next group goes and then it is followed until the last group comes. After the three hour show is over, we walk back to the trailer sluggishly and tired.          We go to bed and hope to sleep quickly knowing that we have another show to perform the very next day.

Well bub, trust me, this is going to be a story for the ages.       Now it was a usual circus day with normal circus behavior. Steve the stuntman was perfecting his normal routine of being shot out of a cannon, Dion our head juggler is trying to get a grip on the chainsaws, Alfred was training with animals, and myself, Kamyar the Incredible, was on the tight rope as usual walking back and forth with some tricks through in there as well. Then suddenly, the unthinkable happened. the baddest man on the planet, Billy 'the toad' Johnson. He was nicknamed the toad because he really liked swamps and had really bumpy skin. Anyway back to the story. Out of nowhere he broke into the our tent and mugged us. Yah, you read correctly, mugged us, this is no kid story! He stole nearly everything there including some of our extra clothes. We were wondering what we could do with just two days before our big performance. ' Hey guys, how about we make an A-Team,' said Steve. 'That's an awesome idea Steve!' 'I call being Mr.T!' Okay Dion, you can be Mr.T.'       We decided on our new costumes and we became the A-team. We then arrived at the police station to ask them what they know about Billy Johnson. We learned that he loves to disguise himself in a variety of costumes. So we made a plan of action for how we were going to capture 'the toad' and we came up with this. Since the police had told us his location by one of their undercover operatives. So we decided that we where going to disguise our van like an ice cream truck, sneak up on him, and arrest him. We were set. Once we were in the same location and spotted 'the toad' with his disguise it was go time. Dion and I rolled out of the van and hide close by Billy, while Steve and Alfred we driving the van with the cops in the same direction. Once Dion and I were right behind Mr. Johnson we jumped on him, tied him up, and ploped him onto the van. We then had found all of our things in time for the show. We never heard from Billy 'the toad' Johnson ever again. Yes, I know this is about as cheesy as it gets but I will do it anyway. The end.

First, I start with my triple back flip. Then, I practice my acrobat skills with Joey. OK. I'm ready. The pressure is on as I walk onto the stage. I take a deep breath and show my skills. 'Bravo! Bravo!' the manager says.' You're hired.' This has been the best time of my life.       My first day starts off as practicing my trampolining with Joey who was also hired. After everyone have there parts practiced,  our first circus show starts. Everyone swung like colorful butterflies and there were no mistakes. The show was a success! The crowds cheered and we knew they wanted more. So, we continued to have more shows. Gradually, we had a show everyday! Everyone loves our circus and will continue to be successful.   the end 	PRP$ NN IN DT NN NNP NN NNP PRP RB VBD PRP$ NNP NNP NNP NNP RB TO NN PRP$ NNS IN DT NNP NNP , PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN RB NNP NNP , PRP VBP PRP$ NN NNS IN NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NN VBZ IN IN PRP VBP IN DT NNP NNP VBP DT NN NN CC NN PRP$ NNP NNP .

Circus life isn't easy it's full of difficulties and I, Florence Scaboldi, should know. I live in a trailer with my mama and papa.         Every morning we wake up do our morning routine and then go to the pie car. We eat breakfast while the crews are setting up  tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.         Then, it's time for school in our one-room schoolhouse that travels with us.Our school is like any other. The other circus performers are from all over the world so some of my classmates are: French, Russian, and Italian like me.         After school it's time for a break I play with the clowns, animals, and my pet Baxter, he's small because we don't have any room in our trailer for a big dog.         Then I have to chores and practice my acrobatics. First, I take care of the horses we use in some of our acts. After that, it's time to practice for the show on the Spanish web and my dad practices carrying my mom, while he's hanging on a rope, with nothing but a kabob skewer!         Time for dinner. My family and I go to the pie car, but eat a little food because we have a show soon. We do ten shows a week: one each weekday, plus two on Saturday and two on Sunday.         At 10:30 P.M. the show is over and I'm exhausted. Walking back to our trailer, we pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. In two days we'll set up for another show.         Later, at midnight I'm thinking about the end of the tour across the country. It would be nice to go back home to Napol, Italy. I think if I will be a circus performer when I'm an adult like my mama and papa? Who knows? The circus is fun, but it's a hard and busy life.

There are circus performers from all over the world.               You also have to prctice your acts like riding a unicycle while juggiling.You also do shows day and night.you dont get to meet other people.Another thing you get to do is travel to japan, Astralia, and all over North America.You get to see people get excited.              When you work in the circus it's alot of people watching you and it's alot of hard work.You have to work hard to get into the circus like the right atetuid and you need a specific talent and you need to have rythem and you need to be flexibal.There are also afternoon shows.                 Before a show you have to get a costume on and if your a girl you might have to put on makeup like glitter, eyeshadow. When your a curcus performer you can travel and learn different launguages like French, Russin ,and Italian. when your done with your practice you can take a short break. When there's a show some acrobatics  take out the net and when they fall and get hurt there's no net to cetch them uwhen they fall and hit the ground.                Also when you work in the curcus a show usually ends at around 10:00 or 10:30 at night or at day. When your a clown you are going to were alot of makeup for your face and your going to were big shoes and white gloves and a weird wig.

She has an 18 year old partner from Ireland named Alexzanderr Madonicase. They work together during shows and are best friends. But one day, Alysonni's leg and foot broke during one of the tricks in practice. She was taken to the nearest hospital with costume and all and had her leg checked out. When the results came back they showed that her foot was severely fractured and she had to have surgery on it. They thought that she may never be able to do another trick again.              While she was recovering form her surgery for a whole nine months, Alexzanderr came to visit her every day until she went back to her home in Italy. While in Italy Alysonni thought about quitting her dreams of being an acrobat in Cirque Du Soleil. On her 18th birthday she got a call from Alexzanderr asking her to go to one of the shows in Italy. She quickly obliges and 3 days later her and her family go to the circus she once performed at.              At the show, Alexzanderr dedicated his performance to her. After the show they met up and Alexzanderr was so happy to see her. They called each other every day since then. Alysonni had already got her cast off and was almost ready to perform again. She was still anxiously waiting to perform again.       After the nine months passed, Alisonni was able to perform again. She was done waiting for the moment when she was finally able to be back and do another performance with Alexzanderr. After awhile, her and Alexzanderr both achieved their dream and made it to a Cirque Du Soleil show and became one of the best duo's in the whole circus industry.

To me I wouldnt want to be in a circus cause theres always to much going on. But if i was i would love to be with the animals and teach them all kinds of tricks like jumping through a hula hoop and teaching them them to be nice to people and not bite them when the people are trying to pet them. I think it is really difficult to be in a circus with all kinds of things going on its like they are at a zoo.                It probably is fun but when it comes to doing things like swinging from swings but when it comes to me i would not want to do that. Or even walking in a ring of fire thats way to scary. I would like to watch one but not really be in it. It is fun watching people in a circus and watching them do magic trickes and even watch the animals. To me the animals are relly smart when it comes to being in a circus its pretty much the same as when people have a lot of stuff going on and have to remember the animals have the exact same thing going on but they cant talk so they just have to be smart and do it on there own.                 One thing i wont look for if i was in a circus is the clowns because they are really creepy to me its like they just wear to much makeup and it looks really bad. I like the circus but i wont ever want to be in it at all only because its scary creepy and very dangerous if it wasnt scary creepy and dangerous i maybe would of joined it. But since there are clowns and its still dangerous im not going to ever do it. Maybe i would like to have a busy plan instead of just staying home and being bored.                  Another thing is that i would not want the animals by me i do not want to be bitten by them at all it pretty much is gonna hurt really bad. To me i really like the circus but i dont want to do anything related to being in the circus because if you dont have a net under the bottom of the swing you will probably fall and break something like your arm or your leg or your neck or maybe even your back.

I learned that the girl that works in a circus is named Bella, and her troup travels 20,000 miles in 7 months of a year.You have to be on time and can't mess up the act.You can pick to be a animal trainer, Acrobat,and even a CLOWN!!!!!!!! Do that pacific talent that you are told to do.                     People leave their home for a long time.When they do they still have fun with the animals and the acts of performing.Their acts are very impotant to them because they work so hard to perfom that show .Most of the people that work at a circus like it, but you would always miss your family back at where ever you are from.You can also learn to do new tricks and make peole laugh when they are sad and you can cheer them up.                     You should be very deturmand on what you are doing and hope you do it right. If you don't pay- atintion on what you are doing you could brake a leg or be very injurd.That's why you are tought so long ,so that you know what to do and how to do it.Once you know what to do you will never be scard and have no fear, because you know how to do it!Yes it does take along time before you get back home because you could be 1,000's and 1,000's of miles away but to work in a circus  and do amazing things its all worth the work in the end.

On night time we had to travel to another country to perform another show so when we got there we dressed up in our costume and acted funny so the kids would laugh and would enjoy us and tell them some of our stories. Being a Circus Clown is kind of hard because some of the kids are scared of us so we tried not to scare them but to make them laugh. Some of the people liked us as a clown and thought that we were nice and enjoyed our performance. It was really hard for us to be a clown because we have to work everyday and we sometimes miss our family because we nevered see them. A circus clown is kind of fun because we get to make kids smile and laugh so they can enjoy our show. Circus Clowns are like the people that makes people scared and happy so we can amke the childrens life haappy and exciting!

It took a lot of hard work to be where I am now but it is all worth it. I am an acrobatic in the circus but I also learn other skills such as trapeze and tightrope walker. I have been training for a while but if you put your mind to it anything is possible.       Every morning I wake up and eat breakfast in our trailer, afterwords I go to circus school from 9:00 to 3:00. After school I help get ready for the show, I practice my balance for the tight rope and for the trapeze. The acrobatics part of the show is my faborite because it's starring me! I love the circus because I like to eat tacos and get fat! It's great I hate excersizing because I don't want to be skinny..........................................................................................................................................................................CHOCOLATE IS DELICIOUS......................................COTTON CANDY TASTES LIKE SPINNED SUGAR 	NNP NNP NNP NN IN DT NN NN VBZ RB DT NN CC NNS RB VBZ DT NN IN NN NNP PRP VBP DT NN NN CC PRP VBP VBN VBG PRP$ NN NN , IN DT NN IN CD PRP VBD VBG NN RB PRP VBD VBG , VBG , VBG , CC NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN NN NN TO VB WRB PRP VBP RB CC PRP VBZ DT NN NNP PRP VBP DT JJ IN DT NN CC PRP RB VBP JJ NNS JJ IN NN CC NN NNP PRP VBP VBN VBG IN DT NN CC IN PRP VBD PRP$ NN TO PRP NN VBZ NNP NNP NN PRP VBP RP CC NN NN IN PRP$ NN , NNS PRP VBP TO VB NN IN CD TO CD IN NN PRP VBP VB JJ IN DT NN , PRP VBP PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN CC IN DT NNP NNP NNS NN IN DT NN VBZ PRP$ NN IN PRP VBZ VBG PRP .

When we seat down the show was about to start. The first peformers are about to start and they were the circus clowns. They were so funny I was about to fall down. The next people to perform is the circus Acrobats. It is a crazy thing to do when you are in the air.   Then, the Circus juggler was next. he had juggled five ringsfor a very long time. The second last performer is the  tightrope walker.He is very dangerous to do that and he made it acrossthe rope.And the last performers to perform is the Circus horses. the person that controled them was doing great and the show was great to.   finally, the concluding sentence: The circus is a good place to go so if I like it you can see it you'll like it to.

Have you ever wondered who the first circus proformers are will ill tell you. Along time ago in 1602 there lived about 5 werewolfs they each had very special talants, the first one was very funny, the second one was very nimmble, the third one was very strong, the fourth one was very agile, and the fith one had a way with animals. They  all wanted to put on a show but they couldnt because hamans are afraid of werewolfs. then suddenly the fith werewolf got an idea.                                                                                               They all worked hard but finaly thay all made their tent. They all practiced too. the first one became the clown because of his funnyness, the second one became the acrobat because of her nimmbleness, the third one became the strongman because of his strenght, the fourth one became the leader because of his agileness, and the fith one became the animal trainer. Finaly they headed for town.                                                                        When they first got there people were scared, but then the clown appeared out of a tiny toy car and then smacked himself with a pie everybody laughed. then the acrobat came out and walked across a tight rope everybody cherred. Then the strong man came out and lifted up a horse everyone was amazed. Then the circus leader camout and jumped a long distance and landed on his feet everyone clapped. Then finaly the animal trainer cameout and he made baboons act like humans everyone stood up and clapped and cherred.

I was so excited i went home right away to pack for the circus train.         When I got on the train i was amazed with what I saw. There werer all kinds of animals and tons of clowns packed in a tiny car. Then I saw my room on the train and started to unpack right away. When they told me that I still have to get an education in was very sad. I thought that it was going to get me out of school. But then i met my teacher and decided that it wasn't so bad.

There is a car,  called a pie car. That is where we go to eat.               I keep a daily schedule on my wall.  And now that i am  telling you about it i might as well show you.  8:00 A.M. i wake up and go to the pie car.  Where we 'circus clowns' eat.             When it is 10:00 A.M. i go to tight rope practice.  This activity is the most dangerous in the circus.  I use special shoes that have squishy bottoms.                At 12:00 P.M.  We have our first show.  This show is always different because we can bring the elephants out.  My dad brings the elephants out for the first show only because they are not completely trained yet            4:00 P.M i have free time, sort of like recess the clowns play with me, they act like they are driving motor cycles.                   I have school too.  There is a train car in the back end of the train.  That is where my mom teaches me, and my sister haley.            The name of our circus is Wild Thangs.

Don't say any more.' 'But,' 'No!' Isabel's mom stormed out of the room. 'I just wanted to say goodbye.' Isabel found a bag and started packing. 'Dad, Mom is angery at me.' 'Yes, I know.'

I love the curcese but my favorit jobs in a circuse are acrabating and  traning and going on stage with the horces. I meet knew people with different langwiges. Did you know that you get to learn about all the places you are going to go when you are traviling? I have to learn lots of  langwiges because then it will be hard to under stand everybody and be all confused. Okay I will tell you a story that happened yesterday.We were on our way to Missouri and we bumped into a little situation. Well not realy a 'little' situation actaualy it was quite bad.          We drove into a tornato and all our food is lost and some animals have gone and 10 people died 23 were injered. The wors part is that my dad got very the most injered. Did you know that he is so injered that we are making a grave for him? He is the only animal trainer still liveing and befor the tornado happened my mom was getting trained and she isn't fully trained from him yet. He is in the hospital so he can't train my mom and she isn't lisenced yet and all she knows is how to train horses. Luckly she can train with Alix but he hasn't helped a person get talt to train animals he only trained animals.         I've been praying for my dad every night and It is not working so well. Last night I prayed that he would get better at least a little and all that happened was that he went into a cemical bath and they found some thing about him! It was that he is alergic to the cream that they put in after they do the cemical bath. Did you know that finding out that he was alejic to that stuff made my mom so mad that they put that cream on him that she didn't talk to enyone today and she is stilldoing that? 10 days later... I am so happy my dad is better he is not in the hospital he is at hom in the liveingroom but he can't move his lag for a whole week so I get to see my dad know! I hope I dont have to see a tornato ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Acrobats have to practice a lot so they don't fall. let me tell you a story about the time I wanted to join the circus.                 It began when I was 11 I wanted to be an acrobat. It was exciting to go and try out but then it was scary to do it. Another person saw me and told me to go for it so I did. I did it and the ring master said I did a great job. When every one was done he told me I made it in the circus. I was so happy I ran home.                 I went to the circus the next day and I started practicing with the other acrobat and it was fun. I fell a few times but after a wile I got the hang of it. I went home and told my mom all the things I learned. She said she saw me for a little bit but then she had to go. She said I did very good.                 The next day we did a show. I got nervose at first then my partner said to pretend like it was practice. I got up and went out there. when my act was over everyone cheered. I was happy.

A circus travels around the world  doing amazing acts. If you want to be in a circus you have to have  talent a strong and flexible body and be determined. Although you might think to be a circus preformer does not include learning it actualy does . Traveling around the world includes geography. Have you ever thought what job you would like to have if you were a circus preformer. In my opinion i would be  a acrobatic.              In the circus you might see exotic animals like elephants, tigers, bears, camels, seals,lions, and horses. You may also see amazing acts like lion taming, trapeeze, acrobatics, clowns, fire eating, and sword eating.The circus is a big group a people who travel around the worl amazing other people. You might also see people from all over the world. they might speak different languages too.             Have you ever thought if it would be fun to live with a circus. in my opinion it would actualy be fun but hard. It would be fun because you meet people from all around the world and learn how to speak different languages. It would be hard because you would have a lot of chores and you would have to wake up early.There is many fun expieriences in a circus . You would also do the same routine every day.             In a circus the main colors are red and white well in my opinion there the main colors because they represent the clowns. Clowns are the main act in a circus. Most people go to the circus just to see the clowns. Clowns are funny and amazing.Clowns are probably the main act.             In a circus there is a total of 12 jobs. There's  trapeez, acrobatics, lion taming, training animals, food vendor, juggling, ticket vendor,ring master,usher, stage hand, clown, merchandise vendor. These are the main jobs in a circus. The jobs are not ordered . This is a circus.

Being a acrobat is a hard and long routine. You will need to learn all the tricks. Other things at a circus is easier. If you fall when doing you acroat tricks it heurts if theres no net or if it riped.?                      If you want to do somthing else you also need to practice that. Juggiling is hard, that takes concertation and skill. You need to have even objects. If you don't have even stuff you will mess up and get embaressed. If you use sharp things you need to be extra careful.                      Other things are a bit easier. Taming animals is easier because the animals are half trained at the zoo and half at the circus. Only certain animals are at the circus. Monkeys, tigers, and dogs are the main animals at the circus. There are so many I named a few.                                         Also another job is mortor cycling. Where you are in a big cage and do tricks and loops. It is the coolest thing you could ever imagine and see. It is the most popular thing to do.but it takes major concentration.

We both  said ok.Gavin said 'I wonder what it will be, maybe a new pool or a big huge new playhouse'  'I don't think it's going to be that big' I replied back to him.the rest of the day me and Gavin couldn't stop thinking about the big suprise we just couldn't seem to get it out of out head's.           That night I couldn't go to sleep because I cept wondering what it was.I tried to turn music on and that didn't work,I tried to close my eyes and that didn't work,And I tried to count sheep but that didn't work either so I just stayed awake but all of the sudden I hear a sound in Gavin's room so I go in there the lights are on and he's under the cover's playing on his leap pad.           So I sneak up to him  and pull the covers off real fast and he gaspes.He say's 'sissy' real loud I say 'shhhhhhh try to be more quiet'.He say's 'ok I can't go to sleep so I decided that I would  play on my leap pad'.           So I say 'can I play on It too'? 'sure' Gavin replied.So me and Gavin played on it for hour's and hour's untill I look at Gavin's Angry  bird alarm clock and it was exactly 1:00 AM in the morning.All of the sudden I tell Gavin really fast its 1:00 in the morning.           Gavin say's 'we better get some sleep' I agreed with him let's get some sleep.Gavin put's his leap pad up and jump's in bed.I go back in my room and fall right back to sleep.           In the morning I get up wake Gavin up and we go into the bathroom to brush our teeth we look in the mirror and we both have bags under our eyes so I go through G-moms makeup bag and find some liquid foundation so I put it under our eyes and we looked good as new.           We all got dressed and got in the car G-mom and G-dad drove us to our big suprise.IT WAS A CARNIVAL!!!!!!!!! Me and Gavin were siked we all ran out of the car after we parked and dashed right through the door when we all got in there,there were thousands of  people.               So me and Gavin held G-mom and G-dad's hand we stopped by the cotten candy magine and the popcorn stand and got all kinds of stuff.When we walked through the doors to get our seats it said 'The Amazing Ring Ling Brothers.               When we got our seats the lights went off and the big speakers said 'welcome to the ringling brothers stadium.when the show started we all were so excited.Once they started everybody screamed and shouted they were so excited  and so were we.           they jougled and walked a rope over a shark tank and made clowns pop out of a teeny car and people were also spinning on giant ropes.And a whole lot of other stuff that was really cool like make lions jump over you it was fantastic.           When we got home we were worn out we went right to sleep on the couch it wore us out. and that was our big suprise.

Performing in the circus takes a lot of practice, time, skill, and talent.  We practice five days a week until 8:30 p.m.                      The circus, of course, travels all the time so we are never in the same town for more than three days.  When we travel we ride with all of the circus performers and all of the technical and stunt crew.  We have been to 35 states so far and we are not stopping now!                  When we perform we do six different acts. My stunt is walking on the tightrope.  Really fun!!!!  When I turn 16 I will move on to doing the acrobatic stunts.  The other stunts are the clowns, acrobats,jugglers,the circus horses, and then my favorite one the canon shooting.  Yes, these stunts are dangerous but, it's all worth it in the end.                   We are having a contest that anyone can enter and win a free trip and more!  So, enter, try to win, and if you win I'll see you there!!!!  Good luck!!!!!!!!!!

You need to understand that at 7:00 A.M. you wake up get dressed and go to the pie car. 9:00 A.M. School time. Our one room school house travels with us. 3:00 P.M.Schools over,time for a quick break.3:30 P.M. Chores and practice.6:30 P.M. Dinnertime. 10:30 P.M. The show is over :00 A.M. In bed thinking about the end of our touring season. One of the upsides is that you get to travel all around the world. You get to work in Australia, Japan and all over North America. The circus has given me the opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many different people. I travel on the road with 100 people who are like a circus family to me. When you're young it's the time to do it. It's the time to travel, the time to grow and experience your life. It's great to see the faces of the audience just jump alive when I make eye contact with them during a performance. Despite what many people think the life of a circus performer isn't all high flying fun its just great to see the fans.

People were jumping and bounceing around.the coolest part was when i got to volenteer! I saw alot of clowns stuffed in a car it was so funny!                When i was a volenteer a man made me dissapear. A clown came up to me and i don't like clowns. There was a guy who spit fier. A man on a elafant and a guy on stilts.               But a guy swinging from tight ropes fell and broke his leag. An ambulance came right away. So thats when the show ended.                 Going to a circus is fun. Alot of coool charitars and animals.

She was so bored, then on t.v she saw the circus was looking for new performers and she suddenly had an idea that just popped into her head, she could join the.................. CIRCUS!!! But how would she tell her mom, should she run away, no that would scare her mom half to death, maybe she could slip a note into her bedroom, or maybe she should tell her mom face to face, no because she would then get really MAD. So she decided to slip a note into her mom's bedroom. Then she was off to the circus.                 She finally reached the circus in Idaho. She made it into the circus because the boss was a clown, so he'd hire anybody. She did her first performance after two weeks of training but she couldn't hold on so she decided to do a trick where she tied 100 balloons to her waist in just the nick of time before she hit the ground she started floating up , everyone was amazed! Most people were so astounded that they passed out.                 She missed her mom and she asked the clown to see if she could call her and this is what the clown said, 'I can't let you do that,   because my boss will hit me with a bat'. So she just turned away and she decided it was time to go home. She missed her mom and she missed her puppy, Noodles. So she left a not near the front door near the boss's office. Then she was off to her real home.                 It took her three days and three nights before she reached her front door. She rung the doorbell and her mother was in tears and swooped her up in her arms and did not want to let go. As soon as she let her down Noodles came running and licked her face clean. They were so happy after that. And Fluffleluffagus never ran away again.

I live in a big trailer with my family.   We travel 20,000 miles in seven monthes each year, visiting 150 cities.   I work from sunup to sundown.   Here's a typical day for me: 7:00 A.M I wake up, get dressed, and go to the pie car1 for pancakes and bacon.   The crews are setting up tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.   9:00 A.M. School time. Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us.   Like any school, ours has computers, tests, and report cards.   Because the circus performers are from all over the world, many of my classmates speak other languages: Franch,Russian, and Italian, like my family.   As we travel around the country, our geography lessons come alive.   3:00 P.M. School's over---time for a quick break.   The clowns let me play with their unicycle and juggling balls 	NN WP NNS VBP NN VBZ JJ NN VBZ NNP PRP , NNP NNP , VBP NNP NNP VBP IN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN CD NNS IN CD NNS DT NN , VBG CD NNP NNP NN IN NN TO NNP NNP POS DT JJ NN IN PRP : CD JJ PRP VBP RP , NN VBD , CC VB TO DT NN NNP IN NNS CC NNP NNP NNS VBP VBG RP NNS , NNS , CC JJ IN NN POS NNP CD NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NN NNS IN NNP NNP DT NN , NNS VBZ NNS , NNS , CC NN NNP NNP DT NN NNS VBP IN DT IN DT NN , JJ IN PRP$ NNS VBP JJ NNS : JJ , NNP , CC JJ , IN PRP$ NNP NNP PRP VBP RP DT NN , PRP$ NN NNS VBP NNP CD NNP NNP POS IN : JJ IN DT JJ NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN CC VBG NNS	N		20131024132813	539		N	20131024135943	556		N

She was laying in her bed just waiting for something speacial to happen to her but she didn't know that was about to come true. She went to performe in the matinee on Thursday when she was doing her tightrope act she decided to do something she had never done before. She kicked her feet up and did a perfect backwards arial but missed the rope!! she fell to the ground and landed on the edge of the saftey net and bounced off. She was ruhed to the hospital in a circus ambulance and was told her cuncussion would disable her for the rest of her life. She was up set about having to leave the circus but Amber was glad she could stay home. Amber still went and watched the circus but never performed again in her life.

I might not be in the circus but I know there can be goods and bads.I can name 5 things  #1 is failing a trick in front of every one. #2 Is working with animals some thing can go wrong . Like if your alion tammer becuase the lions are wild animals and they come out of training anytime.The anthor bad thing is that you half to wake up early and dont get much brestfeast.                But dont get me wrong there is good things in the circus also like.You get to travel to diffrent places places youve never been before.You also get paid for the stuff you enjoy. I would love to join the circus. Sometimes it can be fun to work with animals. It could always be exciting and Intresing .            In the circus you could be any act you want you can even be a trapeze artist.Think about your perfect balence on a tight rope scary but cool . But whats even cooler is that you even do it with a partner. But you half to trust your partner.Also no matter what dot let your parter go at all.           When like when were in a circus are geogerphy lessons come alive. What youre thinking is what does that mean .that means when you do a report on  a state it comes true. you get to see places youve never been to . Also go places youve always wanted to go. So join the circus.              The circus could be fun at times and also not at times. please join if you want to win front row seats. it will be a  great experiance.Be prepared to be amazed . also to be satisfied.

My name is Casandra the Great. I am a magican that works here in the circus. Life here is always fun, but it is also tough.Our whole family works in the circus. We each have a different act. My brother is a clown, my sisters are acrobats, and my mom and dad are animal trainers. It's a lot of fun especially when you make someone happy. People think that being in a circus is a lot of fun, and it is, but it also requires hard work. If you want to know more about the circus life, keep reading!                 The first thing I do is wake up in the morning and go to the pie cart to eat breakfast. If none of my family is up I go to wake them up to give me breakfast. Then I get ready to go to school. I know what your thinking, 'how does this girl go to school if she keeps moving', the truth is we have a trailer that looks a lot like a classroom and all the kids go there so we could learn. For our recess, We go to the horses and ride them. We also go and see what the clowns are doing like my brother. After our recess, we go back to the trailer and start learning again until lunch. For lunch, we all go to eat corndogs, hotdogs, and popcorn. This is just in the moring! Of course we get out of the classroom in the afternoon, but this is what we do in the morning! Are you starting to see that being in a circus is hard work! If you don't keep reading.                 When we get out of the classroom, I go into my trailer and just relax. I might also go and play with my brother and sisters. I would also play with my dog Coco. He is a small dog. Then I start getting ready for the show. We all start practicing for the show. Of course I always practice on my brother. I always do tricks on them to see how my tricks end up. I always need to concentrate on my tricks. If I lose my concentration I will mess up real bad! I always need to think on that day's show. Then when we are finish practicing, we go to the piecart and eat. We are not allowed to eat a lot though. This is in the afternoon! Next, is the show.                 The show is finally here! This is always the time when everybody is nervous except me. I am always the opening act. It's always a great honor when you get the opening act. It is also awesome that you get to amaze them first. We always need to worry about who goes on first and second and so on. There is especially some preformers that get sick because they are really nervous. Now you know that it is a hard job.                 Now you know! It isn't a easy job. To be a circus preformer you will need to be confident and determined. You would also have to be used to staying up late. If you have all these traits then join! you would love it!

The circus is fun and entertaining because circus clowns are trying to make people laugh. Acrobats fly around and do backflips and frontflips to the audience. Circus jugglers maybe juggle rings, chainsaws, and other fun and dangerous things. The tightrope walker tries to balance on two feet and tries to balance on one foot. That is how life in a circus is really entertaining.            Circus clowns are funny and make people laugh. They do juggling, funny jokes, other tricks, and fun things. Clowns can make little kids cry when they show up. They can do a lot of daring tricks. They can also do magic to kids and grown ups.            Acrobats make people amazed when they do amazing stunts. They can also do backflips amd frontflips. They can also ride a motorcycle and balance it with the rope. Life in the circus is really hard for people who are in the circus show. The acrobats maybe practine in gymnastics and in gymnasiums. They can also swing each other around the circus. When they swing around, they come back to there normal spots.             A circus tightrope walker amazes people when they balance on one rope. They can use two long sticks and put it on there feet and still they can still balance on one rope. They can use a unicycle and can ride across the rope and doesn't fall. The experience of a tightrope walker is to be determined and be really good at balancing. I think tightrope walkers have the hardest job in the circus.            Circus animals do a lot of animal tricks in front of people. The trainer of the animals must work hard in this job. The animals can do tricks like balancing on a ball, being disappeared in the cage, and jumping on rock to rock. Animals like horses can jump and can stand up for a certain time. It takes a lot of work to be a trainer of all the animals in the circus.            It takes a lot of work to be part of the circus. Being an animal trainer is really hard, but you still have to strike hard in it. My favorite circus part is the acrobats. I like it because they do awsome stunts. Philippa said that when you're young It's time to do it. It takes a lot of work to be in a circus job because you don't have time to rest and you are busy everyday.

Zack is the oldest (and rudest) male trapeze artist and he is only twelve!So that leaves all the other girls working with the younger boys. I'm only eleven and all the other girls and boys ten and younger.In practice we learned how to hold each other by the arms and legs while one of us are keeping us both up in the air without slipping its the hardest thing that the younger kids are allowed to do.       11:00 AM-Lunch and prep for show        At lunch I had two burgers each.Fortunately Zack and I had to stop eating to to go to our separate dressing rooms toget into our matching outfits ecept that mine was a dress and his were pants and a shirt.My dress is purple with  strips of blue on my skirt.And Zack's outfit was a purple shirt and blue pants with purple stripes on the outside of the legs.       12:20 PM-Afternoon Show       We Had a blast during the trapeze act it was sooo fun we were swinging from one side to another and forming U shapes with each-other. Our parents said that it was the best act that they had seen in years!       5:30-Snack-Practice For Late Night Show       Since we did such a great job at the afternoon performance our pernets moved us to the advanced trapeze group.So we got to just watch what the advanced group did but I have to be honest, we still did better than the advanced adults.           7:30 PM-Late Night Show        During the late night show the adults seemed to like us better than the kids earlier that day! It was an amazing event.The Adults loved us and we loved them I mean after all we are better than the adult trapeze artists.           10:00 PM-Dinner-Bed time         We had Tacos For dinner that night because of our prefomance and went to bed.Every night i go to bed thinking about our house in California, I miss it a lot sometimes, epically on nights like this.Even though I hate Zack, I had a fun time with him tonight.

Everyone think that the circus is all about games and goofing around but it is a lot of hardwork. It is working long hard night and a lot of training.  Whenever I perfome there is a lot of people wahtch me when I perform. My heart starts raceing and I get so nervous finally it is time to go out. Everyone is staring at us waiting .        It is really hard to travle aroud the wrold and not living in one home for year but at the circus I live in a trailer where I live for several weeks. Once it is time I finally perform I walk out thinking abot everything that could go wrong in just a few seconds. My heart saces I get so nervous iwlak onto a tight rope thing it would break under my feet i hear nothing. When i finally ge accrosed it is silent for a few seconds but then i har everyone cheering and screaming. I feel so good and amazing about what just happened. Tha was the best we have ever performed in a long time everyone was so happy and cheerful. we could not wait till the next show.       We have been practicing a lot scense the last sow it was amazing the next show is going to much better I just know it everyone is ready andwaithing fo r the lights to come on we hurry out in our costumes to day I am an accrobat it the show I have never done that before. I am more nervous now than when I was before I stand waiting while my leg and arms shake. We walk out see everyone faces so happy and cheering 'this is gonna be the best show ever' I though to my self then when i see my dad in the croud i almos start to cry and now this has to be a dream. Even thought I kmow it is not I do thebes I can but ounce the show was over I ran straight to my dad waiting for him to hug me.       That night there was a huge part after for everyone who did great and performed and all of there family to join to. At the part everyone is so sad cause that was the last sow of the season. Even though we were sad we still had fun and can't wait for nex seasonto start.

It was hard to focus. I knew I needed to practice, but my mind kept telling me not to. I was tight-rope walking over fire.      'Okay.' I was talking to myself. When did I ever talk to myself? I was nervous. Very nervous. I was aware there is going to be a net between me and the fire, but I don't trust nets. I have fell through one twice already. I was balancing two feet above the ground when Autumn walked in. Autumn was a horse trainer, and a very good one. She could persude a horse to jump through fire!         'Oww!' I fell on the ground. She startled me. 'Oh! Sorry.' Autumn helped me up. 'I need to talk to you about your act.' I was comfortly seated in a chair. 'My act? Why?' I asked. 'I know your'e nervous, everyone is. But the audience doesn't want a net to help you.' Autumn was trying to sound as calm as possible, but it was hard not to. I just stared ahead. Out to the circus tent. I could hear beyond to red and orange stripes, into the big tent with bleachers and trainers.        'Hello?' Autumn wasn't very patient. 'Oh! Sorry. I-I am afraid. Even without the net that never really works, I'm really nervous.' Now I was pacing around the caravan. I didn't know what to do. I know, I needed to be confident, but how could I? I needed balance, and when you're scared that doesn't help. But I agreed to walk on a string, anyways.        'Balance!' Autumn yelled at me from nearly thirty feet below. 'That doesn't help.' I whispered. At least there wasn't any fire yet. There would be at dress rehersal. 'What?!' Autumn couldn't hear me. 'I said,' I finished the rope. 'I said, yelling doesn't help.' Now I was climbing down the ladder. 'Okay. Dress rehersal in an hour.' Autumn walked out of the wide, open tent.          Dress rehersal was fine. I just did not look down. If I did, I would fall into flames.I survived-dress rehersal! Now for the the real show. I stood up by the tight-rope the whole time before my act, posing and pretending to be scared at dangerous stunts. It was time. I closed my eyes. 'Don't look down. Don't look.' I forced myself. Alright. There was a twist.

Reason 1, Is that you need someone flexiable and able to do many things. I could clean cages, tight rope walk, Acrobatics, or, teach horses tricks.       Reason 2, Is because im great with animals One time I got a dog it was in 2007 and She's stil healthy. Everyday I would feed the animals before anything else. Plus i will clean up the pets mess.       Reason 3, I love doing chores if you would look at my room or the living room and even the dishes they are squeaky clean because I clean them as soon as they start to get dirty. So if the elephants have a accedent il will be there to clean it up.       Reason 4, For my act I could juggle or even be a clown. I once juggled 8 bean bags at one time! I could even maybe juggle 8 glass bottles with some practice.       That is why you should chose me for the circus contest.

There are people that were funny hats real funny hats.       The animals at the circus are cool there leopards, cheetahs, lion, horses, and elephants. You do a lot of cool tricks with all them animals. Like standing on a elephant while juggling       There's a lot of stuff to do when your a circus performer. You have to put face mask on before the show groom your animal and feed it. There's a lot of responsibilities in being a circus performer.       circus people take pride in what they do so if I win I'm going to take pride in that!

One time he was geting redy for the circus in 2 weeks. then somthing horible happend he tryed to jump through the small ring and burnt him self he was on fire with knoen around.                  They had to cancle the performenc and move it to3 weeks so his hair could grow back. the performenc grew closer and his hair was still not growing back.                                 It started to grow back and the lion was happy. But it was not growing fast enough. It was the day of the circus he was afraid that the people would laugh at him. And thats what happend then when he did his litte ring jump on FIRE!                     Then the moment of trouth would he make it? he took a deep breth and went for it.

When you work for a cicus you must practice, know what you are going to do, and know about a circus. You must have a good education if the circus isnt for you after awhile. You work long hours and you are away from home.             You can be a clown, acrobat, animal trainer, and a horseback rider. You eat from a pie cart, which is a place where food is stored. You eat whatever is made.             You have a school there too. It's there so you can have an education. If you thought going to the circus would get you out of school, it wont. You learn new things everytime. Being a circus performer is hard work.

I know everything about being in the circaus because I was in one last summer, but either way I still have to practice i don't want to do like i did last year I fell off of the horse and broke my leg. I 'm gonna be in the circus with my bestfriend and we work together perfectly. My bestfriend was also in the circus with me last summer and we had so much fun.      Okay, last summer when I was in the circus I trained animals to jump through fire. I was so scared when I thought they were gonna burn themselves, but it was really easy doing all of that stuff. I actually became a pro at training animals I even trained my two dogs to jump through the fire hoop.       Also, the year before that I was in the spring circus with my other bestfriend we had even more fun together.         So this year I will be an acrobat Im not really sure what they are so I will do even more research on them.

I don't  think that their school is hard, but it is different from others.And their family travels around the world.                                               Also, live in a trailer and they have a small dog. The games that they play with are unicycles and juggling balls.Se is in a soccer team.Her job is to feed,water,and groom the horses.

In fact,last spring,we went camping in a forest in North America. It was the best time of our lives. It was also way better than shoveling the poop off the training equipment. Although it was the only camping trip of our lives,it was still the best camping trip of our lives.                      Our day started out like any other ordinary day; wake up,eat,and go to school. After practicing our routines,we dressed for the show. After the show,instead of going to our trailers  and putting on our pajamas,the ringmaster announced that we would be going camping with the rest of the circus. I was excited of course, but my parents looked as if they had won the lottery. They were as happy as clams to take a rest from work. Naturally,there was a catch to skipping work...we had to bring food for everyone! Not even that could take away the excitment of going camping for the first time in our lives. So the next day,after the show, we packed our bags and went to the forest behind the circus tents. Since we had to bring food,my mom brought s'mores,potato salad,fried chicken,and chips &amp; dip. Man,did we eat a lot! Within the first hour of our trip,we had already finished half of the chicken. While eating,we were telling scary stories. When it came the time for me to tell my terrifying tale,my parents didn't want me to get nightmares,so they decided it was time for me to begin going to sleep. The kids had to sleep in the tents with our names written down on them. As soon as I found the tent labled,'Carlita,' I was amazed by its level of comfort. Knowing that I would have to get up early,I fell sound asleep. In the morning,when I woke up,the adults were already packing up the leftover food and tents. We all walked back to the circus and put away our things. It was the best camping trip ever!                      After that camping trip,I never stopped asking if we could go camping again. Even though the ringmaster said,'no' constantly,I just knew that we had to go camping again. There is nothing better than going camping.

I did many types of jobs. For example, I did juggling it was fun because so many peolpe are watching you and at the end they clapped for me.                                                                                                                           The most amazing job I did was walking a baby leopard. When I started working in a circus thats the first job i wanted to worke on. Ofcouse they said yes because it wasn't a hard work for a beginer. I also had to feed it, care for it, and play with the leopard.                                                                                  At the end of the shows I did, I was wiped out. Not only me also my friends and partners. We all went to the pie car,where circus performers eat and ate and rested for a few minutes. Then we will go sleep.                                                           Most of my friends trianed animals. Elephants,lions,and chimpanzes were the animals my friends trianed. My friends said it was really hard to trian animals. Good thing I didnt work for that. My job with the leopard involved that just a little.                                                                     As you can see, there is many jobs you can do in a circus. Walking a leopard was really amazing. I learned new things.   You can also meet new people.

You got to have a specific talents are skills like:a dancer,a juggler,a trapeze artist,a acrobat or a clown.       So listen from Philippa who work in the circus.   When Philippa was 5 years old she was in a musical theater and ballet and any kinds of music,signing,acting, and everything to hone her craft.        When she was 11 , She knew  she wanted to become a performer. So she went for it. She put in effort in her skills.When she was in she travel around the world including Japan, Australia,and all over North America.             When Philippa was performing she say,' I'm going to  play and have fun.it was great to see difference faces around the worlds.              When the show was over. Many people think, the life of a circus was very hard.it was more beautiful the being a accountant.             Then Philippa say, ' On Tour, you don't have anywhere to call home and you're always thinking about the show.'       'I miss my home and garden and I don't see my family.You have to work a lot of the long hours and weekend as well.' said Philippa.       That how hard to be a performer.

There is one thing I do hate of the circus you have to do the same thing every day!For example I get up in the morning go eat breakfeat,go to school,practice for the show and I have to train the puppys for the show!When I am done with the day I usually go take a shower and go to sleep.                                   I have to admit there is some fun things to do here at the circus.One thing I absolutely love is when I get to see other pepole perform.It feels nice that I dont have to do anything so I can just sit down and watch them jump around.When the day is over I can finally go home.I usually go home and tell my family about the fun day I had at the circus.I really like my family because when they know that I dont like being at the circus they make me some delicious food when I get home.       I do like being at the circcus its just that i feel that it makes me look crazy.It grosses me out when i see the performers put long knives down their throat.What i do in the circus is be an acrobat.I chose to be an acrobat because i get to swing my body in mid air.                                                                          Even though the circus is not one of me most favorite things in the world it does make me happy that i have something to do and it is being an acrobat at the fun circus.

It said 'Enter contest to see your skills for the ringling brothers circus, if you win you get to join the circus, every one is a winner because if you don't win you get free tickets to the ringling brothers circus, front row seats, and sweets.  Right then I new it was a win win and my destiny.                  That month I waited and waited till it was the day on March 31 wich was tomarrow. I was at my house figuring out what to do. It was typeropeing or doing flips on the trampoline, And right that second I thought of what was more fun TRAMOLINE! That night I stayed up thinking about it and thinking and thinking. When I woke up the next morning I got on sweat pants and a sweat shirt and then took off for the long trip to L.A.                  8 Hours full of  worries so when I got out of the car all I did was hope for the best! Later.   Right after every one finished the juges found out who to pick.  'every one, may you walk on to the stage they wrote the name on peice of paper, put it in a envolop then gave it to the annoucer. He took out the peice of paper out of the envolope and annouced the name that was on the peice of paper 'AJ Morelan'   I bust out into laghter and said 'Nice joke now tell me the real winner' And the annoucer said 'AJ Morelan' It was'nt a joke he was telling the truth I ,Aj  Morelan just got inculded to the ringling brothers circus                 The entire trip/ journy was the best ecperience in the world It was so fun It ony felt like a week. The circus crew said I was the best trampoliner They had ever seen so the aworded me 3,000 dollars along with free tickets for front row seates and sweets.

Sally May had no friends that is why she wanted to be in a circus . She read alot about circuses and she saw them on tv. Sally Mays favorite part about a circus was the tightrope walkers she thought that was really cool because you had to have alot of practice to be able to do that kind of stuff. She always wondered if you had to have your shoes on to be able to do that. Sally liked everything about the cicus and she is going to tell you a little bit about almost everything they do in the circus. the first thing she wants to tell you about is the circus clowns . They always have silly faces painted on them sometimes  they are  sad faces sometimes they are happy faces . The next thing she wants to tell you about is the circus arcobats that is one of the most dangerous ones. If you ever go to a circus and you see  this she advices you not to do this at home it is some times when you are hanging in mid air and maybe about to fall you are holding something in your mouth dangling below when some one else has that same thing in there mouth dangling above you. The next thing she wants to talk to you about is a circus juggler. A circus juggler can almost juggle everything or anthing from bounct balls to fire torches to sharp blade knives . But not all people can do that so she would advice not  to do that either. Here comes Sally's favorite part the tightrope walker. You defintely have to have alot of practice on a balancing beam. Sally said that she cant even balance on her bed so she knows that she cannot balance on tightrope. Next she has to tell you about the circus horses.  they have to have so much practice. The circus people can make them jump they can leap over things  and they can make them do any tricks. That is what Sally had to say about the horses. and everyhing about the circus........Oooops did I forget to tell you how old she is.... she is 5......BYE 	RB IN DT NN EX VBD DT RB NN WP VBD DT NN IN VBG IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD NNP DT JJ NNS VBP VBD NNP NNP .

They have to do so many things to get ready. There are many types of performers in the circus.but not just anyone can go and join. You must practice many things like being a acrobat you have to train almost all day. there are also trapeze artists to perform. life in a circus is sort of hard.       Being in a cicus takes hard work you have to train all day. If you are a acrobat then you have to train gymnastics. If you are a clown you have to practice being funny and fitting in things like a clown does. A clown might also want a makup artist to perform.

I am going to tell you about how to be a performers. Also the life of a circus kid. Witch is both cool and hard. I am alos going to let you know about the cool animals as well.       First off, let me tell you about the performers. For a performing example in source two it states that not just anyone can go and join the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. I know I could not do that because I afrade of hights. People who are part of a circus need to have a lot of specific talent. I know I could not be in a circus but I would love to go see one. What is amazing to me is that some kids start as young as five years old. I am eleven and still would not do that.       Next, I am going to tell you about the life of a circus kid. Inside source one it states that, anyone who thinks circus life is nonstop play is crazy. In Bellas case her family travels 20,000 miles in seven months each year, visiting 150 cities. Bella works from sunup to sundown. There is know way I could do the things that these kids do every day of there life.       Now, I am going to tell you about the animals. The circus uses all kinds of diffrent animals. Some are horses, elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. The chimps are my fovorite. What is your favorite? Another thing that I find cool about the animals is the horseback tricks. I have also seen the elephants play with big balls. Witch is really cool I think. some of the people even let the elephants walk over them.       To wrap it up, the life of a circus kid is not all fun and games. It is a lot of staying up late and working. Some parts might be cool but other parts are hard for most kids. Like it said in source on it is not nonestop plying. It is hard work. I would love to go see one of these families circuuses.

It would be fun to be in a circus right! because you are preforming in front of a huge audience. I'm 11 years old and i want to be in a circus i want to be an circus tightrope walker because in the picture below it looks like the man is having fun. But first if you want to be in a circus you have to have a specific talent , the right body type, and have  to be very determined. So I went for it i tried out to be in the circus and they loved me so my first day is next week i have to practice.                                                                       Day 1 on the job!           The first day went great, I practiced  on the tightrope, The first thing you have to do is stretch you have to stretch so you feel all loosen up in your body. Then you stand on the tightrope and balance yourself on it , it's kinda of hard at first but you will get use to it. The circus director (the boss) asked me if i wanted to go on tour and go all around the around the world with them and guess what i said 'YES' screaming. So I went to tell my mom  when I  got home from  work I saw my mom cooking dinner  I told her  'Mom my boss wants me to go on tour with them' and she just stood there looking at me. So that's when I told her if I could go on tour and she said ' well i don't know baby its like you leaving the city and going all around the world without your family' and I said ' I know but its a great opportunity to go and discover'. So I went to my room and started thinking about what I'm going to do then i said to myself  ' I think you shouldn't go on tour because your going to be very homesick'. So I went to my bosses office and told that 'I don't want to go on tour with Because its a big step in my life to leave my family' so he said 'its alright if you don't want to go you don't have to' and i told him i want o quit my job and he said what why and so i told him why and he said alright pack your stuff and go. And that was my first day that turned into the last day.                                                                                THE END ! 	NNP : PRP MD VB VBN TO VB IN DT NN RB .

I was on a tightrope and i was 50 ft off  the ground and I was sacred and the rope was tight and my shoe was untied and in I steeped on it and i almost fell but i gained my balance but i lost my hat.               Then I got on my unicycle and went on the rope I was scared and I almost fell. Now I am on the unicycle and juggling at the same time and I had 14 pins that i was juggling in my hands (i was scared like I was going to fall but i did not fall).           The last trick of the night was to juggling flame pins on the tightrope. I burned my self a couple of times but I was fine.                   Being a tightrope walker is fun because if you are scared of heights  you can get over of the heights and then you wont be scared of heights that whey  I like being a tightrope walker.

Clowns want to stay for the rest of the day.   performers are flexible   performers are cool and on the paper there  name are in bold.   performers like to  plays and performers want to stay.   Performers are tired because they are lairs.   Circus have animals such as elephant, lions, and seals. circus are fun but boring at the same time but like to play and have and when they tired they like to drink fruit punch.   Circus have time and they have lesson to take and they have training to do too. Circus is like  a entertainment for little kids and for adults too. Circus have performers and clowns that have funny clothes and funny faces but they got a big red nose the honks when you squiz it. Circus  are different location and circus works from sunup to sun down. Circus have cool stuff such as performers on a elephant and clowns getting a whip and hitting a lion. Clowns were different clothes and different kind of shoes. Circus have really funny shows and some are bored. Circus are so funny, so fun, and so cool. Circus juggler, Circus tightrope walker,circus acrobats and Circus clown are in the Circus.This was my story for the day. Peopple don't like circus and some people do like circus.

I step out of my trailer and I saw Bo Bo the clown running in circles screaming ''The horses are gone''. I looked over to the stables where the horses were suppose to be and there was still a fresh stack of hay. We feed the horses every night so who ever feed them last must of forgot to close the corral gate.           As I walk over to see the chores list I hear another scream but this time it was Jay Jay the clown. I walked over to see what was going on and there was one of the 5 horse laying on the ground. I took its pluse and it was still breathing so we called the circuses vet. She said the horse is ok it justs has a broken leg and is banned from preforming for 2 months.            We were about to keep on folowing the horseshoe tracks when we heared a thumping noise. It was the other four horse but they were running to the train tracks and the train was coming. We all got in to the nearest car which was a small clown car. Luckly I was wit the two smalls clowns so it was easy getting in. We flew over to the train tracks right when the train came 3 of the horses did not run but Lucky the daredevil horse did.             The shows about to start and we still haven't found lucky so, we decide we will call it a night and look for him tomorrow. We only had 2 horses that were usable so we did are best but the audience wasn't pleased. We ended the circus early and I went to put the horses away and there was lucky standing  in the corral.            I couldn't belive my eyes. The one place we did not look there he was. After I put the horses back a ran into the pie cart and told everyone luckys back.After that the whole group decided to put on the show tomorrowfor all the people that came tonight fio free.All the audience loved it and the horses too.

Sooner or later I joined the circus figuring I had nothing better to do. So what the circus looks dumb, because I found out that the circus is not dumb the moment I first performed. My name is Max Robinson, and this is the story of my life. Being in the circus was fun and all, but it was really tough too. Every day I had to wake up at 6:00 in the morning for breakfast. Then it was straight to school. My school was only 1 room, and wasn't very big, but I got used to it. It all happened when a new kid joined the circus, and at that time I was the best. His name was John hart. He was new so he wasn't the best, but in 2-3 weeks he was the best he was better than me. It all happened so fast that I didn't believe it. Everyone was cheering for him after he did his 360 somersault off the rope onto the horse. After that performance everyone was cheering for him and not for me. I couldn't take it, and then it happened. I got too jealous, and set up a revenge plot for his next performance. He broke a leg that day. Everyone found out it was me, and asked me why did I do it. Well that was a question I couldn't answer either. So I stand corrected, this isn't the story of my life. It was the story of how I ruined my life, and how I ruined John Harts life too.

Paige was always watching her Dad in the circus and wanted to try it for herself. But her Dad thought it was too dangerous and if something went wrong Paige would get really hurt. But Paige did not want to give up just because of that. So that night when Paige was in bed she thought 'what if my Dad got a day of from juggiling and the circus and watched the show'. Paige could ask the top director of the acrobats if she could tryout to be on the team. After that hard thinking Paige decided to go to sleep.           In the early morning Paige went to the acrobats trailer and knocked on the door. 'Come on in the door is unlocked',it was the main coach Barbra Loantin. So Paige walked in and Barbra asked 'Hi sweetie do you need something', Paige said 'I wanted to know if I could tryout for the acrobat team'. Barbra's face was shocked but she said 'That's fine with me if it is fine with your Dad'. Then Paige gave a guilty smile and said 'It's ok, ish'. So Barbra said 'meet me in the morning hunny be ready to give it a try'.'Ok bye Barbra. So that night she knew what she was going to wear her Mom's old acrobat suit with an American flag across it and big stripes hanging down from it. So Paige went to sleep early to get a freash new start in the morning.           That morning Paige woke up really early and went down to the traning center and Barbra was waiting there for her. So first Barbra got Paige into a harness to first see what she can do. Paige was spinning and flipping everywhere. From that moment on Babra knew where Paige got those flips and turns,from her Mom. So Barbra got Paige out of the harness and told her she could perform the next day. So when Paige was on her way home she stopped at Barbra's house one last time and asked for Barbra to give Chris her Dad a day off so she did. That night Paige thought what if my Dad was right, what if I get hurt will it all be over? Paige did not know, so she went to sleep so those thought's did not get to her.           So today was the day Paige was going to perform in front of not just a thousand people but her Dad. So the clowns just went and now it is time for the acrobats so Paige went out on stage and did flips her Dad was so impressed. But now she is going to do the triple dragon man. Only the best of the best could do that. But she tried it and succedded and the crowd went wild. Now she is not just known as Paige Thomas the juggelers daughter she is PAIGE The Great Acrobatic!!!

You can't just join the circus, you need talent to the join it. Also you need to concentrate on what you are doing because if you don't you can't join. You also need to give it all you got to join. If you don't do what is said you won't be likely to join the circus. Now let me tell you how it is like but in a story.         Hi my name is Bob I am a clown if you what to know how it is like in a circus I will tell you. It is a lot of work, there is a lot of concentrating to work here. But this story will tell you what to do. long time ago a boy wanted to join a circus well he needed skill to join well he did it but that is when he found out how hard it is.           Well that boy finaly went to join the circus and when he got there he became a tamer a day he worked. Then when it was night he went on stage. He whipped the tigger then when it was over he went to packup to go some where else as for every one else.          He then met the other people they all welcomed him they told him his chores for tommorow. Well he finished the chores and acting, some people were also finished so they played a game of cards. Well years went by and traveling around the world. Still lots of cities left to go.         Lots of people he met but he loved hs family to he will retire soon to but he will keep  working well there was a knew act he never preformed taming there lions in stead of one tiger. well he neededto concetrate so this time he did not look around sometmes but looked carfully well he did it. then night came and he did well aso his parents came to see and cheered the loudest.         Well he told his parents he is coming back they were happy but only until 6 months well days past new acts came. But he still finished the whole thing. now it was his last day so he did a really good act. So he was to whip 5 loins and one tiger. he finished his act then went home and learned there is a lot of responsiblty and concentrating.         Well that is all you have to learn but still keep doing what I said and you can join the circus. But never give up on your dream.

I told him that I was very good at gymnastics, he brought me into a huge tent with tons of different people practicing gymnastics,flips and all kinds of cool different stuff.He asked me to show him what I could do and I showed him everything I had.When I was done he said that I was amazing and that if I really wanted to I could join the circus.Then he told me it will not be all fun and games,it will be very hard.I told him that I was very happy you let me join,I will not let him down.                  He brought me to a car on the train as the train started to move,he told me this is were I will live from now on.After he let me unpack, he brought me to another car were there was a kitchen,he told me this is were    I will eat from now on.Then he showed me the rest of the train like the bathrooms,and the make up rooms.   I told him I liked everything,and that I'm going to be very happy here.He told me we were on are way to Pennsylvania,he told me that we will be riding for a couple of days.Then he told me that we will stop each day and set up some of the Trapeze stuff and take out the animals,those are the times you can practice.He left and I went back to my room and fell asleep.                  When I woke up it was morning and I decided to get some breakfast, I went to the kitchen and got bacon,scrambled eggs,and waffles.When we came to a clear field and we decided to set up and practice.Then everything went quickly by the next few days were a blur.When we finally got to Pennsylvania,we got set up, we built the tents and got all the equipment ready.That night everyone was very nervous.Then all the people came in to the tent to watch us perform.The owner got the microphone and asked me to come out.

A tipical day for a  girl that's in the circus starts out at 7:00 A.M. She gets up, gets dressed and goes to a pie car to have breakfast. At 9:00 A.M. it's time for her to go to school. 3:00 P.M. When's schools out there's a quick break before you have to go practice for the show tonight.   6:30 P.M. Dinnertime, they normaly don't eat a lot because of the show that night. 10:30 P.M. The show is over and your super tired.   12:00 A.M. Laying in bed thinking how the show went.          When your in the circus you travel to many different places. It's a fun experience in your life, but also a diffucult one to. Your always away from your family until the season is over. Plus your working with people all over the world. Like from France, Russa, Itally, and much more.          Just geting the chance to join the circus is hard. You have to practice, practice, and practice some more just to become a acrobat or trapeze. You need to have the right body type and be very determined. Like I said it takes years of practice just to get the move right. If you join the circus you to be certain that's what you want to do.          The last other thing about the circus is the jobs. If you join the circus you could be a Circus clown, Circus acrobats, Circus juggler, Circus tightrope walker, or train Circus horses.

If you have a really good talent, like juggling or acrobatics, you can join the circus and show the crowd what you're made of. Of course, fame doesn't come without hard work, so you must practice and concentrate on your act.       Once you have your act done to perfection, it is now your time to shine! You will probably have several shows each week and you can impress the whole audience with your skills. Now, after a perfomance you will probably be dead tired, but you cannot sleep in the next morning. You must prepare and prctice your next act.       Now, if you are a kid travelling with your parents, life is just as hard and fun. You must wake up at 7 AM and go to school. After school you can play with the clowns or do whatever you wish. Then it is chore time. You must make sure the animals and equipment are in top shape, so you have to inspect and feed the equipment and horses. Finally you have to perform in a show they might have that night. The day starts all over again the next morning.       In conclusion, if you like thrills, hard work, and performing, the circus is for you. You can perform, play with the clowns, and help out the perfomers. I think the circus would be great, however it requires a demanding amount of work and practice. 	NNP IN NNS CC JJ NN . NNP IN NN IN NNS IN NNS .

As the ballerenas came on stage and did the best thing I've ever seen at the circus when they were done the tight rope walker was as high as he could be he even had a special surprise for the crowd of pepole. He pulled out a tricycle and he began riding it on  the rope. He started to wiggle a little bit but then he got it back on track and did awsome.The middle of the show was even better than the ballarenas. They were dancing in the air it was cool. The elaphant was the funniest the clown was always scaring it when he smiled ''because clowns have all that makup on so it spooked the elaphant.Then the best part about he show was that every one was scared about the man jumping the shark. when he did everyone hallard in fear and closed thier eyseis.My favaret part was when they had the horses ''the man trained his horses to stand up for about 5 minutes every one claped for the man then he had a little speech. He said all his life he wanted to have a horse when he was 15 he got a job working for the circus. So his big plan was to entertain a horse then he ended up with two horses to work with.So then he was realy suprised that he could work with a horse or two. The end was cool because the the magishan cut the clown in half and let his legs out and they started walking around the box'' then the legs got back in his box then the magishan put the clown back together.It was a creepy thing to do so everyone was amazed that he could pull of a trick like that.The clown affically told every one that it was just fake and it was not real.Then the next thing that happend was the box sword trick. They had a crate and ten swords.They put all ten swords in the crate for about ten minutes and took them out. And the women got out of the box and was alright they annonced not to try a trick like that at home beause these are proffesinals that monuver thist for weeks at a time. Then all of a sudden tickets were falling out of the sky then after all the tickets were out of the box. They told every one it was elegal if u had two tickets so if your partner dident have one you need to give them one so i got one and the number was so close to my number 557324- 557329. I was as mad as could be the winner was down in second row seats he jumped up filled with joy. The ticket he won was to go to next years circus and bring two frends. It was also next year was to get a full free chiken box wihile watching enter taioners preform. The next show so that means the same person is going to pits buge pennsilvania in 6 monthes.

Her thought trailed off as she got to the end of the rope. As soon as she flipped in the air landed on her feet juggling the audience jumped to their feet clapping of amazement. ' I did it!' Sarah ran out to meet the rest of the circus crew.               She felt the warmth of her mother and father as she hugged them both with joy. When the audience left, Sarah and her little brother headed out to their small trailer and got ready for bed. At 12:00 p.m Sarah was wiped out and exhausted from all the excitement. Sarah knew that she had better go to sleep. Tomorrow they were going to Dallas, Texas for another performance.               The next morning, Sarah did her regular chores, grooming the horses, feeding the elephants, e.t.c. When she was done, she helped her father and brother load the animals for the next trip. After gathering the animals they boarded the trailor and drove to Texas. When they arrived at 6:00 a.m Everyone began getting ready for the upcoming performance.               When it was time, the audience gave a round of appluase and they started the show. In came the elephants balancing on a ball while holding each others trunks. Then, it was time for Sarah to perform.   As she began climbing the ladder, she thought and remembered the same routine she practiced, just like it was in the begginning.

And most of them look somtimes weird or plain scary. some people might not think so be to me yes! And sometimes the face paint starts to itch and it gets really annoying.       second, there is so much work you have to go through its not worth it to entertain complete strangers and you barely get paid. if you pay to much and dont get any money back you will find your self in debt or jail!just think all those tents you have to set up all the stuff you have to bring with you that would be a hassel.       next, i always see clowns swallowing ballons then like cough them back up. i would not want that to be me. what would you do if you swallowed the ballon then chocked on it. it sure would be hard to cough that up. i am not going to risk my life just to draw attention to my self.       last, i hate the type of clothing they wear it feels so wierd. i cant amagine having those type of clothes on for so long. i dont  know how they wear them but i might just wear regular clothes under the circus clothes.       i am not a fan of circusis but you can be in one if you want to. if you do i wish you luck.

You have to travel to many places like one-hundred-fifty cities. you have to have a certain body shape,you need to be an acrobat,and a trapeze artist.You can see the audience cheering for you.            It's hard to move all the time.You won't even get to stay in one place,because they are always moving.They even have even have test,and report cards.They have them because other people speak different languages.The test might be hard for them.   They don't eat as much because of their performance.They do ten shows a week.You have to be  at nine o'clock for school.The circus life is a little bit hard but it's fun.I think I might enjoy a circus life.

It was time I let go of the bar flying up up up into the sky flipping and jumping twirling and flying. i grabbed the bar again the crowd shouting cheering uncore uncore so I did it once more except this time adding more tricks then I had before.

She started doing the circus thing  when she was 5 years old. she dose circus shows and all the stuff experienced ciurcus people do.        Ciurcus showing is hard you have to wake up really early in the morning and go to sleep really late. I'v heard it is fun but takes alot of practice and comiting.If you do the circus you will not see your family alot or your house but get to perform.        Circus performing is hard but here are the good parts of it, you get to travel alot and see different places and things.Another thing is that you get to perform alot if you like to be the center of attention.The last thing is you get to meet new people and travel with them.        There is some downside things about the circus to. you have to work all day even if the shows are at the night. like I said wake up early and go to sleep late, and you dont get to go home or see your family.       the circus is a very intertaining and a fun place to be. There is alot of cool stunts and awesome things about the circus. my favorite thing about it is the stunts.        I think bella in the real story liks the circus and doesn't sometimes. Shes been practicing and that is how you get better.          Clearly the circus is hard and fun at the same time. you have to practice everyday and still go to school. You have to be admitted to the circus thing and not give up. you can travel all around the world and meet new people.

You will learn normal subjects and be taught like normal kids. You then prepare for your show that night. You might practice tightrope, maybe flipping, jumping, flying, etc. Being part of the circus takes dignity, agility, balance, coordination, concentration, and integrity. Preparing for the circus may take a lot of time. As you get ready for the show you may feel scared. You must overcome that fear and get ready.           Your part of the show that night may be different then some others. Your act may involve teamwork. Just do your best. Soon the show is over and you go back to your trailer. It has been a long day, but you have another big one tomorrow!       Your Traveling       You usually travel to many cities to preform, and that may take several months to go everywhere. Your geography lessons might just be where your heading. Many circus groups travel to different countries, sometimes even different continents! If you get homesick easily, the circus probably isn't for you!       The pros and cons   There are good things and bad things about being in a circus. The good thing, is you get to do many performances and visit all over the world. But you don't see your family very often. You are usually away for weeks, months, even years at a time.       Conclusion   Many people do the circus. They do all kinds of performances, travel the world, and do what they love. But being a performer can take years and a lot of practice. But if you can do it, you can be a great circus performer!

Seals were honking, clowns were busy pushing custard pie down their trousers, horses were training, and acrobats were flying.           'Alana, your turn,' the kid in front of me called.            I bravely started to climb up the ladder, my palms already starting to sweat.            Bradley, the kid who was in my performance, swung off, his feet curled tightly around the swing. Ha came closer, so I jumped off and stretched out my hands.                                                      *   *   *           The practice went flawlessly and as a reward, everyone was treated to a restaurant. The food was delicious, and I was confident we would do great.           Then it was finally time.           'LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! TO START OFF OUR PERFORMANCE, WE PRESENT TO YOU, THE HORSES AND THE ACROBATS!' announced the ring master.           There were neighs, and suddenly, a bright flash of light. I confidently strode to the middle of the ring, which beheld a the two ladders and the swings. Bradley mirrored my move.           When I finally got to the ladder, I gave myself a quick 'Don't screw up' lecture. Then I started to climb, and the act began.           Bradley swung off, and I reached down. He flipped me over, where I got a hold of my own swing. Then I swung myself on the bar two times, and at the flip of the last one, Bradley jumped off and I grabbed a hold of him. Next, Bradley flipped off and I followed him.          But something went wrong, horribly wrong. Either Bradley didn't flip fast enough to catch me, or I followed too soon, but I started falling, to the ground below. We were pros, and we didn't have a net. I wanted to scream, but I didn't want to humiliate the circus or anyone! So I just shut my mouth up, and pretended it it was part of the act.          'Pancake Alana in three... two...' I silently thought to myself.          Suddenly, out of nowhere, I heard a shrill whinny. There was a thump, and I landed on a horse.          Desert Storm! He had caught me and was now trotting at the edge of the ring. Every one was clapping, wolf whistling, cheering, and whooping.          Then, Desert Storm stopped in front of a man in a black suit. THE PRESIDENT!          'Oh jeez. Please let the president like it!' I prayed.          The president smiled and stood up.          'I LOVE IT!' he declared, in a deep booming voice. The cheers sharpened acutely in volume, and the noise made the ground shake.          I sighed. All right with the world. And hopefully, no one busts their ear drums.

And to join a circus you need the best skills they need if you dont and try out you will proply get hurt or even get killed. So if you want to be a clown you can do that with out being skilled. But you need to be able to do magic tricks                   The thing that I dont like is how they do insane tricks and stuff and these kids want to be in a circus to be a clown. And they do insane tricks. so after the circus lot of big top dog rich millonares ask them to host the clowns.                   At there circus so then they get paid a lot of money to be a clown at the rich persons circus and then they just go back and forth and get a lot of money. The next thing I like is how they made a big poster that sid that the circus was coming two days before.                     Then one day before they said the circus is coming the circus is coming and every body got all wound up and started going crazy and they started to say chill out every body were not going to be the clowns everybody got silent and then the kids said just kidding.                     On the last day every body went to the circus and  they made a lot of money and went and spent it on the one wheeled bycicles and then went to there other millonare friend to do the same thing and thats the end of my story.

I miss it and I think I should quit doing circus stuff because I want to get schoolwork done , and spend time with my family because I really miss them . Im going to lie down and think about it . The next morning I talk to my parents they said I should go back to the circus , and That they would still miss me but I would still see them sometimes , I spend one more day with them which was the best day I ever had in my entire life Im really gonna miss them very much ,but I say goodbye and go back to my circus I really missed them.

My dad is a clown so he is always telling me jokes and my mom is an acrobat like me. I love being in the circus but it is also a lot of hard work. My favorite part is that we get to go to so many places.I have one pet dog named buddy but i also get to work with many other animals such as horses,elephants, and tigers.                                                                                                     If you want to join the circus remember that it is a lot of hard work. Today i am going to tell you about a circus that went terribly. It all started when the elephants were dancing. A little boy in the audience had some peanuts and he threw some onto the stage. All of the elephants saw and ran toward the peanut. After that the boy kept throwing more peanuts and one of the clowns riding a unicycle ran over one and slipped. it was a disaster but everyone thought it was part of the act so we kept on going. Finally after the boy ran out of peanuts all the chaos stopped and the show went on.           later that evening when it was time for my mom and I and all the other acrobats to go on i was very nervous. It was one of my first shows because i was a lot younger. i was so nervous i almost puked but i still did the show. but when i was in the air i puked. i was so embarrassed. luckily there was no one under me and it just landed on the stage. while we were doing our act a clown came out and cleaned up the puke.             that night i was scared that i wouldn't be able to be in the circus anymore but i still got to be in the circus. all of the adults said that they were scared their first show and they didn't blame me. and that is the end of my disaster circus story.

Everything is busy, and there are a lot of customers watching. since I have a first-hand account, let me tell you.           First of all, there are the customers. They never seem pleased enough. We always have to do something new to exite them. Never the old 'Clown on a unicycle throwing pies' routine. Always asking for something else.          Next, there are the acrobats. They're friendly, but everytime they talk to me, I have to bring out my phone to get Google Translate. I know they have all their time filled up with practicing, but they could at least learn English! Especially when they're swinging around on the trapeeze and we tell them to stop because it's closing time, they just look at us strangely.          Now this last paragraph is about food. I can't really explain the pie car. Somedays the food is good and it reminds me of old homecooked meals, but that just maked me homesick. Other days... Blech! It tastes like a pile of burnt McDonalds hamburger grease! Those days, well, those days I just eat an energy bar.           That was my first hand account of circus life. I hoped you like it, and notice how fun, and not fun circus life can be. I have to go clean the horses for our next act. Bye!

Also did you know that a circus life isn't all easy, and fun and games. Well sometimes it is but not always. What you have to do to get in a circus is you have to have certain things like what your skills are, what you body type is, you should never give up, and you have to be very determined to reach your goals. I will list some up's and some down's about being in a circus!            Circus life isn't always fun. Because you have to learn the new life styles of a circus actor. For example, When you start off your day it is pretty normal and you still have to go to school. But the school is a one-room school house. When school is done you get a while to play but you still have to get ready for the show that you have to do tonight. As a circus preformer you have to do 10 shows a week and that can be really tiring even if you are really good at preforming in a circus.            When your in a circus you have to travel a long ways from place to place so you are always on the road going to a new place. Also you have to give everything up to be a circus preformer because you never stay in one place for about more than 1 week. Finally, you have to work long hard days practicing over and over again what you learned or what you are learning for the show.                 Also a circus life can be fun?. For example, if you are a circus preformer you can show your skills to the audiance and also before the manitee/show you can play with the things that you use during the show! Also you meet new people that are from all around the world! so you can learn new languages, and cultures.            Also you can travel all around the world to some places in Aisa, Like Japan and China. Some places in Eupope like the U.K. Also you can travel to a lot of places in North America that you havent been to. Another fun thing is you can learn new skills, tricks but you have to be very determined.  Also you can become really good friends with the new people that you meet that preform with you.           Now you know you have to work long, hard days practicing your skills, you can travel all around the world to some places you have probably never been to.

Many of the people who came to see the performances love the thing that the people do in circus and they enjoy it.People who perform in circus has to do alot of hard work and they have other thing to do in their house or anywhaere else so it's a busy life for the people in circus.The people who perform has to be careful with what are they performing cause sometimes the things they do in the circus are dangeorous and the people who are the head of the circus gives a warning to the people who watch the performances that don't try these kind of thiongs at home.

The circus is a big place! to be in! and the place who people buy tic is the circus. The circus is a fun place to be in and they can show some tricks to tell how to do it and you can get better if you can do it. And you can come back and see because you can show to your friend but never tell them how to do if you know the tricks and you can be happy in your self. The circus is  wonderful to go and watch it because you can be in one if they let you and you can be happy too but it okay to not be in too. I learned that the circus people has some tricks want to show you and you will happy to see it and you will come back to see it again and you will also be proud of your self. I learned that clown are scary but there not only something. if they are going to show a trick to you will be happy to see it you can go to other different circus and you can grow up to be on the circus then you can teach them how to do a trick and you can teach more people to do even more ticks.the ropes are made with string and something. you can be one if you grow up to be one .

Its not all fun and games but you get to work with some very interesting people with very interesting talents. Also there are a lot of kids at the circus that could be afraid if you are a clown but you can make them unafraid easily.   Also circus people eat at the pie carevery day for breakfast lunch and dinner.                               Being a circus performer is fun to but you have to trust people. There is a lot of trust if you are an acrobat but it is very fun. The first time that I went to a circus it was scary at first but then I learned that the people there were nice. And thats the life of a circus performer.

We travel to a bunch of different places around the world. Most people think that circus people think that it is a fun job, and you only have to dress up into costumes and dance around. Well it's not! It is a job to entertain people and make people laugh and say 'ooh' it is suppose to look dangerous. I would really like to join gymnastics but we move all the time, my parents think that I basically am in gymnastics.             Tonight we are going to perform in front of a live crowd in Religh, North Carolina. My mom is going to tight rope and do circus acrobats. My dad is going to do stuff with a tiger and an elephant, and also juggle rings. I asked my parents and  since they know that I wants to be in gymnastics I am going to perform gymnastics tricks!And 3, 2, 1 the circus began. All of a sudden my mom goes, then my dad goes 30 minutes later, and last but not least I go on flipping in to the stage.                                                                                                                                                                       Tonight was very tiring night. Now let me call my grandparents, oh ya I remember I forgot there are no phones to use. That's what happens when you are a circus family you usually can't call any family members.  Another downside is that you can't really go to your home and visit your family, what I learned you always stay on the rode. I am going to go to my bedroom and finally go and do something I want to do, so I am going to read.            Morning! Now I have to go to the eating cart and get some eggs and bacon. I eat while my parents start packing up to go to another circus show. I am done eating I go into the car I have to quickly get dressed for the next show my mom has to sit in the back and get some of my makeup on. Since I only got to sleep for 3 hours last night, I sleep on the car ride down to Miami, Florida. We are here my mom and dad quickly rush out of the car and start training the animals and setting up.           Finally, we are done now we get to go see our family. Travel to Neenah, Wisconsin. I haven't seen my family for a year now, I am so excited to see them! Well that is what happens when you are in a circus family there are ups and downs. I hope you learned a lot in my several paragraphs of how a circus family works.                                                         Sincerely.

It was challenging to remember all the steps. After a few weeks I got the hang of all the steps there were like 7+ things I had to remember. When i forgot to do something I didn't get yelled at. That was good.               Next, I want to tell you that there were down sides to be in the circus. First, I didn't see my family for a long time I couldn't even communicate with them when I was on the road. It made me fell really bad that I couldn't talk to my family. I thought that they didn't like me when I came to visit them.              Then, when your in the circus there are also up sides. The up sides are that you can travel around the world and get paid to travel and do acts. You can do your favorite thing out in the circus. you can mess up it wont really matter but people will notice.             Now, comes my favorite part. I worked with the Magical Karlotta she only does magic but awesome magic. She flies up to the top of the tent, and spawns a rabbit with her eyes. I work with lots of people but my favorite is our own fine tightrope walker Kampiter. If you see him you think he will ask for a rope and do his thing. When we were practicing at the tent he tooke dental floose and did his thing walking across that. I think thats pretty amazing. Well I hope you will try to join the circus.

Also there's tight ropers, acrobats, tiger and lion trainers, and people who ride elephants. I won't forget my birthday on September 19, 2009 when I had my first show.        It was 7:00 in the morning and I heard somebody saying wake up wake up. I instantly sprung out of bed and I screamed, 'It's my birthday, September 19.' I got dressed and went down to the pie car and had pancakes and bacon. I was taking with oldest tight roper in the circus and his name was Lyle Stuben. He was the oldest but was only 35 years old.           School was done and raced to begin to practice. I was going to feed the tigers with the tiger trainer. it was there hours till the show . the show was about to begin and my stomach started hurting. The curtains opened and I screamed.       It truly was the greatest day of my life. I feed the tigers and I did really good. At the end of the show I took a bow.

I would say I loved all of it I cant think of a favorite part . And that is my way of going to the circus.ONE other reason is I have never been to a Bellini circus but if I go I would really enjoy it a lot and maybe when they have another I will ask my mom and dad .

I am going to tell you about the resources, how many hours it takes in one circus day, and how early you would get up. I am also telling you my opinion on the circus.         The resources you would use are stuff like animas such elephants, horses, and sometimes other mean animals like jaguars. In the story they said a lady would walk jaguars. You also need to practice a lot with the animals. In the story they would practice doing somersaults off a horse and leap off a trampoline onto a horse.         A typical day for someone that works for the circus such as a kid. The kid would get up at 7:00a.m. get ready then go to school at 9:00a.m.. At 3:00p.m. school would be over then at 3:30p.m.. you would practice. At 6:30p.m. you would have dinner then preform. At 10:30p.m. the show would be over then at 12:00a.m. you would be in bed going to sleep.         You would wake up at 7:00 and go to bed around 12:00, which in my opinion I wouldn't like. I dont think I would like the circus because I don't like getting up early. I also think I would be bad at preforming in a circus because I would be scared to ride on animals and do all of the jumping and twisting in the air. Thats my opinion on the circus.

Then the crew sets up the music, tents, and the lights and music.       I go to school at 9:00 A.M. Like any school we have computers, tests, and report cards. Many of mt classmates speak a lot of different languages, like French, Italian, and Russian. So its hard to communicate with other people when I don't know how to speak that language. At 3:00 school ends. Then i get to play with their unicycles and juggling ball.      At 3:30 P.M. I do chores and practice. I water, groom, and feed the horses I use in our horseback acts. I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horses backs. And i also play with my tiny dog named Noodle; our trailer is way too small for a huge pet. Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash, and our trainers are working on elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. Me I do the specialty for the circus. I'm the one who does the walking on the rope one, and I do stunts with the animals.       For the after show we have a grand slam. We bring lions, elephants, and all kinds of animals that we train. Also we have a fire stunt seen only one in a lifetime! Plus we will even have animals doing stunts in a pool and other things. Ill be doing my finally called the swifter. I get up on stage and grab a partner from a crowd and amaze them with my magic. I will pull a a deck of cards out of my hands and levitate it to whoever I picked. Finally the last part of the show is the flaming hoop. Only I can do this I will run and try to jump the a hoop flaming with fire.

First off all not every body can be in the circus because you needthe right kind of body and skills for about half the jobs thier. But if you do get in then thiers a good and a bad side about being in the circus. Keep reading to find out what I'm talking about.       The good news about the circus is that you can be alot of stuff in the circus. You don't need to have a great body to be in the circus. If you want to be a animal trainer orclown or something else you can join the circus  if you just have the skills. But the best part is you get to travel around the world all the time. You can go to places like Moscow, New York, Canada you name it. The circus is really great and exciting but there is a downside.        But the circus and traveling around the world means your far away from home. Plus you don't get to see your family very often which stinks. And your always wondering about the show and nothing else. But worst of all it's preparing for the show and that must take like forever. So the circus isin't all fun and games like you think it is right. But mostly it is pretty cool to me and mostly fun and games like you thought it was.       So, that's a sum up of what the circus is like and that's that. But heres the quistin, do you want to run of to the circus or stay home. Acctully I don't even think it works that way and you have to be excepted  or something and they'll  put you in the circus if you just show up. If you do want to be in circus then I'll envy you and be in the crowd, literally I love circuses.

What I wonder is how do they walk on them skinny ropes up in the air and jugle for a long time don't you ever wonder that?       I have went to the circus before and I was like wow! how do they know how to do all these awsome tricks? Have you ever went and was it exciting to you?       When it was time to go I was sad because did'nt want to leave I wanted to see more tricks.I can always come back again. It was realy fun that I wan't to go to the circus right now it's just that they are not opened.       Next time the circus is opened I am going to beg my momma to take me. I will beg my momma the day before it's opened untill she will say yes. Yep that's how bad I would beg my momma.       People's life in the circus is realy hard. They stretch alot untill they are flexible anough to do the tricks. It herts them to practice the tricks. They have to do it untill they get the whole thing right. Then they are ready for the circus. 	DT NN VBZ DT RB VBN NNP NNP NN TO VB DT DT NN NNS VBP RB VB NNP NNP NNP NN VBZ WRB VBP PRP VBP IN PRP JJ NNS IN IN DT NN CC JJ IN DT JJ NN VBP RB PRP RB JJR IN .

He had been making every body happy once he even started a circus player because it was his dream to be one. Then he got very happy because everyone got his autograph and to be in pictures with him. So the next day later John went to the circus to do the big show,then once he came there was no one there,only the circus people.            Then he saw another tent beside the circus tent they work at. Then John went inside to talk about that the owner is ruining John's career to his job.So after that tough day he put a sign that says free food and drinks. Then he thought a new idea. It was a person who walks on a tight rope then if he falls he will land on the biggest pillow ever.Then some people came after couple of hours. But they left quickly like couple of min ago.             So the person that owns the tent beside him, he made a decision of him fighting over population of attention for people to come in their tent to get more famous. He made the police stop him from fighting over population from tent to tent. So he made it equal population by adding more things to it.           Also what the police did is to hire a new worker instead of John. So John was in jail for doing all the stuff he did to Issac the owner next to the tent what he used to work at. The next day Issac came then he felt sorry for John,so Issac let him go from jail. Then they became buddies and they worked together at Issac's place to work at.

The circus is a fun place to go with your family or to just get away for a little.  When you go to the circus you will see many clowns, acrobats, and so many other performers that will blow your mind away.  If you go to the circus you would not want to come back out.  Going to the circus is like stepping in a magical world.  My favorite circus act is when people do the trick with the swords and the tricks with the man who eats the snake. The circus for me is like stepping into a another demention.           The circus has candy bars witch is my second favorite part of the circus.  A circus is in this big tent that carries a lot of performers.  Some of the performers are really flexible.  Some of the people who perform in the circus wake up at 7 am to get dressed  to go to the circus.              If you go to the circus maybe you feel that you can do anything . When I go to the circus and I see the flexible acrobats in the air I feel like I can fly.  I have always wanted to be in the circus. If I was in the circus I would be the happiest girl on earth . If you love the circus we could be best              That is why I really love the circus  .

He had to walk on a rope 200 feet high above a pit of sharp spikes.       He was very nervous while he was tightrope walking he could here the sounds of the people cheering while he was so scared inside he would fall to his doom and he would have let his fans down.       The day of the circus fell he was tightrope walking across. His fans were cheering Go John, Go John! He then changed his attitude to a cheery happy attitude.       Just a few more steps and he would be across. And he made it! he heard his cheery fans and when he walked down his fellow circus mates were congratulating him. He looked down and saw his family members at the front row.       He then went up to them and they hugged him and congradulated him. He had did what he always wanted to do     	PRP VBD VBN JJ DT NN VBD NNP NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN NNP NN VBD DT NN NNP NNP VBD TO VB IN DT NN CD NNS JJ IN DT NN IN JJ NNP NNP VBD RB JJ IN PRP VBD NN VBG PRP MD RB DT NNS IN DT NNS VBG IN PRP VBD RB VBN NN PRP MD VB TO PRP$ NN CC PRP MD VB VB PRP$ NNS NNP NNP NN IN DT NN VBD PRP VBD NN VBG NNP NNP NNS VBD VBG NNP NNP , NNP NNP .

The performers have do practace hard so they can acomplish their trikes. To whant to peform at a circus you must be able to do comething. For example the clowns are funny, theirs strong men, circus acrobats,  circus jugglers, horses that can do some trike, and a lot more.         If youget a chance to go see the circus then the chance are that you will find a clown. Some eople think that clowns are scary and freeky. Other people think tht clowns are funny. What i thinf is that clowns can be both things. If they put on to many make up then theymight looke freeky, but if they put on the rifgt amount then they might be funny to other people.         Now the prson that runs the place then they have to worry, becuse if some thing happene during the performance then th can be a problem. For example while the acrobats are doing their poformance and one of them fall what will happen. Enan if they had a net, what would happen if thy didnt. That prson could of got serasly hurt or some thing like that. Though are the worries the manager has to worry about.           The animal that the ciruse have might be wild animals, but they are reay tamed.A circuse will never brink a animal to the circuse that is not tamed. Like for example the tiger the people their will say to go in the hoop or evan some times tey will give then meet.

The reason why you need to practice is because when the show is about to begin and the curtians open and you stand there doing nothing, you should either run as fast as you can to get off the stage. You can also practice your part until your part comes so that you can start performing your part. The second thing that you should have is flexability, strongness, and no fatness because with the fatness people are going to think that you are not strong. The last thing that you should have is a very good memorization so that you won't forget your part and you standing there on the stage having nothing to say nor nothing to do on stage or what ever your standing on.         Having force is a really ceriouse thing because if you don't have force or srength and you carry a person and you drop the person you are going to be the responible person for the person's accident and you are going to have to pay for it too.The other reason why strength is important is because if you try to do something that has a lot of consintration and a lot of force and you mess up you are going to ruin it. The siquences of these things are very important thing that aren't toys for fun these are very ceriouse things that you need to know. The other reason why strength is needful is because it helps people do amazing these and carry some heavy things. The last reason why strength is needful is because it helps people carry things some other people haven't tried to carry.        The two pictures that I think describe about what a circus performer would do are the ones that have a man carrying a woman by the rope which is called a Circus acrobat and the one that has the man walking on a rope which is called a Circus tightrope walker.

At a certain time you have to groom, and feed the horses for the horseback acts at 6:30 P.M. you go eat after you do that you have to go start the show at the show it takes a perfessional to do all of the acts.       The circus can be a place were you can get really injured because you have to do acts with lions, elephants, and chimpanzees you also have to jump through fire sometimes when the show is over at 10:30 P.M. you have to get packed to go to another country and get ready for tommorrows act.

There is a lot of hard work en-valved. You haft to practice everyday. You haft to be committed to be in the circus.               The upside to the work is that you get to have fun. The practice pays of in the end. Preforming is really fun. All the excitement is really awesome. To see all of the peoples faces is priceless.               The down side is the traveling. You spend a lot of time on the road. Your not at home all the time. this means you have no time for hanging out  with your friends back home. also you haft to practice everyday.

I think being a circus clown is fun because you get to do fun things,fun tricks,and you can help out with animals.If you want to be a circus clown it takes a lot of practice.If you are one it should be easy for you and fun.I love being a circus clown.            We can help out on taking care of the animals and some times we have to go all around the world to do a little show.It's difficult to learn how step up and do our route.We have to practice and practice it's hard.

Here are some paragraphs why I think this.           One reason why I think this is people who live in circus don't have time to get a social life and never get to do what they always wanted.People who live in circuses never saw there home or got to stay in one place for the rest of there life.Circus performers never get to see the life of which they came from.They never get to play or do stuff.They are always tired after they performed and they don't get to sleep for very long.           My second reason why is that they almost don't get to do what they what to do.Here are some details why I think this.I think this because they have to work none stop and then go to sleep and do it all over again the next day. I think this because no one gets to stay anywhere for very long.They never get to go to the place they always wanted to go.They never get to have any alone time and always have to be practicing for the big show they have to do every single night.there is my reason why I think this.           There were my last reasons why I thought that . No one wants to be in the circus being happy and then sad .That's why I think this opinion why I think that the are not on the upside or the down side.People never want to do tricks for money but some people do,do this.No one does have to count one people watching them do stuff and some people don't like clowns or type rope walker because they are scared .

You don't just travel to places and perform if it's a family business. You have to do chores and take care of the animals.The performers can't eat a lot before the show because if they do they might not be able to do the show.The performers can do about 10 performances a week.During the show the performers can get really tired.After the show they are exhausted from the performance.When they finish a show it's about 12 A.M in the morning.       The circus life can be fun but its a hard life.You can always go to a circus if it's in town and ask them is the circus life hard or not.You can always be a circus performer when you grow up and be a kid right now.

She tried to ignore all of that so that she can achieve her concentration. Still, she had to get herself to concentrate. She knew that it was very complicated, but she tried her best anyways. She also knew that her family is supporting her even though they weren't there. Emily thought about the time when her family were encouraging and comforting her about her being afraid. One at a time, she rode her unicycle onto a shaky wire. Trying her best, she avoided looking down the ground where the dirty sand was. The dirty sand sort of looked like they were waiting for her to fall down. She tried to do it as cautious as she can, trying not to make a mistake. Slowly and carefully, she rode her unicycle on top of the wire. 'Almost there,' Emily whispered to herself. Finally, she made it to the end of the wire. When she made it, the people clapped their hands happily.                         After all of those concentration, she drank cool refreshing water to calm her fast - breathing down. Her circus mates congratulated her for doing such a complicated work in the circus. She thanked them all, but she still missed her family. Next, her circus teammates and she went to another country ( which is in U.S.A.) Her family were also there so it was very easy for them to enter the circus of where she was performing. When they were in the different circus, she saw her family waving to her and shouting her name. It was Emily's turn to juggle tiny golf balls while riding on a giant ball this time.' There is no possibility that I'm going to be harmed here because the giant ball isn't that high,' she thought to herself. So again, she did her part and finished her goal of balancing. After that, she said goodbye to her family again hugged each other.                         Finally, when they returned to their normal circus, Emily had to do acrobats. She was trained how to be flexible and how to balance more. When she was in front of the stage, many people were cheering her name and clapped their hands. So, she hanged her hands on 2 rings that were tied to a rope( while the rope was hanged on the ceiling).She spun around for about 12 seconds and stopped. While she was up there, she did the splits in the air and also made complicated tricks onto the ropes. Again, the people cheered and clapped their hands. Now that Emily was having fun in the circus, she realized that when she does fun things in the circus, she stops worrying about her family. ' Being in a circus is very fun after all...' she whispered at her mind.

One day I woke up and my mom got a call she said that were going to the circus in New York, I was so happy. I'm bringing my little brother Boe, my big brother Henry,my big sister Erin and my parents. We left 4 days before the show date came. Since I live in Indiana it took us 2 days to get to New York,but it was worth it.We also got to go to the big Toys R Us in Time Square. When the date finally arrived, I was super excited to go,once the show started, the lights started to dim and all of a sudden an elephant popped out of know where. Acrobats,Jugglers,circus tightrope walkers were there. They were all there!!At the end of the show fireworks popped out and bursted unexpectidly.Me and my brother Boe were laughing saying this is awesome. I have to say this was the best day of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At 7:00 a.m. I wake up,get dressed,and eat breakfast  in the pie car. The grown ups put up the tents,light,and music for the show.

To you it may just seem like a bunch of dumb clowns running aroud but it's much more. I joined the circus when I was 12 after running away from home. I don't really remember why ran away but it must have been a pretty good reason because I don't get mad that often. The circus is buisy, very buisy. My job in the circus in being an acrobatic. Here is my story of how I got to the cirus.              I was wandering alone looking for some place to call home after running away. The sun was going down and all I could see what seemed to be a never ending road that looked like it would go on for ever, and ever,and ever. I had been going for three days and already wishing that I wou have packed more water and food. All of the sudden I hear a bunch of noise and turn around to see head lights of a car! I sick my thumb out and they stop when they do I see red writting on the side of the truck. It said circus.              'Hey you, what do you need'said the man driving. What to say, I probably shouldn't have said this but I was hungrey and needed shelter.          'I ran away from home and I'm lost.'          'Same here kid,wana join the circus? Little pay but you'll get free food and shelter.'He held out his hand and I shook it. I hoped inthe back and we drove to our destenation.               We started setting up and then went to sleep. The next day they taught me everything I now know about the circus, and here I am with the best job in the world, working in the circus.

Although it is not all fun and games.  The trainers are exicted to have everyone see what the animals can do now. Right now I'm working on summersaulting off of a horse.          Now it's showtime. I'm nervous, I didn't do good with that horse. Someone trained the horse that isn't wild to do the thing the wild horse was supposed to do. Now I am afraid that they won't understand that I need the calm horse. I'm on in two acts.          ' Good, they understood.' Now I'm on, and I feel so much better. I think I forgot to train this horse. But I don't want to get hurt. I never had that much appluse. I think that was way to  easy for me. I might try an elephant next time.     Now I'm training for the next show         	NNP IN DT NNP NNP VBZ VBN IN DT NN VBZ IN NN , RB NNP NNP PRP VBZ RB DT NN CC NNP NNP NNS VBP VBN TO VB NN VB WP DT NNS MD VB NNP NNP RB PRP VBP VBG IN VBG IN IN DT NNP NNP PRP VBZ NNP NNP NNP JJ , PRP VBD RB VB JJ IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN VBZ RB JJ TO VB DT NN DT NN NN VBD VBN TO NNP NNP NNP VBP JJ IN PRP MD RB VB IN PRP VBP DT NN NNP PRP VBP IN IN CD NNP POS NNP , PRP NNP POS NNP NNP NNP IN , CC PRP VBP RB RB NNP PRP VBP PRP VBD TO VB DT NNP CC PRP VBP RB VB TO VB NNP PRP RB VBD IN RB NNP PRP VBP IN VBD NN TO JJ IN NNP NNP MD VB DT JJ JJ NNP NNP NNP NNP NN IN DT JJ NN	2		20131022161159	935	2		20131023133152	562	2

And it is hard to change places all the time like say you have to go to Mulingire, Ireland for a day and then go to England  for 1 more day then go to a different place but you want to stay in 1 place in sted of going other places all the time.Well tightrope walkers are really happy about their jobs they get to stand on the ropes all day and get to perform live every night bet it gives them a rush because there are a lot of people and if i have a singing job. i would have a rush to also because to see how many people care about me and love my music but enough about me now about the tightrope walkers all i know about them is that they have to walk on ropes.Okay now about the jugglers well they juggle all kinds of stuff they can juggle rings, shoes, hats, and books!  Okay now on to the horses. Well as you all know were talking about horses to be clear it is called circus horses  because people need them in the circus so if they need to do a back flip on a horse they have one to do a back flip on.

Kayla asked her mother who was driving towards the large stadium where the circus would be taken place. 'Kayla if you ask that one more time I will turn this car around.' Her mother said sternly looking at her through the drivers window. 'I'm sorry ma I'm just so excited!' Kayla exclaimed excitedly a grin across her face. Her mother laughs slightly. 'I understand that Kayla.' she says pulling into the parking lot of the stadium. Kayla quickly got out the car and ran to her mothers side opening the door for her then pulling her out of the black vehicle. Kayla practically skips to the opening at the side then walks in quickly. She was chosen to see what happened back stage at a circus! She looked around and saw people ran around franticlly in a hurd ready to start the circus. Everyone was feeled with nerves and excitement. Tonight would be there first circus in the town for the first time! All the circus preformers were running into each other until they heard someone yell. 'Watch Out!' then a loud boom then a high pitched cry coming from across the room everyone ran to the cry. 'Are you okay?' A tall man in a top hat asked kneeling down next to her just as soon as Kayla got there. The girl whimpered quietly. Kayla looked at ther girls swollen, bruised leg she winced in pain. 'I was just walking and then one of the unicycles fell on my leg.' She cries out. 'Well you can't do the show now Natalie.' A young women with oversized glasses said to the girl sitting on the floor. 'I can do it.' The young girl hissed trying to stand up and then almost falling and almost hit the ground then the women with the oversized glasses held her up. 'You can not Natalie! You can't face anymore injuries!' The girl who Kayla now figured out was Natalie sat with her hands to her face sobbing quite loudly. 'What act did she preform?' Kayla said building up the courage to even speak. 'She worked on the trapeze.' The man with the top hat said finally acknowledging her existence. 'Oh...' Kayla responded quietly. And then the women looked at Kayla. 'Do you want to be our trapeze artist for the night?' she asked. Kayla looked at the lady stunned then at her mother who's face was equally as stunned.Then Kayla's eyes widened in excitement once again. 'I would love to!' She exclaimed.       Kayla knew all about trapeze artist it was her favorite part of the show. She's always imagined twirling through the air being free and able to fly. It was absoulutly lovely to watch.Trapeze artists would start off swinging on a bar and then would twist through the air and there partner would catch them and they'd continue to do that.       About Thity minutes later Kayla stood on a stool with a handle above her ready to be grabbed and Kayla's hands clasped at her side were ready to grab it. She jumped up and grasped the bars tightly and swinged her legs back and forth and then let go twisting and twirling through the air. She was afraid of heights and didn't want to look but she wanted to keep on looking at the ground as she twirled elevation above it and then she did a front turn as the other trapeze artist grabbed her hands and continued swinging. Kayla smiled widely.       She would always remember this moment.     	NN VBP PRP RB RB .

Because the circus performers are from all over the    world, many of  my classmates speak other languages: French, Russian, and Italian, like my family. As we travel around the country,our geography lessons come alive.                 3:00 P.M. School's over--time for a quick.the clowns let me play with their unicycles and  juggling balls. I also play with my tiny dog, noodle; our trailer   is too small for a large pet.

In order to get into the circus you must have skill, flexability, and the ability to never give up. My job is to do acrobatics like flips and tightrope walking and stuff like that. When doing acrobatics you have to be precise and accurate when flipping, turning, and balancing. If you make one mistake you will have to face danger, say you slip up on a flip, you might end up across the room laying on the floor because you put your hand in the wrong spot or you flipped sideways rather than straight. Being in the circus is very, very dangerous and you have to take risks. I remember one time when i was beginning acrobatics aroung the age or 7, I slipped up on a flip and landed on my head, I was lucky I was still okay. Thats what i meant by never giving up, I almost got killed doin what I loved but i just got back up and kept trying harder and harder everyday. It takes practice every bit of free time you have, you should be practicing.

Circus performers practice,perform,and move every single day.Every morning they wake up and go to the pie cart for breakfest.Then they start unloading the tents for the night's performance.The performers work on their act,they work long and hard until its time for the show.Before the people come,the performers go to the pie cart and have a small dinner and then its time for the show!Each performer does their act until the show is over.The performers get the rest of their dinner at the pie cart and then go to bed.           The performers keep practicing and performing for the rest of the week until its time to put down the tents and pack up and move to a different city.Circus performers are always practicing,performing,and moving.Thats the life of a circus performer.

There are elephants, trapeze artists, clowns, jugglers, and a ring master.       If you ever want to be in the circus here is some bad news.  In the circus bisness you have to be on the road all the time.  You will probably want to get your family members to come with you.         When you join the circus, you will have lots of fun!  You will get to be on the road everyday.  Do you know what else is enjoyable?  That's right! When the audience has all eyes on you.          In conclusion, go to the circus if you like to be on the road for a year, or, stay home with family and friends.  Anyway,  chose any it's your design.

I would like to be in a circus because I like to make people laugh. Being in a circus would be really fun. All in all, now you know why it would be fun to be in a circus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Next, I would be an acrobat because I think it would be fun to fly in the air and show off a little bit. being a clown would be a little wierd for me because I don't like clowns. If I went to a circus I think it would be cool. I think I would watch the acrobats mostly. All in all, thats why I wan to be an acrobat.                                                                                                                                                                          Then, there is a clown. Clowns are funny. I like clowns but not the scary ones. All in all, now you know about my opinion about clowns.                                                                                                                Lastly, I think I like soccer better than circus.The Circus I don't think is in anymore. The circus is a coolthing to watch. There being funny and thats what makes it entertaining.

In the following paragraphs I will tell you about circus life.        Heres some of the many upsides: you travel the world for free, you get to do fun stuff (doing the trapeeze, walking on the type rope, and much more), and you get paid for doing it! Now there is some downsides: you HAVE to travel the world, usualy you dont have a lot of freinds outside the circus if any, you work all day, and eat what you get or don't eat at all. But dont let that stuff get you down.        This paragraph is a usual scedule for our circus. 6:00 am: get up, get dressed, eat, get ready to go to shcool, and go to shcool. 1:00 pm: shcool is over and I go train animals. 1:30 pm: first show of the day starts. 2:30 pm: first show ends and I practice trick arrow shots. 3:00 pm: go to pie car and eat lunch. 3:45 pm: time for a break. 4:00 pm: trapeeze practice. 4:30 pm: clean animals and animal pens. 5:00 pm: second show starts. 6:00 pm: second show ends, eat, and practice anything I already haven't. 10:00 pm: get ready for bed, go to bed.

The crew and there leader looked at each other.Then they huddled in a circle and talked.'What will we do with the child?What act can she do?'asked a trapeze women.          'I think I know what to do with her,she can tame the lions!She'll be great!'said the leader,and the group broke up.They all gathered around the girl and sat her down on a stool.'Child, you can join the circus, but only if your brave enough to tame the lions!'           The girl thought about it.Why not? I'm brave! I can do it! She considered the offer and nodded.She was going to join a circus!           'Well then, let's get you started by letting you meet the lions.' said the leader.                        The lions were so cute!I don't think I saw anything cuter. I just joined the circus a few minutes ago, and so far it's not as bad as I thought it was.Right now the crew is showing me the lions so I can know who they are.           'Here we have Lisa, she's very shy and she'll grow attached to her trainer quickly.This one here is Roger.He can be very stubborn so watch your back.The last one is Rose. we call her that because she is very sweet and lovable.I think Rose will go perfect with you child.'           'My name is Mallorie by the way.' I should have told them my name when I first got here.It sounds so weird calling me child.It sounds like  I'm there kid or something.           'Mallorie come here and see which lion will chose you.Here's what you do:First put your hand out to each lion,then the lion will sniff it, and if the lion didn't want you it backs away.Now if the lion does chose you it presses it's face against your side.Now chose your lion.'            I walked up to Lisa and put my hand out as I was told.The lion came up and sniffed my hand thoughtfully.It tipped its head to one side then backed away.           Roger was a different story.The crew had to hold him down for me.I was cautious as I put my hand out, but nothing fatal happened. Roger sniffed my hand quietly then growled.Wow, he really needs some training he's a beast!           Rose was nice and quiet.She rose to her paws and sniffed my hand.She walked up closer and pressed her face to my side as the leader said one of them would.I stroked her fur and backed away.The leader was right!She was perfect for me!

She loved hanging out with her friend  Chunky he was really nice and hug-gable loved the circus  . One night before the show Silly was feeling awful she was pale as the moon. and she was shaking.Chunky spotted Silly and asked silly are you OK? Silly responded no I'm not feeling very well. Well then I guess your going to stay in bed.But I want to perform she responded. no you are going to bed right now.Fine answered Silly.           Silly was in bed it was 11:00 it was way past her bed time. silly waited for chunky till she fell asleep. the next day silly felt all better and was ready to perform but there were no shows that night so silly and chunky stayed home and had  a movie night.they stayed up all night and watched every movie in the house.till they feel asleep. the next day there was a show in the morning. get up every body there's a show lets get moving every body got ready for the show 9:30 time for the show! yelled Chunky.The first person to go out was Silly she went and started to juggle and walk at the same time but... she fell chunky went running to her Silly are you fine?no i'm not fine i hurt my leg!yelled silly.  hours later Silly couldn't walk. She was so mad that she blamed it on Chunky. Its all your fault now I cant walk i cant perform I cant do nothing! She made Chunky feel worthless and sad. Every body felt pity for silly but mad at her to she hurt Chunky feelings and that's not what best friends do. Later that afternoon silly regretted saying all that so she went to apologize to Chunky. Im so sorry Chunky I never met to do that I was just injured and mad. its OK Silly at lest were still friends. Chunky and Silly were best friends all over again.

She ate her breakfast and then went to the school. She then came back and started practicing for her big finale which was she was going to juggle rings that were on fire.When she had it down she started putting on her makeup.Next she Picked out her most beautiful performing outfit and then put it on.Then she practiced until the show was on.            At the show she came up more times like when she jumped of the trampoline onto a running horse.At the end she did her finale move and she did it perfectly.Every one was on their feet clapping. They wanted her to do another trick.            That night her mother and father congradulated her and when she went to bed she thought, even when I get older I will preform in the circus.

I thought they were playing a prank on me like they always do, so I went inside their cabin and said 'guys this isn't funny it's gotten really old', and when they saw me they said we didn't pull a prank today. I stared at them like they were maniacs and said 'then why is there an eyeball on the ground outside?' They didn't know, so when I went back outside and picked up the eyeball, right as something caught my eye I looked up and they were gone.            As I walked to the pie car I  was thinking so hard that I guess I wasn't looking at where I was going and I ran into Mack, the groomer, and I saw him holding his eye and asked him what had happened to it, but he just ran off. That was very unusual for Mack to do, he was usually very talkative and spunky. That's when it hit me mabye Mack somehow lost his eye. Instead of goig to the pie car I ran to our own cabin, grabbed my journal, and locked myself in the room.  I noted everything that had happened today about finding the eye, seeing mack holding his eye, and the clowns, usually very honest, saying it wasn't a prank.                        When It was time for the show, my dad was frantically looking in his pockets, and saying where did I put it?

You might think that being in a circus would be fun,and exciting but you are wrong unless you like a schedule like this:           First you have to get up around 6 o'clock in the morning almost every day then you go to the pie cart and meet your fellow performers and have breakfast then you go to the school house from 9 - 3 o'clock Next you go to train for a half an hour sometimes we take a break or play around then do your chores and train some more 6;30 is dinner!!!!!!!!! 10;30 show is over time to clean up 12 time for bed!    then do that over and over again until the winter it is especially hard in the summer.

You must be up early to eat your breakfast, to practice, and to do any chores you might have like feeding the circus animals or helping to put up the circus tent. You do many performances and travel around the world to do them. depending on when the show ends, you either do or don't get enough sleep.So, circus life can be tough.

When I was younger i used to use my stripped blankets as a circus and I would try and do all the things they do in circuses!          The main one I was the best at was juggling, ever since then i would juggle and keep juggling. I would juggle while dancing and singing, i would even juggle while i would read and at school!           The most thing i didn't like about the circus is tightrope because i couldn't do it, i would always get mad at MYSELF for nothing, i wanted to get better at it but i couldn't.               Until i turned twelve i  stopped juggling all of a sudden,and i miss it and i haven't been to a circus ever since then, and i wanna see up close now.             I would love it if you could pick me to sit in the front row, and have this one dream come true. Oh, i haven't told you that i have worked at a circus for two years, but anyways thank you for reading this!

Then I go over to my dresser inside our camper and take out some clothes for the day. After I get done getting dressed I meet up with rest of the performers at the pie car for breakfeast. As we eat breakfeast we watch the crews set up the tents, lights and, music for tonights performance.                At 9:00 A.M. we take our breakfeast and dump it into the trash and head to the one room schoolhouse that travels along with us on the road. Like any school we have computers, tests and, report cards. Many of my classmates speak different languages such as French, Russian or, Italian like my family. When we travel through the country its like our geography lessons come alive. Today we have a writting assignment we have to write a 5 page story on the american revolution. As the bell for school rings I finish my story turn it in and head down to the break area.                3:00P.M. We are at the break area. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I can almost ride the unicycle without falling off but it is too hard. Allthough the unicycle is too hard i can juggle pretty well. I thank the clowns for them lending me their things and go play with my dog Noodle. He is so small Our trailer is too small for a big dog.                3:30 is chores and practice. I go do my first chore wich is to feed, groom and, water the horses. We use these horses in our horseback acts. I finish up my chores and head down to the practice field. As my father practices somersalting off a running horse I practice jumping from a trampoline on to a horses back. To do this stunt takes balance and a lot of concentration. I see other kids practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leapords on a leash. Trainers are also working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.                6:30 is Dinnertime. My family and I go to the pie car to eat, wile we are there we dont eat much because we have our big performance. We do 10 shows each week: one show for each weekday plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on saturday, and two on Sunday.           At 8:00 we are getting ready for the show that starts at 8:30.           8:30 it is time for the show my father and I are the opening act. My dad takes the lead on his horse. I follow ten paces behind running. He sommersalts off the horse and the horse keeps running. I sprint for the trampoline and jumpoff of it doing a flip in midair landing on the horse. I let one hand off the saddle and wave to the crowd as they cheer for us.           10:30 The show is over and i am so tired. As my family walks back to our trailer we passd the circus office, conssession stands, stables, and trailers. Two days from now we will be set up in another town.

I'm not the only kid here, either.   There are lots of kids walking to a ride or going into a building. But I'll bet you hardly any of the kids here are in a show. But I am. I'm in the circus.       Now before you ask, no, I did not run away from home and join the circus. It has been in my family for a long time.        I do an act in the show. What I do is several things. I work with the horses. I can make then jump through a hoop. I can also make them jump over obstacles, too.       I also do a bit of acrobatics. I have been working on doing a flip in the air while on the bars.        I love it when the advanced acrobatics do this trick. What they do is first, they need a partner.  Then, they both go out and link arms. One person falls onto the floor then jumps on a trampoline onto a horse. It is AMAZING!!!!!!        There are lots of other acts in the show. There are ones with lions and tigers and bears. Also there are ones with monkeys. My sister actually walks Suzie (her favorite monkey) on a leash to the trainer during the show. (Since she is small, we only have her do little thinks.)       The show is starting!!! Shhhhhh!!!!!        'Ladies and Gentlemen, children of all ages, welcome to the Krazey Circus!!!' Then the lights go out and the first act starts.        It's an act I'm in. Suddenly, a hoop is set on fire!!!!! Then the lights come on and you can see a chestnut brown horse jump through the flaming hoop. You can see a golden hoop and a white and black-speckled horse jump through that hoop with a rider with a pink suit on. Then we do the course. We both jump over lots of obstacles. Then our act is over, and another one starts.       In this one, bears with bow ties dance. Then it is over.       In this one, monkeys and lions look like they are having a conversation.       So the show goes on.       That day through all of the acts I'm not really sure how the rest of our day went. But before I knew it, we were on our way to a county fair, ready to start another day of circus fun.

Why do you always complain about your job?asked the ringmaster.     'Oh, sir, I didn't see you here!Ur?What did you say again?I am so sorry that I did not hear you.'replied Niki.     'Niki, I do know that this is hard work, but you have got to understand that your parents are counting on you. I think you should take a break and think about what I just said to you.'     Niki nodded and went to her tent. She sat down on her bed and began thinking about her parents.     'Gosh, I think the ringmaster is right, Ishould know how hard it is for my parents to see me go I should work hard and think for my parents'said Niki to herself.     The next day, Niki was grooming her horse, she needed water so she went to her tent to grab her water bottle,when she came back the ring master was standing there admiring her horse.     'Sir, are you alright?I do not hope my horse has a problem!     'Oh Niki, I didn't know that this was your horse, I think you have groomed it well!'answered the ringmaster.     'Why, thank you! I thought about the words you said to me yesterday, I think you are absolutely right. I agree to what you said to me.'     'Very well, I am sure that your parents are going to be very proud of you!'said the ringmaster.     Niki blushed at the compliment. The ringmaster walked away and Niki went back to grooming her horse. The day went by quickly. The next day was Wednesdy the show is coming.     'Oh, I know that I have done this many times, but I have a friend that lives here, and she is going to see me working in a circus and laugh at me!' said Niki freaking out.     'It is all right Niki. This means that you are a string girl! A circus is hard work and you are a sucess!'said the ringmaster.     'I owe you too much. You have helped me come this far. THANK YOU!'said Niki.     'Now go on out and show every one how speacial you are!' said the ringmaster.     Niki stepped out onto the ring and performed beautifully. Everyone clapped at her amazing performance.     Niki smiled and bowed to everyone.    'This is the happiest day of my life!' 	NNP NNP NNP VBZ DT VBP TO VB TO PRP . '' VBD NNP NNP VBZ DT NN IN PRP . WRB VBP PRP RB VBP IN PRP$ NN .

I walked out on stage and I climed up on the high stand i jumped off but dident hit the ground because someone caught me while swinging high in the air on a rope I fliped off and landed on my own rope. I started swinging and swinging until I caught a bar and flipped into the net. after I bowed to the crowd I  walked off the stage.I walked right into the circus owner Mr.Dickenson I said I was sorry and started to walk off when he called me back I got scared. I had heard rumors that he was the meanest person in the circus. He asked me if I wanted tocome over to his trailer and have some cookies I said sure but really dident want to go.I walked with him to his trailer and stood in the doorway he gestured me to sit down and have some cookies that were already laid out. I sat down and thought 'maybe he isent so bad after all' and it turns out I was right he was really nice. he talked about how he bought the circus because he used to love the circus when he was a kid. And I told him How I ran away from home to join the circus. When we had finished I walked to my trailer and went to bed.

If you   didn't know, I am a tight rope walker and the manager of the Circular Circus. You must be thinking that life in a circus is very hard because of all the practice and acts that are done. Well that kind of is true, but working in the circus is also very fun. Here are a reason few reasons why.   First, we get to meet a lot of new people. There is a diversity of   people: French, Russian, and Italian. They can be beneficial. Suppose there is a French kid, and he is learning about Venice, Italy. He may not understand something about Venice. He can learn about the place from an Italian kid. The school geography lessons come alive because we go almost everywhere.   Next, we get to do a lot of stunts. Some of them are using   unicycles, juggling balls, somersaulting off a running horse, leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back, acrobatics, walking baby leopards on a leash, and trainers working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. I am a tight rope walker; it takes a lot of balance and concentration. This is not a stunt, but I am also the manager of Circular Circus. This helps because I get to schedule the performances according to the performers convenience.   Now you should be thinking, that life in the circus is not boring   at all, but instead very exciting.

You can see different cities like: Ontario, Boston, and Philadelphia. You can also see new states like New York, Massachusetts, Canada, California, Main, Florida,  Idaho, and Maryland.        You can also see cool people doing cool things like: Acrobats, Jugglers, Tightrope Walking, Ringmasters, and Clowns. You can meet new kinds of people who like: the circus, art, juggling, anyone with the same interest as you.        Also you can see what your learning in school in person like: if you learn about the Statue Of Liberty, you pass new your in your circus trailer and you can actually see it, like it said in the story, 'It makes geography come alive.'        There is a lot of animals you can see to like: Lions, horses, elephants, chimpanzee's, giraffes, some really talented dogs and cats, and sometimes (a) bear(s). A lot of animals are part of the circus.       A circus life is a busy life and you need to do a lot in order to make through some dangerous acts. If your an Acrobat, if you miss the target you have to grab you fall either onto a net or on the hard ground. If your a Tightrope Walker and you lose your balance then you also fall to a net or the hard ground. If your a Lion tamer and your trying to tame a lion but happen to get to close, you c an be eaten alive. If your a stilts walker and a stilt breaks you can break your leg. Also if your a juggler and you miss and hit your head.        Life at the circus is fun, hard, dangerous, and filled with learning.

New York time spoke with Carlos Cortez.Carlos said that he lives in a trailer with his papa.        Every morning he wakes up feeds the animals after that he goes to the pie cart to eat pancakes and bacon. Then he start's warming up with circus people.       Carlo's gets a thrill when he performs in a live audience.Its great to see the audience jump alive when you make eye contact.       The downside is that you don't get to see your family.We work long hours and spend a lot of time away from home.Carlos said that ''on tour that you really have anywhere to call home.       The upside is that you travel around the world.Carlos has worked in China Australia,and all over North America. Carlos says that its giving me many  opportunity to meet many different people.       At 12:oo A.M. In bed. im thinking about going home.It will be nice to go back to my home in spain.           Late at midnight I think about the tour finishing.It would be nice to go back home in Barcelona Spain.So i can see my mama and my family.

When I was a little girl, my mother and I used to always pretend we  were in the circus . But, my father never approved of the circus . He said the circus was childish and silly, you see he was a lawyer and didn't like childish things. One day I told him that I wanted to be in the circus, he got so mad he lighted the fire place went upstairs and got all my circus things and there them in the fire place and said ''Rose you will never go to  the circus. That same day  my parents got divoreced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But enough about me let's talk about the circus. The circus owner is my best friend's dad and my best friend Grace is the other trainer.The circus life is nonstop work  but , the funnest part is when we perform . I sometimes feel that they only come for the horses.Other than the horses my favorite part is the clowns.They make me laugh so much even thinking about them makes me laugh. Being part of the circus makes life a little more fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Finally I must tell you about behind the circus curtains.People are all sweating even they have done this a bunch of times. Sometimes the coustumes are so bright they almost blind me.The trainer coustumes are very simple skirts with a with a simple shirt that macthes my skirt. That is my life in the circus.

I have been to many circus ?that i think is fun because you sit down with your popcorn and you just watch the cool stuff and its alot of entertament.The best one i ever been they had alot of explosesions and my favorite part was the mens that were driving motorcycle.

Things that wouldn't be fun is you have to practice everyday and you get tired.Plus you have to do ten shows a weak.Some little or big kids are scared of clowns and cry.Then the clowns bring lights out and people start to buy them so do they buy food too.One time their was a trampolining outside and little kids were on it having fun.     But it actually is fun except the entrance is to much money so go only one time to the circus not everyday.

To become acircus performer it takes determination ;courage ;and a lot of practice. There's a lot of things you can do at the circus like being the juggler or the clown (etc.). They don't just want any people at the circus they want smart people there.Being a circus performer is very dangerous.That is why I think we need to respect the circus performers . And just because you didn't  like the performance I   think you should still clap because it is showing respect for them because they worked hard. They can be fun also . Would you ever want to be a circus performer. 	VBG DT NN NN MD VB RB JJ IN JJ VBP TO NN IN RB TO JJ NN PRP$ JJS CC RB NNS VBP RB VB DT NN .

The circus is all about people that work a lot at day and night when they come here and visit to do three shows. They have to go to school  and study like us . They travel a lot to different places like Salinas, Mexico, Texas ,Los Angles ,New York ,every where.I think the circus people are cool because I learned a lot of stuff from the acrobats.The acrobats are cool because they do scary stuff.      The people who work at the circus!The people who work at the circus are acrobats clowns jugglers tightrope walker horses. The clowns are funny because they make jokes.The jugglers juggle balls and little hula hoops.The tightrope walker walks on a tight rope with out falling.The horses go around the stage and when they finish you can take pictures with the little horse.The acrobats swing on metal bars   and grab on to each other but you have to grab on tightly or you will fall on the net.               The best part is the end because you can take pictures with the acrobats when it is over.The people from the circus do hard work for us to laugh and smile.I think becoming a circus  person is not that bad  because you make people laugh and children to.

I am so excited i feel like i am going to scream.Acualy i did yesterday when my friend lala called my mom and asked if we could have a whole day playdate and sleepover at the same night and she sayed yes.I'm right now packing my stuff to go over to my friend's house.''Hurry up Samantha'' my mom said. I'm now done and i'm in the car waiting for my mmo to arrive at lala's house.It took forever but finaly we arrived. Once we got there my friend and i squeald together. We quickly ran into the house together, we ran and played it was the best day ever.The day went by so fast it's already nignt time and now lala's mom says it's time to put out the light. We sighed that we have to go to bed already, when lala's mom walked out of the room with our lights out, we sneakily turn the light back on and talked and played all night silently.When it was morning we were so tired we drooped as we walked to the kitchen for brekfest.My mom arriveed at the same time to i waved slowly goodbye to lala and walked into my mom's car with my stuff draging along with me.

Some people think clowns are scary but they aren't they are very nice. Tightrope people face a lot of danger. Like falling of the rope and land on the cold hard ground. Riders face of falling off .May also be trampled to death.   The jugglers don't have any thing to fear. If you juggle something heavy you could really hurt you self or get a black eye.   These  people do a lot where they get hurt very easily. Hallow they make it look very easy. But it is not.   I would like to try it some time.  I could walk a leopard.Ride a elephant. Be a lion tamer. Also be a acrobat.   All that stuff may be fun but very dangerous.Also it would be fun to be up in the air.It would be fun to ride a elephant. I just don't under stand how the people cannot be hurt. They do all this stuff and not get hurt it weird.   Nothing is impossible they say so I take there word for it. It would be nice to see a clown once in a while.  See people shot out of a canon. Also little clown cars. Also see how they are so cute.       Seeing tightrope walkers walk it would be scary and good at the same time. You would never want that person to fall and die. taming a lion. That would be scary and hair raising.Standing on a horse and jumping off would be spectacular to see.       You may even see water shoot out of the flowers  on the clowns shirt and get wet. That would be funny. Seeing them fight.Calling each other names. Also a lion tamer who would make every body nervous. That is what happens at the circus.

After the show my dad told me we made $200,000 and that i did a great job and so did James.It was 10:00 and i was tired so i went to my trailer and got in my night clothes and turned out the lights and went to bed.

I, Andrea Smith, will tell you how I made my dream turn into reality.                   I lived with my older brother, mom, and dad at the time. I liked my older brother, but everyone always told me how I should follow in his footsteps. I wanted to live my own life, not be my brother's shadow. My brother was skilled at many things, but I knew no matter how hard I tried, I would never be like him.                    So, on one fine day in August, when I was ten years old, I decided I would run away. My parents actually allowed me to do it, and I believe it was because they thought I would come back. I do visit them sometimes now. I remember packing a large suitcase with food, water, clothes, and all other neccessities. I also remember trying to to stuff my oversized tent into my bulging suitcase. I had forgotten to think of one small detail: If I ever did run away, where would I go?                     I had no relatives in America. So, I stayed at my best friend's house for a week. I didn't tell her that I had run away. I just told her I had come over for an extra-long sleepover. Then, I left and roamed the streets, looking for a job. I saw a poster advertising a circus. It said: Come one, come all! Come to our circus-extraordinaire! Cloony Clown's Club auditioning for talented clowns! I remembered my long-forgotten dream of joining the circus. I quickly noted down the address and, dragging my heavy suitcase behind me, ran through the thick crowd, shoving people this way and that.                     I reached the circus tent and rushed inside. The words I had failed to notice on the flyer earlier were etched on a large poster on the wall in front of me, plain as day: For talented performers, ages 11 and up!                       I couldn't believe it! I had come this close to achieving my goal and now it had slipped from my fingers! But that's when I remembered something: My birthday was on June 12, and today was June 11! I ran outside and sat down next to the large red and white polka-dotted tent. At exactly 11:59 PM, I rushed back inside and said 'I'm auditioning for Cloony Clown's Club. I've heard that you need a trapeze artist.' as fast as I could. 'Well lucky you, there's only one more spot left.',the lady at the counter replied. As she said this, I watched the clock above her head. It read 11: 59 59 sec. 'How many years old are you?',the lady asked. And then putting on a big, broad smile, all the while watching the clock, I replied,'Eleven, ma'am, I'm eleven!' 'Well then, welcome aboard!' I couldn't have been happier to hear better words!                         And that is the story of how I became the best trapeze artist in Cloony Clown's Club!

I would show everyone what a great animal trainer I was. It took cooperation for me and my animal. Suddenly, there was a crash. I looked outside, they were setting up the tents.         My name is George Gates and I am an animal trainer at this circus. I have been training since I was 8. Like I said earlier, today was a big day for me. At 7:01 I go down to the pie tent(where I eat breakfeast), then I go back to my tent to change into my circus clothes. At 8:00 the big circus tent is set up and I do a rehearsal. Then at 9:00 we all relax after our rehearsal. I am100% sure I won't make mistake. Then the clock ticks 9:00, We got down to the circus tent and then a bus full of people arrive.        Although my heart is in my throat, I walk straight up to them to greet and welcome them. I can tell by their faces they are eager to watch the circus show. Soon more and more people arrive and soon there are more than an 100 people. We take them toward the circus tent.        My heart is still in my throat. They seat themselves and I perform to them. Showing my circus love I perform without making a mistake.       Then it is soon evening I ahve performed all lot. My circus love has been here since I was 8.

I am George Callisto, an acrobat from the circus. You may think circus life is crazy and easy however it is really difficult.       We have school at 9:00. Like any school we have computers, tests, and report cards however there is lots of diversity with many cultures like Russian, French, Italian, and Scottish just like me. Since we treavel so much our geography lessons come to life.       At 3:00 school ends and then comes practice for the show. There are many ineresting parts to it however my favorite is the acrobatics.  The we have a simple dinner at the pie car at 6:30.       At 10:00 the show is over. Boy am I tired. It was so much fun seeing all those happy faces in the audience. But now time to get some sleep. Thank You.

I was having fun waiting for Joe's and my part came. The clown went out and did his magic tricks. The acrobats did their long performance. Then it was our turn to perform.       We were doing the fire act where we had to juggle juggle three thick  sticks with fire on their edges. Then we anccidently dropped one stick and there was a enormous fire. 'Run!' I screamed. Everyone evacuated. I tried to call the firefighters with my cellphone but they didn't understand me because they spoke a different language.       I decided to go to nearest city and get water. My crew helped me do that. We got water and got rid of the fire. Our tent was ruined but we were safe and that was the important thing.

You don't get to see your family as much because your always traveling to different cites,countries,states.       There are varieties of roles in a circus such as,juggling,trapeze,acrobat,and even getting shot from a cannon!       so if you want to work in the circus be prepared.

When the circus finished Joban decided that she wanted to be a circus Clown. So I didnt know what to be so Joban said 'Come on Deanna we could be clowns together. Then I said ok because I thought it would be funny if we were clowns. So, before we left me and joban asked if there were any spots left in the circus. One of them said that they were gonna ask their manager and when they came back they said that there was only two spaces left. Then me and Joban asked if we could do it. Then they asked us what we wanted to be then we both said at the same time'Circus clowns' Then they gave us both a paper for our parents to sign. Then if they said yes we would be in.      Then when we got it me and Joban got into the car and drove home quickly. So me and Jobans parents was in the house talking to eachother we both ran up to them and asked them to sign the paper so that we could be in the circus.

There, the crew   was setting up for today's show.   At 9:00 A.M., I went to school. It was just like a normal school with computers,   tests, and report cards. Since the circus performers are from all over the world, my classmates speak many different languages.   After school is over, I take a 30-minute break. I play with the clowns' unicycles   and juggling balls.   Next, I do my chores and practice for the circus. I take care of our horses', the ones   we use in our horseback acts. My dad practiced jumping off a running horse and somersaulting on the ground. I practice jumping through a hula-hoop just a little bit bigger than me. Other kids like me are practicing the tightrope. Trainers are working with many different kinds of animals.   I eat dinner at 6:00 P.M. in the pie car, but don't eat to much since we have a show   coming up.   In the show, we start off with a live band riding on unicycles dressed as clowns.   Next, trainers walk leopards on a leash, while the leopaords juggle three five-pound balls. After that, kids cartwheel up a ladder and dive into a pool of water. Then, a tiger leaps up to the top of a ladder and does monkey bars. Finally, my part and my dad's part comes. My dad starts the horse while I started charging towards the hula-hoop. I jump through the hoop and jump onto the running horse. Meanwhile, my dad jumps off the horse and does two backwards canon-balls in mid-air and a backwards and forwards flip on the ground. After all this, I drive the horse through an obstacle course where dad holds the obstacles.   After the show, everyone claps and applauses for us. We are exhausted and go to   bed late at night. The whole circus crew was ready to travel to another place after a good night's sleep.

One amazing thing is that you get travel around the world.The philippa has worked all aver the worldthe planet including Australia,Japan nd all over North America.when your young,its time to travel,the time to do it.Its time to grow and experience your life.Philippa also gets thrill from peforming.You can play and have fun every night.Its fun to see the faces of the audience just get so suprised ad jump off their seats.          Despite what many people think, the life 0f a circus peformer ist all high flying fun and games and clowning around.Its glamores than being an accountant,but there are some dropbacks.Circus performers work long days and spend alot of time away from there home.Most of the time you dont have time to play around or even call somebody.Some people miss there home and garden with bueteful flowersAnd you also have to spend alot of hours on weekends as well.

His name was Lloyd.  He lived in San Bernidino.  He's been dreaming of being in a circus one day.  Lloyd watches his favorite circus on tv everyday.  Then an announcment came on after the show.  They said they needed a new   trapeze artist so , they were having a contest and whoever was the best could be            Lloyd thought about it and he decided he needed to talk to his parents first.  They discussed and they agreed for him to enter.  His parents were very supportive and confident in him. So was Lloyd.  He told him self he needed to train really hard to become part of that circus.  He promised himself he would.                                                 Lloyd trained extra hard for the contest.  His parents but him a trapeze set for him to pmudractice on.  He fell a few times but there was a safety net on the bottom.  Then he decided to use the net in his act.  He got the idea from a movie he saw by the name of Madagascar 3.  he ate healthy so he could be fit and he also  exercised doing push-ups, curl-ups, and pull-ups to make sure he had the perfect body for trapeze.            The next day he showed up to the auditions for the circus.  But he was the only one there.  Therefore he got the job.  after his first few shows he started to feel like a stick in the mud.  He wondered what his parents were doing while he was gone.  He wanted to stay in the circus but, really wanted to see his parents.  So, the other members of the circus came to an agreement of how Lloyd can stay in the circus and still see his parents.  They said he can stay with his parents but, when the circus is in San Bernidino he can do his act.                                                                                                      The circus took Lloyd home. When he arrived his parents were on the couch crying.  Lloyd asked what was wrong.  They said they missed him.  Lloyd told them that he's only going to the circus in this city and that any other cities the circus is in he's not going there.

He choose to express himself through an essay.                For Pablo a typical day is a very interesting day because it all falls perfectly in order. First Pablo has to wake up get dressed and take a shower all before 7:00 A.M. Next he goes to eat at a car called, ' Pie car.  In the pie car a perfect breakfast of pancakes with bacon. After he`s done he goes to school at 9:00AM and finises at 3:30PM. Next he does his chores and practices his circus act. At 6:30 PM it`s diner time,and his meal is at the pie car. He can` eat much because he`s about to preform.                 It preforming time for Pablo and he has the butterflies! First the ring master goes out on stage and welcomes everyone on stage. He announces all the acts to the stage. then the time comes when he says,'Pablo.'  Pablo was so nervous his palms were sweating. Pablo was an acrobat and his partner was a girl. He was afraid because at practice he dropped her doing a  triple  back flip double back twist spine breaker. From that day on Pablo was terrified of dropping her. Pablo went in to the stage and climbed a ladder to get the swing and prayed to the heavens to give him power to carry his partner. After he did that he felt stronger and he carried Susan. The crowd went wild.               After the circus Pablo was so tired and was happy he did n`t drop Susan. Pablo's whole family told him he did a great job.

You also have to have a great body and be determined. You should never eat a lot before the show. This is what you should do to try to be in the circus.           In a circus you have to wake up early. You even have to live in a trailer with your family. Even though you get homesick, you still have to focus on your peformance. You have to practice and practice to gt better. The circus is a hard life.

I am a juggler.Juggling is hard at first.But once you get the hang of it , it sticks with you forrever.I myself now happen to be a master at juggling.       My mom is a tight rope walker.But my dad is a clown.Me and my family eat in a pie car.We don't eat alot though.       When it is show time we get serious.There is no clowning around when it is show time.If i clown around during show time my dad whoops me.That is why i don't clown around.       My brother has the coolest job of all.My brother is a firebreather.But my brother's job is also the most dangerous.He can die from it.

Although some days I feel that I never should of joined the circus, I like being around my friends and fellow animals. The first thing I do when I get up is to get dressed and go to the pie car for breakfast,get the tents ready for tonights show, then start practicing for my acrobatics.             My partner and I practiced long and hard for our first show. We had watched other performers before and had thought, 'how do they do this'. Since then I have never gave up my dream to become an acrobate. The show started and I was full of excitement but with nervisment too. I had swung from the bar handle and was off. My partner had caught me and crowd had roared with excitment. I had done it once more and it finally happenend. The day I had been waiting for had come. I was the star of the show.         After that I watched the other performers like the animal trainer, clowns, jugglers,tightrope walker, and much more! The the trainer made the lion jump through a cicle of fire, the jugglers switched balls and even juggles up to 8 balls. I realized that my treasure eas the circus the whole time.

'Let's try that front snap kick again.' Changhao nodded obediently and performed it, this time executing it perfectly. 'Great!' I said and gave him a ripe banana. Just then I felt something nudging gently into my leg. I turned around to face a fully grown king cobra!             'C'mon Triss,' I frowned. 'You know you can't get attention by interrupting. I'll be with you in a minute. Triss made a face, but slithered away quietly. I worked with Changhao on his lunges and then turned to Triss. After the day was over, I lay in bed thinking. My name is Keith, Keith Reyes. I am an animal trainer at the Classic Carnival, a very successful circus that has thier last show of the American tour coming up in a week. It's a big deal, and the circus promoter will be there. My animals and I are a big part of it and that puts a lot of pressure on me. Best not to worry about it, I thought and fell asleep.             I woke up early, at 5:00, and made my way to the pie car. The cook there, Zachary, was an early morning person, and knew I was too. 'Hey there,' he said. 'I got some pancakes for both of us to eat. And I also got some tidbits for your animals.' By the way, Zach loves my animals, and they love him back. I chuckled and we made our way to my cart to eat. After that, I set about teaching my newest animal, a bald eagle, some tricks. In all, I have only three animals, but they are the best three animals one could have. Soon my eagle, which I named Leatho, could do a rolling dive, a barrel flip, and had been trained only to bite people who hurt him first. I looked at my watch. It was already lunch! Zachary and I headed to the pie car and Zachary immediately whipped up an all-you-can-eat buffet.             This time, when I lay in bed, I was content with my training.             It was the day before the circus! Everybody was rushing, but not me. I had trained my animals well, and we had already rehearsed our performance several times in front of the stage crew. But late in the night, while I was giving my animals their dinner. I saw a darkened shape out of the corner of my eye. I did not sleep well that night.              I woke up even earlier to do some last minute practice. But when Zachary and I came in, we found the pet yard empty! Just then I noticed some footprints. I followed them into a large tent, while Zach alerted the others. I had never seen that tent before. I quietly slipped into the folding of the tent and saw two men talking. Animal smugglers! With my animals in cages. Rage welled up inside me but I forced myself to stay calm. Those men had guns. I slipped out and found the rest of the circus actors.              I told them where my animals were and what I was going to do. It was showtime!              I slipped int the folds of the tent again and chirped like a cricket. Leatho knew that signal and began banging on the cage. The men came over to quiet it while Triss stretched and stretched, and made herself thinner and thinner and got out! Triss, however, went to the bottom of Changhao's cage. Changhao started hooting like a madman and the men grouched over. Changhao immediatley layed them flat with a cross chop while Leatho picked his lock. Leatho them barrel rolled into the men and started pecking them. After doing them justice, he went and picked Changhao's lock. The men saw this and started getting up. But then Triss slithered over, with his hood spread wide. The men, their eyes wide with terror, freaked out and ran out of the tent as fast as the could, where they met the rest of my crew along with the police.            The police, who had been called by my crew, disarmed and handcuffed the men.            That night, my animals performed the same trick beautifully on two able-bodied men. The crowd went wild and the circus promoter signed us on another American tour. I went to sleep that night felling happer than ever before.

In the circus there are several jobs you can do, Like: Trapezze, Juggling, Acrobatics, Ring Master, Clown,training animals, and the stage hands.These jobs at the circus are fun.So please keep reading!So here is my story of the circus jobs.                 Hello!Have you ever wanted to be on a trappeze or wanted to know about it?Well you are reading the right pargraph!Well The people who go on trappeze's are pretty scared but look like they are not because they practiced several times.If you know trappeze people fly off ropes! It is so cool! It looks so scary when they fly off and then go to the next bar!But when they were new and they were practing they would always fall of and be depressed but they sty strong and say 'I will achieve this goal!After years or months passed they are great!That is what is like being a person on a trappeze!                 This Paragraph is about juggling.Have you ever tried to juggle? Well if you haven't try now!   It is hard?Ehh?You juggle balls or pie or anything!As Like swords (WOW) or chain saws (DANGER) These jugglers have hard times. They have to practice WAY  more then any others.That is why maybe jugglers have so much fun.That is my paragraph about juggling.                 This is about acrobats.Those acrobats you proabably have seen looks so cool!Did you know that they do somersaults?They also launch from cannons, And tight rope walk? So scary!You are up so tall when you are looking down there probably isn't any safety when you fall down and you can break probably your body bones.That is what it is like being in a acrobat.                 Now, I Jenny Kim shall be telling you about the ring masters.The ring masters are the hosts of the circus. Then they announce who is going to come out next.The ring master shouts all day.TIRING!He has a special costume that is more natural then the rest of the acts.Then at the end of the show the ring master puts on an amazing show with the horses!Wouldnt that be exciting?That is what the ring masters dresses and does.                 Now, this is what most of the kids know from all the circuses.The clowns! The clowns entertain every audience.They ride in tiny little cars and always act silly! hehe The clowns throw pies and wear big pants!they wear so much make-up you don't even know whos who!?But guess what the clowns actaully learn they dont do whatever they want because that would create a mess.So that is why they practice how they should do it and not how to do it. That is what clowns do and what goes on clowns.               Next, I shall tell you about the animal trainers.These animal trainers are lucky but their job is risky.The animal trainers train animals.Of course! The animals train  monkeys,seals,elephants,leopards, snakes, lions, annd horses.They have danger hazard so they have to have medicine or someone who cures people like doctors. The animals have fun jumping through hoops and jumping very high.They sometimes make the tigers jump in the hoop of fire!Wow~!That is what  the animals do and what the trainers do.               Finally, the stage hands you can never forget!If you never had them you would have no circus and you need help putting up the tent. They also help by just calling saying 'you are almost next.' or 'you are next, Hurry!'They get the animals ready for the show and sometmes they have to clean the animals poop.eww~They also groom the animals and get their manes or hair ready for the nights show. Those are reasons why we need to have stage hands in the circus for help.              Well, I hope you had a nice time reading my essay because this may help you on a report.I hope you had fun reading the ones in the circus you like by the way did you like my essay?I hope this helps you because it would be a honor to me.Thank you and Goodbye~                                                                              ~The End~ 	: `` DT NNP NNP : CC NN : NNP : NNP NNP CC NN : NNP , PRP NNP NNP VBP VBG TO VB PRP IN DT NNP POS NNP DT NN RB VBP JJ NNS PRP MD VB , NNP : NNP , NNP , NNP , NNP NNP , NNP , NN NNS , CC DT NN JJ NNS IN DT NN VBP RB VB JJ NN .

It's busy because you have to get dressed, eat, go to school, have a quick break, you have chores to do, practice your performance, and finally perform. See how busy you can get if your in the circus. Well now for the tough part you don't get to visit your family! Yes i know it's depressing. Well that's how it's gonna be if you were in the circus. See there's a lot of things you have to do.              Okay so now you have to learn to get ready if you were in the circus. Now your getting ready to become a performer if you were in a real circus. First, you have to make sure your concentrating in school. Second, You have to be determinate to do this because there a lot of dangerous things you have to do if you were in the circus. Third, you have to be flexible and work hard. Fourth, you have to have eye contact with the audience. When you grow up you can be a circus person.                  If your sure you want to be a circus person you can be a:              Clown if your funny and like to joke around An acrobat hanging and swinging A juggler were you an juggle anything but you have to concentrate if it's going to hit you A tightrope walker to concentrate on balancing A tamer to tame animals. But there are other jobs, but those are extra work like cleaning up dropping from the animals and grooming the animals.                Remember you get to barley see your family because you have to concentrate at the circus because its like a job. But there are things you need to do at the circus because you can get paid because your performing for the crowd because people like to get entertained. People like to get scared to like if your going to fall off and than people (gasp).  But some times you get to thrilled with performing then suddenly you get to nervous because of the crowd. Than the performers that are not scared go on with there act and go on with you. There's a lot of things you need to do remember to concentrate, balance, and be confidant to get ready for the show.               You dont get to see your family because you have to concentrate on the job you have as a circus performer. You dont get to call from home because there's no service on the train their on. But if your going to perform in the state your family is in you might get to see them.               Atleast your making money to go to your family when you retire and go fly all the way to where your family lives.

I saw a sign on the door of a resterant it said clown needed. I though and thought until a little angle poped on my Sholder and said do it do it now. I said ok an took the paper of the wall and called the people. They interveiwed me and they said your hiered i screamed and cryed for joy. That was the best day of my life.

It really got to his family and they wanted to help. So one day they sat him down in the pie car and started to talk. 'Now Timmy, you have been acting, how do I say this? Well, lets say different,' Said Timmys mom, Lily.                  'What do you meen?' Said Timmy with  a grim look on his face. 'Now son, can you tell us what is going on?' Quetioned Timmy's dad, Tom. 'Well, there is just no place to call home. I feel everyday that there is no home so whats the point of being here,'             Then Timmy got up and went to his room. His parents then fallowed to cheer him up a little. 'Honey? Can we come in? We want to talk to you,' Said Lily but right after You could hear Timmy say a faint ' Sure, Whatever.'                  Lily and Tom walked in and sat down on his bed. 'Timmy, I now it's not the glamorous life you want but this is where we belong. It may just be an old, rusty train to you but we grew up here and this is what we call home and someday I hope you call it home to because this  is where you are going to grow up. Timmy sat up and looked at his parents and finelly said ' This is home. I may not have realized it, but this is home.

I work at the circus named Lots 'o' Fun. I work as an animal trainer, but my favorite animal to train are the leopards.          My favorite animals to train are the lepards, because they are adorable. Also, because they are very unique and it's not like training a dog. However, you need to help them practice enough so they don't forget what they are doing in the middle of a performance.          There are many leopards, but here are some of their names, Lola, Daisy, Dotty, and Smarty. The trick that the audience loves the most is when they jump through hoops. Right now we have 3 leopards in training. Their names are Sky, Rolo, and Taliver.          Some of the people I travel with are Carl and Anne, the Circus clowns. Also, there is Terri, Carla, Andrew, Patty, and Carrie, our acrobats. My closest friend I travel with is Tonya, a fellow animal trainer. Sometimes the trailer can be very tight with everybody in there.           My least favorite things to do are working from sun-up to sun-down, so, you only get a little sleep. Also, it's hard being away from my family for so long and not having friends for a long time because you keep moving to different cities. Then, there is also having to eat out of a pie car every night.          So, sometimes the circus life can be great, but sometimes it can be very rough. That is about my life traveling with the Lots 'o' Fun Circus, many fun people, and the best animals!

Have you ever been? Well if you have cool!!!!           Do you want to know my my favorite part of the circus is. Well I will tell you, it is all the different types of animals doing all different types of tricks.            All animals are funny and cute but my real favorite is the monkeys and elephants. I like it when the elephants do the special tricks close to the end.            The worst part to me is having the circus over and go home, but the good thing is that it lasts pretty long i say about a few hours.             When i have the chance to get tickets though i try my hardest to get as many as i can get cause they are some big bucks. So it is hard to get a lot of tickets if you don't have that much money or if you have enough money to get more than one you can try but don't waste your money on whole lot of tickets or you will be out of luck.                                So next time you go to the circus tell people what your favorite part of the circus is. See you later!!!!!             	PRP$ NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP . . . . . . .

You might hurt yourself if yo do something wrong during practice. It is very important that you do not wear your uniform during practice because you only get one so if it rips your out of luck. There are some downfalls of being a clown like you never get to see your real family when on a tour butt you still get to call them after your praformance. Then there are good things like you get payed alot of money. So if you want to be a clown just keep these things in mind.

And when my best friend Sabria and me won front row seats we were excited. Every since Sabria and me entered the contest I am always going to dream about this moment. 'Hey Sabria were up front now lets give them are tickets'. 'Ok thats fine I will'. As we gave are golden tickets to the man up front and he gave us are passes to sit up front!'This is the best day ever' said Sabria! 'Yes this is' Nikkia said even more happy than ever! Just then the man said lets rumble and tumble and lets watch everyones show! But before we do that lets give are winners a big hand Nikkia and Sabria! (cheering was everywhere). Then the show was begining and everyone was out there. After everyone went home I will never forget this moment. I love circus.

The circus is a fun colorful place full of  interesting people and animals.  A circus is where people come from different states to perform a show for  you.  A circus is also a place where you can enjoy watching unusual acts and laugh at different things.  A circus also has animals that preform tricks for you such as, Jumping through hoops, Standing on two feet, And danceing.  Also there are acrobats who preform different stunts hanging on ropes.       First, Circus clowns, Circus clowns are funny people wearing makeup and big floppy shoes.  You may have seen a clown at your circus and if you have'nt here are some common details a clown has, Big floppy shoes, Curly fluffy hair, Silly makeup, And a funny outfit.  Clowns are nice and often play jokes on other clowns.  Jokes are funny to clowns here are some common jokes they play, Pie in the face, water in the face, and loud music in their ears.  Clowns are funny but scary at times to me.       Second, Circus acrobats, Circus acrobats are cool interesting people.  They preform tricks on ropes and flip in the air.  Acrobats are like professional ballet dancers but on ropes.  They twirl and slide on ropes to make people think they are going to fall wich leaves them in suspence.  Also, Acrobats have to trust their partner or they might put the partner's life in danger.       Third, Circus juggler,  Circus jugglers throw different objects it the air and toss them in a circular motion makeing them come into each hand evenly and the cycle continues on.  Circus jugglers toss things such as, Rings, Sticks, Animals, And balls.  Juggling  requires only one person but you can have at least four in a group.  Jugglers usualy wear puffy red, White, Or blue shirts to make them look interesting.  Also, Jugglers may do tricks while juggling they might flip or ride on a unicycle while they are juggling.       Fourth, Circus tightrope walker, Tightrope walkers walk on ropes that are conected to two platforms one is where the walk begins and one is where the walk finishes.  The tightrope walker has a very dangerous job in the circus they walk on a rope several feet above the ground.  Even though the rope is high up they usualy have a net hoisted above the ground just incase they fall.  Tightrope walkers can also do more stunts with their job to make it more interesting and dangerous.  Tightrope walkers can ride motorcycles on a rope, Jump on the rope, And sometimes spin on the rope.       Now, Circus horses, Circus horses are fun animals that usualy jump up and down.  Circus horses have to listen to their trainer or they will be excused from the circus.  If the horses are not trained they might go crazy and hurt somebody.  The people who preform with the horses might jump on their backs or stand on their backs as a trick.  The horses are usualy black or white to make them stand out.       Later, The circus tent, The circus tent is where everything goes on, the entire show depends on the tent.  The circus tent is the basic traveling home of the circus people.  The circus tent is wide and tall like a small house.  The tents are usualy white and red or white and blue depending on the type of circus.  The circus tent takes a while to put up if you do not have the right kind of help with you.           Next, The circus lifestyle, The circus life isnt all fun and games all the time.  You have to work all day and all night all the time even on weekends!  Circus performers don't get alot of sleep either they have to be up around six or seven A.M. and the noght before they were up until like twelve P.M. so the few hours they get to sleep is pure gold to them.  How their day starts is go to the pie car to get food for breakfast, Get dressed, Practice for a while, Go to the morning show, Then practice for the matinee.  Pretty harsh living style but the preformers say its all worth it!       After that,  Chores a young circus performer has to do, First, they clean animal stables I think that job would be disgusting becaus the animals use the bathroom there.  Then they groom the animals to prepare them for the show.  Next, they feed the animals so they don't get hungry during the show and eat the straw scattered on the ground.  After that, they practice for the upcoming show so they can do a perfect job and please the audience.  Later, They let the animals rest so they will be well rested for the show.       Then, Traveling school,  Their school is like no other it travels with them on their trips to different countrys.  It may get hard at times becaus other kids on the school trailer speak different languages and you can not understand what they are saying.  Also when they travel all around the world they see the different cultures that the states have and that makes the lessons come alive.  The school isn't much different from regular schools it's just on wheels.  The school makes it to where the circus children have education while they are on the road.       Last,  Circuses are fun at times and hard living at times to.  Would you ever give up seeing your family for the circus life?  I would never do that becaus without my family I would be upset.  Circus life is different from a regular life it has its up sides its down sides and the sides that are just right.  This concludes my report about the circus.

The tightrope walker is steady. The horses are walking. The trains are going fast. The show is over people are clapping the acrobats are bowling.Everybody is going home cars are leaving.We eat dinner relax.We have 10 shows a week,Its the same thing again.We will end up in another citie.

I was trying to be and acrobat, but it was hard. My partner Manuel is helpng me how to be a good acrobat. Manuel taught me 24/7 until I was ready for my debut.           Finally, my debut came I was so nervous about my first circus show. I was also afraid that I was going to mess up. All the pressure came to me. I waited, waited, and waited until it was Manuel and me. It was our turn to go on next. The clown introduced me to the crowd.            The crowd went wild when they heared that it was my debut. when I went on my stage, I did what I needed to do, which was to entertain the crowd.There were so many people watching the circus, more pressure came. When I went on my first jump I swinged and jumped off. Then, Manuel caught me and put me back on my swing.I couldn't belive I made my first jump.            When I saw my boss smiling at me, I was happy. Happy enough to do my second jump with confidence. So I went off. Good thing there was a net underneath me because i fell, good thing that nothing was hurt. When I was on the net, I springed up and went on my swing and tried my 360 jump again. I did it and Manuel caught me. Everybody was amazed that I made my second jump. They don't know that i have 4 jumps.            When I got back from my ledge, Manuel and I jumped at the same time and did our frontflips off our swings. All of the crowd loved us. Finally, it was my 4th jump. I have to do a backflip while doing a 360. My last jump was hard I missed my first try and my second try. You know what they say third time is the charm. I swinged off my edge and looked at the crowd. They were amazed what Manuel and I were doing. We jumped off the same time, and did our 360 backflip. We got each other's swings and landed on the ledge.            When we got down, we ave each other a high five. We went to our boss and wanted to know how we did. He said great. We were so happy we gave each other another high five. Oh man I can't wait to go back and do the same thing what we did at the end.            While we waited to jump again before the crowd goes home.We needed to get water so we will not be thirsty. After an hour, all of the member went on. We did our acts again all at once. It was so cool and there was confetti. We all bowed to the crowd and said goodnight. I was so sad that the crowd was not here, but couldn't wait for the other crowd for next week.            I couldn't believe that the crowd rated the shoe 5 out of 5 stars. My debut was a success and I did a really good job on my debut day. After this month I have to go to Florida. I can't wait to go in the beach and have fun. Everybody couldn't believe that I only had 6 months to get ready for today and all that work payed off.

Exept before they could do the show they had to find a clown which was the main part of the circus.            The circus put up a sign up sheet for a clown job. On the first day everybody signed up it seemed like.            Then when it came to be adition day only two people showed up. It was kind of disappointing ,but it gave the judge a easier choice. The people that had signed up to be a clown were named after Babe Ruth the famous baseball player and Usher. They were both a good clown and definately not shy to a strangers face.

Ok back to the story, I'm getting ready for the big show in Toon Town and then I over hear my boss saying that there is a new person in the circus.then i whisper to myself ' I wonder who that is going to be?               An hour later, Bob saw the new person in my boss'ss room and guess who it was. Roger Rabit!!!  Roger came out of the room and said, ' hello'        Then I said, ' Oh, you are the new person.'        'I have some experience in being a tightrope walker,' Roger said        I replied 'Then lets see it.'            It was 3:45 and the show started at 6:00. Roger got up on the tightrope on a little bike. He just rode back and forth on the little bike . he came down and said to Me ' How about that did you like it?'         ' Not really.'            It's 5:45 and now I'm starting to get worried that maybe Roger won't get it right. Now it is 5:55  and the show is about to start. Now it is 6:00, let the show begin! I go out and I look up at Roger and saw him standing where he was suppost to be and then they put the spotlight on him and then he started to do back flips on it then for the grand finale he did a wheelie on a little bike.

My family consists of my brother Eric, my sister Mile y, my parents and me. My day starts with breakfast in the pie cart and then school starts. My brother is in the high school class and my sister is in preschool. I am in middle school in 6th grade. I go to a special trailer every morning to the sixth grade class which consists of 3 boys and 4 girls, including me. After school I play with my cat Sunny and do my homework. Next I practice my craft.       I am a trapeze artist and right now I am practicing flipping off a trapeze and into another trapeze. It requires a lot of skill and patience. My dad is working on his clowning skills and my mom is working on the tightrope. She is preforming a difficult trick in  which she must ride two unicycles stacked on top of each other while on a string tight rope suspended 50 feet in the air. My brother is working on a trick in which he is thrown out of a cannon and my sister is working on doing a flip off a trampoline. My friends do acrobatics and trapeze. Then we have dinner and get into costumes. Mine is a sparkly green costume.       The show begins! I do a trick which I learned a long time ago: doing a handstand on my friend'ss head while she is sitting on a trapeze holding a pole which my other friend walks on to get to our trapeze. She then hangs on the seat of the trapeze while it lowers and I get off.   The show ends and I walk back with my family, tired as a sloth.       It'ss midnight and I am in bed. I wonder what it is like to be a regular kid, about to see me preform tomorrow.

In a circus there is alot more things to watch like a tightrope walker . Also they have circus horses. The horses do tricks in front of the audients.but mostly they get riden on by the workers at the circus. also the tightrope walkers they walk on thin ropes.                                                                                                                                                              At the circus they also have acrobats that perform. The acrobats do stunts that are hard to do . But not for them because they practice alot to get it just perfect that way they do not get hurt. The circus also has clowns. I do not like clowns but i am sure other people like them .but i dont like them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Outsides of circus they have food games all sorts of things . they even have jumpers.    some times they dont have jumpers. mostly they dont have jumpers .as you can see the cicus is not so bad but i still do not like circus. even though i dont like circus i  am sure that other people like the circus.

There is a group of people wanting to inside some shade.Thier names are Billy, Bob, and Billybob.                                                                                         2           Billy finds a circus and says, 'why don't we just go in there,' but bob, the grumpy one claims it is to much money. Billybob the stupid one says, 'no still same monies,' bob says, 'we have 50 cents not 50$ dummy.' They both started arguing like pigs over a mud bath. Billy had to break up the fight. He did and says,'look we can enter for only 50 cents.'                                                                                                              3            Shure enough at the bottom of the invataition it stated 50 cents for people who join. Billybob said 'we no go have be hot!' 'see he's a dummy what'd I yeh,' Bob said, Billy looked at Bob and he stopped. And they all lived happily ever after.

His dream was to be in the circus. But first he had to find it. So he looked at the news and found out it was in Yrup. Luckily his family was taking a trip there. When they got there he looked for the circus.                He looked at the park, he looked on the street. Then finally, he saw a baner that said,'look for the lights flashing tonight the circus is in town. When his mom and dad sent him to bed and he look for the lights out his window. He saw the lights and he thought i will go there tomarrow.                When it was the next day he told his family he was going out. His mom sayed ok but be back by 8:00. he sayed ok. He ran to where he saw the lights and they sayed,'your welcome to join the circus and i here he has a happy life                                                        THE                                                 END 	DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN WP VBD RB IN NN TO VB PRP$ NNP NNP NN VBD TO VB IN DT NNP CC JJ PRP VBD TO VB NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT NN CC VBD RP PRP VBD IN NNP NNP PRP$ NN VBD VBG DT NN NNP NNP PRP VBD RB PRP VBD IN DT NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN , PRP VBD IN DT NNP NNP RB , PRP VBD DT NN WDT VBD , JJ IN DT NNS VBG NN DT NN VBZ IN NNP NNP PRP$ NN CC VBD VBN PRP TO VBD CC PRP VBD IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD DT NNS CC PRP VBD PRP MD VB RB NNP NNP PRP VBD DT JJ NN PRP VBD PRP$ NN PRP VBD VBG NNP NNP NN VBD NN CC VB RP IN CD PRP VBD NNP NNP VBD TO WRB PRP VBD DT NNS CC PRP VBD , JJ NN TO VB DT NN CC PRP RB PRP VBZ DT JJ NN DT NN	1		20131022161225	690	1		20131022163309	539	1

If I worked at the circus I would work as a circus  candy clown. I would dress up looking like a real clown.       I would do tricks make wird ballons and other stuff. I would have lolypops in my hare. And then I would go to my traller and go to bed. And then I would wake up the next morning and getting ready to be a circus candy clown again.

Ashley is 16 years old and her parents own the circus. Ashley basically lives at the circus because shes always at one or on the road. Shes home schooled her parents want her to perform with the tigers but shes so nervous and scared. Her parents told her if she doesn't come up with a act in two days. Ashley's going to have to work with the tigers and is not going to have the choice.    The next morning she woke with her clown pajamas on ate a bowl of cereal bacon and four pancakes. When your in the circus you have to be full so you don't get so hungry. Also make sure have a good breakfast. Then she went to the gym in her pajamas the clowns were laughing at her. Ashley worked out for a while then got ready. They got on their trailer and left while she was riding in the trailer she was thinking about her performance. While she was traveling  then she decided what she was going to do.      When they got to the circus they set up the tents and decorations. Ashley ran to her parents and told them what she wanted to perform. She wanted to perform on the trapedes her parnets agreed. Her mother said its going to take alot of practice. Ashley practice for 7 hours everyday and finally mastered it. The show started at 8pm Ashley was practing. Ashley's mother brought in a real live tiger and told Ashley to get on top of it. Ashley was nervouse she got on the tiger she wasn't scared anymore. Her mother siad your going to have to do two acts.    Ashley agreed with her mother then it was showtime she did excellent with the tigers her parents were so proud of her . It was the last show and she performed great. It was time to leave for the summer and Ashley misses the circus so much.

Its not easy to do all of theses things when your away from home.But its fun to see all of the people that come to the circus and watch all of the animals and acrobats,jugglers and tightrope walkers.       At 3:30 P.M. I have chores and practice.I feed,water, and groom the animals like horses we use in our horseback act.I'm working on a leaping from a trampoline into the horses back;it takes balance and concentration.At 10:30 P.M. the show is over . I'm wiped out from all of that work.       One of the upsides of being in the circus that you get to go everywhere.Philippa has worked all over the world including Australia,Japan and all over North America.The circus has given me the opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many different people.       I miss my home and  and where i live at and i miss my family.You have a lot of practice a lot of hours of working and then you show it off in front of a big crowd.THE END.

To begin with,you have to drive 20,000 miles in seven months each year.Visiting 150 cities from sunup to sundown.First,you wake up at 7:00 A.M to eat and get dressed.Then at 9:00 A.M its school time.Like every school ours has computers,test,and report cards.Many people in the school and circus speak other languages like:French,Russian,and Italian.At 3:30 P.M.Chores and practice.We feed the animals and water them.Then we groom the horses in our horseback acts.At 6:30 P.M.Dinnertime.We go to the pie car to eat,but we dont eat much because we're performing tonight.We do 10 shows a week:one each weekday,plus a matinee on wednesday,two on Saturday,and two on Sunday.10:30 P.M.The show is over.At 12:00 A.M.Its time to go to asleep.           Next,you have to have to have specific talent.You have to be like a acrobat,trapeze artist,circus clown,juggler,tight rope walker,and know how to train animals.You also have to have the right body type and be determined.If your determined you can start at a young age.Like Philippa started when she was 5 years old.She did musical theatre and ballet and all kinds of music,singing,acting and everthing to hone my craft'says Philippa,who also trained in rhythmic gymnastics for years.There are so many people out there who want to do what you do,that you have to go for it.You have to put your heart into it and be certain that's what you want to do           Finally,theres always gonna be bad days or good days.Sometimes theres not always gonna be happy and perfect days as you think circus are.The good part about being in the circus is that you get to travel across the world.The girl that started when she was 5,Phillippa has worked all over the planet,including Australia,Japan and all over North America.'The circus has given me the opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many new people said Phillippa.Now the bad days or downside days.Circus perfomers work long days and spend a lot of time away from home. You have to work a lot of long hours and weekends as well.              As you can see,these are all the things circus have and all the things people have to do to have a good circus.

At 7:00 a.m, I have to eat breakfast in the pie car and have food like pancakes and bacon, and eggs. The crew is setting up for the show tonight.       9:00 a.m., School time, I go to school for six hours each day. Like any school, there is modern technology, tests, and report cards. Since we perform all over the world, many of my classmates speak other languages, so it is sort of a bilingual school. As we travel all over the world, our geography lessons are great help.       3:00 p.m. School has just got out. It is sort of like playtime for me because the clowns' let us play with their stuff like riding unicycles and juggling, and we also have a dog and we play with hom afterschool too. I sometimes get bored, but I can always entertain myself.       3:30 p.m. We practice what we are going to do tonight for the circus and do chores. The chores can be really boring like I have to pick up the elephants' poop and feed the elephants. I have to practice my acts like riding on the unicycle and juggling. Trainers are doing training with the animals.       6:30 p.m. Dinnertime. We eat a small meal before we perform our show because we could get cramps and we are performing tonight. We do 8 shows a week. One eack weekday, and two on each Saturday and one on sunday.       10:30 p.m. The show is over. I am exhausted after a big show.We pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. WEe will set up in another town in two days.        12:00 a.m. I am in bed and thinking about the end of our season. It will be very nice to go back to our real home in California. I might be a circus performer, or maybe not. Who Knoes? The circus is fun, but it is a very fun part of the year.

One day   Kiara said that she could not   do one of the stunts because she was scared of heights and that   stunt was 200 feet high. Then   Kiara thought of way to do it   without looking down and she   said that I will go into my imagination while I am doing the stunt. I am the sillyiest    clown in the family. Kiara was   thinking about how much she loved being a clown when she   was doing the stunt. Then the   stunt was over and then Kiara   and her family went home. The   next she got up and pratice.They did the first show at their home.   Kiara was so glad she did not   look down because she  would   have been screaming in mid   air.Kiara mom was cooking breastfeast and Kiara asked   her mother do she know were   her clown costume 	PRP$ VBD DT CD NN JJ NN VBD NNP PRP$ CC PRP$ NN VBD IN DT NNP CD NN NNP VBD IN PRP MD RB VB CD IN DT NNS IN PRP VBD VBN IN NNS CC IN NN VBD CD NNS NNP NNP NNP VBD IN NN TO VB PRP IN VBG IN CC PRP VBD IN PRP MD VB IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBP VBG DT NNP NNP VBP DT JJS NN IN DT NNP NNP VBD VBG IN WRB JJ PRP VBD VBG DT NN WRB PRP VBD VBG DT NNP NNP DT NN VBD IN CC RB NNP CC PRP$ NN NN NNP NNP JJ PRP VBD RP CC JJ VBD DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD RB VBN PRP VBD RB VB RB IN PRP MD VB VBN VBG IN JJ NN NN VBD VBG JJ CC NNP VBD PRP RB VBP PRP VB VBD PRP RB VBP	1		20131023152506	539	2		20131023220047	537	1		20131025135216	543	1

So that night I squeezed out my window and headed towards the circus to see if I could get a job.I tried to talk to one of the clowns but he kept shooting me with a water flower.So I went to another clown and he used a hand buzzer on me!The instructor asked me where my mother was and I told him I was an orphan.He asked me if I had any special talent and I said 'NO.'         Then the next day the instructor came and woke me up and started training me.I learned some pranks and things like that.My favorite part was when he taught me to throw pies and that was fun but hard.now the other clowns are working with me and are showing me tricks with money and hanker chiefs.                                      10 YEARS LATER        Now I am 20 years old and life is horrible because I get hardly any sleep and I have to drive one of the semi trucks because we are short on drivers.Every day is the same as the next and we eat the same thing everyday.I wish I never would have run away.

Doing things like that that are just God given talent.  You might think it looks easy but trust me it isn't.  Although it is fun it is a lot of hard work. To achieve goals that you make in the circus are always fulfilled.       After a show you will probly be very exuasted. But that realy doesn't matter in the circus. You are very happy with how you did but you fall out when you are done. Hearing those people cheer is just a dream come true. you absolutly love it.

He's our portable trashcan when I would get the last piece of pie he would eat the crust, when my dad wasn't looking I tossed him a price of my broccoli.       On the day of the circus I would do some extra practices when no one is looking I start on the trapies, but I have to be very quiet bcause I don't wan't to wake up the lions or the monkeys. But I don't want to wake up my dad for sure so thats the life of me in the circus. Ectspet the part of trying to get out of the trapies when everone is awake thats the hard part of it. Thats when having a hole in the side.

The other reason is that I can do different acts.Some of the acts are doing somersaults off of horses backs and leaping off a trampoline onto a horses back.The other acts are being a circus clown, acrobats, a circus juggler, and a tightrope walker.               The circus act that I would do would be able to train the animals.Like the leperods,  elephants, lions, tigers, chimpanzees and monkeys.I think it might be fun to train those animals.Also I would  want to be a trapeze artist.I would want to be a trapeze artist because it would be very cool to be stretchy.Another reason I would want to be a trapeze artist is that it would be awesome to able be swing from high places.               Those are the reasons why I would want to be in the circus.It would be fun because I could do a lot of acts.The act that i would want to do the most is to train the animals.Like the lions, tigers, elephants, chimpanzees, and the monkeys.The last act that i would ever want to be is a juggler.I wouldn't want to be a juggler because it probably wouldn't be any fun.

When we got to the circus Jamie and I were so excited we both could not wait to see the animals we talked a lot about how fun and hard it would be in the circus.When the show started we were so happy.The first act to come out was the circus clown,then the acrobats,then the circus juggler,then the tightrope walker,and at last the animals.We saw the baby panthers,lions,tigers,and bears.           At last the show was over.When we went back to Jamie's house and we were setting up a bed on the floor for Jamie and I.It was all nice and neat until Jamie's dog Sadona rolled around on it but we were so tired that we just started rolling around too.

They told us we were going to have a lot of practice so on Friday me and my friend said are good bye's to are family's and left on the train.That next morning we did a lot of practice and i had learned how to go across a long rope with out falling it was really fun and that clown Edd was very good at everything for a beginner.Well after a week me and my friend really missed are family's but my friend said she was going to leave so she called her mom and she got picked up in New York the next day.So that means im by my self know but after she left me and Edd were having so much fun we learned how to do so many thing i even learned how to walk a leopard on a leash it is very hard.So after a couple of performances i really got use to the circus life it was really fun.When we went to Las Vegas it was the fun we got this big hotel and we got to get new clothes for this big act were going to do in Circus Circus.After 3 months i got to know everybody and i felt like i was part of the family.                         So its December now and i only have one month left until this tour ends i had lots of fun meeting everyone and learning all the tricks.But this last performance im going to try my best and take some risk because i want to remember this life.So tonites the performance and i cant wait im going to do all types of tricks like learn how to jump on the trampoline while  juggle and how to teach a tiger how to jump into a fire ring with out burning himself and many more.after the big performance at the circus people gathered and ate a big dinner we all had a good time but we were all leaving the next morning we were all sad but we told each other that we were going to do this next year.Then the next day the train dropped every body off and i was so happy to see my family but i missed everyone.But certainly a year later we all did what we told each other and we all were back to the circus life.

Lewis and i'm going to teLl you about life in a Circus. Life in a Circus is very difficult, but not for me because I have been in the Circus for 15 years. I started when I was 7 years old, I wanted to do it because my parents has their own circus, so once I saw them doing acrobats I knew from the beginning that's what I wanted to do. I trained for 3 years and when I turned 10 it was my first performance. The performance I had to do was walking on a horse back while it was running. At first I was very scared but then I saw my father show me what I had to do before showtime  to refresh my memory and then I noticed it wasn't that scary after all. It was 5 minutes before show, I was next. Before I went on my father wished me good luck and it was time for me to go on. As I walked onto the platform I noticed how many people came just to watch the Circus, then I said to myself I can't mess up or my parents reputation will be ruined. So, after all I performed my act and I landed it it was perfect everyone loved it. I have been doing the Circus every since.        Now, I've told my story so it's time for me to tell you the types of training you wil have to do for your entrance in your life in the Circus.        If you want to be in the Circus you will have to be fit and in shape. You will have to take contortionist and acrobat lessons. Most of all you will have to be determined to do it and not quit and that's how you will get the performing act. I'm gonna tell you only a fewjobs they are gonna have there just incase you will want to do one and I will tell you what types of trainings you will have to do with them.       The first job I am going to tell you about is acrobats. In order to do acrobats you will have to have great balance and posture. Next, you will have to be in shape and have lots of flexability. The types of training you will have to do is just learnong how to do certain moves and how to hold your self in the air with nothing holding you. Then, you will have to learn how to flip and spin in the air and that's how you do acrobats in the air without nothing holding you but a rubber-band like object that you will have to hold on to in order not to fall out of the air and this will take lots of strength.       The next job I am going to tell you is about traing lions. To train lions you have to be very brave and have the animals to like you. Warning: If the animals do not like you stay away from them and try to stay calm. The type of training you will have to take is only classes on how to get the animals to do what you say and it will take lots of practice to get the animals to like you. Tip: Give the animal treats after they do what you tell them to do.      That's all the Tips I have for you today until next time GOOD LUCK! I have a show to do. Good Bye!

Cindy always loved going to the circus with her parents but she wondered why they always left before the show began and came back when it ended. So she went to investigate what her parents where doing one thursday night and this is what happend.                     One thursday night Cindy went with her parents to a circus and her parents went somewhere elese so Cindy folowed her mom, Terissa, to a funky room where ladies were getting in funky costumes. But then her mom grabed one out of a familier bag and put it on. So Cindy found another bag and put the costome on witch fit and followed her mom witch looked like she was waiting in a long line for something then heard her mom call out,'Millie, where are you.' Then someone replied in the dreeing room, be there in a minute.' But no one came and her mom said,'Oh, i didnt realize you got here Milie,' and grabed her hand and pulled her out in the show ring. Then she said ,'run and jump high,' so she did what her mother said.

Once the show began they saw acrobats swinging off of the ropes.'Mommy I want to be an acrobat when I grow up,' said Margret.'Margret you have to have the right body type and be very determined. Now watch the show,' said Mrs. Robinson.Next they saw people standing and doing tricks off of their horses. The crowd cheered as someone did a somersault off of his horse.              Then they saw the tight rope walkers one man almost fell off the rope. Several people were cheering at this point. One by one the tight ropers walked on the ropes and none of them fell off. Finally they showed the clowns and the jugglers. The jugglers could juggle five bowling pins at once. The clowns really scared Margret.              At about ten o'clock the circus show was over. Margret was really tired so when she got home she went straight to bed. That night Margret wished she could  have stayed longer. She hopes that she can go back another time.

I wanted to join the circus when I was about 10 years old. my mom told me I was very flexible. So for my birthday I asked my aunt if she would take me to the circus,so she did.When I saw the acrobats I knew I wanted to join the circus.           Getting ready for a show isn't easy because you have to set all the props and equipment up.also you need to practice before the show begins.           During the show I love to see all the performers.Soon it is my turn to preform I am nervous but I usually do good.Once I am done performing everyone tells me I did great.           After the show is over I am exhausted so I go to bed.

In the tent, Hudson the clown was getting ready for the big circus. He was inside the helicopter which would take them to the circus. They put the elephants inside the back of a train which takes them to the circus as well. Many other things were put in the train. As well as costumes, baloons, food and water supplies and many other things. The helicopter would take them to the circus. Beginning now the rotors began to spin, and the train's engine was steaming.       Both of the transports took off, with 120 miles to travel. once in paris, the helicopter landed. The train came up the slope to a stop 20 minuets later. Everyone got ready for the big day at the paris national circus, which was tommarow. The people got out and trained for their' acting postions. Hudson, getting out of the helicopter, welcomed the others that had arrived in the train. Hudson was nervous as they enter The giant tent, filled with many people. Over 17,000 People filled the seats. The actors got ready as chinook helicopters dropped supplies from a rope. Hudson picked up the clown suit from the care package. They all walked inside the tent as the helicopters flew away.           An hour later...       The acts were very good. Everybody clapped and cheered. Then hudson's act started. Hudson didn't show up. The crowd grew silent. Dead silence filled the Tent. Hudson was on his computer. But the time was fast on his computer. The crowd, booing, yelling and waiting for hudson's act was angry. Hudson then remembered he forgot to change the time! It wasn't 5:00, it was 6:00! Hudson then ran for the door to the stage. The clown was rushing to the acting grounds. But the crowds were throwing Tomatoes!  It was like a battlefield out there. The poor clowns had tomatoe splatters all over their expensive suits! Then, the lion cage opened and the scary lions ran wild! It was a disaster! The clowns Ran to the dressing room and yelled at hudson. The clowns then grabbed throwing pies and headed for the stage. But the crowd was gone. Just gone. They had left! But there were still two people. He said he wanted to see an act. So now was their time. They got ready. They put Woods in a container and hudson got a saw. He cut the box. Woods was seperated! The two people liked the act and asked if they could do a few more tricks. They said yes.           The next month...       The circus called 'Pieday' was a hit! They were famous!  All the people wanted to win front row seats to see them. They were going to Russia To perform next. They all loaded up in the helicopter as they took off. They were gonna be a great group! The chinook landed in russia and everybody liked them! This was very good! People of all over the world cheered and clapped for pieday circus group. And one day Woods the clown got called to go to a famous child's birthday! This was great! Woods was a tightrope walker. Hudson was a clown, an acrobat and a great juggler. He could perform multiple things. Thousands of circus Chinooks flooded the skies on the day of the birthday. Trucks that were red carried supplies on the streets. This was a big thing. The mansion was about 36 floors high. THAT'S BIG. Once there the clowns got all the supplies and the whole day went well. Pieday was the most famous circus in the world.

I could here birds chirping outside and my mom cooking breakfast downstairs. I had been anticipating this day for months now. I couldn't wait to go to the circus.       I lived far out in a small country town and the circus hadn't come in a long time. My family had a farm and we had many animals but my favorites were horses. My mom once said to our neighbor that I had a real gift with the horses. I knew every thing about them. I had once heard that the circus that was coming had the most amazing horses in the world.       Later at the circus we bought our tickets and walked in. The tent was ginormous! It was red and white striped and seemed to go on forever. We quickly took our seats and waited for the show to start. Suddenly a man in stilts walked onto the stage and started speaking in a  low voice.' I am sorry but our opening act, the horses, has been canceled due to our sick horse master'       I was filled with disappointment and wanted to cry. I could see the horses back in the other room stamping impatiently and wondering where their master was. Suddenly the man on the stilts seemed to remember that this was not in a big city and that most people would own farms and know how to command a horse.  So the man said,  'Although, if anyone knows how to work with a horse we could have them train for a day and you could come back tomorrow.' No one was very happy about the fact that they would have to come back tomorrow, not even the performers. They knew it would set back the scheduling for the tour. But they didn't want to disappoint anyone who had paid to see their show.       I wasn't even listening to the announcer because I was too sad and lost in thought. But my mom suddenly stood up and said, 'My daughter has a wonderful talent with horses, she could do it!' Every one started laughing. The thought of a little girl tending the horses in a circus was just absurd. Despite all the laughter, no one else volunteered. I was going to work in the circus with one of the most amazing horses in the world! I was so excited.       Later that afternoon, I started to work with the horses. It was very easy in the beginning but then I learned how to orchestrate much more complex tricks with the horses. I learned that I wouldn't actually be on the horse but that I would just be giving the horses commands.       The next day at the show, I got very nervous. Although I had been training non-stop yesterday I still had butterflies in my stomach. Before I knew it, I was walking onstage with the magnificent white horses. The lights started to dim and it seemed like all eyes were on me. I started my first trick. The show was simple at first but throughout my act the tricks got harder and harder. Finally I was finished. I turned and took a bow. I thought I saw out of the corner of my eye the horses bow their long graceful necks too. Everyone started applauding. I was filled with energy and happiness. That was the day I saved the circus.

She can balance on a balance beam and even and straight with books on her head (I think that is only a plus though).Katleen is someone that can really be the best at anything.           One day she was walking in the park with three other friends that were dear to her heart.They stopped by a refreshments stand to get some ice cold water when there it was.The poster for the  new opening in the Cirque Du Soleil.They had heard about it on the news but didn't know they could have a chance.All three girls tore a slip off with the information on it.Katleen really wanted this job as a kid she was always watching the circus with her mom and dad but today she has a shot at being in the circus and having kids watching her perform.She was so excited but then she read that each entry needs to have a opposite gender partner to be able to try out.She automatically thought of her friend Devin.He was her best friend and they would be a perfect pair.Devin was also her crush.She really thought that he was cute but everyone thought she was silly.Right then and there she pulled out her phone and called Devin.He picked up in excitement. He said, 'You'll never guess what!I just found a sign up sheet for the Cirque Du Soliel today when i was in the park walking Sally.Do you wanna be my partner.' 'Yes Devin I'll be your partner.That's exactly what I wanted to ask you too so i guess you beat me to it.' said Katleen in a happy voice.The two met up in the park and started to practice right away doing back flips,side aerials,and cartwheels.They looked lovely together let's just hope they can pull it off in three days or all that work is just trash.        Three days passed and today is the day.Devin and Katleen both met up in the parking lot of the try outs and walked in together as a pair.The two went to the bathrooms and got on their leotards and Katleen got on her tutu.They came back out and got someone to go and take a picture of them in their outfits so that they remember this day forever.About an hour later the pair was called up to get onto the ladder to get on the  rope for acrobats.They both were very nervous.They stepped out on the stage and the music started.Their piece was titled 'Butterfly'They got back down the ladder and hugged each other to death.They really did do their best and they both knew it.They were the tenth to last couple to perform.After the end the judge called out  the top three.'Kevin and Destiny in third place.Niall and Hailee in second place.Finally Katleen and Devin in first place.'The couple jumped up and started screaming at once that means that they won the competition.        Devin and Katleen both woke up extra early the next Monday to get ready to get on the bus to go to the circus. When they got there everyone was so welcoming to them. They fit straight in with the crowd everyone accepted that they were the new people to their team.When Devin and Katleen got there they ran their routine with all the other people in the circus.Katleen thought that it would be all fun and games until she actually got there    and experienced what it was like to be in the circus.Devin wasn't getting off at the right foot.Everyone loved and hated him for all the wrong reasons.His father was the person that was going to stop the circus from performing.One clown said that her was told that  he  was banished from the earth along with his descendents.Devin was hurt that they thought that he was going to stop them and ruin their chances of being the best.Katleen was sad for Devin.He had always had this problem since people knew who his dad was.         That night Devin wrote to his mom and said he was thinking of leaving the circus forever.When Katleen heard of this she was disappointed that he didn't want to go through with his promise to never leave her alone.Secretly Katleen wanted him to leave so she can stop worrying about their friendship. She told Devin how she felt and the next day he was gone.'What did I do?!' thought Katleen when she read the letter.Her new partner was a guy named Niall.He was at the competition.He said that he loved her performance in the competition.        Katleen finally got over Devin and just in time because her show was in three days.She and Niall looked awesome together.He loved to be an acrobat with her.She started to practice in her hotel room just so she would be perfect.She didn't even go to her own party because she was practicing.She never wanted to miss over twelve minutes of practice time.This time was very important to her.She was determined to show everyone how graceful she can be. But like every good circus performer she started to miss home.She miss her family and her dog Pepper.She could stand being away for so long.One day she decided that she wanted to leave and get a better job then being in the circus.Niall finally talked her out of it and made her think if she really wanted to sacrifice something so precise to just o she can get a better job.He said,'I understand how you feel.I felt like that when i came to be with you but as you can see I'm as fine as fine can be I'm even better.' Niall did have a point  thought Katleen.I can't away something that I've worked very hard for to go to waste.She decided to buckle down and get focused on what she wanted to do and why she wanted to do it.         Katleen knew that her dad and mom would not approve for her to not get focused and be ready for something as big as this.The big day came the day she wanted to come all her life is finally here.The circus came and now she wanted it to be the very most special day of her career.They didn't think that Niall could perform because he was getting really sick.They were sxcared.So Kateen had to work with an unexperienced guy by the name of Gaert.He was handsome but his acrobatic skills sucked.He never knew which way to turn her but it pulled off and lolooked so unique and special that they had to love him.He brought a good experience to the show it was unique and special in a way that was also very funny.The  Cirque Du Soliel did pretty good thanks to Katleen and her strong courage.

One cool thing is that you get to proform with people from all over the world. Another cool thing is you get to around the country. One realy cool thing is that you get to live with all sorts of cool people.       But being a circus proformer dose have its ups and downs. One down side is you have to practice all day. Another down side is you have to clean up after the animals in youre show. One really bad down side is if you get hurt during your act you could be put in a hospital.       Its not all games but its still fun to be in a cricus. One up side is durring the show you get the admeration of the entire croud. Another up side is evetually you get at least a little bit famos. The best part is you get to see places like washintonDC.       Their are some ups and downs and some things have a nutral feeling to them. One thing that has anutal feeling to me is horse bace rideing. One ofthe very best part is you dont have to pay to get in. You can get free food at the stands.       Once youre finised with your act you can mess around with the animals. After youre finised with youre act you can watch the rest of the show. Their are alot of things to do in a cicus like acrobatics and jugleing. So in con conlushonthir are some up s and downs to liveing in a cricus but its still fun.

SOME people ask at circus'es'' if there is coaster's '' well sometimes because more circuse's need coaster's.ANIMAL'S they are the most talented they could  spin around they could jump over flameing ring's wow.USSAULY there's not alot of circuse's around because they come once a year.there is magic show's and much more       A circus is fun to kid's but sometimes kid's get scared of clown's.ANYWAYS i hope you like the circus have a good day.

You have to have a specific talent at something.For example if i was good at playing basketball then maybe i would join the NBA.     You must also be detirmined (work hard) to what your good at. So like I said if I was good at basketball then I would have to be detirmined and work hard at it practice practice practice...     You also would have to have the right body type. For example if you fat and your talent is being a basketball player then being fat is holding you back. You must stay fit for your talent. For example if im good a football then you should make sure you got everything down like homework and chores so that you can do your talent so your parents will let you.     So if you are all of theese things then join the circus. You would make a great performer, but remember to follow all theese things dont just do it for one time and then slack off 'NO' you must work hard throughout your carrer. If you do you would make a great employee(worker)...

The afro is usally rainbow          The clowns also do funny things like get into small cars and put pies in face. sometimes they honk the other clowns nose.

Then when he was old enough, he went to find a circus,and he found one! He went inside, there were clowns juggling pies and riding unicycles, acrobats on the high-wire everything was there to see! Jo went inside and asked to be a clown and the owner said 'Yes'. Jo was in the circus! he dressed up as a clown and went inside, and there was more things inside then outside! There were people grooming the elephants and horses, and acrobats jumping from horse to horse when they were moving! Jo's act was to  juggle with pies and jump on the trampoline! After the circus they all got paid and went home. Jo went home and fell asleep.       The next day was the same but they were going to Italy! So, every body went home and packed their things and came back in a few minutes, with things, but some people lived in Italy, most of them lived in Italy. Jo and the others went to the plane and went of to Italy! it took a day to get there because they missed a flight, but they got to Italy the next day. everybody was exited to do the circus with new people! But every body was hungry after the trip, so everybody went into the pie-car and had breakfast. then the people who lived in Italy went to there house and went to get there things.       Jo was amassed at what he saw in Italy! he saw different food and different cars. he bought a few different things and he looked at the museum paintings, then it was time to go back to the plane and go to China to perform they went to the plane station, but they missed there flight! it wasn't supposed to come back in a month! they went by car and went to China, but then they found another plane station and then went inside and was just in time to get there plane flight! the plane had to stop for fuel. then they went to China!       Jo and everybody else could see China! They landed at an airport and got out, they went to the grassy area and seted up the circus tent and they started the circus and so many people came! Jo had to sleep and ride a unicycle around the tent! So they did the act and then they went inside a SUV and went to sleep. the next morning and went to the plane station to get a ride to Seadle! They were just in time to catch the flight to Seadle!       They made it to Seadle and they put up the tent and they went to the piecar to eat. Jo was going to the tent to say 'Can I get paid?' The owner said 'Yes'. Jo got paid and he was going to take a break from the circus and go home. Jo said 'Goodbye everyone!' They said 'Goodbye Jo!' and he bought a car and went home. Jo said 'Im going back to the circus to be with my friend's'.

You need to make sure that you are ready enough so you do not mess up. Even if they work at the circus they still have to go to school in order to learn. Their life is much different from ours but they still sleep eat breath they are still human beings. Circus performers have a hard life as i said they eat they dont have a dinner table exactly they eat in the pie car. To answer yur question no its not filled with pies. (trust me I thought the same thing). They cant eat alot because they have a show right after they eat. After their performes they get two days then they are off to another town.                          In the circus the performe alot of different things. It kinda matters who you are on what you do during the performess. Well we are going to take about the tightrope walker. His job is to practice walking on a rope up really high in the air. If that was me i would probly faint. He must really have to work hard so he doesnt fall or mess up. His job as a tightrope walker is very danerous but it does might people show up to watch. That sure can give him a nice pay check for sure.

She bought us backstage passes so we could see all of the animals and performers. I've never been to a circus before but they sound like lots of fun. My dad would have come but he's sick so we sold his ticket, but I still have to tell him what happened.                         It's 6:00 time to go to the circus it started at 6:30 ,but we went early to see the performers getting ready to perform it was really fun watching them get ready because we got to see the animals do a bunch of tricks like a tiger roll over and sit down all on command. Once they were done more people started to show up that's when I realized that wasn't the real show and that was just practice.                        When the real show started I was really excited because the first thing you could see on the stage was a man and a woman swinging through the air doing flips and catching each other in mid air.then under them were two clowns riding on the backs of two enormous elephants. Then a man on stilts walked right through the space in-between both elephants then a man riding horseback did a cartwheel on the horses back while the horse was running. Then all of the performers went backstage then the stage was empty, but that wasn't the end even though I thought it was it wasn't because a man with a lion came out and then another man with a tiger then they both started jumping through hoops and sitting and rolling over then they left too it was over.                         Then we went backstage and met all of the performers even though most of them didn't speak English it was still fun i even got to feed and pet a lion. When my mom told me we had to go I didn't want to, but I knew we had to get home before it got to late so I left. When we got home I told my dad everything we did then went to bed so I could dream about it.

When he arrived men and woman fled inside the tent so did the young boy. Inside his eyes lit up, a circus! 'ooss' and 'aaghs.' Filled the whole tent, as a man walked across a tightrope while balancing an umbrella on his nose.  After hordes of performances it began to get dark. The boy began to run home. Just then he ran into a big muscular man with narrow eyes and a rather large mustache. He picked up the boy and with a gruff voice said 'Watt'ar-ya doin' ramm'n intu' peoples like d'at?' He dropped the boy and the man paced off. On the long walk home he could still hear the croud cheering.

I really hoped it was not somebody from an important act, or anybody.  Everyone in the circus is like a family to me and I would really hate to see them go away.  I ran like the wind over to the tent, my feet were a blur.                 I am the fastest runner in the circus that is why I do my special act.  I practice everyday to perfect my skills.  My act is I run as fast as I can and then jump onto a swing and do a flip over the fulcrum.  I love seeing the kids faces once I finish because over my experience as a kid I know that kids love fast runners, and people who do flips.  They LOVE seeing someone go head over heels.  I think I have the best act in the circus because I please the kids.  Also I love doing my job.  I love to run and do flips.  Every performer feels that way about their act because they love to do it.  You are not a true performer if you do not like to do what you do.                I sped past the animal stalls and my horse named bullzeye, named after my lacrosse stick that I will never forget, whinnied and I replied 'Not now bullzeye I have to get to this accident.  Here have an apple.'  I grabbed an apple from my backpack and threw it to him quickly.  Something else fell out of my pocket and hit my ankle but I kept running.  Bullzeye is my partner in 2 acts : jumping on a trampoline then doing a flip and jumping on a trampoline then landing on him.  The second one takes a lot of balance and concentration.                I burst into the tent and saw a small crowd huddled around someone.  I ran over to him and asked what happened.  He replied 'I was on my unicycle and then I fell and hit the rack of knives.  It was the clown.  My best friend, he was like a father to me.                I, Bill Gasten, am 23 and just graduated college.  People call me Billy.  My parents worked here until a fatal car accident during the off-season when I was 6.  Instead of going to an orphanage I insisted on staying with the circus.  I really wanted to stay and travel the world and meet new people.  Right now we are in Japan.  The clown, Ron Smith, acted as a father to me.  He is in his later years and had no kids or wife.  I really hoped he was not a goner, he was all I had.             A bunch more people came to look.  'Ha-ha, I got you good' Ron said.  Nobody laughed.  'Ron its not funny, you really scared us.' the manager said.  'Yeah' I added 'Its not funny'.   'All right everybody go back to work, the red stuff on the floor is ketchup mixed with water and red food coloring.' Ron said.  'What, Ron?  Tonight is hot dog night and you know I need a lot of ketchup on my hot dog.'  I said.  He must have stolen it from the pie car I thought.  'Actually, I found this over here' Ron said as if reading my mind.  Everybody walked away. The manager shook his head in disgust as he stormed into his office mad that he had to be interrupted reading his emails.             I went back to practice and had a regular day.                   'C'mon fast get everything ready, Billy' someone yelled at me.  I could not find my special safety hook for tonights performance.  Somehow it had fell out of my pocket.  It was hand made for me when I was young and it had my parents names on it with mine.  I needed it. I just could not remember where I had put it.  I had it in my pocket before school but it is nowhere to be seen now.  I had searched everywhere - even in the bathroom and I could not find it.  Good thing I only needed the hook for the last act that I had so maybe I could find it on the stage during one of my other acts.   'And now, we have our very own... Billy Gasten!' I heard being announced.  I got my things and hurried out onto the stage.                 The crowd roared and I waved to everyone.  Then the music started to play.  I waited for my cue.  Bullzeye charged out of the curtains and towards me.  I pretended to be scared and this was not supposed to happen and once bullzeye got close enough I jumped up and onto his back the did a front flip off.  We had practiced this many times and the crowd loved it.  I pretended to wipe sweat off my forehead just exaggerating a lot and actually I did wipe some sweat off my forehead.  Bullzeye turned and charged again.  This time he jumped up and I slid under him.  I noticed a glint in his teeth.  Wow I though, the dentists have been doing a good job.  We did that a few times until the music ended.                 Then the curtains closed and I hurried to find the hook.  I ran out and looked again.  I went over to the stalls first because I had been there for a while today after practice.  I found an imprint of the hook in the grass by bullzeye's stall.  Somebody had picked it up, but who?  The I realized that was what had hit my ankle when I ran to Ron.               I checked my watch and it read 7:03.  Time for my second act because it took about 5 minutes for the stage crew to clean up.              I hurried back to the tent and got to the stage in my position.  Bullzeye and I did our act.  Again I noticed a glint in bullzeye's teeth, but I thought it was only the golden tooth in the back of bullzeye's mouth.   After I realized that it was hopeless, I would never get the hook in time unless there was a miracle.                Time for the hook act.  I waited 5 minutes and then when I was about to go out when bullzeye nudged me.  I turned and said 'Not now, bullzeye'.  I turned back and started out the door but bullzeye kicked me lightly with his foot.  I turned back and looked at bullzeye in an annoyed way. 'Not now bullzeye, I am not in a good mood.' I said in an angry tone.  Bullzeye spit something from its mouth.  I looked down at the gooey thing on the ground.  I gasped.  'Thank you bullzeye, you are the best' I said happily.  I picked the object up and wiped the saliva off.  'To Billy' it read 'From mom and dad'.  The metal with wood reflected all the fun moments I had with my parents.  I ran out onto the stage ready to do anything.                  When the crowd quieted down I announced 'Everybody, there will be one change in the show tonight.  Give us 5 minutes and we will be ready again.  I walked back and pulled the curtains shut.  I called to the stage crew and told them specific orders.  'Get the swing fulcrum raised 20 feet without changing the length of the rope and put the trampoline near it.  Get this done in five minutes.'  Nobody objected and they all hurried off to get the tools required.                                   Life for a circus man is always challenging.                                   I went over to bullzeye.  'All right bud, we are changing the plans.' I said aloud and whispered the rest to him so it would be a suprize for everybody.   I placed something on his neck and left.  I gathered everyone up next 'Everybody there has been a change of plans.  You might want to go out to the bleachers and watch this.'  I informed.  Everyone did as told.  I stretched my body out to get ready.                    Bullzeye came over to me and we walked onto the stage.  Everything was in place.  The curtains opened, the music started to play.  I hopped on bullzeye and we set off.  You know how I said I was the fastest in the company, well, correction, Bullzeye is the fastest in the company.  We ran like the wind to the trampoline and as we got 5 feet away I yelled 'JUMP!'  Bullzeye jumped and landed perfectly in the center of the trampoline.  We flew diagonally upwards and I closed my eyes and thought.                   Why did I use bullzeye, if we fall we both die.  Bullzeye does not deserve to die.  I said firmly to myself.  Then I thought back.  I remember the time bullzeye was born and my parents said he could be mine.  I remember the dinner before my parents drove away to a place I am not going to now.                  I opened my eyes and looked into the crowd and saw everybody watch in amazement.  I was born to amaze.  And bullzeye was born to amaze,                                                        and be on target.                       Click.                       The hook got on the swing.                      The crowd roared.

There in a house a man hurrying up to drive to the market says to himself 'Alright lets see I need milk, eggs, and a new horn.' His name is Tom Hiller. Tom is an unmarried man who works at a circus and is a clown. As Tom was in the market he met a freind who also worked with him. They met and were saying 'Hi' to each other.Tom was finally leaving and the day was turning to night. So Tom was getting ready for the circus.                                               Tom was putting on the white make-up and some red lipstick around and on his lips. Tom was getting used to the idea of wearing this stuff on at first he felt like a woman with a white face. As he was driving to the circus he stopped for lunch then he got back to driving. He saw a place with a huge tent with the colors of red and white. He put on his suit and got ready to work.                                                    Tom was riding a tiger and a small unicycle. After that Tom went home and took off everything on his face. Tom was tired and said to himself ' Oh boy it's been a tiring  day!' Then he went to sleep in his blankets and slept. He dreamed about how fun and hard it is working at the circus.

Becoming a Circus Performer              To become a  good circus performer  you need to know somethings about circus stuff because once you become a circus performer you will be a professional at circus things. First you need to practice doing flips and  perfect cart wheels. Then you are going to have to work very hard to do a good job. I think we should practice at least seven times a day for a month then once you get good at it you could practice juggling in the air on a unicycle.                         Another step that will help you be a good circus performer is making a schedule . That could really help you find the right time for practicing. You will have to practice training circus horses. You will have to practice being funny because when u are a circus performer u could choice through out a circus clown , circus acrobats, circus juggler,or circus tightrope walker.                          The job that I would choose is circus acrobats. I would do that job because I love doing flips. Also because I am very flexible. Being a circus performer is a very important job. Unless you are not into it, you should not try this job out. If you really love circus then i suggest  you try your best.                    Not just anyone can go and join the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. A rule you should know about being a circus performer is that you can't just join the circus because you need money you could join the circus for many different  reasons. One reason is that you like animals a lot and u want to become the person who tames the lion. Or maybe you like riding unicycles while juggling.                      If you want to become an awesome circus performer you will need to study a lot  and practice. You will need to have a typical day to spare time.You're going to have to ask permission to your parents.I think a good book that will help you is 'Life's a Circus by Kerrily Sapet. That is a good book because it tells you how life at a circus is like.It tells you that anyone who thinks circus life is nonstop play, is crazy.  She had a typical day everyday. Another book is 'Becoming a Circus Performer' that book is good because it tells  you how to become a circus performer. Also if you really want to be a circus performer you should never give up.               	.

Second you need to know how to be funny and fun. third you have a long day practicing and going to school. Then you have to get a lot of rest before a show and do not eat a lot cause you might get your stomach to hurt.        First what you have to do is eat breakfast, then you have to go to school. after that you get out of school, next you have to do chores and practice after that you have to go eat dinner and then go to the show, next you come back from the show all tired and want to relax, then you have to go to sleep for the next show.        You have 10 shows a week. You have to figure out how to do amazing things and get them right. you might need to eat first than everything else and don't eat so much then you might throw up.        Its probably tiring doing all of though shows but you might get used to it and might want to do a lot of shows so don't get down on yourself you might feel homesick just don't think about it. Might miss people but you will see them one day. there's different languages like French, Russian, Italian and even more.        You go all around the world to different states different cities every 7 months they traveled 20,000 miles that a lot they visit up to 150 cities each year you work from sun up to sun down.        There's different types of stuff in the circus like acrobat and trapeze and joining the circus you can go all around the circus.

As hope boarded the circus train she was greeted by clowns and animal trainers.She walked through the train carts.At last she had reached the acrobats cart.Hope was surprised to see people hanging of the roof and beds.'Hello!' everyone had shouted.She was smiling with joy as she found her bunk.She was bunking with a acrobat from Russia.The Russian girl was 10,only a year older than Hope.'Hi I'm Hope' a silent moment paused between the two girls.'Hi I'm Rachel, I am guessing your the new acrobat?'. Hope nodded her head right then she knew they would be best friends.       The next morning Hope woke up with the rest of the acrobats, at 6:30 A.M.Training started today.Rachel and Hope had been put to work on rope acts.Hope watched Rachel dance between the ropes,back and forth.It was as if Rachel was a professional with the ropes.When Hope got on the ropes, she wasn't to bad for a rookie.Time had flown through the day as Rachel and Hope worked on the ropes.'I like you,your my new best friend,' Rachel had said with a bright smile to Hope.       A few weeks later it had been opening night.It was Hope's first night.Rachel and her watched as the other performers did there act perfectly.All the animals did their act and obeyed their masters/trainers.To Hope the most beautiful act was the horses.They danced and pranced around the ring,coats shining bright in the circus lights.Finally, Hope and Rachel had heard their names being called for their act.'This is it!' yelled Rachel over the noise of the crowd.'Uh i don't know if i can do this' Hope shakes as she says this.They slowly walked towards their acting spot.'The ropes,the ropes' Hope said in her mind.'I can do this!!!' shouted Hope over the noise of the crowd and the animals.As Rachel and Hope got on the ropes the crowd went silent.Each grabbed a rope and the gliding above the crowd went smooth as possible.The crowd yelled and shouted their names.       Once they got back to their bunks everyone congratulated them 'Way to go!' 'Nice job!' 'Hope you guys do that again' all of theses comments came from professionals.'Don't worry we will be doing that again soon' yelled Rachel and Hope from their bunks.'I can't wait for tomorrow' said Hope as she yawned.'Same, good night Hope' 'Good night Rachel'.They both turned on their sides and fell asleep as silence fell over the other bunks in the carts.And that is the wonderful story of Hope and Rachel,her new best friend.

Although their soppose to to sleep 8 hours of sleep and they only get about 6 hours of sleep.                Her life every day. The first thing that she does in the morning is get dress up, , and go to car pie for pancakes  and bacon. the other people are getting ready fo the show tonight. After breakfast she goes to school there she learns alot of stuff .   Then she does some chores after school like feed, water, and  groom the horses . The horses that they use for the show.                     People dream of being in the circus an running away from home.But its not just anyone can go and join  the circus  and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. We need to have a specific  talent , the  right body  type  and be  very determined . Like Philippa who also   trained in rhythmic gymnastics for years. Philippa has worked all over  the planet, including Australia, Japan, and all over North America.

The crowd shrieks at the horse. John the man who is scaring the horse with a fake gun laughs. Its my turn to go in and tell john to stop that. I'm supposed to be his older sister.        I shake my finger at him because we aren't aloud to talk in a circus. He puts his head down like a little boy who couldn't go to his friends house. Then he shakes his head and lets the horse be.  I do a back flip to the horse and the crowd cheers. I pet the horse then we skip off behind the curtains. We have to move very fast.        Soon enough were all out in front of the crowd and holding hands and bowing. Huge smiles are on our faces even though we are extremely tired. Then we skip back behind the curtains and take off all our make up and take our hair out of the amazing design it had.        My hair is a reddish brownish color. People say it is beautiful. I think it is too. I'm only 12 years old and I'm in the circus. My parents travel with me, other wise I'll get a little home sick if there not with me.        I slip on my pajamas and have a bed time snack. An apple. I love apples very much. We can only have healthy snacks so I pick apples. They rock.  I have to get a good nights rest for tomorrow. I have a big day coming up on my heels.

Your life can be at steak when you are doing stuff that they do. it takes alot of practise to do it but you need a talient first.   2.  Some People are good at juggleing, running, fliping. All kinds of stuff. But you can get hurt in circuses, lets say you are doing acrobats and you loose grip and fall down to the ground and hurt yourself. What if your juggling swords and you miss you and it hurts yourself REALLY bad. You need practise befor you do it for real.       3.  They might ask you what you are good at ''well im good at tightrope walkering'' or '' I can juggle really well'' they might just test you on that. They want to know if you really can do stuff like this.       4.  When you make it on the team, you are gonna have to dress up. It may be a suit, a dress, a too too. you might get a hat, some fancy shoes, maybe some makeup if your a clown, or a wig. You might wear a tie too. They just want you too look fancy when performing.       5.  When you see the people you can get scared, like ''what if I mess up'' maybe ''what if they dont like it and I get fired'' they is always that possibility. You are just parying that you can do it and then ''NEXT UP THEEEEEEE ACROBATS!!'' and they are cheering, you take a deep breathe and you go do it.           6.  Suddenly, You actualy did it and you go back stage and your smileing and your so happy and your glad the children and adualts got to see you and its just a great feeling.       7.  The boss comes too see everyone and the thank you for doing the concert and you may get payed. But when you think about it, you just did a flip, you juggled swords, you walked on a tightrope, you can do it! and you just cant wait for the next concert and you can believe in yourself, all you have to do is believe in yourself, and just pray. And you did it again, when your done doing your job and you have to retire its just a sad feeling. It had been 28 years of your job and you leave it, its just very sad. But it was very fun to actualy be in the circus and have fun. But people will still come to get a job in the circus and the children will come, and the adualts too! and it is very fun!

You need to have a specific talent, the right body type and be very determined. Philippas road to circus stardom started when she was 5 years old. I did musical theater and ballet and all kinds of music, singing, acting and everything to hone my craft, says Philippa, who also trained in rhythmic gymnastics for years. When I was 11, I knew I wanted to be a peformer, so I went for it. I gave up everything else and concentrated on my dancing and performing. There are so many people out there who want to do what you do, that yoy have to go for it. You have to put your heart into it and be certain that thats what you want to do.

I bet you think that being in a circus means that you can have fun all the time. Well, if you thought that you are wrong. I have to work hard every day practicing skills. I'm always busy.                                                 I go to school with all the other kids in the circus. We only have one classroom, but I'm okay with that. Some of the kids speak  different languages, so I know four languages. I know how to speak French, German, Spanish, and English. After school I have to groom.                                                                                                                                         I have to groom the horses for tonight's big show. I also have to groom a elephant! It is the smallest elephant in the world. Her name is Tiny. It's time to start practicing.                  I am watching my sister, Ella, fly through the air. She is a trapeze artist. It is my turn to practice. I am working with Tiny. I do handstands while she is walking I can hold a handstand for two minutes without falling! I did it perfectly. Yay! Now I'm watching my dad. He's a tightrope walker. He walks on a rope fifty feet in the air. He is so good. Now it's my mom's turn to practice then the show will start. My mom is a circus acrobat. She is so flexible it is unbelievable. We also have a human pretzel and a dancing bear! It took years to train him.                                                                                                                        There is only five minutes until the show starts and I'm getting butterflies. I peek out to see the crowd and I faint. When I wake up I see mom.                                                            'Mom is the show over?'                                                                                                    'No, you woke up just in time to do your act.' I almost scream. I ran to get ready. Then I realized that I was already ready. I got Tiny and walked out to the stage.                        'Ladies and gentlemen for your next act we have Harper Waldo.' I heard the announcer say. I got on Tiny's back and did a handstand for two minutes then I picked up one hand and held it for another two minutes! Then all of the sudden I was swinging through the air with Ella.                                                                                                             After the show we went out side and everyone wanted my autograph. I was so shocked that I said 'Me.' Then the fans said 'Ya, you were awesome.' So I had to sign two hundred pictures.                                                                                                                   So my family went to our trailer and the gave me a huge bear hug.                                     'We're so proud of you.'they all said at once.           'Thank you.

To find out some of the ins and outs of becoming a circus performer, Kidzworld spoke with Philippa hayball, an acrobat and dancer with cirque du soleil's circus show,Quidam.       Not just anyone can go and join the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist . you need to have a specific talent ,the right body type and be very determined.   Philippa's road to circus stardom started when she was five years old.I did musical theatre and ballet and all kinds of music,singing,acting and everything to hone my craft who also trained in rhythmic gymnastics for years. when i was 11,i knew i wanted to be a performer,so i went for it. i gave up everthing else and concentrated on my dancing and performing. there are so many people out there who want to do what you do, that you have to go for it. you have to put your heart into it and be certain that what you want to do.       you want to enter the contest but realize that you know something about the circuc! you decide to do some research to gather information that will help you write your story. While doing your reasearch,you have found two articles and some photographs.       after you have looked at these sources, you will answer some questions about them. briefly scan the source  annd the three questions that follow. then go back and read the sources carefully so you will need to answer the questions and write a story.       you will now look at several sources. you will go back to any of  the sources as often as you like                                                                         	NNP POS DT NNP NNP WP VBZ DT NN NN VBZ JJ NN VBZ NNP NN NN DT IN DT JJ VBN IN VBG RB IN NN CC VBG DT NN .

Life as a circus performer can be both hard and fun at the same time. In the mornings I have to wake up early to get dressed and eat breakfast. Then after that I have to start practicing for the night's show. It's not easy for me to do the tricks though. I have to have balance, concentration, and skill. This hard work is very rewarding when the crowd goes wild when I perform my tricks.        The good parts of being a circus performer is great. You get to travel all over the world for circus performances and you can meet new people. To me the best part of all is when you astound the crowd. When you are break you can explore the place that you are at, learn the people who lives there's cultures, and try new food.        The bad part of being a circus performer is when you have to work super hard to perform at performances and basically there are performances at least once everyday from Monday to Sunday. You also have to be far away from your family for a long time. You can't call your family too because you don't have anywhere to call.

I want to be apart of circus more than before. Let me tell you why.              If I could be appart of the circus, I'd be a stunt devil. It seems to be the most fun. And it fits me best. Only thing that gets me is that I have to do that every single night. With practices thats almost all day. Thiis is is what I'd do if I became a circus preformer.               I get to meet all of these people. That would be awsome. If I could say that my job is to get to go to all different places all around the world, that would be AWSOME. Not many people get the opportunity to say that. It would good for me and you to get that pobblisity. It's a win-win.               But there is always a down in a up. I wish we could see our families more often. That would be nice. Maybe we could select a location to visit. Show our parents what we have become. You should think about this.               There is still a few more things I would like to know. Like about the pie cart. Do they serve pie? Mmmm, pie. Especcily pumpkin with whip cream. and there is much more but this letter would go on forever. So I'll just wrap it up with... This is why I want to join the circus.

As I was speaking a sudden voice appears,it was the annouuncer, as he spoke 'Ladies and Gentlemen clap your hands together for the amazing Panther!' the crowd raised up their voice and started cheering.I wonder who was under that costume,I guess well never know.When the show was done I went to the back of the stage and I ask the guy in the costume 'How do you do all thoughs tricks?' he said in a deep voice 'Its not about the tricks, its about you believing yourself.'That was the day I would never forget.After that I tried to do the simple tricks that he did.The next the circus was open again and the same guy was their too.I asked him a lot of questions again, he said 'Although I am very skilled, its difficult being out their with a crowd watching you.'           That time I knew I had to try my best to become a circus performer too.I tried and I tried when I finally got used to doing tricks.That was when I knew how difficult it was to be an performer.When I showed my family the tricks I learned, I also experienced how difficult it is when a crowd is watching you.Ill never forget the time when I did my first trick in front of my family.

And you can see very silly clowns. And you can see circus acrobats.And you can see circus horses. And Tightrope walkers.         Whats one of the cool things about being in a circus is that you get the chance to travle around the world. And you can meet many different people. Not just anyone can join the circus though. And it's more glamorious than being an acountant.And you have to be very determined.And that's what it's like to be in a circus.         Not just any one can join the circus . It takes alot of determination. Being in a circus isn't easy. You have to work long days that includes weekends.You have to concintrate and work hard.That's what  it's like to  be in a circus.

It isn't just nonstop play, in the circus you work from sunup to sundown. Busy right?        Lets see what a typical day looks like for Bella Castini: 7:00 Wake up, get dressed, go to the pie cart to eat, 9:00 school time, 3:00 school's over---time for a quick break, 3:30 chores and practice, 6:30 dinnertime,7:00 SHOWTIME 10:30 the show is over and finally I am in bed at 12:00.        There are some upsides of being a circus performers you know like you get to travel all over the world and you get to preform in front of a live audience every time you preform endless people are watching on a TV. I think the upsides are kind of cool.        In the circus there are some downsides too like circus performers work long and tiring days and they send ALONG TIME away from home (i think they get home sick a lot.)I don't think that sounds very fun.        But  before you get to do all this you need to know a few things, first: not just anyone can join the circus you need to have the right body type, second: have a specific talent for some it is Circus acrobats for others it is a juggler and for some it is tightrope walking        Some of the words I used you might not under stand like:   pie car: where circus performers,   unicycle: a bike with only one wheel,   groom: clean and brush,   matinee: afternoon show, and   wiped out: very tired, those were circus terms so unless you want to be a circus performer or you are a circus performer you don't have to know those terms unless you want to.        So after all those ups, downs late nights early mornings if you still want to be a circus performer and you have the right body type and a spisific talent go ahead and try to become a circus performer just try it who knows it could be fun!!!!!

You may of heard all the stories of performences and the animals and all that jazz, yeah it's fun but hard.I mean you have to take care of the animals like feed,  them take care of there messes, get them ready for performences, and train them.         That animal stuff is probably the hardest but dont forget about traveling. We are constantly going somewhere. Like we'll have to go to another place for a performance then to sleep. It's crazy!          And all the times, are scheduals, there so annoying! We just have to be somewhere at a certain time or else were in trouble. So were constantly being rushed. Like for example, if were not intime for showtime, watch out! It's coming.          That's what I mean. Life in the circus is fun but very hard. 	NNP VBZ JJ IN DT NN .

He would leep from 1 spot to 10 feet in the air sometimes he would go higher. then one day he jumed so highwhen he landed he broke his ankle but the leader of the circus didnt want him to leave.        Then 4 years later his circus tured worse than ever . the lion practiced and practiced but cant jump higher then 10inches off the ground. So the leader said in 10years if leepo dosent jump higher then 10 feet. He is going to find some other trick but if he cant then there going to ship him to the wild          4 years later leepo can jump 4feet 4 years later leepo can jump 7 feet and 9 inches 2 years later 8 feet and 5 inches but leepo still tried but couldnt so they tried to teach leepo differant stuff but couldnt so they shipped him to the wild (africa) but he fought and fought but they put him in a box but still didnt stop him and he hit the box so hard he broke the box and he jump so high  that is higher then he had ever jumped so they brought him back and he did his trick.

She loved to see the circus clown make funny face and act funny in front of the people. Sariyah also liked to see the circus acrobats she enjoyed seeing them dance in the air holding on to ropes.                    One day Sariyah asked her mom if she could go to the circus with Amari,Vanessa, Jada, Kirsten, Sarai and Taylor. Her mother answered ''Ok'' . Mom do you think you can take us to the circus. Sariyah mom asked where will the circus be. Sariyah answered it would be in Los Angles.                                 The next day Sariyah give a call to each of her friend and said to pack there stuff because they were going to go too Los Angles. When they were done after school they are to leave  to the air port. They all got in the plan and were headed to Los Angles. When they got there all went to stay in a hotel. they were all tired. So each one at a time took a shower and went to sleep.                      They woke up the next morning and left to go to the circus. they final got there.They saw many clowns doing funny actions. Sariah knew that they were going to have a great day. They played games and won prizes. Then the went to see the circus tightrope, circus juggler, and the circus acrobats.                                                                       The all had great time and all got home.

And you have to get up everyday and get ready for your job and you train animale how to be nice and stuff or you just rain yourself how to do your magic stuff or unless you are a tightrope walker you would have to practice alot because you get hurt if you dont practice, but if your a clown you have to wake up really early and put your make up or paint on your face.       Its also about how you have to switch places at a curten time. Like at 3:30 ther are chores practice, or at 7:00 am you have to wake up and get dress up and stuff like that. When you have a circus job its going to be really hard for you, but if you think of it won't be that hard because you only have to go once if there is a circus coming out. The thing is being a circus person can be really fun for you because you can get to play with the animale and do cool magic tricks and stuff like that.       In the circus you need to have talent! You just cant join right away you have to have intressting things like if you were good at doing magic tricks or good at dancing and stuff like that i bet you can get the job. You have to have the right body type to join. Philippa Started to be a circus performer when she was 5 years old and i think thats pretty in pressing!

Everybody was going crazy! Some people wanted to see the elephants, some the clowns, and some the Trapeze artists. When we were lining up to get on the bus, i was thinking. This is my first time going to circus. It felt like forever getting there, but when we saw that big red tent when knew we were there.                  After we got our snacks we got our seats. I had probably about three slushies! So now i really had to go to the bathroom. So I went and asked my teacher , Mrs. Johnson, if i could go. I had to hurry because it was getting ready to start.                  When I was looking for a bathroom i got lost. I found a door that I thought led to the bathroom but then I saw all these bright lights! ' where am I? ' I asked my self. A huge elephant passed by me, then a clown! Then I knew where I was. Backstage where the performers stand before they go on stage! A tall man with a mustache came up to me and asked, 'why aren't you changed yet!! We go out in 5 minutes! ' He handedd me a colorful sparkly costume to wear. So i went back and changed and it fit! Did you know how fast circus people can do your makeup and hair. It's crazy! I looked in the mirror and said to myself, 'wow! I look good! '                   Then , I thought, Mrs.Johnson is probably looking for me! She doesn't know that im going to be in the circus. Now, im in big trouble.                     The 5 minutes went by and i was on the stage. People were screaming and those lights were really bright! I was looking for the class and Mrs.Johnson but couldn't find them. I had no idea what i was so supposed to do until i looked up and so people on these ropes doing tricks, hanging upside down. I thought, don't tell me I have to do that! Then that man with the mustache was telling me with his hands to go on that empty rope.                       Here we go. They pulled the rope higher and higher! It was like I was flying! I was doing flips, twirling all sorts of stuff. It was so exciting! Then our act was over. We waited until everybody was done then we went out and bowed. People were screaming as loud as they could! It felt great.                       After the bow I had to go change and find my class quick! I finally found them. I was going up the stairs to my seat and they were going down the stairs. Mrs.Johnson wasn't that mad. All my classmates were saying how good I was and how it was like to be in the circus.                       I never thought I would do it but I did. I was in the circus!

So i`m going to tell you about two clowns named Bob and Fred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One day there were two clowns that work for a circus. Their names were Bob and Fred.Well bob was the funniest of all the clowns that have lived. So they both were suppose to go to a circus in Alabama. Instead of going to Alabama like they were suppose to they went to Texas. In Texas they don`t like clowns as always these two little clowns never listened.'Yea-haw' said bob riding a cowboys horse.'You better give my horse back you ugly clown' said the old cowboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          'What did you just call me cowboy? Huh asked Bob. 'I said give me my horse you ugly clown'' said the cowboy.''ok you want your horse back well you are going to win it by boxing my friend Fred'' said Bob. It was one o`clock and the clowns were horsing around in Texas still not in Alabama were all the fans were waiting. ''Alright you want to play that game huh'' said the cowboy''Sure''said the cowboy ''Billy''called the cowboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Well like always they both were not even thinking about the circus in Alabama. They are too busy trying to win a horse by boxing a guy named Billy. This is going to be a fair match said the cowboy. Also no blood added Bob. ''Are you ready'' asked the cowboy to both of them and they both said''yes''. ''Let the game Begin said the cowboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wham! there came Fred from nowhere hit Billy right in the jaw(his tooth fell out). Whoops Billy swung and then he missed. Boom! Fred had hit Billy again this time in the gut. bam! Fred grabs Billy`s hand and uppercuts him in the jaw again. Don't you give up yet?''bob asked. ''no not yet'' said the cowboy. Ram! Fred  knee Billy in the side Billy falls,but he gets back up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Good thing about it is that they fought all the way to Alabama,but the bad thing was they were on stag boxing now. Bam! Fred kicked Billy in the jaw hit him in the jaw,and knee him in the jaw. Well the contest is that Billy and Fred have to box to get a horse.knockout by Fred! The two clowns have won a horse!'' Nice job Fred'' says Billy not hurt because they were not suppose to hurt each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Sometimes you can make a deal if you lose don`t get mad just say good job.Well that's the way the day went for the 2 clowns.Now Fred and Bob are enjoying there new horse.

I have to get up early in the morning and do lots of stuff such as going around the world almost everyday. My schedules are so not necessary. All I do every day is just go around the world and do crazy things that doesn't really matter in life. I'm in Europe getting ready to perform the most crazy and not necessary things and the only human beings the only likes it are mostly kids. The grownups just thinks that it is just fake things that we do and its not the exciting to them as its exciting to the kids them selves. So what i think is what the circus clowns should do is just retire and find a job at a fast food restaurant like McDonald's. People are so UN-grateful these days with entertainment and food. Sometimes I just think of myself as an old dumb,stupid circus clown that just belongs in the circus and needs to stay.   Today I have to walk on a tight rope and ride on a lion with fire on it.  I'm going on now I'll be right back. I'm back that was a show. I stand myself corrected because i seen a lot of adults excited and enjoying the show. So i guess its just some adults who just aren't into those circus things. When i was out there I had so much fun and I was happy that almost everyone was cheering for our circus. The tight rope was really hard but i concentrated and did the best i could do and i didn't fall. The lion was a wild one but i rode on it and i was scared because i thought the lion was going to try to eat me but the lion was tamed and it learned not to eat people.  Today at the circus was really good if the circus keeps going like this i would stay here until the day I die.  Im super tired of all the things we did its time for me to go to sleep. Good night.   Good morning. I just found out the i graduated from the circus and im going back to California. Im super happy. I think yesterday was meant to happen. Im super happy to be going home but imsad becasue im not being in the curcus anymore. I have to say goodbye to everybodty and thank them for all they did to help me be in this circus.   Im back home in Calfornia. I really miss getting up early in the morning and travling places. But im happy to be back home.

Bruse ate real fast so he could do his chores.        The first chore that Bruse did was groom the horses. Bruse loved grooming horses because he felt like he could talk to them. he loved talking to Browny the most. That was only because Browny was his.    After he groomed the horses he had to go to school. Bruse hated going to school because he only wanted to do circis things, but of coarse his moma made him go to school. The only time Bruse payed attintion was when they tougt them different langugas. The only langugas Bruse could speak are English, Spanish, and Russian.        After school Bruse played with his kitty Muffin. Muffin, loved when Bruse, would get a feather and a string. She loved it becuse she got to chase the feather all around. Finally Bruse had to go practice.        Bruse got Browny his brown horse and started practicing by making Browny run gallop and jump polls.        Elena and Dean wen't first. They were the acurbats.Twentyfive people wen't before Bruse.All of a sudden it was Bruses TURN. He got on Browny an made her run, gallop, and jump just like they did practicing.

He tried to get up but his ankle was throbbing with pain. When the other performers came by they just left him alone because they thought that he was kidding [because he is a clown] so krusty just layed there and waited for someone to help him.                       After 15 minuets of waiting krusty decided to try to crawl to his fellow performers to get help.When he finally got to where they should be they weren't there. krusty looked at the clock and realized that they had left to go on stage 5 minuets ago.                    Krusty new that it would be at least an hour before anyone came looking for him so he decided to go to sleep. What woke him up was that he herd a soft voice saying ' krusty wake up ' and when he woke up he was laying in his bed and one of the achrobatic girls were waking him up because he was missing breakfast at the pie car. krusty was about to hop up but  when he thought about his ankle he got up real slowly and when he pulled the cover off there was nothing wrong with it and it was at that moment that krusty realized that it was all a dream.

Today is the biggest show of all. Today is the worlds biggest circus show ever! Winter got up at five in the morning to get ready for the big show tonight. She got up went to the pie cart, had breakfeast, and went back to her trailer. Her brother Holden was getting into his clown costume. She put on her trapiese artist costume and make up and went to practice.        Winter flew through the air hanging by feet and arm, grabbing arm and swining to the next trapiese. All the trapise artist practiced their routine all day long until it was show time. She ate a small dinner and the went out for the big beggining.        Show time! Winter and the rest put on an amazing show. She flew through the air, grabbing others feet and arms, going from trapise to trapise. Their show was perfect. The clows made jokes, the animals amazed the millions, and the others made the best show ever.         That night was amazing and perfect. Winter had a fantastic show along with the others and had standing ovations. Pictures were taken and grouds cheered all through the night until it was over. The show was the best ever.

Tony thought it was going to be boring. When we got there or moms kissed us goodbye and it was the embrassing because there were 5 million people looking at me. When we got there it was so crowded that they broke my back spine so we had to hold hands! The six of us were scared because we all got front row seat and thoought we would get swallowed by the lion or the elephants.                    5 hours later  later, the six boys got out of the circus and started to complement how good was the circus performers. When we were waiting for our ride the manauger came to talk to us. He was talking about the circus because he saw how excited and scared we were. When we heard that he said maybe you six will join the circus we were excited! He told us that the interview will be on Monday and the result will be on Tuesday. After 3 days for waiting we saw our result and the six of us got in!               After we packed our bag kissed our moms and said goodbye. Our lemo drop us off at airport and we all went LA baby! 10 years later we all are famous and rich but we still visit our mom every month.

During the day you have school, chores, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and practicing your circus talent. Your day starts about 6:00 and ends at 12:00 this is how your day would go if you were a circus performer.              6:00 wake up and get ready     In the morning I wake up, and go to the pie car with my family we eat a big breakfast to get lots of energy, and we talk a little. Its usually a slow start for me in the morning because i don't want to use all my energy.         2.     8:00 time for school!   After breakfast i go to a one room school house it has many people in it i learn the same stuff every other kid does. I have test, essays, and i get a report card. There are many other people in the school house, and they speak many other languages like French, Russian, and Italian.         3.     2:00 time for a quick break    On break you can play with unicycles and juggling balls. You live in trailers and u cant have big animals because if their to big then you will have no room in your trailer.        4.      2:30 Chores and practice   I do my chores i have to take care of the horses that we use in horseback acts. I am trying to do some more tricks with animals and its working out very good.        5.       5:30 Time to EAT!   At dinner time me and my family go to the pie cart, we don't eat much because we don't want to get sick wile performing.        6.       9:30 time to sleep   The show is over I am tired and sleepy no more work for today its not time for me, and my family to go to sleep.                                         This is the life of a circus performer.

When I get dressed, grab some breakfast from the pie car, and go to horses while everyone sets up tents, lights, etc. By 8:30 I've fed all the horses, and now it's time to go brush my teeth and hair. At 9:00 school starts, and I am very excited to get back to the horses. Finally school's over by around 3:00. I get to the horses, and begin cleaning them up. I first fill up all their water buckets, though. I then start brushing them with a more stiff brush, and next move on to a soft brush that shines their fur a bit. I finish by putting some fly spray on them.                  I take a break from the horses, and complete some homework and chores. I make my small bed and make myself a little snack. While I eat, I review with myself the steps of my horseback act. Then I stop by my friends bed.'Hey Jenna!' I say. 'Want to come help me with the horses?' 'Sorry, I can't right now, I've got to practice my quadrupel back hand spring. But I'll stop by later!' She says. So I get my helmet and boots, then tell my dad to meet me in 5 minutes by the riding area, and head down.                         Once we're both ready to practice,I put a big, white, square pad on my horse Lily, a snow white horse, with long eye lashes, and a white mane and tail, then I slip on her bridle, and hop on. 'Okay, lets warm up with a hand stand with Lily standing still.' My dad says. I do it fine, then for about a half hour practice my back flip off her and landing it on the ground perfectly.                        At 6:30, we eat a small dinner, because we have a show. The makeup and hair artists apply sparkly makeup, and bright lipstick. I wait about a half hour before my part comes in. I walk out on Lily and I stand up on her. I stay determined and confident, something I will always need to do here. Then I slowly swing my and back... And PUSH OFF! I curve my body back like a rainbow, then I slowly bend my knees as I land. The crowd goes wild. Every time I do this, I always smile big. Then do it again but with a double back flip. If I thought they were cheering before, well they were screaming this time! I smiled at everyone, and then walked out, the noise fading.                        I was wiped out, I put Lily back, took of her saddle pad, and headed 'home'.   I put my two piece rainbow pajamas on, and waited for my dad to come home. i finished my homework, then put it in my backpack, to go to school in the morning. When i returned to the small table in our trailer cabins living room, my dad came in. 'Who wants hot coacoa!?' he asked as he set down four cups for all the girls staying in the trailer we all gathered aroud the cups, grabbed on and sat down slurping our hot chocolate. Then we all crawled into bed, falling asleep right away.                   Every morning I go through the same routine. I never get tired of being with horses all day. When we are done at one destination, we drive to another, and always have a blast att the shows. I am so glad to have such a cool life. I get get to meet kids all around the world! And make new friens, every year.

She woke up at 7:00 a.m. got dressed and went to school there are 12 other kids that go to school some seek French others Russian but Sally she spoke English. School in the circus was like any other school it had desks and testes. After school she ate lunch at the pie car had a little break then did some chores( feeding the horses and brushing them). Dinnertime she could not eat a lot of food because of the show. The show was always fun being on stage and after seeing the people and telling us what a great job we did. In bed she thinks about home and counting the dyes until she gets to go home life in the circus was fun but at the same time sad.            A few months later Sally found out the next stop was her home town she could not wate to see her friends. When she got up the next morning she was in her home town, she jested wanted to run to her home but she knew she could not. At school she did not treat it as a normal day she rushed through about every thing she did that day her friends tried to slow her down but she was to excited.            That night she saw some of her friends and there family. After the show her mother said she can go with hang out with her friends. They had so much to say but they knew they did not have long so the talked and talked until there mothers called them away. sally was in bed thinking about how much things her friends and she would do when she is off tour.               Before she knew it it was time to go back home. Right when she got home she called her friends. As they did before they talked until they could not. they hung out all summer until Sally had to go on tour again. That was the best summer she had ever sean.

She was telling me what it is like to be in the circus. She must  wake up early and go to bed very late.       She must practice day and night and do chores to keep the grounds safe a clean. She told me how she learns many new stunts to perform infront of people.But something i never new or would of guessed is she has a school!        I wish I was a acrobat like Isabella, we could be best friends and play around like I do at my school, except more seriously. Maybe I will inrole in gynastics and we could someday be in the same circus!

I was about to run but the lion started talking to me. The lion said, they were friendly and they didn't want to harm me. They told me that they wanted to leave and not perform tricks. I told them that if they left, then  people will be sad. They decided not to leave. The next day the animals were not there everyone was sad. The next day people didn't go to the circus because they wanted the animals performing. The owner saw the animals gone and he called the animal control to try and find the animals . The owner didn't even care about the animals he only cared about the money. I tried to tell them that they just want to live in the wild and not in the circus. The owner just ignored me.                  Secondly, the animal control found the animals and now they are back in the circus. I felt bad because they told me they wanted to live in the wild and not in the circus. When the circus was done I went backstage and I saw the animals. They told me that their dream is to stay in the circus. I told them that they said they wanted to be in the wild. They said they changed their mind because in the wild they are not proud. In the circus they are proud, lots of people are watching them and smiling. I just thought they wanted to be in the wild. So, the animals did really wanted to live in the wild . The next day the animals were in the circus preforming and having fun.

I rushed over to the animal pens and the sight I saw was horrifying. The ringmasters body lay mangled on the ground I quickly called for help but no buddy   came 'DANG!' the circus must of started. so as quick as possible I hid the body and put on the cloths.It was good that I did because at that second one of the clowns came in,'Boss we need you on. NOW!' I was hustled out onto the stage I did my best acting,'Lady's and Gents the moment you've all been waiting for,,,,,TIPSY TURVY CIRCUS!!! '. I hope that was right and by Davy Jones it was!   The clowns came out in their funny car and stopped right in the middle the door slowly opened then,,,,,,,a whole bunch of clowns came out i was laughing so hard my sides felt like they were going to split open, but wait one of them had some hesitation in what he was doing. Oh well I disided to keep watching and see if anything else was weird. The show continued on with nothing weird but the fire breathing, when I could of sworn he tried to toast a man or it was just me.Finally the circus was over I was so happy to have the circus over that forgot about the body. 'AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH' their was a young woman at the body of the ring master. She looked at me then at the body  she was speechless. As quick as a flash I calmed her down and told her everything. She looked puzzled but then she seemed to get it. 'My name is Joan I'm the ring masters helper once I knew you said tipsy not Topsy I knew something was wrong so I tried to find the real ring master but all I found was a mangled body.' So me and Joan hunted for hours on end for the murderer but we found nothing we were about to give up when I saw the man that tried to toast the other man 'AH HA' we followed him to his tent 1,,,2,,,3,,, we ran in and caught the man red handed!   later that evening the police came and took him away 'Thanks to you folks we'll put this man behind bars again.

I have i dont like ciruses becuase im scared of clowns. The circus is a place where actors  perform live.Thats when you want to play soccer but you never stay long enough so you can.That is what acircus will do if you join you cnt play sports nothing exept for pratice for the show. .                                                                                                        First a circus gets dressed at 7:00 a.m,then you have to eat and set up tents for the show,next you have to gather all the animals for practice , 3:30 you have to do chors.First you have to groom the horses and water the horses.You have to practice jumping off the trampoline and land on a horses back that takes balence. You see your dad jump of 2 horses backs and do a  summersult. Your neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash.             At 6:30 pm its dinnr time . your family goes to the pie cart and you dont eat alot because you are about to perform tonight. you do ten shows a week one on week days 2 on the weekends.                   10:30 pm .The show is over and you are walking back to the trailer and you look at the consession stands, stables, and trailers 2 days from now you will be set up in another town.                            12:00 AM in bed,your thinking about the end of the touring season.you think about your real home in florda. When you grow up will you still be a circus preformer? The circus is fun but it is tough life.

Here is      her story.                    Hello, My name is Cassidy Knoll. 4 years ago I joined the amazing life as an acrobat in the circus. My talent kind of runs in my family. I always have been proud of my family and how I live my life. Alot of people dont have the opportunities I do in life and so that makes me feel special about who I am. My entire family has these amazing talents and we are all very lucky!                The bad part about being in the circus is that you are never in one place long enough to make any friends or anything like that. I enjoy making new friends and because I cant stay long enough to really make any, it isn't very good. We also dont hae many chances to really get to stay at our real house. We are always traveling. Which actually isn't a bad thing.          We get up really early in the morning to go to our one-room school. But, before we do that, we have to head to our pie car, were we eat. I enjoy getting to see all the different places while we are on tour and I have alot of storys to share to people I know who aren't in the circus buissiness. I am sure that anyone who isn't in the circus would love it! But also find it very tough.         I also suggest reaching for your dreams. What do you want to be? Go for it. If you think you have what it takes, you should definently try to be who you want to be. Don't let anyone change your mind!

We had to write an essay on a circus life. When i got home i rushed to the computer.           My mom walked in the door when i got on. Then i had to explane why i was on the coumputer. When i got to goin it wasen't that hard. I got finished around ten.         My mom was mad then she started to start scouling.The next morning i got called last. When i got done i ended up winning the 5 tikits.           I had to take it home to my parents. They said it was very good about a person in the circus. When it was before the circus time i shared  my story with the clowns. This is the story i wrote.            'It's 6o'clock in the morning i go feed the camels. It is excrushiating work. When it is time for school i am in sirious pain. When i take my homework back to the trailor i hear my back pop.            I feel like throwing up i thought. I don't whant to do any work i thought. When it was time to practice i thought i would die. When i was practiceing my legs felt whosy.             When i was about to go on i felt quesay inside. When i was done i was happy it all paid off.'               I was really happy that the clowns liked it. When the circus show was over i got to go and meet the lions. The lions were really soft.

I will be writing about the color of a circus, acrobats, circus jugglers, tightrope walkers,and circus horses.        The circus I went to was painted red and white. The circus was only in town for two weeks. It was carried in by trailers. They had lots of plays to watch and some rides.         I saw people on strings doing acrobats. They were really high up in the air. They were also twisting so much I thought they were going to  fall on to the audience. They were grabbing the rope with their hands, their feet, and even their teeth.       I also saw people juggling sharp wooden sticks. I have no idea how their hands were moving so fast. The sticks were so sharp if they messed up the sticks would have injured them badly. I got really scared when one of the sticks went flying through the air. It might have been part of the act, it might not have been part of the act.I will probably never know.         The next thing I saw was three tightrope walkers. They were even higher up then the people doing acrobats. The ropes were so thin it looked like he was floating. I wonder how the tightrope walkers got so much balance. I think the tightrope walkers got their balance by walking on brick walls. Maybe even just walking on the side of a curb.         The best thing was the circus horses. They were standing on their hind legs, and jumping very high. They were also catching apples in their mouth. the circus horses even did exactly what their masters told them to do.   `      This is what happens in a circus if you are interested in going to one anytime soon.

Also you got to be praticing before the circus show. they got to feed alltheir animals before the show so their animals could go in the show. After all the show they got to clean up the big tent. When there done cleaning they go to sleep. After that day they leave to a oter part to another part to the same thing again.             If you want to jion the circus you got to be train on whatever you to be. In a circus you could be a animal trainer, a clown, a juggling guy or lady. If you want to be a rope balacer you got to be a good balancer. you could become a clown if you are funny or if you know how to ride a unicycle. You could jion gymnastics if you want to be a rope balancer.

Then suddenly all the lights turn off and only one is on. Then a loud voice comes on and says h'm Good afternoon ladies and gents, girls and boys. Tonight we are going to perform the most dangerous acts , the mos amazing acts, and the most beautiful acts. So better take a seat and do not miss anything.'' The first thing we saw where beautiful white horses. They were so graceful and they did not mess up in anything. Then we say some leopards and tigers. We were all amazed because we thought they would going to attack the man that was controlling them but the didn't. Then these huge elephants came out and women were riding on top and they were wearing white feathers on their head. The elephants were so beautiful there was even a baby elephant. It was so cute. Then some acrobats came and they did a lot of cool tricks everybody was saying WOW. Everyone was really amazed and having a good time. We thought they were going to fall down because they were hanging from a swing well it wasn't much of a swing. It looked hard to seat on because it was only a pole. There would be 2 swings and one of the acrobats would jump would jump on one of the swings. Then he would jump on the other one. And he would stay there and wait then another acrobat would jump on a swing and get ready to grab the other acrobat because there was only 3 acrobats. The women grabbed on the other acrobat and they would just throw her back and fort. Then it was the really last act and it was clowns the did funny tricks everybody was laughing so hard. They were almost falling of there seats. And when it was over EVERYBODY clapped, clapped and whistled because we like there acts.

Now we finally get to go. Today at school my teacher gave us front row seats to the circus I screamed in my head. But, first I have to clean my room, wash dishes, and do chores. After i did all that we finally went to the circus.                         When we got to the circus I found a perfect front row seat. My dad went to go get food. He brought back a lot of food i don't know why. When it started they wanted a volunteer I raised my hand and I did'nt know they were going to pick and they did. they put a snake on me luckily it was'nt poisionous or did'nt bite me.                                                After my mom stood up all night watching TV. My dad was gettig the stuff out of the car. My sister was looking for candy to make her stay up, and then she fell asleep on the counter.

The circus girl loved the circus, it was all she could think about. She wished that one day she would be as good as Dougie, her favorite acrobat. Dougie looked as beautiful as a supermodel when she performed. She was as graceful as a swan. She had such elegance that you couldn't take your eyes off her. She was MESMERIZING!             She worked day after day practicing Dougie's every move, making sure every little movement was perfect. She would work from dawn to dust, giving everything she had to the moves. Intill she had almost every move down, there was just one more left, the hardest one of all, the Falcon.             The circus girl worked on it for years, she just couldn't get it. She sometimes never went home at night. She wanted to be Dougie so much for so long that she just couldn't give up. She evenally she got so angry with it she went home and just cried in her father arms screming, ' I can't do it!!! I CAN'T DO IT!!! I'll never be like Dougie!!!!!' Her father coforted her all night in she finally stoped crying.            Then he said, ' But your not Dougie your The Circus Girl!!!' and then she reizied that he was right, she wasn't Dougie, she was THE CIRCUS GIRL!!!!!!                                 THE END!!!

Then we went in our classroom and the teacher and a clown were talking then the teacher said 'Ok Mr.Hudd is going to pass out a flyer to only some of you'. So then I got one and it said on the title 'Win front row tickets to a circus' so i was looking through it and I decided to try and win them. So then school was over and I started to type out all the things I know about a circus. But I didnt get far because the power went out for 2 hours and I couldnt type so then I started to write but I went to the bathroom and my dog ate my paper! Then I couldnt do anything but wait untill the last minute. 5 Hours passed and the power was still out then one more thing happend I was so tired I fell asleep. I was seeing strange things in my dream like on thing was a clown was stealing a diamond necklace from the jewlery store! Then I woke up and didnt want to write about it yet. Later I did research about this exact carnival and it was in India! Now how am I going to get to India?

The circus   is a place of fun, entertainment and mystery. But it takes a long time for   people to put on a show. They practice months and do alot of training.   They also travel alot.                    The acrobatic's training is complicated. They do years of training.   Acrobatics might be one of the most hardest acts in the circus. They   can be the most scary act. The fun that they have is making kids entertained.                       The clowns  are the funniest act. They enjoy making kids laugh.   They also do some practice.They play on dancing animals.they do   acts with pie cars and horses.                 And thats the story about the circus.

Today was the big day.   All our practice in acrobatics  will finally come to use.  My name is  Bella Lindini.  Otherwise know to the croud 'The Beauty of Italy ' I work in an Italian traveling circus with my parents.  I am 11 years old . Today we were going to do the biggest show we had ever put on in my life time.  I had never done this big of an act.  Today we were going to go to america. I had never been to america in my life though my parents had been many times.  I started getting dressed slowly in to my outfit for the show we had practiced many times for this show.  we were performing in Los Angeles, California.  It was not at all like home. There were no forests just palm trees every where to be seen. there were no big neighborhoods just streets and big glass buildings.  The time change really got to me but I had been traveling in america for 6 months so i had gotten used to it.         I got out of the car and went down to the pie car for some pasta with sauce.  ' well you are up earily' said my mother behind me.  'Hello mama' i said. I could hear the tiredness in my voice.  I saw my mother was tired to.        I finished my pasta and went down to the big top to pracitice my act. I did my flips onto the trapize and shaped my self into God knows what.  flipped myself off landed in the net bowed and jumped off.  I had anthor act to but i needed my partner who was not awake or was still at the pie car so I practiced that again. When I finished I turned to the floor and saw my partner.  ' Lovely' he said finally.  'Gratzi' I said. I looked into his eyes and he nodded he knew i was asking him to practice we did our routine. I started on the trapize and did flips and turns then i hung by my feet and waited 5 seconds then I flipped back up and saw his reaching for mine.              I went on through out the day.  finally it was time for the show.  My feet were tingling.  I was nervous I was fine with doing the act ifront of  italians but i had never done this in front of americans.          when I heard my name I went out I heard them speaking english yes i was fluent enough to under stand them bu t they spoke it so clearly that i had never heard something like that.     I went up on the trapizeand did my solo act in the stiff dress that would hardly let me move.  twist turn twist turn i thought. then i jumped of did a flip in mid air and came down.  there was silence from the croud.   then they burst with clapping and shouts and hoots and hollers flowers were shooting tword me like bullets.

I love working at the circus .Their are clowns that get to paint their face .I am a trapeze .I think of my work as if i am a monkey .I think of it as a monkey becouse monkeys get to climb all over and that is exacly what I do .Maybe for you it looks like it is verry easy but it is not.I will talk to you about that .                     Do you like the circus as much as i do ,well if you said yes than I will teach you  about that today . All of what i do may look simple but it's not it' really complicated. We have to practice alot to make it look good when we perform it . At first we  just make up our moves and then we practice then we performe it .does all of this sound verry simple?                  I love doing this so people con wach me .To engoy wat i do what I learn.And that is why I love my job a lot!

He said'Well today is that show case in Las Vegas. Tonight you  have to walk on the 1,000 foot up tight rope and then do the ribbon swing and drop on to an elephant's back, Tonight will be the night that you show all of the people your talent and that you can be a real circus person when you get older.

It will take hardships and skills. although you may think that a circus performer's life is all fun you are wrong.You will have to drop everyting and start practicing if you are willing enough to join. But if you are you will have to have the right body and atitude.You will also have fun though. A circus performer's life isn't all easy or all hard but if you put your mind to it  you can accomplish your dreams.

I walk outside after eating and all the crews are setting up the tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.       9:00 A.M. is school time. Our schoolhouse travels with us. Like any other school ours has computers, tests, and report cards with grades. Because many of the performers are from all different places in the world many of my classmates speak different languages:French, Russian, and Italian like my family. As we travel around the different states in the country our geography becomes more and more alive.                After those we have to do many,many more things throughout the hole entire rest of the day. After I groom my dog, feed, water, and groom the horses we use in our acts we take a break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and and juggling balls. After all the rest of the jobs are done we get dressed and ready for tonight's show. After the show is over we all eat dinner then go to bed excited for tomorrow's show.

They have to practice a lot for there show they need to practice so they do not fall down. If they fall then that's it they have to stop that part of the show then there's clothing the clothing is the easy to do because. All they do is just grab there outfit and just put it on. Then there off to do the show it is not easy to be there it is really hard to do there work. If i where there i would not last a day at there job there some other things that. They have to do like train there horses or any thing else like other animals like dogs or what ever animal They have at the circus.

Now,  I  am going to tell you about how you will be practicing you act 24/7.When you are in the circus you will be practicing a lot. Because you would want to mess up in front of a whole bunch of just sitting there watching you when you mess up.That is where the saying 'Practice makes perfect'. comes from the circus.                    Next,i am going to tell you about the salary. the salary is a big thing now with the economy failing. Working  with the circus would not be the best choice. if your losing money.Right now because as you keep going you would make a little money. But not enough to survive in life.                                                                                      Now i am going to tell  you a very important thing if you sign up for the circus you would only not make a lot of money.Sure you would make money to put food on your family's plates but not enough for new clothing or school supplies. But you would not get to see your family a lot. working in the circus switching your hours around like crazy. Either you be sleeping,  practing, or being on tour.                              There is an up side to working in the circus. you could make friends.get your name in the world. But that does not only mean waste your time. with your friends.when you work in the circus thing change your travel you notice different things you've never noticed in life like different community's that may be failing with life.                                                                                                                                       Those are things that would come up in your life.If you worked in the circus .it may be fun at the time but it is not worth it in the end especially if you get a good education.

For my birthday I got a juggling set and I was off juggling.  By the time I was 8 I was already juggling knifes.  One day I saw a sign on the door of a pub, new employees for the circus.  It said March 24, 2:00 at my local amusement park, Magic Mountain.  I told my mom and on that day she took me.  I performed last so I had a lot of pressure.  I went home very nervous and weeks later I got a letter that said I got the part.         I had met all my performers that I would be working with and they told me I came right in time.  They said that we have a circus in a month.  I said great lets get practicing.  We had practiced and practiced until it was a week before. We had to drive to Maine so we needed to get going.  We got to Mine and got some sleep.  The next day was the performance.  We practiced all day until it was time for the show.         We got to the theatre.  I was so nervous that I would mess up because it was my first show. The host announced now performing Ron Gooding.  It was gonna be my first time juggling with knifes on fire.  I got out there and the music started.  I started juggling.  I then walked on top of the tight rope and started walking on it and juggling the knifes.  But then I fell.  Luckily there was a net but the knife went in to my eye.       I got rushed to the hospital but it was to lated the docter had told me that i needed a glass eye.

First I ate breakfast, then I had to feed the animals, and then I had to practice.        It's almost time for the show to start and we have been practicing for the past 2 hours. I will be doing a trapeze act. The announcer is getting ready to say my name. 'Now, for our trapeze act!' I step out and start to climb the ladder. At the top start to feel nervous.   I feel like I'm going to fall. I grab my swing. My partner grabs theirs and we both jump. I did a flip and my partner grabbed me. The crowd is cheering when we get to the other side!        After the show my parents come and congradulate me. After a long days work I go to the pie car for dinner. Back at my car I get ready for bed. I think about today's show and feel happy. But tomorrow I'll have to do it all again.

They have to wake up at 7:00 and go eat breakfast then if your a kid you have to go to school from 9:00 to 3:00 Then you have to get ready for the show and eat dinner then you perform. The circus is very tiring because you have wake up early and you don't go to bed till around 12:00 but it is also a lot of fun because you get to travel the world and go to so many amazing places.You also get to meet so many people.                 There are so many things about the circus that really cool but in order to do those cool things you have to work hard to join the circus. You have to be determined, you have to now you want to be in the circus. You also have to study hard to get into the circus but not like study in school, you have to study acting and do a bunch of performances when your a kid. You also have to be funny and not be scared in front of hundreds of people.                 The circus is a great place to go get a laugh or hang out with your friends and watch a show, it is also is a place to see amazing tricks. If you ever go to a circus you will have a great time seeing all the animals like horses, monkeys, and lions. You will also have a great time, and see an amazing show.

I work hard for every show to make sure I do it just right. As I am back stage practicing my act, I can see all of the other circus performers practicing their act. Being in the circus is fun, but it's lots of hard work. You always need to practice, know what you're doing, and you have to have a certain talent. You can't just learn it! So, if you keep on reading you'll find out I what mean.                      When you are practicing you have to know what your doing and how you are going to perform it. Are you going to  have a partner? Or are you doing a solo act? These may soud like easy questions but when you're a circus performer these are very inportant questions. Then when you have it figured out you have to practice for hours a day. You have to keep going over and over and over your routine until you know it's perfect. Then when you are positive you're ready you wait until the everyone else ready then you put on the show.                  Now that you know what it means to practice for the show, let's talk about the fun part. As soon as you step foot on stage you get this amazing feeling inside. It's definitely a rush! You see all of those cheerful faces in the fantastic audience and you know they're all watching you and know you'll put on a great show. You want to have a great show too. But in order to do that you have to remember every step of your act. You are for going to feel nervous but then the music starts and when you do the first move of your act it comes to naturally and are no longer nervous about doing it. In fact you feel like your just at home messing around with equipment. You hardly notice the crowd. but when you finish your act, you see all the smiles and you put a smile on your face, take a bow, and make room for the next performer.              Now that you've heard about the hard work and the fun it's about time you know the schedule. At 8:00.a.m. you go the pie car. That's where all of us circus performers eat. At around 9:00 we head over to the circus arena. We all practice there until about 12:00. Soon after that we put on our costumes, get hair and make-up done, then practice some more until it's our turn to go up. Soon after we put on new costumes and give the crowd a grand finally. After the show is over we wait until  the next show and are to do it all over again.                  So that's what's it like to be a circus performer. It's lot's of hard work but it all pays off in the end. Lot's of people may think it's we just figure it out and have fun with it but it's not. Even professionals need training. So next time you go see a circus think about how hard they worked to make it perfect. Then ask yourself this question,'Do I really want to become a circus performer?'

You have to get up bright and early to get dressed and go to the pie car for pancakes and bacon while the others set up the tents,lights,and music for tonights show.Then the kids go to school.Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any other school, ours has computers,tests,and report cards and because some circus preformers are from all over the world many of them speak other languages: French, Russian,and Italian.After school is over it's time for a quick break. The clowns let us play with their unicycles and juggling balls.Also we play with a tiny dog its name is Noodle.Saddly our trailer is too small for such a big dog.Next we do chores and practice for tonights show  	NNS WP VBP VBP IN DT NN VBZ VBN CC NN RB PRP$ NN CC DT VBZ WRB JJ PRP VBP TO VB IN NN TO VB DT JJ NN NNP NNP VBP TO VB IN JJ CC RB TO VB VBN CC VB TO DT NN NN IN NNS CC NN IN DT NNS VBD RP DT NNS , NNS , CC JJ IN NNS JJ DT NNS VBP TO JJ NN NN NNS IN NNP NNP DT JJ NN , NNS VBZ NNS , NNS , CC NN NNS CC IN DT NN NNS VBP IN DT IN DT NN JJ IN PRP VBP JJ NNS : JJ , JJ , CC JJ NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP VBP IN PRP$ NNS CC VBG RB PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN PRP$ NN VBZ JJ PRP$ NN VBZ RB JJ IN JJ DT JJ JJ PRP VBP NNS CC NN IN NNS VBP	1		20131023115050	539	1		20131023203803	543	1

I had no where to go I kept calling for them, but they would never come. Then the unspeakable happened, Some one found me! He nursed me to a three year old baby, then he explained to me the way I was saved and told me his name(Voric Oglar). As I got older Voric noticed my muscles starting to grow. By the time I was eight I could lift a horse.               Then Voric mentioned the circus, I knew what it was because my old parents used to work their. I said I would love to go to the circus, so we did. When we got their I saw tall people, short people, hairy people, and magic people. We got to the end of the line to sign up, and he said,'State you talent and your name'. I said my talent is strength, and my name is George Wringling. The man stopped and said,'hold on just a little bit' and left the booth and entered the circus tent.               The man from the booth came back and said,'George meet Mr. and Mrs. Wringling.   Then everything went silent so quiet you could hear a pin drop a pin in confusion, and hatered all circling around that one day they left me. Then it went back to normal. 'We're sorry', the Wringling's said. 'Their's nothing to be sorry about. You left me that day I don't know why but you did, and you can't be forgiven,' I said.              'We can explain', they said. It all started the day at that farmers market. We put you in your baby stroller. Before we left, you fell out, but we didn't know you did until we left and got back to our tent. We came back as soon as possible but then you were gone. 'I guess it's resolved then,' I said. 'Now we're a family,' The Wringlings said? 'Now we're a family,'I said!

Bullies mostly targeted him. He went to Hawthorne Elementary school In San Luis Obispo,CA. His school went up to kindergarten through 7th grade. Timmy was in the 5th grade he mostly got bullied by the 6th and 7th graders. The kids in his class always picked him last to be on there team in P.E. And most of the kids  made fun of his last name. They called him Butt burn and worst names like buttsnifer. Timmy usually ignored these dreadful names and thought about his dream which is being a magician in a circus. So Timmy was walking home one night and he saw a poster that said LITTLE MAGICIANS NOW HIRING. Timmy was happy to see this poster, he already new a lot of magic tricks. He had a lot of magic kits and he watched videos on YouTube on how to do magic tricks all the time. So the next day Timmy's parents drove him to the performing arts center. There they signed a lot of papers.             A couple hours after that Timmy's parents packed his bags and they left. 'Bye honey' his mom said. 'Bye son his dad said.  Timmy was starting  To Feel a little homesick now that his parents were gone and he was with some of the administrators on a private jet. When the plane landed, the administrators guided him to a Funny looking trailor with a couple of other kids. When he walked in the administrator greeted Timmy to the kids he said, 'Hey kids this is our new magician  ,Timmy bottomburn. Everyone lafted . Timmy was feeling sad about his weird name. He thought, 'why did my stupid parents name me this'.In about a couple of minutes  everyone stoped lafting. Then everyone told him that they were sorry for laffing. It turns that they have wierd names to. There were 2 girls and 2 boys. There names were Sally pukeeater, wendy Slimeball, Jhonn Bighead and Amari blood face. A few Days past and next thing you they were h   is best friends. They Would always practice their magic tricks together.

So the directer of the circus called the fire department and by then the hole tent was almost gone.         So after the fire was out the circus was a mess so every one helped clean up and then the circus was back to normal. But then the directer told Red he was fired.          Red was very sad, everyone was sad. So Red went home and took a very long nap and dreamed of the disaster. Then he woke up and herd a knock on the door so he opened it and it was the directer. The directer said he was sorry and he could come back to the circus, the directer said NO fire.           So the next day everyone was happy to see Red the amazing clown.

I`am going to tell you  three things about  the circus three cool facts about the circus.   The circus is popular around the U.S.       The first fact about the circus they go around to 150 cities and 20,000 miles in seven mouths each year.They wake up in the morning and  get dressed and then go to the pie car .When they are done eating and go get ready for they performances.       The next fact is they closed  down the circus is because he was not getting money so it lost bisections.      The last fact is that the owner sold the land and the man that ones the land he rebuild the circus.               as you can see that is allfor today. 	DT NNP . . .

It was a Circus banner being pasted on a brick wall by a youge boy, the poster had two elephants and a person on each one then a clown was trying to get on to one of the elephants. '' Circus To-Day'' I read aloud, Jane had an excited look on her face '' We should go.'' '' After all we just got done with school, we could go ask our parents on the way.''I looked at her, not saying a word because she was the onlt one in the whole shcool who knew that I wanted to be in the Circus. She said it would be a good job for me. So the time we got home our parents already put us on the list to go to the Circus.                            ''We won't be able to go to the Cicus so you will have to take care of Jane while you are there'', ''okay Bill''. Bill was my great grandfathers name so I thought she got my name from him. Jane started to pout about going with me instead of going alone. Jane is 10 and I am 12 she says since she is almost as old as me she should go alone. Dad lay on the chair yet awaken be the sound of her pouting.'' You won't go anyhwere if you don't stpo pouting''. He said in a earitated voice.                               ''Bill is  your older brother and you should respect that''. Mom said. As we went to go to the Cicus we were very queit untill we were on a bathroom brake.When we got back in to the car we were tired so we took a nap, by the time we got there we were so excited that we could hardly wait to go inside. While we were inside I bought us some pop and popcorn for the show. When we were there Jane was talking the whole show but then it was the grande fanally with the loin tammer.                                 '' That is the best part'' I said,when we got home I knew what my dream was it was to become a performer in the Cicus and when i got older I had  to do it and I did I had lived my dream and it was amazing. Just always follow your dreams.

You probally think that their jod isn't hard at all and that you can do all the tricks they can. Well these people risk there lives everyday doing dangerous stunts tricks and more to entertain the crowd. They have to work every minute of the day and they have have to be determined.       Part of being part of the circus is that you have to work hard at your trick and you have to be good at your talent you have to practice on your craft every single day because you can't go out there and be sloppy. As part of the Circus you also have to do chores like groom the horses, give them water, and also have to give them alot of care.     You have to balance out the time of your act with the ending of your act and you also have to own your act you must practice, practice, practice till your act is perfect. You must pay attention to what you do and more. You also have to make sacrafices like giving up your family time and more. You have to work alot of long hours and weekends as well.

My life in the circus was so fun I love being in the circus. What you do in the circus is you have to be in very good shape. You always have to be healthy.One time in practice i fell off the balence ball. After that we strech out our legs and we try to do circus acrobats. Sometimes we will try tightroping. That is the funest out of all tightroping I love tightroping. All of the circus clows are SCAREY!!!!!!!!

I am the traner for an elephant named Bungo. One day there was a terible accident that happend. This accedint involved Bungo and a very rude citizen. It was my first day on the job and I was out practicing when I was hit straight in the face.            It was a peanut! a peanut, then I heard some laughing in the stands. I looked up and saw a dad and a kid sitting there and laughing at me. The next thing I know the security comes and takes them away. I think to my self how rude that was.            then I hear some yelling coming from the security. next thing I know the dad and kid are in the same spot doing the same thing. Throwing peanuts at me and laughing. then I yelled and said security get these people out of here. The next thing I know I hear what sonds like a gun shot. Boom!             The kid has just been shot! what the heck is going on shouts another person whating for the show to start. Then Bungo starts getting scared. It is not good when Bungo gets scared because as you may know elephants are 20 times bigger than humans, and can do a lot of damage to a helpless citezen. then some of the other elephants start to get scared. the next thing I know Bungo is charging full speed at the stands.            Then the worst thing possible happens the rest of the crowd starts going bonkers. They are screaming, yelling, and shouting at each other to move out of the way. Then I hear it. CRASH!! The whole group of people over by the stands where the dad and kid were start screaming and crying in pain. The police come and they are forced to tranculize the elephant so that no one else gets heart.             And that my freinds is my story.

My favorite thing in the circus is the tite rope walkers. It takes a lot of balece and incuregement to do that. Some people do titeropeing over the grand caynon.         My second favorite thing thats fun is taming the animals. It would be fun because you get to see exotic animals. Like monkeys,horses,lions,and much more. It would be scary because it's a wild animal. Oh yeah don't they train elefents too? I think they ride the elefents and make them do tricks.         My third thing is acrobatics. It would be fun, swining from ropes. They do cool things in the air. Like do a flip in the air then the other guy catches him. The thin of gravity is a strange thing. just to be that high would scare the crabs out of me.         I think the circus is a fun thing for me. I'v never seen a circus but It'll probely be fun anyway. I'd like to se all this stuff.Titerope walkers,animal tamers,and acrobats.all really cool things. And it would be a cool to be under a big top.

Right now myself and the rest of the crews and performers are pulling into our next location for our show!   When, we come to a stop the animals are unloaded right away by the trainers and the muscle men. Next, the tent is unloaded along with the stilts for the stilt/juggleing act. Lastly, the performers get to start getting ready for the show that night.     Now, that I can start my fun I get out my leatard and big box of makeup. First,I need to of course get on my outfit so later I won't mess up my makeup. Then, when I finish with my outfit I first need to put on my powder pink blush and my aqua mascera. Next, I put on the purple eyeliner, navy eyeshadow, and best of all my favroite light pink lipstick.     Once, I'm done I head to the pie car for a light dinner. So, once I reach the car everybody is already there talking and eating dinner. Then, when I get my food and start chowing down the food everybody is gone.     When, I finish and leave the cart the circus is about to begin so I rush to the tent and open the flaps just when they call my name to introduce me to the crowd. So, in I went to meet the anxious crowd!          	NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NNP , PRP VBP DT NN NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP RB PRP CC DT NN IN DT NNS CC NNS VBP VBG IN PRP$ JJ NN IN PRP$ NN .

I think the circus life would be fun because you would get to travel to all different places that you have never been to before and you would also get to train and work with acrobatic animals.       If I worked with a circus, I would want to either run the consesion stand because I would get part of the money from the consesion stand or I would want to train the leopard because I think it would be fun to train a wild animal.       I think it would be good for the moving school because then the kids could learn some geography during the trips because you would be going to different places so you might learn about different cultures and what languages different people speak.       I think the circus life would be fun but dangerous.

My friend Joe is also in the concession business. He makes and gets the food ready.       Its hard being in the circus. You have to get up early. You also go to school from 9:00 to 3:00. Its hard being in the circus when you a performer because you might get stage fright. Its easy being the concision guy with Joe.

My dad does different stunts in the circus like lion taming ( which i s what he does ) my mom and i help take care and groom the animals. My mom also makes costumes. My sister works with trapize but has not fully mastered it but is pretty good. My brother helps clowns and laughs at their silly costumes acts and bright red noses.           I have a very busy schedule and never have time for a social life. At dinner i never have to much to eat because i always have shows after wards. But after the shows and taking all the animals to their stables and places i am wiped out like my dad and sister. My mom was tired to because she had to help hand out and put away costumes.           Well thats what  happens in part of my day i always have chores. I also going to a school not like an every day public school a travelng school. Thats my life in the circus.

I'm so exited I can't wait any longer to get up on my plank and do my tricks and flips.This is amazing! My dad is going to be so proud of me. Well for now I'm going to eat dinner but not too much I still have a show. Tonight is going to be the most amazing night of my life. I'm going to first do a front flip off of a horse and land on a tiger. The tiger will then try many times to bite my legs off, but I will fight it. Once the tiger is unconscious I will jump off of its chunky body onto an innocent bear. The bear will not do anything but I will force myself to knock it out too. That is my reunite. I make my way onto the podium in the center of the tent. People are screaming my name 'Fail Fail Fail Fail' the beautiful words ring out in my ears. I jump from my horse mounting the Lion which acctualy almost bites my legs off, but I manage to knock it unconcious, I jump to the bear which does stand still and I repeatedly punch it until it is just a sleeping body on the floor.

You can do lots of tricks, when you are there. If you love animals you would be around them every day.could you have time alone, no you would not because you would be with the animals and training them every day of the week.Would you get breaks or will you not? I think training animals are not so bad do you think?         First, I recamend you to think of your family. Would  they want you to leave the state I think they would say no because they would miss you a lot.  If you do leave you would be famous but you would come to you own town you would be sad if you see your family you not do the show because I get scared in front of a crauwled to if you get in front of  peaple.

He wanted to join the circus  because his parents Jim and Jen never listened to him. So he left his town and went to Missouri. Three years later he was a well known performer because of his awesome act. He would be shot out of a cannon at over 100 miles an hour! His act was very dangerous but he wasn't worried.               One day they were putting on a show in his home town. Bob was nervous that his parents would see him and make him quit the circus. Then his parents saw a flyer at the store and Bob was on the front his parents were mad. They bought a ticket right away they were going to bring their son home. They saw him do his dangerous act and after the show the went to the performers tent and had a talk.               Then they were about to take him home when... He ran and ran he ran to the cannon and got in shot him self out and was home free until. BOOM he hit the ground he was in a colma for 5 days. When he woke up the first thing he saw was all his circus friends and his mom and dad. They all went back to the circus and his mom and dad got a job there too and they were all happy.

My family and I travel 20,000 miles in 7 months each year, visiting 150 cities. We work from sunup to sundown. Circus life is fun.          I wake up at 7:00 A.M.I go to the pie car for pancakes and bacon.Then we get ready for tonight's show by setting up tents, lights, and music. I schedule my day out. I go to school at 9:00 A.M. School ends at 3:00 P.M. From 3:00 to 3:30 I have a break.At 3:30 I do chores and practice. One of the things I am trying to master is leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back.          Then, at 6:30 P.M. it's dinnertime.Our family does 10 shows a week. The show ends at 10:30. I get to bed at midnight. I am exhausted from the hard days work.           If you want to join the circus you need to have a specific talent, the right body type, and be very determined. You have to concentrate on dancing and performing. One good thing about being in the circus is that you get to travel around the world. One bad thing about it is that you miss your family.

So all that day Valerie wonder what was the noise she heard . The next day Valerie heard the same noise. So she went in the house in asked her dad, Bob,  what was the that noise, he came outside and asked what noise did you hear Valerie ? Valerie came out of the house and said 'I heard a noise! I heard a noise!', later on that day she heard on the radio that the circus was here and started screaming and shouting. She asked her dad can they go to the circus together and dad said not right now honey. Valerie asked her dad again and her dad said, Honey we can go tomorrow afternoon, I promise. Soon as Valerie got off the school bus she ran in the house and asked her dad were they still going to the circus and dad said come on let's go to the car. When they arrived at the circus, it was many different things. People were swinging on the ceiling and off tightropes. The next day Valerie went to school she bragged about going to the circus with her dad all day long.

She was very flexible and nice she also had a kind of spark to her face that made her look both pretty and mysterious at the same time. She has always wanted to visit the circus but her parents never let her because they didnt want her to be influenced and grow up to be a circus clown. They wanted her to have a nice and educated life so she could grow up to be a doctor.                  One day on her way home from school she saw a flyer taped to a post lamp. She couldn't believe her  eyes . It was a flyer that said there was a circus coming to the town of Buckross. That was the town she lived in . Right away ideas started flowing to her mind and she began thinking of ways she could go to the circus without her parents knowing . She ripped the flyer off the lamp and read the words printed in a small font at the bottom: Saturday October 18. Five dollars to get in she had 15 in savings.Later that day she went up to her room and started writing down the possibilities. That's it! She finally figured it out after after almost an hour. She looked at the flyer one more time it starts at 2:30. She would tell her parents that she had to go to study at that time until 7:30.                   Saturday morning finally came she told her parents at 1:45 until  that she was going to meet her friend at the library for a study session. They agreed and asked if she needed a ride. She reasoned with them until they agreed to let her ride her bike there. She almost forgot her back pack because if she went without it her parents would become suspicous  so she emptied out her back pack and got out her water bottle and some snacks. When she got there,there was a big man at the trailer door . She gave him 5 dollars and he let her in. She saw amazing stunts , acrobats, silly clowns, crazy jugglers, and even circus horses . The time got away from her as she watched with all her interest.          When she looked at her watch it was 6:45. Oh no! She told her parents that she would be home at 6:15 . She rushed home and and when she walked in her parents were sitting in the guest room waiting for her. They were very upset that she was late. They sent her to her room in anger. When she got to her room the guilt was eating at her gut. She went  downstairs and spilled her guts to her parents . She apologized as they stared at her in dissapointment and surprise. She felt terrible but better that she had told them everything. They gave her the same old speach and sent her up . She felt bad . But when she went to bed that night she dreamed that she was one of those acrobats swinging by ropes feeling as if she was flying happily.

Saul knew that he had to go to circus school  and travel world wide and wake up early. So, he trained himself as hard as he could and when he went to join the circus of his dreams.They rejected him. Saul was sad, but then a person got fired from the circus and left mad. Saul heard the news and went to try it out to see if they wanted him. And they did. Saul was so happy and said'This is the happiest day of my life'! And so, Saul became famous and  more people started coming to see him more than the one that didn't except him.          They walked over to him and begged for him and Saul said 'You rejected me thought I was garbage and you think that I'm gonna go with  you guys?  How pathetic.  Noway I'm going with you guys.And so, they left all sad.' Saul was feeling great that he told  the people  that didn't except him.He knew that his dream has come true and that  he must've been the greatest entertainer in the world. This was  his time and knew that he had to take a break.             Now, Saul is retired from the circus, but now owns the one he used to work for.  He still makes a lot of money today and lives in Ontario, California. People still enjoy the circus even though Saul doesn't work as a entertainer.But they are glad that he took over as the owner of the circus he used to work for.  The circus though go nationwide it just stays in Ontario.  He might even make other circus's look cheap around the world.             Saul has inspired other people to join the circus.  Everybody around the world has been inspired by him. In Japan, China, Russia, Europe, Spain, and Germany. Saul, was so famous that when he was a  entertainer they showed it on tv everywhere. Thats why people know him around the world.  Saul, still to people everywhere around the world  is the best entertainer in the world.

Then he went to the train tracks and looked for a train to go on.Then he saw a train and he juped on and he was of but then it started to rain and he couldn't close the door so he went to the very back corner of the little train car.Then he fell asleep.Then he woke up and it was morning.Then the train stopped with a halt and he jumped off before he was seen by anyone.Then when he was done he started to walk away from the trains.         Then he walked over a hill and saw a big red and white tent and started to walk down the hill.When he got to the tent he asked a man who walked by if he could sign up.Then he got signed up and a couple of days he missed his mom and dad so he quit and walked back home and his mom and dad were so they never let him out of thier sight again.

But he wasn't just any acrobat, he was a daring acrobat.  He does the most frightening stunts as an acrobat.       Danny desided he would do the most impossible stunt ever at tonights act.  Jumping off a tower it the circus and grabbing a rope upsidown in middair then jumping off the rope and do a tripple twirl in middair into a mini pool.  Later, it was time for his act.  He was ready like always.  He jumped and...       He has succeded with his epic stunt.  And broken a world record.  The next day he looked in the world record book of 2013.  It showed 'Most daring man Danny Powel.'

The horses just jumped up in the air, right before the elephants walked in. The elephants were dark gray and they had enormous ears. Then all of a sudden some of the acrobats swung across each other and they did the most amazing tricks. Some of the tricks were spinning in mid air and doing flips.        Then Bob the clown started juggling 10 balls. The acrobats caught them then started juggling them then they would grab the rope again. Then one man started walking on a tight rope. He was wearing a suit and he had a top hat. There were trains going around the building. This was an amazing circus.

I have to wake up at seven in the morning and go to school at nine and it ends at three. At three thirty I have to do chores and thakr care of the horses. I am in the progress of learning new tricks. My family is in the circus too. It is a family buisiness.         The show starts at seven and ends at ten. I am always tired after shows. I go to bed at twelve and think about the circus life. I think to myself, 'Why is this life to hard? It is a fun life and I'm tired so I am going to go to sleep.'. So i went to sleep.         I never thought I would be a circus performer. I was always the normal kid in school. How did this happen?I have always loved the circus that came to town twice a year. I just found out my uncle was a performer so I asked if i could join it, he asked his boss. After a day of waiting he said I could be in it! That was a long time ago though.         The good thing about the circus is that I get to travel around the world and sometimes see my friends at shows! I love how people look at me and say I am good at my job. I have learne to tell when people are impressed.         The bad thing about being in the circus is that it is very hard work! I travel alot and I am never home to see my other family. I work long days and I cant take a break or I won't be ready to perform. I have to work on weekends too, but this life is fun because some people do funny acts and it makes me laugh!

We jump on trampolines until the horses came then we had to jump on the backs of the horses.Then we all head back to the pie trailer to have dinner but we don't eat much because the show is tonight. The show is about to start we rush back to our trailers to get ready I had this amazing costume on Maris had on this beutiful costume same as mine she looked prettier though.We are all gasping for breath this is the best moment of my life.

Life in the circus can have the upsides and its downsides. My trailor is medium size and its taken good care of. I get up each morning throw on some sweat and a t-shirt and head down to the pie car where we all eat. I sit at the table with all of my friends and watch the crew all set up for tonights performance. Me and my friends all talk about tonights performance. We get two hours to eat then we have to go to the schoolhouse. It's like any other school, we have computers, tests, and report cards. All through class I was thinking about tonights performance. We are in Austrailia tonight and it has been my dream to perform here ever since I joined the circus. As soon as I knew it class was over and we all left the schoolhouse. This is the time where me and mt friends have a fun time.            Sam, Emily, and me all run out and go play with the performers before we have to practice. We play with the juggling balls, the unicycle, which I am terrible at, and we play with the elephants. We all run over to the horses and feed them. I am in all the horse acts with Emily. Sam gets to go on the high blance beam. We all say goodbye and go practice. We all had to get ready for the big performance tonight.                Me and Emily are on the trampolines practicing our flips when the horses come over. We jump fromm the trampoline onto the horses back, we have to be concentrated and worry about our balance. We all tired after that! Me and Emily walk over to Sam where she is practicing her acrobatics. She is the best at them. We all decided that we should eat dinner together and get pumped up for the big show.                We all had to rush back to our trailors after dinner and get ready. The show was getting ready to start, this is my dream coming true. I knew my family was out in the crowd supporting me. The time came is was out performing. The best part is I get to perform with my best friend. I just feel like I am in a different world. That was the best feeling ever.           Tonights show was the best! I am wiped out though. I walked back to my trailor slowly. I took off my costumes and got on my pjs. I sat there thinking about the performance and how it was the best! I sat there thinking about my family until sleep came over me. 	NN IN NN .

The crew is like my family, my family lives in Idaho. I see them every few mouths and sometimes they will come and watch me preform. I am 21 years old, I finished school and went to collage for about 2 and a half years. Then i found out that I could do so much more. I bet your wondering why I just dident finish collage right? Well that's because my best friends uncle was in the circus and we went to see him pro forum. I was amazed at what i had just saw. I asked him if I could join but he said it wasent that easy. He made me train for 2 years before he would let me preform. So I worked long and hard before I could do what I really wanted and thats the tightrope. One of the haredset things known to man, walking on a thin long line was just as bout as close to impossible as you can get. After three long years I was able to pro forum.         As a circus prefourmer there's not a time that im not busy. Hers my morning routine-       feed lions at 6:00 am. practice from 6:30 to 7:30 am. clean cages at 8:30am  hang and make posters for are next show at 9:00am.   give all 5 show dogs a bath at 10:00 am       Every has there part. You have to do your chores like every other house hold only ares are a little bit more extreme.         We have a show every other mouth and in every mouth is a different place. We travel all across the world finding good spots to hold are circus.        Well that's just a small part of my big everyday life. As you can see we do a lot around here. We are always busy but we always have fun.                                                                                          -the end                       by-McKenzie L.

When Micheal was training for tightrope walking,there was an earthquake and he lost his balanced and fell down really far and broke his right leg! He said that he needed for someone to take over while he was in the hospital.Then,his best friend Cody told him he would take over and then Cody sprung into action.           Cody was really worried. He didn't know a thing or two about circus acts or tightrope walking! Sarah,really perfect circus performer,taught him the basics.First,she taught him how to juggle bowling pins and other objects.He kept failling and failling and failling but then pretty soon he got the hang of it. Second, she taught him how to tame a lion and it was a piece of cake for him.Finally,she taught him how to balnce how to do tightrope walking and he was really worried on this part. After 3 tries, he finally manage to do it and then the circus was a sucsess and Micheal recovered from is injury an told Cody he did a great job and thanked him for filling in.               THE END                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	RB , EX VBD DT NN VBN NNP CC PRP VBD IN DT NN NN VBD JJ NNP NNP '' CC PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN DT NN , CC CD NN , NN VBD VBN IN PRP VBD VBG IN NN NNP NNP NNP VBD VBG IN NN VBG , EX VBD DT NN CC PRP VBD PRP$ VBN CC VBD RP RB RB CC VB PRP$ NN NN .

Second,the fun stuff i would want to do is be a clown because you can draw alot of stuff.You can be funny and do alot of different voices and dress up funny.Another thing i would want to do is be a circus juggler because you get to throw stuff in the the air when almost every one is looking at you also because you have to concentrat and practice alot.       conclusion:               everyone would like to go to the circus i know that i would want to go to a circus because you get to eat different food and watch different acts at the circus.

Just like sports you have to pratice over and over and do the same thing in the circus. You start off with eating breakfest while your crew sets up things such as lights, and music for the upcoming show.                          After finishing up eating breakfest you will go to school, like any other school you have test, computers, and report cards. Many of your classmates may speak different languages you haven't heard because people come from all over the world. Your classmates may speak languages such as Italian, German, French, and spanish.                                            When school is over you get a quick break many people may start doing differnt things like juggle balls. Clowns might even ride their unicycles.                            Once it's almost time to start people practice or do chores. The trainer will feed, water, and groom all the animals for the act. While the trainer does that everyone else will be practicing what they will do at the act.                              Just a few hours away from the act people go to the pie car to eat dinner, since they are going to preforming that night most of them don't eat much. Some circuses will do usually 10 shows in one single week.                              Finally when the show is over everyone is tired and start to walk toward their trailer to go to sleep as they pass by they see the circus offices, concession stands, and stables.                               While this must sound fun they must continue on their tour without their family with them to support them and talk to them. So life as a circus actor isn't as easy as you think.

An hour later we were sitting on the bleachers waiting for the show to start when a clown came out in a little car with polka dots on it.

You do not get payed alot of mony. you spend your nights sleeping in a trailer. and your place to act is always a different place. I think it will be hard.       Being in the curcus is a prosses that takes alot of effort. if you do good you can have fun doing it. you get to entertain people wich I think is really cool. you get to preforme tricks like backflips cartweels and you can acrobatics there is a big adduence.       In the morning you have to wake up at six o-clock. you go to a cart and get toast and orange juice. after that you have to practice before the cucuise. at night you get out of your cotume and wash your costume and go to bed. the next morrning you have to do the same prosses         	VBG DT NN NN VBZ RB VBG PRP VBZ NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP VBP RB VB VBN NN IN NNP PRP VBP PRP$ NNS VBG IN DT NNP CC PRP$ NN TO VB VBZ RB DT JJ NNP PRP VBP PRP MD VB NNP NNP IN DT NN VBZ DT NNS WDT VBZ NN IN NNP IN PRP VBP JJ PRP MD VB VBN VBG NNP PRP VBP TO VB NNS WDT PRP VBP VBZ RB NNP PRP VBP TO VB NNS IN NNS NNS CC PRP MD NNS RB VBZ DT JJ NNP NNP DT NN PRP VB TO VB RP IN CD NNP PRP VBP TO DT NN CC VB JJ CC NN NNP IN DT PRP VBP TO NN IN DT NNP IN NN PRP VBP RP IN PRP$ NN CC NN PRP$ NN CC VB TO NNP DT JJ NN PRP VB TO VB DT JJ NNS	0		20131023220152	537	1		20131024102107	539	0		20131025144758	543	0

The circus is really fun there's a lot of different shows and sketches.A couple of them are magic tricks,circus clowns, acrobats,jugglers,and many other things.The circus is a good place to have a laugh.I remember the first time i went to the circus i saw many shows it was very funny with all the clowns and other things.The clown was very funny it was my favorite one there the clown picked me as a volunteer it was fun i had too help get the lion out of the cage.

Next, I will go to the circus and get things ready so the circus crew can practice all their routines for the show.               10:00 am I will go to school. The school I go to is not a regular school. This school that travels with us for everyone who needs to be at school and is in the circus. Many of my classmates speak a lot of different languages like: Italian, Russian, and Spanish like my family.                3:30 pm School is over. Then, I will start heading to the circus and start practicing my juggling and acrobats. I really like my routines. They are so fun. But sometimes they are scary because I feel like I am going to fall.                 5:00 pm I will come home and eat dinner. I eat dinner with my family. Sometimes my family and I eat food like: hamburgers, tacos, and chicken. But we do not eat so much because we are performing. If we eat a lot on the night we are performing we might have an accident during the show. We do 5 shows a week: one Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.                 9:30 pm The show is over. I`m really tired. My family and I are going home. Two days from now we will have another show. Now I am home. I`m in bed thinking about my next show. I can`t wait until my next show. I really like my shows. They are really fun because I like to practice my juggling and acrobats.             10:00 pm I`m trying to go to sleep. But still thinking about when the tour is over. When our tour is over we will go back to our regular home in Hemet CA. When I grow up, will I still be a circus performer? Who knows? The circus is fun but tough.

High flying, tight rope, and much more.Circus proformers get to travel all over the world going on tours.The circus proformers work very hard to become who they are. Circus proformers travel as much as 20,000 miles in seven months visiting more than 150 cities.          You may want to become a circus proformer but is hard work. Circus proformers get up at seven am and go to bed as late as 10:30. In the morning they eat at the same place everyday. All the profomers go to school fromm 9:00 to 3:00 then they get ready for their circus matinee.          After reading this story about the circus and you still want to become a proformer it is extemely hard work. You need to bee fit and be willing to be away from home for several months. You need to have lots of talent with the type of circus act you will be doing. Most circus proformers start young and work their way up to be a a circus proformer. Everyone wants to be in the circcus and you can if you work har.

It's a great feeling it feels so exciting it's a great experience. But you have to do allot like wake up early eat breakfast get ready, go to school, practice for the show, and finally what I love the most perform in front of that crowd. It makes me happy making the audience laugh and shout. And we can put up signs to tell people that we're coming in town. At night we somersault off horses, we tightrope walk, we juggle, we do acrobatics, and we make people laugh from our clown. thats why i love being in the circus.

Guillot                                  George was 11 years old, and wanted to be a circus preformer when he grew up. He had talent and confidence, and knew he could do it some day. George could do flips and jumps like never before. He was simply a dare-devil. He was a very brave boy with very good reflexes. He saw a flier that read, ' We are looking for people with great talent that is confident and brave enough to be shot out of a canon! Join the circus today!' George kept the flier for years and years.            Years later, George was eighteen years old. He was at his beautiful, new house, unpacking the last box. When he unpacked that box, he saw the same flier that he had kept since he was 11. He had just remembered that he wanted to be a circus preformer. He went to the new contest to join, and showed his skills and bravery!            A week later, he got a note reading, 'Congrats! You won the contest to join the circus! Come to the same place as you did last time for the show tomorrow night. See you there!' George was very happy to hear this news, since it has been his dream for years! He finally got to his goal in life! George always knew that he had what it takes!            The night of the circus, George had to sign a contract in order to preform. When he went into the stadium, he was a little nervous. He was mostly amazed of all of the obsticals and animals. He warmed up and went into the stadium on a tight rope! When he got down from the rope, he got launched out of a canon, and hung his feet on the bars connected to the ceiling. George landed on an elephant, and rode it out of the stadium.            After the show, George was wiped out! He went into a trailor to sleep in while he is changing into pajamas and sleeping there. George knew that the show was great, and it amazed the crowd of people! He had a dream about what will happen in the next show.                       In the morning, George felt great. He went to the pie car for eggs and bacon. He also had orange juice to drink, because he didn't want to drink soda for breakfast. George was exited to go to the next show in Louisiana! It was far, but worth the long wait. He was just so exited about it though.            That night, he arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana. Another clown told George that they would be in a parade for Mardi Gras! He knew that Mardi Gras was a big holiday in the whole state! Alot of people were there for the parade to start. George was throwing necklaces and dabloons into the crowds from a float. After that, he started doing backflips in the very top of it! The parade was over, and George was even more tired than the last show. He did the same thing as he did at the end of the last show, and in the morning.            After George ate breakfast, he was ready to go back home for a while. When he got home, he was happy to have a job as a circus preformer, and loved it! He was wore out after every show, but he didn't care. The only thing he really cared about is accomplishing his dreams.

Also we have clowns, acrobats, rope walkers, lions, tigers, bears, elephants, and also dancing horses. What we all do at the circus is entertain the audience. The best part about the circus not including me is the dancing horses, because when they dance it sounds like they are stepping at a step show.           The type of clothes we wear at the circus are funny clothes. Funny clothes are clothes that make people laugh at you. The most people laugh at the clowns because the clowns wear the funniest and most colorful clothes. Also they laugh at the clown because the clown does crazy things such as falling on the floor on purpose and dancing crazy.           At the circus there are different people or animals performing at one time. Also the circus is so big that they probably have a gift shop and plenty of snack machines. Also did you know that every year the circus give out free circus tickets! Also some circus tickets be in restaurants and stores.

I don't really like that name but I do sometimes. I don't know how that name got started.Or who started it.       I would like to be in the circus because I would LOVE to be a tightrope walker. I always walked on a branch and that is how I got my balance. I would like to walk on rope instead of a branch.'It looks scary.' But at the same time it looks fun at the same time!'       I hope I won't fall the rope.I wonder if there is something to catch you? I have one more question has anyone fell off the rope before?Oh sorry I just have one more question how high is the rope?.How much does it cost to be in a circus?Also has anyone did tricks on the rope?sorry i had so many questions. Also I hope i didn't waste your time?       Now i think i am done asking question. Okay back to the tightrope walker conversation. I hope it will be fun walking on the rope. I could get nervous walking on the rope but it is worth it. So please let me in the circus.I have more questions but I will let you go.

But being a performer for the circus is not easy  because doing the performer for the circus takes six months to be a performer.But being a clown is the easiest thing to do for the circus because all you have to do is be a good acting clown.If you fail for performing or being the clown you'll be fired for performing and being a clown.           If you want to be a performer or be a clown you have to sign in and you have to wake up at 7:30 am,if you be late all the time you'll be fired and no more chances.You have to practice and practice and practice to be a profechinal to be a circus performer.   When your seeing the performer you will love it because people from the circus is talented.

He loved it so much that he has a huge pet named circus, he is an elephant.       Every time Bob would say circus talking to a freind or his boss circus would come to him adimadicly. If Bob would yell for him he would trample over anything to get to him, he would run through a brick wall to help him.       Nothing would seperate them, not even nails on a bored. Thats the whole reason that Bob loved the circus. He liked the circus but with Circus he loved the Circus.

But overall my life is not ordinary!              Every morning when I wake up, I eat breakfeast, and get dressed to go to school. But I don't go to a reagular school. We have a one room school house in our trailer. That's where I go to school. Like any normal school we take test, and have grades, and report cards' and all that stuff. But unlike other schools ours is of course only one room, and it travels with us on the trailer. Also many of my classmates speak a forien language.            When school is over insted of going straight to homework, and chores like a normal girl would do I actually get a short break. During my break I juggle, and ride unicycles.             But, after that I have to do my chores. Some of my chores are things like taking care of the circus animals, and  helping get ready for our next show.              Once I am finished with my chores it is dinnner time. We must eat lightly or we will be to full to perform. Once we are finished we head down to tonights show.               I am exited tok watch the show, and know that someday I will be a part of that. But I am also exited to come home and get some sleep. Living life in the circus is both complecated and exiting. I hope that some day you will live your dream just like I am mine.

Before the show starts and after the show,they let people ride on my back.  In the show I do a special trick, me and my fellow elephants stand up on our hind legs and balance a ball on our trunk and toss it to another elephant,until we get our ball back.  Another trick we do is stick our trunks into a bucket of water and stand on our hind legs and SQUIRT WATER EVERY WHERE.                          After the circus is over we load up and go to bed and we are at another city by the morning.We practice in the morning and all the way to when the show is about to start and people start to pile in.  I always want to make the little kids smile and be happy.                 We just love to make every body happy. I love what I do as an  elaphant.

It actually is vary hard.You need to be good at a ton of things to be in the circus.You have to travel from place to place every few days, you have to practice a lot, and you have to every stunt well or else the crowd might leave the show.There are upsides and downsides.      Getting started as a clown isn't as easy as you think. You have to be determined and be in good shape. You also have to be good at performing and doing whatever you are asked to do.      Some upsides are that you get to travel the world performing circus acts. Some downsides are that you have to practice a lot, you spend a lot of time away from home, and you have to work long days.      It takes a lot of skill to be in the circus. You have to be good at doing lots of things. Plus you get to travel the world performing.   Being a circus performer isn't easy to do.

Being in the circus isn't as easy as it looks.I'd like to be in a sport but where never in one place.If im not traveling then im practicing or at school.       Theres only three other kids in the circus so I dont really have any friends in the circus.I performe with my Uncle.Im working on being an acrobat.Thats what I wanted to be before I came here,but they said I had to be twelve im only eleven.       I wanted to quit the circus,but im only one year away from becoming an acrobat.The reason why I wanted to quit was because I have to in a pie car, never get to see my friends or family and I have to travel so much.       I have to live in a trailer with my Uncle.Every breakfast,lunch ,and dinner I have eat in a pie car,but the worst thing is,is that I only go to school two days a week.This circus stuff is really wearing me out.

Hello I'm Calypso, an Arabian Circus horse born with an attitude. When I came into the world it was in the middle of the Circus. My mother who was pregnant had such cruel care givers that they didn't notice that she was pregnant until in the middle of a show she gave birth to me. Some little 11 year old girl ran from the stands and helped my mother with everything. Now that little girl is my owner and she is not so little anymore. She is now 22 and her name is Brooklyn. Brooklyn and I are the stars of the show in the Barnum and Bailey Circus. Our signature move is when Brooklyn is standing on my back while I'm loping and I jump a 5 ft fire lit pole and we make it every time because we trust eachother so much. When she is on me she becomes part of me. It is just so magnificent. Well anyway today we were doing our signature trick and the pole was not balanced right so the pole fell right of when I jumped over. Before we knew it the whole tent was on fire. Brooklyn ran me outside and when everyone else ran all over the place  Brooklyn called the Fire Depatment. Then she ran back into the tent and sprinted back out with as many animals or animal halters with an animal atached to the end as she could. She raced in and out until everyone and every animal was out of the burning tent. She went in to take one last look around and thats when a beam that held the tent up fell directly on her. She was screaming for help. I raced in there as fast as I could and pushed and pushed until the beam was off Brooklyn. Then I helped hr onto my back and carried her all the way to the hospital. She turned out all right but if I had not gotten the beam off of her that fast she would of died. When we got back to the Circus the fire was put out and I was known as the horse her saved her owners life.

That would be horrible.If that happened i would never perform again.Luckily, my parents own the circus and i wouldn't really be the ruined one but still ill be ruined.I told my parents i was stage fright but they said that everything would be OK.They also said that i have to perform and that if i get scared to just imagine that i was all alone in my room.Having a  family that owns a circus is only sometimes fun, it can get really boring we have to travel all over the world but I'm still not used to performing because of my stage fright.The show is in two hours Ive been practicing for three days I'm so nervous .I'm going to go practice be right back.I'm back and there's one more hour till the show i practiced for another hour. The show is about to start and my parents are doing the first act, my father is walking the tightrope and my mother is a clown.When they are finished it will be my turn.Oh no it's my turn be right back I'll try my best.I'm back i got wiped out but surprised of how good i was. Everyone cheered for me i had so much fun.For now on i will always perform.

You have to eat right and stay in shape. It is hard to be in the circus as hard work as they work if you had to do the thing they do. They have to walk on ropes, breathe fire, and a lot of hard thing that you would not even thing of doing I hope. THere is a lot of bad thing about the circus too. You have to have long trips, wake up early, and a lot to do.             Why I think it is hard to stay in shape is because if you dont eat alot you will be hungry if you eat alot then you will be full before a shoe. What do you do in that case. Staying in shape is hard but not that hard. You just need to work out and go to that gym. But that is two reasons why being in the circus is har and not fun to be in.            My other reason why it is fun to be in the circus is because you get to walk on some ropes. It might be dangerous but it might be fun. Most trapeze preformers have a net below the rope if they fall. Some trapeze preformers think that they are so good that they dont need a net but if they fall they are not good anymore.            Other reason why it is fun to be in the circus is that you get to breathe out fire if you are the fire eater or something like that. I dont know how they do that but they get a big long stick with fire on it and puy it in there mouth. That is so cool and dangerous alot of poeple think that is cool why I don't know. That is my other reason why bering in the circus is fun.            My othe reason why it is fun to be in the circus is because you get to do a lot of stuff that you don't see everyday. People practice a lot of how you stuff that is fun nd cool. You should thank people if you go to the circus because they but a lot of work in to it. Please it is not easy to but fire down you mouth, or walk on thin ropes and if you think it is than try.That was my last reason why the circus is fun and some reason why it is not fun.            I would love to be in a circus but I have to be more.

I can now do it correctly with my partner, so that means that i need to try on my costume. It fits perfectly.       It is now just before the show anjd i am getting ready. I am very nervous because if i fall of the rope there is no net to catch me, and i can get hurt.

I do the trampeze and the tightrope.                                         The Trampeze        The trampeze is scarier to me because it's very high up. The trampeze is a metle bar hung by two very, very strong strips of rope.                                         The Tightrope        I love the tightrope because it takes balanceand I love balance exersises. The tightrope is a piece of thin wire  held up by two poles.                                         The Beggining   First I was in a very small un populer circus called Dreams Circus. One show was in Miami,Florida, there was a performer  from Ringling Brothers there he was impressed by my skills on trampeze and tightrope. He invted me to be in thier circus with them,I said yes.                                             Right now    Right now I'm working full time Ringling Brothers We travel nonstop during the year.We go to different coutries.Our next show is in Miami,Florida.

Another thing that hapens in the circus is not just anyone can be in a circus you have to be acrobat or a trapeze artist you need to have a specific talent the right body type and be very determined.

Bella woke up to the loud noise of horses running around. She had slept at the Jiggly-Doo Circus! Bella quickly went to the trailer, changed her clothes, and did her hair. She was ready to practice at the Jiggly-Doo Circus. Her father was training the lions to jump through a ring of fire. Her mother was doing gymnastics. Bella's job was to do tricks on a horse.           The next circus show was going to start in a couple of hours.   All of the performers were practicing their hardest because the mayor of the town was going to watch. It was very loud in the Jiggly-Doo Circus because all the performers were there. Bella was so nervous that she did not even feel like practicing. It was hard to work in a circus, for Bella, because none of her friends were with her. She did not have anyone to talk to nor did she have anyone to play with.       The circus was going to start in a couple of minutes. The circus   manager came in with a worried look on his face. 'Bella Wakefield, you're going to have to walk on the tightrope. Our tightrope walker went home, sick.' Bella wanted to burst into tears because she did not know how to walk on a tightrope. Finally, her father said,' Don't worry, Bella. If you think you can do it, you know you can do it.' Bella was comforted by this and stood headstrong. The Jiggly-Doo Circus was off to a great start. The host, Jim West, welcomed everybody with a warm smile. Bella was going to walk on the tightrope.

One day she wanted to be the greatest of the greatest in the Circus.       When she was 12 years old she was training to be an acrobat. Her parents were so   cruel and they were such braggarts. Tammy said that she would be better than them one day but her parents would just laugh at her. One day Tammy was going to do her first show! Her parents were standing there watching. They were hoping that she would mess up and fall. Tammy was ready for this day and she did not want to mess up. When the show started the lights were on her. Everyone was watching her and only her. It was so quiet that you can hear a pin drop. Suddenly the music started. She climbed the satin pink cloth and she twisted her self around it. She was so elegan and graceful the audience loved her. They clapped so loudly that her parents almost fell down. Now, the star is born!       Now, Tammy started doing shows all around the country! Her parents were not   even noticed. She was being really popular. Now her parents were furious with her. They tried to break her leg so she will lose fame and they will earn it. Tammy knows her parents very well now. She knows what do. She will run away tonight and do all kinds of shows by herself.       Now Tammy is a very popular and her parents are too lazy to even do shows.   Tammy is very happy and she will always be at the Circus.

I work in the amazing circus called THE EXTRAVAGANZA. I started working there when I was only a little girl. People may think that working in a circus is fun, and that you get to play around all the time. But no, it's not like that. If you want to be in a circus, remember there is a whole lot of work ahead of you. But at the same time, it is not torture.                              Everyday, I wake up at 7:00 A.M. I get ready, and go to the pie car for breakfast. Today is the big show, so the crew is getting everything ready. Then, at 9:00 A.M. it's school time. We have a tiny one-room schoolhouse that travels with us. We have all the advantages that a normal school would have such as, computer, tests, report cards, etc. My classmates are from all over the world, so we experience many different languages. As we travel around the country, our geography lessons come alive.               At 3:00, school is finally over. I get to play with my little dog, Brownie. We are not allowed to keep big dogs because of our miniature trailer. Later, at 3:30 P.M. I do my chores like, grooming, feeding the animals for tonight's show. My parents are practicing their solo act. My dad is going to somersault off a running horse, and my mom is going to walk a tightrope. I am going to train animals to do tricks. At 6:30, we eat our dinner. Finally, it is time for the show!               It is 10:45, and the show is over. I am exhausted. Then, at 12:00, I am ready to sleep. Every show night, I go to sleep thinking that two days from now I will have to do another show.               As you can see, my life is not only fun, but tough. My life is a circus!

I am Emma, the tightrope walker. As a circus performer, we do many different jobs. For example, you may be wondering, why is a tightrope walker jumping through a hoop of fire? Well, that is why I am going to take you on a journey to see what a circus performer does and how I got interested in being one.                     First, in a circus, you have to be and early bird because we sleep at  12:00 and we have to wake up at 7:00. In a typical day, I go to the pie car, go to school, have some free time, have dinner, and have a circus performance. After all my shows I am wiped out! As a tightrope walker, it takes a lot of balance and concentration, so I have to practice five hours everyday!                     Next, let me tell you how I got interested in being a  tightrope walker. When I was young, I had a habit of balancing myself and walking on the terrace. My whole family performed in circuses, but I was too young to start performing. But, when the day came, I showed the crowd what my talent was, walking on a tightrope. Later, it was said, I was going to be the tightrope walker for all my shows.                    Lastly, as I got older, my dad told me that I was old enough to do different stunts, not only the tightrope walk. You may be wondering, is'nt it hard doing different performances at once? Yes, it is very hard, but being in the circus meant a lot of training and I wanted to win my dream and be a circus performer. There are many ups and downs of being a circus performer, but I don't want to let down my family and quit the circus.                    Today is my last show and I want to show the world who I really am. Today, I am walking on the tightrope, getting shot out of a canon, and jumping through a hoop of fire. As I walk on the tightrope step by step, I see the crowd staring at me in astoshment as I jumping off the tightrope and land perfectly in the canon. I get shot and make an amazing flip through the hoop of fire. I was the star of the show. As you can see, being a circus performer means a lot of hard work in order to accomplish your goals.

The pie car doesn't have the best food, but it is the best you will get around here. I then heard a scream when I was in the middle of biting my bacon. I ran to the tent to see our show host looking at the broken leopard cage. I then saw a shade of blue on the lock. All of the circus performers then walked out of the tent to find the leopard. I then met up with my close friend Puly, which is his obvious nickname. He is always bugging me about not having a pet and always about his nails. This might seem odd, but his favorite hobby is painting his nails blue. He paints a different shade every day. Other than that, he is a pretty cool person.            We were both looking for the leopard together, but he wasn't that worried or paying much attention. But whenever i got near his trailer, he would wonder off another way as if he didn't want me near his trailer. I probably figured it was because that was where he kept his nail polish stashed. And since he is always braging about it, he might think that I am jealous and I want some. That's when I relized were the leopard went. God, icould notice that shade of blue any where by now. I felt dumb not knowing that it was him.            I then aproached Puly and dragged him to his trailer and kicked the door open. The leopard was found.

Being in the circus has it""s upsides and it""s downsides. The upsides of being in the circus are that you get a chance to travel around the world, and you get to meet people from all over the planet.The downsides are that circus workers work long days and spend a lot of time away from home.this is what one circus performer thought:&ldquo;On tour, you  don""t really have anywhere to call home and you're always thinking about that night""s show.I miss my home and garden and I don""t see my family.You have to work long hours and weekends as well.&rdquo;       If you work in the circus you would only get 7 hours of sleep if you had Bella""s schedule.I would not want to be in the circus because I do not want to be traveling.I am not the kind of person who likes long trips.       Being in the circus doesn't look that bad because I like animals. So if I were to work in the circus I wold like to be working with :       Lions Tigers Chimpanzees Horses Elephants Leopards           Being in the circus could also be fun because you can do cool tricks like:       being a circus juggler being a circus tightrope walker being a circus acrobat           Being a circus performer is fun but it can be can be hard work.                  Becoming a Circus performer               Not just anyone can be a circus performer.You need to have the right body type ,be determined ,and have a specific talent.For example, Phillippa did musical theatre, ballet, music, singing, and acting when she was five years old.then when she was eleven, she knew that she wanted to be a performer .She then gave up everything and concentrated on dancing and performing.

Then he decided to go to the circus and see how the professionals juggled. He took two bottles from the dumpster and decided to juggle the way the professional did. It was very hard and he couldn't keep the bottles in the air for ten seconds. He tried again and again, but couldn't seem to improve. He wanted to quit, but he would rather keep trying than go back to the dumpster. He practiced in the circus for weeks and weeks. Finally he got the hang of two bottles and then started adding more. After a month of practicing, he decided to juggle in the circus. He went to the circus owner and showed him how he could juggle. He was very tensed and couldn't keep the bottles in the air.            Then he decided to leave when the owner said that he could be a clown. That seemed to be a good idea at that time. He messed up a lot, but that was what made that funny. He was hired to be a clown and, if he could improve juggling, he could be a juggler too.             It was the day to perform everybody was waiting for my tricks, and it was very funny.             These days, you can still see him in the circus. He is a famous juggler and a clown. He sometimes says that life in the circus is hard, but he likes it a lot better than the dumpster.

You see, I work at a circus and we constantly travel. So, we live in these. A thought was nagging me at the back of my mind. I knew it was important, but I just couldn't place it.            Suddenly, my mom, in her acrobat's suit jumped into my room. 'Get up, you need to have a good breakfast, so you will energy to parctice for tonight!' Tonight, I thought. What was tonight? But, I sat up groggily and changed out of my pajamas.            I went to the pie car and grabbed a bagel. I ate it slowly, still not fully awake. After that I went to school. Today, I had a test. Was that what I forgot? No, my mom said tonight.            At 3:30 I went to take care of and train the animals. I saw my friend Annie waiting or me. We both trained the animals but I had to do the acts on stage. 'I suppose you know what to do for tonight,' she said. There it was again. Tonight.  What was so important that happened tonight? 'Uh, I guess so,' I replied. I started handing out meat for the tigers. They ate happily.            At dinner everyone was a little nervous.They didn't eat much. But I took a baked potato and slice of pizza with fries on the side. I sat down at the table my mom was sitting at. 'Why are you eating so much?' she asked. 'Is there something wrong with that?' I wondered. 'Yes, tonight is the biggest show of the year.' she hissed. I gasped. How could I forget that? I only ate my slice of pizza and ran off to practice even more.           Before I knew it, show time came. I ran on to the stage for my part and did my acts: jumping from a diving board, twirling in the air, and landing on a circus elephant. I did it. The crowd roared in approval. After that everyone clapped me on the back saying I did great. I was a little uncomfortable with all the attentinon, but I was still glad. The day had ended on a happy note.

I haven't been home in a long time, and I really miss my family. But sometimes, when I am performing, I know my family is watching me on T.V. But on the bright side, I have made many good friends in the circus. My life is busy, busy, busy. We visit a lot of cities every week to perform. The act I am now learning is very dangerous. I am practicing how to juggle knives.       I have always wanted to be on a basketball team, but we don't have time. We do have school though, our classroom is full of people who speaks languages that I don't understand because, they are different people from around the world. It is really fun to travel as we can really see what the teacher was talking about in the geography lesson.       Becoming a circus performer takes a lot of practice and skill. Everybody has always asked me, 'What did you always want to do in a circus?' I would always reply, 'A circus acrobat.'

My name is Emily Johnson , and my family is at the circus. It will be in our town for the next three days. When my brother, David, and I found out that we were going to the circus, we were both ecstatic. In fact, I want to be a circus performer when I grow up. We got into the car and drove until we reached the circus. Once we are inside, we sit down in our seats and wait for the performance to start. It is noisy , and everyone is anxious to see the trapeze artists, the acrobats, and all of the animals.   At last, the performance begins, and everyone is suddenly   silent. The music starts and we see the animals start to file out. There are elephants, horses, monkeys, and many more. They are all doing tricks with their trainers. We all watch in awe as the trapeze artists and tightrope walkers start their peformance. Next come the acrobats. It must take balance, hard work, and concentration to be a circus performer. Before I know it, the performance is over.   We are led to the back where we are informed that we have the   lucky seat numbers and that we are allowed to meet the circus performers. Because I am interested the most by the tightrope walkers, I ask to meet them. When I ask them how they decided to become a circus performer, one replies. 'I knew that I wanted to be a performer at a young age. You just have to go for it and give everything else up.' she says. 'Is it fun to travel around a lot?' I ask. 'Yes, because we get to travel the world, go to so many places, and meet different people that all enjoy watching us perform. However, we sometimes miss our family and our home. When we are performing we have to move constantly. We also work from sunup to sundown.' another circus performer says.   Before, I wanted to be a circus performer when I grew up. Now,   I know that circus life is fun but also has its downsides. They experience the joy of performing in front of a live audience, and get to travel to many places, performing tricks. However, they have to travel often, work from sunup to sundown, and give up everything else. For now, I'll just settle for watching the circus performance instead. 	NN `` '' WP VBZ IN NN .

I wake up at 7:00 AM sharp and eat breakfast in the pie car, it is a trailer where we eat. While then the crew gets the tent ready. It is huge. Now it is 9:00, time for school. My school is a small room where there are computers, desks, and a teacher that travels with us. There are children who speak Russian, Italian, and French. Now I look outside and I see the geograhy lesson in real life.                      Now it is 3:00 school is out for today. I go and groom a horse. My father calls to me he says,' I finally figured out how to do a handstand on a ball while holding rings with my feet.' I say great and go and practice my trick. It is doing a juggling act on a tightrope. I fall but luckly there is a net under me. My mother is practicing tricks with a lepord. Them suddenly I hear someone saying,' Callia. Can you help me here.' Right a way I knew that was my mother. I raced to her. I thought she was in danger because of the lepord but to my suprise the lepord sat down and wouldn't get up. I helped my mom and went back to my practice.      Now it is time for the show I was nervous but my mom said,'I  don't think there is anything to worry about Callia. You did great in your practice and you will do great in this show too.' So I did do great in my show and my mom and dad had no trouble at all.

There are both upsides and downsides to living in a circus.            As a circus performer, I get a chance to travel around the world and visit many places. But I work from sunup to sundown and spend a lot of time away from home. If you decide to work in a circus, you need to have a specific talent, the right body type and be very determined. Not everyone can become and acrobat or a trapeze artist.            You have to wake up early and live in a train most of the time. You might need to learn to understand many different languages because circus performers come from all around the world.            To be a circus actor, you need to have patience, balance, and concentration. The stunts might seem a bit dangerous. You might be bitten by a lion or a tiger. You might crack your skull somersaulting off a running horse of leaping from a trampoline onto a running horse.            In a circus, you have to perform every day and usually 10 times a week.            So now you see what hard work it is to be in a circus. You might change your mind now about wanting to perform in a circus.

How it would always be fun? Well, sadly, its not all fun and games. It takes talent, practice, and deteramnation . I know becaus I, myself am in the cricus       Well I wake up about 7:00 am, and go to the pie car to eat with all the other performers as the crew prepares lights, tents, and music. After I eat I head to the school house. Its like a normal school. There are kids from all over the world that are in the circus so many can speak other laungues.       Schools over and its about 3:00 pm now. I get to rest for 30 mintues before I began my chores and start practicing.I only have 3 hours untill I eat dinner then go to the show.      About 4 hours of working, i go back to the trailer and get ready for bed.      The circus is fun, but its a busy and hard life. You must have talent, a certain body type, be very determined, and have great focus.       Not all the circus is bad, there are upsides, like getting to travel the world and meeting new people and learning new cultures.       So, do you have what it takes to join the circus?

My father is the ringmaster, my mother is the trapeze artist, my brother is a clown, and I am an acrobatist. I have been to every state in America at least once, and I have been to Japan, Turkey, Costa Rica, and Italy for a world tour.   Most people think that being in a circus would be the best thing ever, but it isn't. I have to wake up a 6:30 every morning, eat a quick, light breakfast, go do a few hours of school, then go and practice my act until lunch at 11:45. After lunch, I do my chores and help anyone who needs help with something. Then I do an hour or two of more practice, and then it's time for the show. We do two shows each night (sometimes three) and always three on Saturday and Sunday too. Another bad thing about circus life is accidents. I lost concentration a few years ago on an act, and I fell and broke my leg, a rib, and my wrist. One year, my dad also lost three fingers when a lion got too excited. There have been other accidents too, but those we're the worst.

I'm an animal trainer at the Great American Adventure circus. We circus folks travel many places each day. We have a tight schedule for were we travel and what time we have to leave.             Being in the circus is not easy. You will have to wake up at atleast 5:30 in the morning and work all the way until 9:00 in the night. In the morning you will have to wake up and eat your breakfast. Afternoon you will have to get ready for the show. After the show is done, you go to the trailer and get a good night's sleep and wake up in the morning at a new place.            Many people do not join the circus because they think it is a crazy place with no fun. Well, I can assure you that they are absolutely wrong. The circus is a very fun place for people and it is NOT crazy. You will experience the job of your lifetime! You won't regret it if you join!             To have a circus job you will have to be talented and determined.   If you want to be a tightrope walker you will have to maintain a good balance. To be animal trainer like me you will have to work well with animals and be willing to take care of them. To be an animal handler you will have to be neat and be willing to walk the animals back to their cages.            Their is also a pie car, a place were the circus people eat. You can be a cook in the pie car. In the show, many people will come to see you, whatever job you have. Make sure to do your best and smile!

Early in the morning at 7:00 A.M. I wake up and go eat breakfast. In the pie car, I eat bacon and pancakes everyday. You may think that is luxurious but it gets boring after a while. Then I go to school at 9:00 A.M. like every other kid. Just because I live in a circus, doesn't mean I can skip school. Class is in one big schoolhouse that travels with us wherever we go. Parents may be thinking that kids won't learn as much, but the truth is, we all learn the samethings even if the schoolhouse is portable. We also get tests and report cards like everyone else.            School ends at 3:00 P.M. Then, we get a quick break for about 30 minutes. Then, we have to practice for 3 hours. Some people would practice juggling and others would practice aerobatics. At 6:30 P.M. I would eat dinner. I don't want to eat too much because I might vomit while performing. When performing, you think about all the practice you have done and say to yourself,'I cannot fail,' as you do your amazing trick. Once the performance is done you feel proud as the audience gives you a standing ovation, amazed of what everyone thought about the circus.            At 10:30 P.M. the circus is over. You feel very tired and you are ready to hit the hay. At midnight, you go to bed thinking about your family wishing you could meet them or even call them.

I live in a circus, doing acrobatics and horse-stunts. I was probably destined to be a horse-stunter, as my dad is the ringmaster. As for acrobatics, I'm like a rubberband- elastic. I am so flexible that one could twist me into a pretzel. Hi, I'm Yvonne Lutz, your average 11-year-old circus performer. I always wake up this early, so I'm so used to it, I don't even stretch anymore. I get dressed, brush my teeth, and go to the pie cart for breakfast. The pie cart is like a dining hall, except it is a moving dining hall. As usual, on the menu is pancakes and bacon. I eat up quickly so that I have time to rest before school at 9:00.                It is school time now.We only have one room, and like the pie cart, it is a moving school. My classmates all speak different languages from all over the world. I am French. We all get to learn about our lessons like history and geography hands-on, because as we move around, we get to experience many places with a wide range of historical and geographical views. Today we learn about Hopi Indians, as we are in Arizona, quite near to the Grand Canyon. We even get to see a medley of varieties of Hopi dances. Girls my age and even younger dance intricate foot patterns in noisy dresses. Noisy because they have shells that clang together, and as in loud, like gaudy. We go on a short one hour round-trip hike down into the canyon, learing about different plants we had never seen or heard of before, and their needs, adaptation, survival skills, and habitat, going deeper into it than 'desert' or 'canyon' or 'hot weather climate area.'                Now school is over at 3:00, and I can take a half hour break to let loose. This is when I write. I have a diary and a journal. I record the events that occur daily and school notes in my journal, why my diary holds my feelings, like my on-and-off hate for this hectic life. Sometimes I feel like I am going to explode.                 It is 3:30 now. Break time is over. I have to do chores and practice. My favorite routines are the trapeze, tightrope walk, and anything to do with horses catches my fancy as long as I get to ride in the routine. And sometimes, the stunts don't involve riding. I practice crazy stunts on galloping horses, and many dangerous acrobatics like the tightrope. Sometimes I lose my balance and fall into the net that is not very far down. I only stunt when there is a safety feature involved. I never mess up in a show, luckily. That would be extremely embarassing. I pratice for three hours so that everything is perfect for the show. After I practice, I quickly try on my costumes before dinner. My acrobatics outfit is a neon sequined head-to-toe suit. It is cross-hatched metallic pink, bright yellow, electric blue, neon orange, and a neon or metallic version of almost every color of the rainbow. There is an argyle pattern of red-orange, yellow-green, blue-purple, and pink-purple. Clear and silver sequins dot the entire thing. It is like feety pajamas in style. But it is tight on the body, and flexible, too. The back of it also extends above the neck, grasping tightly to the shape of my body until halfway up my head, where it flares out. A Marti-Gras type mask, patterned the same as my suit is attached, perfectly fitting my face. My horse-stunting cosume is the same pattern, but with different colors, like a sparkly black, white, cream, tan, and peach, and for the argyle print a metallic mahogany, cadet blue, cerulian, and mauve. The style is breeches, with a silk button down shirt and a velvet coat with a pea-coat collar. The helmet, I wear none of. That is just more of the danger, and to add on, my boots, patterned just as my riding clothes, are high heeled. They are knee-high, and cut off in triangle shapes on the two sides, the cut-outs about four inches deep. I stare at them in awe, as they are lovely. I am a colorful person, and therefore love them both, but the acrobatics outfit to a higher extent.                It is 6:30. I have a light dinner, and then go to the Big Top to perform, as that is the tent for the major acts. I perform, always nervous yet excited, and think about how amazingly I did in practice, and my confidence soars. As I finish my routine for the millionth- and last- time this night, I wipe the sweat of my face and smile, taking a bow with the rest of the crew.                 Wow! It was a long show as usual, but I'm always surprised by how long it is. It is now 10:30, and the show is over. I walk back to my trailer as slowly as a slug, as I am really tired. Once I get back, I brush my teeth and change.                  Now it is around 12:00. It is really late, and I pretty much collapse into my bed, falling asleep before the sheets even settle down.

Next, According to the text or source, the circus is all more fun than work families all over the country that they travel to that watch the circus mostly feel that would be an awsome job and it could be but not always, i like watching thje circus but i wouldn't feel like it would be the greatest job in the world but also if i got offered a job at the circus i would tzake if i was 18 or older just to have a job is a goodn thing but i think having a career is better.               lastly, the circus is a good job anb all but i want to set my goals to a higher standard but the circus might be a good job for people who want to have more fun in there job so if you think that you really like the circus life you should go fo it do what you love because your not going to have many oppertonities to get it so if you really like the circus you should join when you can because the only  come once a year and wont always apply.           To conclude this article if you really wanrt this job and yopu have it in your heart  to do you should because it imnportant toi do what you love because it changes you attitude about life and others .

There is also lots of entertaining things to see it you might want to see it again.There i also lots of funny shows like the clowns.Sometimes when the clowns shows up he calls a person from the audience and does a show it is very funny when they do the show.Sometimes each year they do something new but you never know what it is going to be.Or sometimes each year they don't do something that they did last year or two years.

We   also    get  report cards  .                                                                                              ?                                                                                                                                                                  People  in  the   circus  have  different  jobs .

Almost  all  of  the   people  that  work  in  our  circus  are  our  relatives.The  only  person  that  does  not  work in the the  circus  are  like  20  of   them .  My  mothers  family  is  really  big.My  fathers  family is  not  to  small  and  not  to   big   either.We   also  have  people  that  are  not  part  of  our  family,but  most  of them  are  .                                                                                                                                                                 We  also  have  people  that  speak  different  languages.Some  speak   Italian  ,french,Russian. My family   speaks  french. Me  and my  family  learned  how  to  speak    Spanish  and  other  languages  too.We  learned  different  languages  because  we  travel  almost  every were.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Some  of  the  tools  we  use  are   a   one  wheel  bicycle.juggling  balls.We  also  use  animals  to  do  acts  like  for  example:horses,seals,elephants.some  acts  we  do   are  juggling  while  riding  a  one  wheel  bicycle.We  also do  acrobats  .                                                                                                                                                                                  We  perform   all  weekend   and   months  we  always  work  .  When  we  finish   our  acts  we  eat dinner  and  wake  up  the  other  day   and  it is the  same  routine.         We also  have  chores .We eat  on   a   pie  car  a  pie  car  is   where  circus  performers  eat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Circus  acts  may  look  easy  for  some people   but  for  some  people  they  think    they  are  hard  .  The  circus  is  really  tough  . When  you  do  an  act  you  get  wiped  out . especially me  because  I  do   the  acrobats.

I start work at 6:00 am and get make up on and go to breakfast. i have to get my gear on so i can entertain kids at the circus.        It is fun to be a clown but it is still hard work. i never get bored though.   I wish every body could experience this.

You have to practice because you have to get everything right when its time for the show.  To get ready for the show you have to get everything you are going to use ready. When you have everything ready , its time for the show !!!!                                When you are performing a show, you have to know how to entertain an audience.

The other part of living in a circus is skill and training.skill and training is the hardest thing at the circus.It is hard because you have to praitice praitice praitice.skills is also hard to do because you have to be good at something that you know.Praitice is hard because you have to do it all over again till you know how to do it.The skills is the hardest thing to do like puting a whole watermelon in your mouth,caring two fat guys     	VBG IN DT NN IN NNP NN NNP PRP$ NN VBZ NN NN CC VBG IN DT NN VBZ VBN CC RB JJ IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ CC NN DT NN WRB PRP VBP DT NN VBZ IN PRP VBP VBN IN NNS PRP$ , PRP VBP TO VB CC PRP MD VB JJ NN NN CC NNP NN PRP JJ IN IN DT NN VBZ , PRP VBP TO VB RP JJ CC VB NN CC JJ PRP$ NN , PRP VBP JJ NN IN PRP VBP TO VB , CC PRP VBP CD NNS DT NNP NNP JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN VBZ RB CC NNP CC NN VBZ DT JJS NN IN DT JJ VBZ JJ IN PRP VBP TO VB NN NNS VBZ RB RB TO VB IN PRP VBP TO VB JJ IN NN WDT PRP VBP VBZ JJ IN PRP VBP TO VB PRP DT IN RB IN PRP VBP WRB TO VB JJ NNS VBZ DT JJS NN TO VB IN NN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN , VBG CD JJ NNS	1		20131023161902	539	1		20131023214900	545	1
