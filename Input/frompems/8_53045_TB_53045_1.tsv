The discoveries that have been made about the Inca have a great importance in the  history of many early civilizations. Their way of running and controling a civilization was very different then others because they had no form of alphabet or even a system of writing at that. They made knots in strings to record their calender. However, as of today noone knows the meanings of these knots which makes understanding the history of the Inca's very difficult, but also very unique because there is very limited history about them which means there is alot yet to still be found.       Also of great importance to early civilizations was the Pueblans. They were also very unique in their own way because they often followed a very nomadic life style. They got the nickname the 'Cliff Dwellers' because they built their dwellings underneath overhanging cliffs. Historians have shown that the Pueblo people occationally packed up and moved, which gave them their nomadic lifestyle. However the history stops here for the Puebloans because once they packed up and left Mesa Verde, their home for most of the time, they travled south probably into Mexico and Arizona, and were never really heard from again.       Finally, probably one of the most talked about and most interesting civilizatons of all time is the city of Neapolis which is belived to resemble in detail alot of the myths of the 'lost city of Atlantis'. What is so unique about this myth is that it truly was a lost city since it was thought to be submerged down into the deep ocean. This was finally discovered by a team known as Pavlopetri. This discovery was so magnificent because it is proven that this underwater city dates back to more than 5,000 years ago. 'It is by no doubt', described by Dr Jon Henderson, the oldest submerged town in the world.'

The Puebloans, the Greeks, the Incas, all were great civilizations.  What do they all have in common?  They all eventually failed.One of the main reasons we study these civilizations is to discover what made them fail.  Learning why ancient civilizations failed helps us learn about their civilization and make sure that we don't make the same mistakes they did.            The Incas were one of the most successful ancient civilizations. At the height of their power, the Incas occupied an area of land almost the size of the Roman empire.  The fall of the empire was caused by foreign invaders killing their king.  We learned know this because it was Spanish invaders who killed their king, who at the time had records of what happens, unlike the Inca.  If the Spanish had not recorded this, we could have discovered this by studying things from the Incas.  From studying the Incas, we learn that we should not immediately be trusting to new people.            Ancient Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde many years ago.  They were basket makers and would live in small houses called pithouses. As their populaton grew, they statred to expand their housing into stone houses with pithouses in front of them.  When their population reached several thousand, it started to drop, and the puebloan moved into the cliff dwelling that they had once occupied.  No one knows why this happened.  Eventually, we could find out why and make sure that we don't make the same mistake that they did, but only if we continue to study them.            Recently, a Greek civilization site was explored for the first time.  It is only now being explored because the site happens to be underwater.  From studying the remains of the site, archeologist have concluded that the city was submerged at around 1000 BC.  This is because pottery found at the site resembled pottery from the stone age, around 5000 years ago.  The only way that the city could have been submerged was if the sea level was rising, something that is happening today.  If we don't stop global warming, the icecaps will melt, and soon we will end up just like the Greeks, underwater.            By studying ancient civilizations, we learn more then just who they were and how they lived.  We see the evolution of their civilization, how they began, how they survived, and how they died.  By studying them, we can make sure that we don't make the same mistakes that they did, and that the human race always survives, and always thrives.

To want to know what happened before us, what is happening around us, and what will happen after us. Learning about entire civilizations before ours existed is an enormous leap in our understanding of our world. Not only can learning about the past contribute to our simple quest for knowledge, but it can in many cases help us improve what is happening around us. It is a well known and widely accepted fact that the more experience one has, the generally better prepared for life they are. As humans are limited by our short lifetimes, learning about those before us serves as our 'experience,' and can help us make decisions based off of their successes and failures. For this reason, the recent discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important ones. The discoveries of these three civilizations are vital because they allow us to improve our understanding of the world before us and help us improve our own.        Uncovering ancient civilizations can give profound insight into what turns history took before we existed. For example, the discovery of the lost city of Atlantis, the Pavlopetri's hometown, confirmed the legends captured by the ancient Greeks and filled a hole in our understanding of what happened during the time period roughly 5000 years ago (Smith). Without the discovery of Atlantis, we would have been left wondering what had happened. Several other similar instances exist, such as the ancient Incan empire and the Puebloans. The discovery of the Incan empire filled a significant gap, about one hundred years (1438-1532) in our knowledge of the events before us. It explained temples, buildings, and ruins still in existence, and more importantly contributed to the residents' knowledge of their ancestry and heritage (Gruber). The discovery of the Puebloans had a similar effect, it filled a hole in our understanding of our country's history and the people before us, and let residents descended from them know their heritage and personal history (Mesa Verde National Park). However, knowledge of the past is useful for more that just for knowing.        Discovering ancient civilizations can help improve our world, by learning from the past mistakes of others. For example, the discovery of what happened to the Pavlopetri civilization at Atlantis taught us that ocean level rising can have a disastrous effect on humans, and thus gave insight into the current issue of global warming. Similarly, lessons can be learned from each of the other civilizations, such as the dangers of drought from the Puebloans (Mesa Verde National Park).        Without the discovery of these three civilizations: the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, we know considerably more about the events before us and the reasons for why those events happened. From learning about these three civilizations, additional insight that we would have originally been without was provided into our current world, and the addition of these three civilizations into our history 'lexicon' will permanently change our understanding of the world for the better.

Archaeologists have to use the most advanced techonolgy to discover about the Incas.       The Europeans had to build pithouses to and they were great at craft. They built amny things like pottery, etc. They were even called Basketmakers for their wonderful craft. Farming was the main livelilhood in their world. They lived there for almost 700 years.       Now we are moving on to the Lost Greek City, and it inspired of the most endured greek myths. It is the oldest sumberged town in the world and its still standing today in the water.

So famous people need to avoid them aswell as they can because if they dont paparazzi will capable of doing things to mape pictures look desiving. Many famous people dont mind paparazzi though such as famous singers now a day like tyga,2 chainz,lil wayne,drake,tyler the creator,nikki manaj, and much more they are willing to take pictures. But other famous people dont like having their pictures taken by paparazzi and that is because they knoe that paparazzi will think of a way to make the picture they took look bad and horrible and add details of what they think will hurt the actor/singers carreer.

The inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep a count on live stock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archeaologits have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is lot like solving a mystery.

Also, they need to find artifacts to learn more about civilizations and people that didn't have information archived. The Inca, First Ancestral Puebloans, and the Lost Greek City all have one major thing in common, they all are studied by Archaeologists and they all have/are artifacts left behind.           The Inca didn't leave any archives for historians to study. This means that historians don't know that much about the Inca life. The Inca did keep records by using strings or quipus. The Inca used colorful strings and tied knots in them to keep track of the date and livestock. However, no one knows what the knots mean making a part of the Inca a mystery. There were clues left behind by the Inca that give historians and archaeologists clues about their art and architecture, government, agriculture, religion, and the way of life. Some of the information about the Inca comes from stories passed down about them. Europeans wrote down old stories when they arrived to the Inca empire in 1532. The Europeans wrote about the Inca in letters and diaries. However, these people didn't know the Inca language well so historians need to be careful when interpreting these objects. The artifacts and objects the Inca left behind give us the rest of our Inca knowledge. The Inca artifacts were made from: pottery, stone, gold, or silver. These materials last a long time, so you can find them. The artifacts were found in the ruins of buildings and in graves. The people were buried with artifacts as a sign of reincarnation. Looters still look for treasures to this day, and they take artifacts that might be important to archaeologists. Sites that are carefully dug up provide the bet idea of Inca life in Peru. Archaeologists are able to compare what they find to the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca. The Inca lived in high-altitude places like caves and mountains. This preserved more sites because looters couldn't get to them. However, archaeologists had to be expert mountaineers in order to reach these high-altitute sights. Bodies in the Andes are frozen in good shape because of the cold mountains. This allows experts to use scanning equipment to learn how the people died and lived. The Inca are definitley a interesting but hard group of people to research even to this day.       A long time ago (about 1400 years) before the Europeans explored America, people lived in the Four Corners region. They chose Mesa Verde or Green Table (in English) to be their home. In the late A.D. 1200s, this group of a about 2 generations moved away. This culture is preserved at the Mesa Verde Nation Park. Archaeologists call these people Anasavi translated from the Navajo word 'the ancient ones' or 'the ancient enemies. Now to this day we call them Ancestral Puebloans. The first Ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde around A.D. 550. There main livelihood was farming that replaced hunting and gathering. The Ancestral Puebloans were also known for their skill of craft (like pottery), so they were called 'Basketmakers.' They lived in pithouses in small villages (about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750). Pithouses had their living room a few feet into the ground. Around A.D. 550 the pithouses evolved into Kivas that were above ground. During the Classic Perios (A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300), the population began to grow making villages more compact. Due to the major population growth crafts began to decline in quality. Pottery began to be used more often, so there was less attention to craft. About A.D. 1200, there was another population shift and the Puebloans moved back to where their ancestors used to be. When this happened a rise icliff dwellings happened which made Mesa Verde famous. The Puebloans didn't leave any written records of their lives (same as the Inca).          Through artifacts, weather, natural occurences, homelands, etc., Archaeologists were able to learn about the Inca, The Ancestral Puebloans, and the Lost city of Greece. Artifacts and the settlements/homelands left behind allow Archaeologists to learn more about these ancient civilizations and people.

They were important because if we didnt discover them we wouldnt know a part of are worlds history and also the connections to the empires that we discovered. Since we discovered the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri we know how they lived, what there rules were and now thats why we live today.       The Inca empire helped us because they made trades with us in order to help us live. The Puebloans helped us because they kept us out of war and we made trades with them. Finally, the Pavlopetri helped us during the war but they lived next to water so they mostly helped with supplies.

We get to see what interesting made and we can preserve those artifacts even longer with modern day technology.       The discovery of the underwater city is important because it shows how far modern day technology has come that we can go to the depths of the ocean and find a 9,000 square mile city. It is also interesting because we can figure out how an ancient civilization sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Some theories include that the sea level changed, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami occurred and caused the city to go under water.       The discovery of the Inca remains is also remarkable. The Andes mountains serve as a gigantic freezer for the bodies. It keeps them so well preserved that we can use modern day technology to examine the bodies and figure out why the person died. The deserts also help preserve their pottery for us to examine.

The discoveries we made helped us find out more information of the Incas,Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.          It is an archaeologists job to find artifacts that will help us understand how these groups of people lived,worked, and managed to strive a succesfull civilization.

Inca artifacts are different objects from stone,gold,potters and silver. These artifacts are found in all over. some are in ruins while others in graves.           Another group was the Pueblons. The Pueblons would build pithouse that they lives in and they were clustered into small villages built on cliffs. They learned to make pottery and they also made them selves weapons.

They didn't have a formal alphabet of a steady writing system. This story is about the Inca and how they civilized, oral history, and the clues left behind from the Inca.             The Inca civilized for nearly 100 years. They ruled in South American empire that rivaled of ancient Rome. Today, we have heard of read stories passed down from generation to generation. Passing down these stories helps us learn, or want to learn, how the Inca lived, or at least how we thought they lived.             Today we know the history of the Inca. Passed down form generation to generation we know how they lived. We know these stories because they were written down by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. These Europeans were Spanish and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.The Spanish didn't no the Inca's language, so their descriotions werent accurate. Some Inca told stories rather than history.             The Inca left some clues left behind. Some of these include pottery, gold, silver, and stone.These materials lasted a long time, even if buried for hundreds of years. Some artifacts can even be ruins of buildings and even graves.Inca textiles and clothing also survived. We know now that the Inca lived in the high Andes mountain range and worshiped some mountain peaks.The Inca were usually buried in caves or on top of mountain tops.              In conclusion, The Inca were very imoprtant to American history. They were one of the first to establish our country today. Even though they didnt have a good alphebet or have a standard writing system, they are still apart of our history. This story was about the Inca and how they civilized, the oral history, and the clues left behind.

These discoveries have been famous throughout the history and they still are being explored by tourists sometimes. Wouldn't it be wonderful to know why these artifacts are so important in our history and why people are so interested in them?            These great artifacts are great because they have a lot of history to them, like people who used to live there, or how they lived or died. The Inca of Peru, was important because it had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They left nothing for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today nobody knows what the knots mean. People know the stories from ancient times because clues were left behind by the Inca, form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Archaeologists would study these clues and put them together. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived well but some were destroyed by the dampness. The most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.             The Puebloans are important in our history because people have found out that a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they lived there and they were building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Archaeologists called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'. We now call them Ancestral Puebloans. The Anasazi built pithouses for a place to live in. They also built Kivas which was a ceremonial room where they can use it for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or good crop. Anasazi's lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years then Mesa Verde was deserted.              The Pavlopetri was one of the most important artifacts because it was a lost city that is beneath the waters off southern Greece. It is the oldest submerged town in the world. The shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. The seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. Marine geologists have yet to work our why the settlement sank. Some theories include it was because of sea level change, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or tsunamis. The Pavlopetri inspired one of the world's most enduring myths, the fable of Atlantis. Atlantis was a myth but it was a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.              These discoveries have amazing history to them. There are stories that some people would have never known if people have explored them. Its a good thing that archaeologists have discovered them. These ancient artifacts have made people go and travel to these places because of their great history. The history shows how life used to be for all different kinds of people in the ancient times, how they lived, where they lived, and how they died. Everything has a great importance in them.

There are many things that we need to look at when we talk about lost civilizations many things that we need to consider. Things like how we get learn things about these civilizations. Then there are many things we can learn from the artifacts that help us learn what life was like for them. Natural weather and things like lootings make it hard some times to locate these ancient civilizations.   We learn about these civilizations through diffrent things. Some were written down as old stories, some were passed through oral history through many generations. But through everything that you learn not everything is going to be true. And historians understand that some statements are false others are made up, like some of the Inca stories.   Historians also learn about these anicent civilizations through artifacts they prove to be very important. They learn things about their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, governement, transporatation and way of life. Commen artifacts are usually made out of, stone, pottery, gold, or silver. These types of materials tend tolast a long time, most of these objects have benn buried for over hundreds of years.   There are many things that make it hard to locate these anicent civilizations. Weather, and things like lootings are just to of the major ones. Weather is something that is always going to be unexpected so you have to be prepared for whatever mother nature throws at you. Archaeologists have to be prepared for anything. Lootings are always taking place and they dont tell us much about the sites. Some sites have been reported and some archaeologists are sent who can dig them up carefully. Sometimes things are lost othertimes most of it can be saved it all just depends on the situation.   Lost civilizations are very important to us, it helps us learn new things about our history. It is very important for archaeologists to take special care in preserving our history. Things like weather and  lootings slow us down in this process, sometimes things can be saved other things will be lost forever.

We can also learn what kind of foods they would have eaten if there is remains of the food in the bottom of the pot or bowl. We can see that people did have knowledge unlike some of the movies that make them look really dumb and don't know what to do.                People back in the stone age may have been cavemen but knew what to do to survive in the climate they lived in. They needed to make tools and weapons to make food and kill animals for meat. People would use every single part of what they would kill. They would use the bone and shape them into tools like knives for cuttinng through the skin of a deer. They would use the fur as a coat or blanket to stay warm at night.                 These discoveries are so important becasue maybe they had a problem like a disease that we didn't know about. If we found a body of a person that had that disease, and it was well preserved, we could use ccurrent day technology and find out how to cure the disease before it strikes again. Some of the fabric of what the people would wear could be found and show how they made their clothing without a cotton gin or needle and thred. If the people had writen documents it could show future civilizations how not to get in big arguments and how to keep a civilization running for a long time.                 People in the Mesa Verde clan managed to make sturdy houses to withstand the harsh conditions of the mountains. Then later on they would evolve into bigger houses to house larger families in one house. The people of Atlantis tried to build a city under water. They people of Inca actually built a city in the Peru coast and in the Andes mountains.                 Another reason that the discoveries of artifacts of the ancient civilizations is if you want to live there the people could have writen documents of how to live in the conditions there. The documents could tell how to maintain fields to farm crops in the conditions of where your at. They could also have cave drawings of what kind of animals live in that area. There could be tools to left behind you could use like a bone knife and mabe a bow and arrows or spears.                 In conclusion it is very important to know about the past of where you live so you know how to live there. Make tools to survive with. Learn how to make a house that will withstand the weather conditions of the climate there.

Or even the pottery made by the Puebloans. These artifacts can tell archaeologists about our ancestors and their civilizations.                 Thanks to the dry deserts or the cold Andes Mountains, many artifacts from the Incas have been analyzed by archaeologists.  One of the artifacts found by archaeologists are the colorful strings with knots, called quipus, the Ancient Inca used to keep records. They kept records of calendars and livestock.  Archaeologists have not yet found  the exact meaning of the knots on the quipus. The knots have told archaeologists that the ancient Inca of Peru did not have an alphabet or a system of writing though. Some Inca clothing has also been found in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts and the cold Andes Mountains. These  can tell archaeologists what materials the Inca used to make their clothing and what materials they had access to.                  Archaeologists have also recovered artifacts made by the Ancestral Puebloans. The Puebloans used to use and make beautiful baskets, but this changed. The baskets found between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 showed evidence of declining in quality. This could be from the wide spread use of pottery. The pottery found, on the other hand, went from a simple design on a gray background to black drawings on a white background. This is why archaeologists believe that pottery more or less replaced baskets, and the craft of basket making was less well known.There were also the  smoke-blackened ceilings and walls of the Ancestral Puebloans homes, which showed evidence of fire. This told the archaeologists that the Puebloans used and had access to fire.                       In southern Greece, a lost city was found. This city is like the myth of the lost city of Atlantis. This lost city in southern Greece is submerged in water. Archaeologists have learned many things about this civilization from what is left of it. They know that the people who lived it the city from 2800 to 1200 BC were religious. This is known from the rock-cut tombs and religious structures found in the underwater city. Archaeologists also know that the people from this ancient city had main streets, courtyards, and buildings. The people of this city were not nomadic.                   Archaeologists can learn about a civilization just by looking at the artifacts discovered there. There would be no way of knowing that the Puebloans lost their interest in basket making if the pottery and baskets were destroyed.  We also would not know of the city underwater if  nobody found it. The more archaeologists find, the more they can learn where we came from.

The ancient Inca was a civilization in Peru. The Inca was a civilization that had Quipus to keep track of the time, date, and what happened that day with the civilization. The Incas left a lot of artifacts when they disappeared. The Incas had a lot of buildings and they just disappeared out of nowhere.         Like every other civilization the Incas had artifacts made of gold, silver, pottery, and stone. The Incas wrote down what happened in the quipus with a different color represented something and the knots were the story.  The Incas had a portrait explaining what their religion was and they had a lot of housing on their territory. The Inca were a civilization that left a lot of artifacts to study about. The Incas buildings were made of Stone.The Inca like where they lived.         The Incas was an ancient civilization more than 100 years ago. The  Incas was the last of the civilizations to get destroyed. the fall of the inca king wasin 1532. The incas lived high in the andes mountain in peru. they farmed on flat land they made in the mountains. In the mountains most of the Inca bodies were found and can get scan. the Inca bodies gave us information on how they lived and what they ate . The bodies give us a lot of informtion about what they did and stuff. The Incas were some civilization that had no writing or language. The inca left no writing but knots on the Quipus. The Inca fall date was easy to find because the spainiards killed the last inca King in 1532 and they took over the empire. The Incas did not die like everyother civilization, the Inca died of warfare. The Spainiards killed every Inca and then took over the kingdom for themselves.          Some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or loosters, who take anything that be valuable. Some of the treasures have been taken centuries ago by the Spainiards. Some of the Inca clothing survied very well. Ancient materials like cloth usually just destroys by dampness in the cold air. The rest of the knowledge comes from the artifacts in the housing of the mountains. Some artifacts are found in the ruins of the buildings. Others are found in graves used for the afterlife. Historians have to interpret these artifacts very well because the Spainiards did not speak the Inca language very well. And some of the inca stories are legends not history.

That all these historic places still are hard to determine to what happened in the past of what lived there and what was it like and to day most of the historic places become a national parks. And only a few people in the past who risked there lives to descover these places who made it gets to tell the story of what that place was like and how. And this took place mostly in the beging early  A.D.   were people started advaning there skills. And the the people who descovered who lived there leaned a lot  from who and what were there skills like so thats what mostly what went on.       In the late 1800s archeologists learned skills and peoples lives that lived like the people that lived like the people in the early A.D. that people used that type of technology still and its been a century lately and they still live like this. then Mesa Verde statrd to become deserted ever one sarted moving away and for ever been forgot in then later years pass bye and Mesa Verde becomes a national park so that mainly about this story.   how the people lived in 1880s from sense 1000 A.D. And thats a big part.

All civilizations have to come to an end. Even a great and massive  culture like the Incas. The Incas had ruled all of Southern America for about 100 years (1438-1532). The Incas were very talented they knew art, architecture, transportation, religion, government, and even their own system of their lives. Archeologists today had found certain artifacts to tell of Incas past lives and to see how was life as an Inca. Although the Incas did not have any system of literature or an alphabet, the Incas still had records of themselves, of calenders called quipus. Although archeologists do not realize what the knots on the quipus mean, they need to know much of what had gone in Inca civilization. Today it is hard to find an origin of an Inca today. The fall of the Incas took place when the Spaniards took over and killed the last Inca king. Archeologists look all over Southern America and search for remains of Inca civilization.                      One generation to another, were Puebloans way of living on the Mesa Verde until one generation moved away and left. The Puebloans are known as the basketmakers because of there talent in craft. The Puebloans were skilled at making all sorts of handy objects such as weapons, pottery, baskets, and pit houses. At a time the Puebloans obtained a settled life and replaced hunting for farming, and men gathered as there natural life style. For a time the Basketmakers population multiplied.The Puebloans got there name from the Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers,' because around 750 A.D. they began building houses above ground. By A.D. 1000 the Puebloans began building advanced skillful stone buildings. As well as there art and pottery, changed and advanced, the A.D. 1000 were a high point for the Puebloans. Between 1100 and 1300 A.D the population had reached thousands, the result had impacted the villages, and needed new ways of making new houses. Another change was of the Puebloans moving  upwards to a cliff around A.D. 1200. The result was off-putting to many archeologists. The cliff dwellers only lived in the caves for about 100 years. By A.D. 1300 Mesa Verde was deserted, and the Puebloan kind migrated to the South into New Mexico and Arizona. Sometimes people are going to leave their homes and find a new one.                     The city of Atlantis, lost but true. The city took place back 5,000 years to the place of Southern Greece. The city remains dating back 2800 to 1200 BC long back before the glory days of classical Greece. Atlantis straddles 30,000 square meters on ocean floor right on Southern Peloponnese, that was sunken down back around sea on 1000 BC. Marine archeologists were able to properly survey the ruins of Atlantis. The marine archeologists found a world of buildings that was moved by shifting sands. The city was occupied some 5,000 years ago, earlier than the scientist had thought. The buildings  were over 9,000 square meters, but what was really surprising was a possible megaron. What the megaron means that the city might had been used by an elite, that could raised the status of the settlement. Marine geologists have yet to find why the settlement sank, a few reasons why is because of the sea level change, or an earthquake. Others had known of the city but had thought of it as a myth. The city is still remained unfounded, but there is still vast oceans out there needed discovered, and some day Atlantis will be found.

It gives us an idea of how life was like back then, without technology or our modern uses, and how they managed with what they had. the discorveries of artifacts and daily lives of the Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have imacted us by learning how life was like in the past.                The Inca Civilization had many discoveries found by scientist. For example, quipus was a colored string with knots that was used as a form of a calendar. They had textiles and clothing that have been preserved . they worshiped mountain peaks also. These discoveries show how their ways of living is still found in our societ, only in a different way.               The Puebloans were skilled at crafts, hence the name 'Basketmakers'. They were farmers, and have been giving up of their ways of a nomadic lifestyle into a more settled way. It has helped us seee how their way if living was.            The Pavopetri were a team of Anglo-greek ream that were on the settlement that sunk. It is dated back 5,000 years ago. Because it was so long ago, evidence of is not precise if it was wealthy or how large it was.        In conclusion, artificts found in these civilization have helped our knowledge of them to expand. Our former way of thinking of their lives have been replaced by this new prior knowledge. Hopefully, new discoveries can be made as to ebnhance our knowlege and alway keep the people of the past in our mind.

Did you know the archaeologist struggled &amp; did a lot of work just to find artifacts about our background &amp; past ? Well It's True They Did There Hard Work Just To Find Out About Our past. They dug up things &amp; discovered new things everyday. Like it says In part two 'As in many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, or silver.' This explains that they researched these materials way after and studied them until they finally found out what it was.               The other thing they talked about was the Puebloans. they are pretty amazing!! They, did not leave anything for the historians to learn about. There were some lost city's underwater that inspired the worlds BIGGEST myths! Also about 5,000 years of time Homer became a hero of detail. That's what the scientist said about homer. Jon Henderson was one of the underwater archaeologist. He was also a professor at the University of Nottingham. Archeologist try there best to try to get more information about our past generations such as what i learned about the dinosaurs.               Dinosaurs used to be around the world when we weren't! They were extinct after the meteoroids hit earth. That's what i read in the questions i had on this test. I Learned many things on this 2 part reading. They were near Neapolis as it say under the map 'We found ceramics dating back to  the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago'. And at least 1,200 years before they thought the settlement wasn't there. This was my article on Inca. 	PRP$ NNP NNP NNP CC VB : JJ NNS .

They developed a calander made by knots in colored strings to keep track of the livestock. No one can really understand--or read the string-- because back then it was very complicated to figure out. Most of what we know comes from orally told stories about the Incans and ancient Rome. We know for sure about these stories because they were written down by the Europeans that came in the empire in 1532. Many spanish soliars and priests. They tell about the Incans in diaries and in letters. Many historians realized that the Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language very well and they might not have understood what the Inca told them, so the descripstions would not be as accurate as two Incas speaking to eachother. The rest of the things that we already know and still have left to discover lay in ancient artifacts. Things like pottery, silver, gold, and objects made of stone. Many of these things are found in ruins or buildings. These artifacts stay in well conditions for a very long time.

These artifacts can be down down in the ground. Ssuch materials last a long time, even if they have been buried a hundred years ago. Some arifacts turn up in the ruins of the buildings. others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.

About 1,400 years ago Europeans explored North America. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550.    Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in 1880s, acheologists have sought to understand these peoples lives.   The secret of a lost city that may have inspires one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable od Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have been surveyed. This is and extraordinary find but there is still alot more down there that has to be found.

Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami       We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought,''   said Henderson, who codirected the underwater survey.       The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.           There is now no doub that this is the oldest submerged town in the world, said Dr Jon Henderson, associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the goly days of classical Greece. There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique.               Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reched several thousand. It was mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms,   often with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. The stone walls of the large pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde, with their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. Baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to the vraft. about A.D. 1200,   another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centruies before.Why did they make this move? We don't know. Perhaps it was for defense ; perhaps it was for religious or psychological reasons; perhaps alcoves offered better protection from the elemoents. Whatever the reason, or reasons, it gave to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is most famous.

What i am tryin to say is that the Incas made the first calender in the world.Another reasons the discoveres about the Incas was important because they found so many artifacts about the Incas and know so much about them like if they're still here.             The Puebloans discoveries are important because these people were Knowas the most creative people to live. They made lots of things they were so creative that they made clustards of villages.They even taught themsselves to make pottery,bow and arrow , and more efficient weapons for hunting.What I am trying to say that they there discoveries wasvery important because they really taught themselves to do many things and to me that is very neat.            The Pavlopetri discoveries was important because this doscovering was tied in with the discovery about the lost city of Atlantis. When Atlantis was found many people was surprised becaus esome people thought it wasnt even possible to find it, but they did.They archaeologist only found it because when they were looking for Atlantis they saw the sand starting to shift and ther was the lost city of Atlantis.When the archaeologist and marine geologist found the city the archaeologist said                      'This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down ther to be found.'   That shows that even though they found the lost city of Atlantis there is still many thing to be found down at there, on the ocean floor.           The findings made about the Incas, the Puebloans,and the Pavlopetri was and still are very important because the Incas made the first calender ever in the world, the Puebloans because they made lots of thing that we could or may use in our life and they were very creative so i dont know why we will ever forget them ,and the Pavopetri was very important because this lead up to finding the lost city of Atlantis.

I strongly believe that the discoveries of the three civilizations are very important in our era.            The Inca's ruled a South American empire for nearly a hundred years that had rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. Spanish soldiers and priests described the Incas in letters and diaries that were past down for a perennial amount of time. Inca artifacts have created a great amount of knowledge in our brains and we have made that knowledge our own and been on the path that the Incas would have been on for years. We have learned from the Inca and have followed their lead for years, that is why I strongly believe that the discovery of this civilization was important.            The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde at about A.D. 550. Mesa Verde means green table in Spanish. They learned to make pottery and made the bow and arrow, much more efficient for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. The people made pithouses and had lived in them; the pithouses had lasted from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, when settled agriculture had began. Next, the Kiva's came which were ceremonial rooms also known as churches. Our ideas of houses and churches mostly came from the Puebloans civilization, this meticulously shows why this discovery was so important.           'The Lost Greek city' has dated back 5,000 years. Luckily for the archaeologists, some of the artifacts were reserved by shifting sand and ocean currents, if not, then we would have had never known what this civilization did with its arts and accessories. The Pavlopetri were very skilled with arts such as pottery, ceramics and other type of arts. The Pavlopetri have given us a good deal of creativity and knowledge about fine arts like this. There is no doubt that the discovery of the Pavlopetri was important to us.             The Incas and their fine clothing artifacts, The Puebloans and their structure of houses and and materials they used, The Pavlopetri and their arts that created creativity and the knowledge of arts in our minds. The three civilizations have given us ideas about different things and how to do them. What would have happened if we never learned about them? We would have never been so creative and so smart, that is why I strongly believe that these discoveries are so important to our lives.

Caveman were living before we were even thought about, they were the first human beings on the planet. among most mportant things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and happened to it. the fall of the inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca King in 1532 and took over the empire. the origins of the are more difficult to trace. because when they lived has been inhabitated by many different people.

First, by finding the little things such as baskets and peices of pottery, we learn about how our ancestors used they're resources and what the area allowed them to use. Even they're homes tell us things. Stone or clay houses built atop cliffs give us a few reasons on why life there was so sustainable. We can give educated quesses such as, they needed an area to protect them from the elements. Or maybe protection against enimies. Each artifact gets us a step closer to learning what used to be.      Secondly, remembering what life used to be. Think about what are world is now, we have cars and homes with heating and electricity. Finding these civilizations shows us how peole before us used to live. They had horses, homes built by hand with rock or twigs even. They had fire for light at night and the sun during the day. Life was much harder for them, than for us.          Lastly, the world's culture. Look at the Puebloans, they're culture influenced their crafts and whole style of living. What beleived in set them apart from each and every other civilization in the world, how they hunted, ate, used materiels and even lived was based on their culture. Or the people who lived, or thrived in the now sunken city in Greece. The way the town was set up shows us how these people may have lived, and maybe how they died.        In conclusion you can see that discovering these civilizations improves our image of the past, seeing how life used to be, and the cultures we may know today.

They really didt leave much behind.The Incas ran a huge empire.And many people were surprised about that i mean who knew theyd be running an empire.The incas history holds alot of mystery.Although they were mysterious they left behind some things like a portrait that had some what of a religon in it.The rest of the knowledge come from artifacts as i said before they were veary mysterious.The Incas did believ in the after life.So although some are burried they did believe in the after life.The Incas  lived high in the Andes and they may have even worshippe moutain peaks. PART 2 There is many history behind every civilization. They all had diffrent thing to b remembered by they left behind History. Thats what we study now.We learn about how their society grew bigger how they all functioned and how they controlled power. It was taken in diffrent ways as the pyrmid it went by Who was the most richest and most poor and yeah. Thats what i read about.

Two of these are remains of great civilizations we have learned about. The other is a possible myth proved correct. All of these are part of history though. To relive history would be quite the conquest.        If you were climbing and suddenly you were at the entrance of a great ancient city then you have found the remains of the Incas. The Incas are a civilization that lived around the years 1438-1532. These people didn't have a written language making it hard for the archaeologists to learn more about them. All we know is that they used colored strings and knots to tell how many animals they had from year to year. They used this system for everything and it worked well for them.        Next is the sunken city on the ocean sea bed. This is believed to be the mythical city of Atlantis. Archaeologists are trying to figure out if it really is Atlantis or was just the sunken city that inspired the myth of Atlantis. What makes the archaeologists believe even more that this sunken city is Atlantis is, that it is the only city found underwater that has objects that predate the time when Plato wrote of Atlantis. The possibility that as few divers found Atlantis is quite powerful. Considering that the myth of Atlantis just may so happen not to be a myth but a fact.        Lastly if you were to have found pit-houses then you have found the ancient ruins of the Puebloans. The archaeologists have also called them Anasazi. The pit-houses were lived in from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. Another building found that was built by these people are Kivas. Archaeologists were notified of these around the 1880s. These were buildings made to have city gatherings. Archaeologists are still trying to find more out about the Puebloans because they too didn't have a written language making their history quite complicated to comprehend.        To relive history would be quite the conquest. Which is one reason why so many of us are trying to figure out history. However there will always be times when someone won't e able to find the missing pieces. There are times when we will be adding to the history books. Until then we learn more and more about history, possibly even making some history ourselves.

I know I have, and it is because there are more things to learn out in this world. If they didn't do their job we may not how anciant civilizations work. I have researched and read about three major discoveries all discovered by archaeologists. The first one is one about an ancient civilization called the Inca's. The second one is about a group of people who are excellent at crafting they are called the Puebloans, often knowna as the Mesa Verde. Lastly, this is one is about the lost city of Atlantis , and how they are trying there best to uncover something major.        The first one to start off with are the famous Inca's. These people were truly amazing in my personal oppinion. If you think math and algebra are hard just imagine being the Inca's. They had a unique system of strings. These strings demonstrated teh simple things that we have today. The strings helped them with math, the alphabet, and even a calender. However, the rest of their strange civilization is a mystery, but I have hope it will one day be more elaborate. The archaeologists have oral stories past down from generations to help the decipher the odd civilization that is the Inca's. Overall, I think this discovery was very important because, this discovery helped us understand a whole different civilizations way of living.       Another spectacular discovery is the one about teh Puebloans. These people from what I read were very strange. These people were very artistic and were masters at crafts. They made baskets and pottery. In the beginning they live in houses called pithouses. However, through many years the mastered something better than wood, stone! As soon as, they mastered stone houses out of no where the ventured to the mountains and built houses there. Nobody knows why, it could be because they were scared, maybe for defence, or even something psychologically. This is also a very important discovery for many reasons. I think it is important because in the beggining all they knew were sand,mud, and wood. then through later years they progressed in knowledge. They then lived in stone houses the same model as the wood ones, but these provided more protection. That is why this discovery was important.       Lastly, the amazing discovery by the archaeologists the Pavlopetri. These archaeologists are trying to uncover the lost city of Atlantis, not that is pretty extraordinary. They have found slight evidence that Atlantis will be real. They found ancient pottery and some tops to ancient greek buildings. They are still contemplating on why it sunk in the first place. Also, why wasn't it reoccupied. They have came to the conclusion that Atlantis is most definately the largest submerged city in the world. I feel this discovery is important because if they actaully uncover Atlantis it will be huge, and world changing. It will most likely be the most amazing discvoery of man kind. I find it even more fascinating because Atlantis was always a fable that parents tell their children, but now it is becoming a reality.       In conclusion, you now see why archaeologists are some of the most fascinationg poeple, and they improve history by a huge amount. All discoveries are important, and contain many unknown facts. First the Inca's with their extremely complicated way at life. Then with the Puebloans with their progress in knowledge. Lastly, with the Pavlopetri and almost findiong the lost city of Atlantis. It is reall quite amazing. So, never forget there is a meaning to everything!

Having known these civilizations makes some discoveries make more sense to the human population.        The Inca had no formal writing system, but used a system of knots in a string to keep records.  These knots were known as quipus. No one is sure what each knot represents, therefore trying to read them is like a mystery. The Inca empire kept records with the quipus too.  Inca Empire lasted for nearly 100 years before disappearing into the Spanish empire.            The pueblosns lived in the four- corner area. This civilization lived for around 700 years.  Most people translate them to being 'ancient enemies'. Basket-making was a skilled that they were great in. They lived in pit-houses and made more efficient weapons and homes.

The importance about the type of study is that they help us learn about the past. In Inca of Peru, historians found that the Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Some treasures were taken from Inca sites. Archaelolgists who study these sites keep carful records.       Explored by and Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the think that the suken settlement of Atlantis dates back some 5,000 years ago.'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr Jon Henderson.

The Inca has influenced us because of their alphabet. if you think about it somebody one day didn't just come up with it, they had to have gotten the idea from someone else. Also, another way they are important is because of what their artifacts have taught us. we can learn their way of government and how they live and grow off of that. Also, their clothing that had luckily been preserved all these years. we can learn from that and now we can seee how they survived.            The Puebolans have influenced us because they spanned a generation. For example, they started farming instead of hunting. Which we still now do this very day and age. They also developed the pithouses and basket making. they basketmakers flourished and thanks to them we build our houses above the ground. These people invented the first sturdy housing arrangement which some people still use now-a-days.            The Pavlopetri has influneced us because if it wasnt for their city, exploration under the water wouldnt have been influenced to search for Alantis. it also gives Marine Geologists a chances to figure out new factors about the under water life that there is yet to find.              So thanks to these ancient societies, the ways we live and research our world has flourished and devolped.

They show us a piecc of history from their civilization, and their time, also their land. The discoveries shows us their lifestyle. There is three ways why each discovery is important.          To begin, the discoveries of Inca are important. (They had colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock.) We wouldn't know that information ife we never made the discoveries of Inca.

By studing these artifacts archaeologists and others can piece together details about the Inca way of life.     The way that archaeologists are able to find all of these artifacts after these hundreds of years is that some Inca artifacts are made from stone, pottery, gold, or siver these materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Also some textiles and clothing have survived good as well. some have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or also the Ande's mountains.      Although finding such artifacts are not easy the Inca lived high in the Andes and most of their sites are very high places so it makes it very difficult for archaeologist to get to. Another thing is their are treasure hunters and looters, who take anything that might be valuable.      So, Archaeology is a good way of finding out about civilization hundreds of years ago. Although it is not an easy process it is worth it in the end, finding out about the Inca life.

Some people in Peru dyed from diseases from many kinds of animals. Over 200 people died from diseases. Egyptians found many new dicoveries like finding artifacts from mummies. They brought it back with them and showed everybody. Some people died after making the discovery. Some did not. People in Peru have found artifacts in their own house or carved in their house. Archaeologists kept these as a secret. Most of them kept it in journals about their dicoveries. Most people showed others, some kept it to themselves. When others found that the others that kept the stuff to themselves, they got mad at them. They would kill them and take what they own, even their discovery they found.        About 1,400 years ago, a group of people lived in the Four Corners region and chose Mesa Verde for their home. People left thier homes, to find a better home to live in. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') about A.D.550. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as thier main livelihood. They lived in pithouses, clustered into small villages, usually built on mesa tops, but sometimes in cliff recesses. people there learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower.       People go underwater to look for the world's most enduring myths- the fable of Atlantis- have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. Explored by an Anglo- greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years. About 40 years ago, the only year that the archaeologists could only find, put hidden cameras to record what they could find under the sea. When they came back home, they told people of their discovery. They said, ' We found ceramics, dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought,' said Henderson, who was co-directed the underwater survey.

The Mesa Verde for instanse showed use different ways to build houses like the pihouse under ground and come in from the roof and how they survived and hunted and the Greek people how they found a city underwater from an old legend and how old it was it was dated all the way bak from the stone ages and the buildings were 9,000 square feet thats a lot of room so these discoveries where very important to use in many ways.

They shaped the world we live in today, and studying them explains how they did that. The remains of ancient civilizations tell us our entire history. All over the world fragments of the past have been left behind. When we look at these, we can uncover our own history, the history of our world.             Ill start with the Incas. The Incas were one of three very important civilizations in Peru, including the Aztecs and the Mayans. Their empire was built high in the Andes mountains, where it was hard to reach and could be well protected and thrived from 1438-1532, when the spanish murdered the last Inca king. The Incas were very intelligent and were responsible for much of the beginning of modern agriculture in South America. For example the cities were built of such evenly cut stone, that it seems impossible for a human to accomplish it without a machine, like Machu Pichu. The religion, art, and culture are still prominent in South America today. We are able to learn much about the Incas because their remnants were well preserved by the cold of the mountains, even bodies buried in the caves can still be studied for they have been kept in such good condition. The Incas were one of the important links in South American history.               Not to far away, in what is now Mexico, the Ancestral Puebloans left behind their cities built into the sides of cliffs of what is now called the Mesa Verde. They first settled there in A.D. 550. They were no were near as advanced as the Incas. They lived in clay or stone houses built in to cliffs. They became very prominent farmers and depended on farming to survive. Over time they did develop agriculture and the population reached into the thousands. They became one of the finest expressions of human culture in North America. But by about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was competely deserted. Their city still remains, which modern day archaeologists study and has become a tourist site. Some of todays pueblo people are still decended from the Ancestral Puebloans.               On the other side of the world, another civilization rose. The city of ancient Greece. It is most famous for its fable of the sunken city of Atlantis. Modern day marine geologists have discovered such a city that may have inspired the myth. The city know as Pavopetri was sunk some 5,000 years ago. Geologists hypothesize the reason for it, probally a combination of the land shifting and earthquakes. Because of the shallow water and shifting sands though, the city has been kept in amazing condition. It can give us a look into the myth that prople have been hunting for for hundreds of years.                All of these civilizations are very important to modern day historians. It gives us a glimpse of our orgins and how the modern world was shaped. 	WRB VBP JJ NNS JJ .

They have discoveries made about why they are so important. I'm going to explain to you why the discoveries made about them are important. I will give you a good bit of details about these places. I think you'll be interested in everything I tell you.       First, in the ancient Inca of Peru, they didn't have any kind of formal alphabet or system of writing. This civilization ruled a south american empire for nearly a hundred years (1438-1532.) The Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from many generations. Europeans arrived in the empire in 1532. They get a lot of their knowledge about the Inca from looking at many artifacts.       Secondly, some Inca sites were interrupted by treasure hunters or looters. A lot of Inca's textiles or clothing didn't survive but some of it did. Archaeologists provide the best ideas about life in peru. The archaeologists who do study these sites keep a recording. They need to learn as much as they can.       Next, the Inca date is easy to remember because the spaniards killed the last Inca king in 1532 and then they took over the empire. Its's hard to trace the origins of the Inca's. The Inca can be found high in the Andes. A good bit of the Inca's had been buried in caves in cliff faces. The bodies that are found in the Andes are usually in good shape.           In conclusion, this has helped the looters preserve the sites. Looters had a hard time trying to get to them. Thats all I know about the Inca's for now. Remember eveything I told you, so you can use it some time as a source for something. I hope all of my information that I gave you was helpful or useful.

First of all, these discoveries help histories find out about events that happened, scientists find out about land formations and how the earth has changed, and us know how much our modern society has evolved since their times.           First of all, these discoveries about these different ancient civilizations helped historians know about different wars that have happened, different territories and the types of people that lived in them and more.  I found this quote from source one, 'Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca. Sometimes archaeology confirms historical record.' This shows that artifacts help determine if history is accurate or not, sometimes the artifacts match up to the historical thoughts that we have about that time period.           Secondly, these discoveries help scientists find out more about the land forms and other things that happened in the past and quite possibly could happen again in the future. ''As the world's oldest submerged city it is truely amazing. It not only shows how people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists because the waters aruond it are so shallow.'' Scientists wanted to know how the city sunk underwater to maybe be able to prevent this from happening in the future.           Lastly, our world today is very different from all the ancient civilizations.  Now, we are very reliant on technology and it is very different to think about that there was a time before us where people weaved baskets and relied on natural resources for food and water. If we didn't know about these, we wouldn't know how to live without being reliant on technology.           In conclusion, archaeologists have made a great discoveries off of information and artifacts from the past. They have done us a great service by finding out this information for historians, for scientists, and for the people.

They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called 'quipus' and what they did was they recorded the calendar to keep count of the livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many of the acient quipus, but today no one still knows what the knots mean.       In order to find out most of the things about history as we know today, they were mostly left over things like; paintings, art, clothing material, architecture, agriculture, and transportation. Otherwise no one would know what went on back then because no one would've been around to prove what went on. But some what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories past from generation to generation. Passing on stories was an important way to preserve a community's history. But we know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.

The why is that we need to learn how those power full nations fell and to prevent that from happening to our nations. We may make the same mistake like they did our try to create a good nation like theirs.                  The Inca were a great sociaty no one knew much about them they know that the paindiards killed their king and to over their kingdom. They were a great kingdom witch they were compared to the roman kingdom. they were smart as well.              The puebloans lived in la mesa verde witch was a great place to farm and build houses. The pavlopetri are people no one actualy knows about they would have lived in the sunken city of greece. People dont know about them very much they are discovering more and more about they to this day.

The people of Greece want to know when tribes lived here and how the lived because it is an important part of the history. The people of Greece also would really like to know did they build in live in the fabled city of Atlantis. The legened was told to by their ancestors and passed down from genration to genration.

Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting stilll goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archaeologist very much. Other sites are reported to archaeologists, who can dig them up carefully. They provide the best idea of all about life in Peru before and during Inca rule.       Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it. The fall of the Inca is easy to date becasue the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The origins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. The area where they lived had long been inhabited by different peoples. Archaeologists have to be careful to make sure exactly which people built which site.

In the story they show pithouses which people have lived in.  If you compare that to our homes now they are very different but also similar.  They had a hole in the roof of their house for fire to escape.  Today we have chimneys for the fire/smoke to leave.  We must have leared that from the pithouse.  Also in the story they showed a church house.  Today we have church building that are similar to the one that was called Kivas.  Finding the clothes under the ground and ice burgs have gave us ideas on what they used to wear back than.  We could relate their clothes to ours and see the similarities and differences.  We can see if they wore special clothes like us to go out on a special accation.  Overall if we havent discovered the Inca and Puebloans many things might have different in our world today.

The Ancient Inca are from Peru. They didn't have a type style of the alphabet. Incas  made knots with with a lot of colors of string and that how they would do writing.                            The Incas have a language the nobody except for them self's.  Ancient Incas had different religions then everybody else. The Ancient Incas were different from the other people. The Ancient Incas were around for nearly hundred of years. Through 1438-1532.                   The Incas lived in the South American empire in Rome. Generations has passed that the Incas have passed. The Ancient Incas is a mysterious case or subject to solve. The Incas still remains to day. The bodies the burned to death still remains somewhere underneath our feet.

Now since archeologis have found them after natural occurances, they learned facts about the locations and their origins.                 The archeologists also learn about the people from there in the past by examining items that have lasted from then to now so when they examine the objects they can figure out how they live such as finding the Pithouses. The archeologists found that people lived in the pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750.                 Also the kiva, they larned that it is a Hopi word for ceremonial room. Puebloans may have used kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. They were gathering places and sometimes also places to weave.                                    Archeologists also found the udersea city of Greece. They found out that Greece dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is enprecedented. It also straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. They found a lot of buildings there, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious stuctures, and on the seabed was a replete with thousands of shards of pottery.

The ancient Inca of Peru had a different system of writing, while we spoke and wrote in English. The ancient Inca had a different language.                 From 1438-1532, ruled in the South America, some clues by the Inca form a portrait of their religion, art, and architecture. Some of what we know today comes from the oral history, of stories that were passed on from generation to generation.                Some of the Inca sites, have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that is valuable. Archaeologists who studies these sites that have looters, keep careful records. They take notes and try to learn as much information as they can. Some archaeologists can compare from what they learn from artifacts to what they know about the ancient history.                Long ago, people lived in pit houses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, when their agriculture began. The pit house has a four cornered roof and a fire pit. By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.  The fires were built in the summer, because it was mainly for cooking. In the winter, when the alcove rooms were wet, fires probably burned throughout the village.                The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths from southern Greece. Archaeologists found ceramices dating back to the end of the stone age, underneath the lost city of Greece. Which is located near Neoplis and the Elafonissos Island.               The marine geologists have yet to work on why the settlement sank.                'It is very likely a combination of the first two,' said Dimitris Sakellariou. Which he is talking about the theorices that include ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.                The first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predate the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.               'Atlantis what a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploratoin going,' said Sakellariou.              This was an article about the Ancient Inca, the Mesa Verde National Park, and the Lost Greek City that may have inspired Atlantis myth secrets.

They are important because it is very hard to find information about how they lived and how they went on with their lives. Finding answers helps gives us a sense of detail about how they lived.       Finding information out about the Incas is very difficult. They did not have any form of alphabet or system of writing. What archeaologists find out by collecting artifacts is very important. Since there is no one who knows how to read the stories tied into colorful strings by the Incas it is very hard to understand much about them.       The Puebloans lived in North America about 1,400 years before Europeans explored North America. Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They documented events with potery which helped archaeologists greatly. The Puebloans were very interesting in how they lived and where they lived. We wouldn't know any of this without the archaeologists finding the information they have found.       With less than 1% of Earths water searched it is hard to find information in the sea. Atlantis is a fable that brings people to search the waters. Without that fable archaeologists and marine biologists would have never found the Pavlopetri. It was a part of Greece that was sunk for an unknown reason. Archaeologists have found many artifacts that are very important to finding out how the people lived and how long the settlement lasted. Without them we would have never found this undersea city.       The archaeologists worked very hard to find answers. Although there is still many question they have done a good job so far. With more and more work to do they will find more answers. It is important for us to understand how other people live because it helps us understand the history of our world. Our world is amazing, wouldn't you like to know more about it?

There are many reasons behind why they are such interesting news to our historians today. Now we know about more people who used to live on the Earth. We found artifacts about them so we now know their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Now that we know these things we know how people at that time were like. This fills up another page in our history books. The Incas loved to pass on stories and we now know some of these stories because of the artifacts that we have found about them. This is why finding the Inca empire was a great thing.                      Another thing we found were the Puebloans. So apparently there is a group of people who chose Mesa Verde as their home. They lived there about 1,400 years ago. The reason we found them was because we found their stone structures in which they lived. The reason this find was so amazing is because we found out about the houses they had at that time. The houses were called pit houses. These houses are actually in the ground and they had a small opening in the top where you could get in. This really shows us how far architecture and building has really come. But something very interesting about the Puebloans was that they were masters with stone. They could make the strongest walls at that time. We would not have known any of this if it weren't for our historians finding this. This is why finding the Puebloans was so great.                      The last amazing discovery that i learned about, was the discovery of the oldest underwater town in history. This means that Atlantis might actually exist and this might be a town a little off of their. Well the settlement that was found there dates back 5,000 years ago. This site straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It is said that this town was engulfed by the ocean around 1000 BC. This town had buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, there were thousands of shards of pottery. What really amazes me is how they knew to look there out of all the places on the Earth. This is what i like about the findings on Earth.

I am going to talk about the lost Inca civilization.                  The Inca were from Peru and had no formal alphabet or system of writing. To keep count of livestock, the Inca made knots in colored strings called quipis. When the first Europeans met the Inca, they were stunned by how they used quipis to run a huge empire. When archaeologists found quipis, nobody knew what it meant. Nobody could read the knots tied into the colorful strings. Understanding it is a lot like solving a mystery.                         The Inca also ruled a South America empire for nearly a hundred years, and it rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. The Incas left behind portraits of their religion, art, agriculture, architecture, way of life, transportation, and government. If they study the portraits, they can tell the way that the Inca lived.  The Inca have stories passed down from generation to generation that people still know today. Some of the old Inca stories were written down by some Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.                 The Inca lived in the Andes and they might have worshiped some mountain peaks. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, and they might have taken anything that was valuable in the Inca sites. A lot of the Inca's treasures were stolen many centuries ago, and people still take stuff till this day. Archaeologists have a hard time finding out stuff after the looters have been there. Archaeologists who study Inca sites keel records carefully. they write down and photograph everything that they find, and in the exact position that they find them in. They try to learn everything that they possibly can about every artifact that they find.

You never know what you are going to find, but even just digging a hole in the earth you can find a whole intire civilization, such as   Inca Puebloans     3. Pavlopetri   Archeologists find and discover new things every single day. Civilizations are found and created. By finding these lost places we learn abut our history and the people that came beore us. We have so much yet to diccover on earth and so much to find, but we will. However, many complicatiosn are faced. In our time new strustures and homes stand and cover where the old one once were, and that adds more dificulty to find new lost civilizations. And who knows, maybe one day we aill be.....a Lost Civilization...

Most of the knowlegde about the Inca today comes from the artifacts they left behind.Second, is the Mesa Verde national park.The occupants of Mesa Verde had great ideas of using what they had to live.They built houses of sticks called pithouses and complex churches called kiva.Lastly, is the greek city. The lost greek city fluded and was crushed under water . This could have been the theorey of Atlantis. Those are the important civilizations of yhe past.

About 1,400 years ago long before Europeans explored North America a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.Homes got destroyed it caused them all to move away in the late A.D 1200.The first Ancestral prubloans settled in Mesa Verde witch is Spanish for 'green table' they are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft.Between A.D. 1100 and A.D 1300 during the classic Period the population may have reached several thousand.About A.D 1200, another major population shift saw people begin move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancentors centuries before.Perhaps it was for defense  Perhaps alcoves offered better protection from the elements.Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880's archeologists have sought to understand thes people lives.Scientific knowlege isnt that great though.The structures are evidence of a society that over centuries accumulated skills and traditions and passed them from generation to generation.Ancestral Puebloans builed dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs their basic construction material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread.When the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verda left they traveled south into New mexico and Arizons settiling among their kin who were already there.       The secrets of a lost city that have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths a fable of Atlantis have been brought to liight froim beaneth the waters off southern greece.Explored by an Anglo Greek team of Archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of the Homer's hereos and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented experts say.The site which straddles 30,000 square meters of oceon floor of the southern peloponnese is nbelieved to have been sonsumed by the seat around 100 BC.Less than 1% of the worlds oceon extradionary finf but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.

If we hadnt discovered these towns and artifacts we wouldnt know about our ansestors and the history behind our towns and citys. Looking back at ancient artifacts we can see what the people before us believed in and studied. Our ancestorys have a big influence on how we do things today.                Arciologists have beens studing the past for a very long time. traditions and stories got passed down from generation to generation. So did the technices used to build strucktures and cook and hunt. You  might not realize it but the people way before us have made life a lot eisier on us. They showed there childeren how to do specific things and it kept getting passed down to different generations. We keep building off of ytheir ideas and make them better and eisier to use. no wwe dont have to walk everywhere because we have cars and they didnt. Life was a lot harder for them. if they were outside at the wrong time they could die from an animal attack or humans invading. now our pretection is better.               We get languages from our ancetors too. They spoke in certain ways and over time we have changed it and adapted. Religion was a big influence on us. I dont think we would have some of the religions that we do if it weren't for the people before us. Yes, we do have  lot more reaserch and discovery ahead of us, but its fun to learn about the past. In conclusion the ancient people have impacted our lives more than most of us ever realized. We have a lot to thank them for.

Finally, the Pavloperti's got their importance when they became one of the founders of the secret of where Atlantis was.                        First, Machu Piccu is one of the wonders of the world because it was built on top of the Himalayan mountains.That was where some old stories came about. The stories talked about the Spanish soldiers and priests. Then, they would make a description of the Inca in diaries and letters. We know some of the old stories because some Europeans wrote about them. The rest of what we know about the Incans comes from thier artifacts, things they left behind, and the sites where the artifacts came from. Some things they left behind were: clothes, buildings, pottery, stones, gold, silver,and cloth. That was how the Incans were important.                                        Then, The Puebloan's were founded mostly by the Europeans because Europeans started to explore the world over 1,400 years ago. They believed that the Puebloan were either the 'ancient ones' or the 'ancient enemies.' They believed this because they believed in many gods instead of only just one. This was thought to be taken in the 'Mesa Verde National Park'. The Puebloan's built mostly Pit houses for war and for art such as pottery. There were also times when basket makers population multiplied because this was good the Puebloan could hire them to make baskets for food.                             Finally, the Pavloperti were founded by Greeks because they were located in Neapolis that was near where Atlantis was founded. The Pavloperti were the first of many people to find this island. The island was located under the sea. You can see where it is if you look at the map. It was hard for the Pavloperti to find it because without the scuba gear many of them died because the could not breathe. That was another problem because many of the Pavloperti were becoming extinct! That was when they finally found it and many people of the Pavloperti were happy.

It didn't matter if they had to walk 3 or more miles away it was their job and nothing can stop them from doing that. Some people have died for walking all the way by the sun because the sun was really hot and they would dehydrate and they wouldn't give them water so they would die thirsty. Some have made it but theyv'r made it thirsty and tired and feel light headed and dizzy. iot feel horrible when that happens but that's how it was back then and now it's easier for us because we now how transportation and we don't have to walk any more if we did we would of had a lower population and ewven the littlke kids would have to walk a lot.

Some artifacts have been lost by the weather because they are buried.The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. The Inca had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Today no one knows what the knots mean. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studing these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life. Some old stories have been written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Such materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years.           The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. About A.D 750 they begun building houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and muds.Fires built in summer were mainly for cooking. In winter, when the alcove rooms were dampand uncomfortable, fires probably burned throughout the village. By about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. Several theories offer reasons for their migration.           Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist and known as Pavlopetri,the sunken settlement, Atlantis, dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heros and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. Atlantis has remains dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. This site straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. Marine geologist have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Some theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.           The Incas,  the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri had important artifacts that are found and there are some that are yet to be found. The artifacts and their discoveries are important because they helped create new artifacts and help learn about their past and how they lived it.

Berth questions that by the hundred years (1438-1532) who ruled the empire for South America? No one now's because the only things left behind were clues. Clues that were their religion by the Inca,art by the Inca, and their transportation by the Inca. By these clues people could piece every little clue together and and get more details about the Inca life. Inca lived high in the Andes and maybe have worship some mountains.                Source number 2 reports that 1,400 years ago even before Europeans explored North America a group of people who lived in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. Late in the A.D. 1200s in span of a generation or two ,left their homes and moved away. Mesa Verde became a national park of ancient culture.The first Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde lived in Pithouses. They replace hunting for farming life.                                                                                                                                       The Cliff Dwellers archeologists have sought understanding peoples life's. Despite decades of excavation,analysis.classification,and comparison knowledge remains sketchy. By the classic period (A.D. 1100 TO A.D. 1300), Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization.                     That's why its important to learn history because they made items and created other items that's helped people in their life. Those are the reason why you should listen to history.

The Inca did not leave archives for historians to study. Archaeologist have found many ancient quipus-but today no one knows what they mean.Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion,art and architecture,agriculture ,government ,transportaion ,and way of life. Mesa Verde National Park preserves a great reminder of this ancient culture. Acheologist have called these people Anasazi. People lived ikn pithouses from about A.D 550 to A.D 750,as settled agriculture began. They lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. When the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there. Lastly, explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years. 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr Jon Henderson associate proffessor of underwater archaeology. What they found surpassed all expectations. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. This is an extraordinary finjd but there is still a lot more under there that has not been found. All these topics have wonderful stories to them, who knew the ancient places would be fasinating to study about.

The incas left knots of colorful string called quipis to record thwe calender and to count the livestock they had.The Incas had run a whole empire using strings to keep records. No one knows what the knots mean even though they have been discovered.Clues left incas way of life,art architecture and culture  to be discovered like a mystery. What we know about the Incas is mostly passed on by ancient stories passed on through generartions, most likely legends. Some of the old stories were discovered by europeans who wrote them down most likely innacurrate because the europeans did not speak the inca language. The rest of historians knoweledge comes from artifacts left behind by the incas and ancient sites. Most artifacts were  gold, silver, pottery and stone. Some were found in the bulidings of the sites and others were found buried with the dead to be used in what they believed the afterlife. Some clothing peices were discovered as well and cloth was preserved welll because they were left in the dry desert where the Incas used to live. Some Inca sites have been destroyed by treasure hunters who take anything that might be valuable to them.The archeological sites are the best way right now to determine the Incas life. Archeologists need to track exactly were they find the artifact tomb or building or else it might get lost or there might be other evedince in the place they were looking. The inca lived in the high part of the Andes mountians and were believed to worship some of the mountian peaks. The usual spots for Inca villages are in remote high places. The giant mountians are very cold so the bodies burred in the caves and mountain tops are preserved very well and looters cannot usually get t them which makes the job a lot more difficult because they have to climb a moutain before they can get to work. They use medical scanning  equiptent to find out how the person died the way they did. In conclusion the discoveries about the ancient incas could not have been done with out the help of archeologists. 	DT NNS VBN IN DT NN VBP RB VBN IN NNS .

They did not leave any thing for us to study now days and if they did we cant read it. When the erupeans first meat Inca they were amazed by how they could run a whole empire with such little help. Today we found some things to help us learn more but with out other clues those things are really no help. They say without anybody who can read anciant things those clues will stay a mystery.            The olny way we know that the south empire was ruled by Inca was just very little clues that we had put together . To put those clues together even took along time. So how would it be to try to read a language we really never even seen before. It would be very very difficult.             Most of our evidence comes from stories. Like stories past on from generation to generation. If it weren't for those story we would be very behind right now. These storied helped us alot. They may have been changed or adjusted alittle but they still help us. We know some old stories because they were were written by eauropeans in 1832.             Our historians have to be real careful about this stuff like when they go over it and stuff they need to be really careful and really smart about it. If our historians found clues and somehow something went wrong ........it would be so bad. Thats why its really important for our historians to do there job and to do the job right.             Some of our sights have been distroyed by tresure hunters and looters. Some of those people might have even taken some valueble things whitch would be very important to have. But i guess well never know until we find evidence or something to lead us too who those people are. Archaeologist who study these sights that have been distroyed keep real good carefull records. They right down and photograph any artifacts or clues they find. They need to learn as much information as they can from every single big or little piece of evidence. Archaeologist can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the accounts of the Inca. Sometimes archeology confirms historical records.            This is why it is very important to have a lot of evidence. If we had no evidence we would know like absolutly nothing about this. It is very important in our history that kids know these thing and audults too. It is also very important that we do not vandalize and istroy stuff because we will never know maybe the thing we do can help the peple from 100 or more years from now. If we keep looking for evidence and we find more. The stuff we find may change the world and even the world in just two seconds. It would take alot of time too make sure you evedice is complete with a story or your just gonna look stuped. Any ways this is my essay to you guys saying why the distcoveries weve made and the evidents we found is very very important.

There are many civilizations out there in the world that we do not know of. Like how did we discover fire? How do we keep ourselves warm? How do we find food? These lost civilizations have been forgotten over the last couple thousand years. We should at least know our history to explain why we have such a nice living paradise now then we had back then.        Starting with the Inca civilization, I bet you're thinking right now that you do not know this civilization. This civilization was a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. We all know Rome, I am quite certain that many are very found of the gladiators that have fought bloody battles. How did we find all this information about the Inca civilization? We, the archaeologists have found out that the Inca had no formal alphabet nor a system of writing. So how did we find all this information? The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed to see how the people of Inca could run such a huge empire without any trouble. The Europeans discovered strings that the Inca people use to keep records. Today the knots on the string are still a mystery today. There are many things we do not know about our history as we do with our modern city today.        1,400 years ago, a group of Europeans explored North America. They discovered another lost civilization, Mesa Verde. For more than 700 years, descendants lived in Mesa Verde and flourished here building elaborate stone communities. We know now that the descendants left this beautiful area moving somewhere unknown. In A.D. 550, the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They were known as basket makers since they were so skilled at crafts. The Puebloans lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometime in cliff recesses. They were very well known for their crafts. They would learn to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for hunting. These first civilize people had it better than the Inca people did.        Last of all the story you've been wanting to read. Atlantis. As many of you people know Atlantis is the lost city of Greece. The settlement dated back 5,000 years to the time Homer's heroes. Atlantis have been know to be the oldest submerged town in the world. It remained dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC. There were many sunken cities but nothing compared to Atlantis. Due to the shifting sand and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. Atlantis was a myth yet a story in out history.        Hoping someone learned something today, our history did matter. Many others probably wonder why we even bother with history. Why do we even need to learn about something that was in the past. There are many possibilities that the past can help with the future. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN NNP NNS IN NN NNP .

The discovery of the Inca was important because it showed us how they survived in the mountain region. The Inca had lived in the caves of the mountains and also had used the peaks and other caves for burying their dead.The Inca had used quipus to tell stories about them and their ancestors. The quipus' also had held anceint history that we can not find. People still cant read the quipus' now. The Inca civilization was destroyed after the death of their last king by the Spaniards.       The Mesa Verde were a very smart civilization in architecture.The Mesa Verde had lived in the Four Corners region of the present day United States.The Mesa Verde were a very advanced group were still advancing when they flourished.There artifacts have shown that they had changed from an atlatl to a bow and arrow for weaponry. They also had very intricate and huge shelters after a while. In the earlier times of the Mesa Verde they had lived in shelters called pithouses, which were small semiground huts,and then they had advanced to upper ground shelters that got up to be three stories tall.After they left their homeland they had came back and had lived under cliffs. they had made small rooms out of sandstone that were about six by eight feet.       The Pavlopetri had lived in a civilization that was sunken after they had died off.This civilization was a lot like a regular city in present time.The sands had preserved a lot of their artifacts including buildings, courtyards, main streets and other main structures. They had their own religion too due to the religious structures the archaologists have found.This civilization had been ruled by a king or emperor.       The finding of the Inca, Mesa Verde, and the Pavlopetri are important because they have told us what we did to survive in differnet regions of the world.These three civilizations had all shared they way they were sheltered. The inca lived in caves in the Andes, the Mesa Verde lived in huge buildings by the cliffs of mountains, and the Pavlopetri had lived in a now present time bay near greece. All these civilizations had a lot of important artifacts that led to us finding the lifestyles of them.

They help us learn about ancient life, show us how advanced ancient civilizations were, and create new ideas about what else there is for us to discover.       From the Incans, archaeologists learned what kind of clothing they wore, what occured in their history, and how they practiced their religion. Puebloans left bhind evidence of their houses, drawings, and weaponry. In the lost Greek city, archaeologists uncovered buildings, tombs, and religious structures, showing the organization and planning involved to create the city.       You would be surprised at how advanced civilizations were in ancient times. The Puebloans ditched the atlatl, a spear thrower, for the more reliable bow and arrow. They also took the time to skillfully create walls of thick stone, often rising two to three stories high, and join them together to form units of fifty or more rooms. Planning and skill is also evident in the Pavlopetri civilization. They constructed an entire city consisting of buildings, courtyards, main streets, tombs, and religious structures.       After finding all these artifacts, archaeologists are left with ideas about other undiscovered civilizations. The lost Greek city was thought to have inspired stories about Atlantis, but who knows how many other lost civilizations there are beneath the 99% of ocean we haven't searched? If the Incans were smart enough to hide themselves in deep cave to prevent looters from stealing their posessions, why couldn't anyone else think of it?       These dicoveries help archaeologists understand the lives of ancient civilians, how advanced they were, and what else might be waiting for us to uncover it.

The findings from the Inca helped us learn about our ancestors because it says that they used stone, gold, or silver to make pottery. It also shows what kind of clothes they had and how they made them.   The findings from the Puebloans showed us how the housing was back then.Farming replaced hunting and gathering was a main livelihood. They then aquired the bow and arrow and that is important because the bow and arrow is still used today.   The findings from the Pavlopetri are important because it showed us how the early city looked in the ancient times. Like courtyards, rock cut tombs, main streets, and religious structures.

You might also wonder why its important to lean about these people. Well, we can learn from their mistakes. We can learn more about where we came from and learn more about the Earth and its history.        We can learn a lot from these people like how they grew food and what the grew. We can also learn were they lived and who they traded with, or who they went to war with. We can learn how they built their houses or if they lived in caves. We can learn about ancient money systems and accounting. Take the ancient Incas for example. They kept records of live stock and grain by tiying knots into colored strings. The ancient Pueblos used to live in the Andy's mountains. Then they moved o Mesa Verde and lived in Pit houses.Then they learned how to make houses out of stone. Although most went back to living in mountain caves we can still learn about them today.        We can also learn about what people made to trade. At first the Pueblos wove baskets then they became skilled at stone masonry. In the lost city, that is now under the southern Greek coast, thousands upon thousands of pottery shard were discovered with the ruins.        We can also learn about them from their art work. Like Native Americans Indians the Inca would paint portieres and and make sculptures. Some other civilizations made beautiful pottery. Others made buildings and sculptures.        Another thing we can learn about ancient civilizations is how they ran their government if they had any. Like stated before the Inca kept all records by tieing knots into colored string. That would get complicated!        We can also learn about natural disasters from these ancient people. We can learn about how often a land slide was or an earthquake. We can learn about how they protected them self against these things. We cold also learn more about tornadoes and hurricanes by looking at the destruction it caused the ancient people.        Religion is also something else that we can learn about. We can find out witch gods and goddesses they worshiped. We can learn and compare how their society worked and how our works today.        We can use all of this information and use it to learn about our past and maybe how to improve our future, all by studying these ancient civilizations.

Ancient artfact were made from stone, pottery, gold, and even silver. The ancient artfacts were buried over a 100 years because miterials last a long time. some of the artfact were found in buildings. Artfact are most af the time old things that people left behind. Ancient meterials like cloth and stuff like that are most of the time are damaged by the water, but in hot places like a desert the cloth would be ok.

As I was reading I learned about the Inca empire, the first ancentral pueploans in Mesa Verde, Cliff Dwellers, and the little city in Greece. When I was reading this I found out that the Incan empire use a tool called a quipus, which is use to keep track of records. I also found out that in a pithouse there is a fire-pit and that it was in the ground just like the kivas, the kivas is like a pithouse but instead of hide as the walls it was made of pilaster, which is much hard to break.         In  my research I found that the city in Greece isn't the only under water city, there are cities like that all over the world. Atlantis is taken from this underwater city, and we all know that Atlantis is not real. Some people might argue about that this city is Atlantis, but most people know that Atlantis is fake.         I for one is a person of fake, but I will believe that Atlantis is just a city that is not underwater but above water and land. If you also believe me that's good but if you don't that's good too. But no matter how much you think about it there will always be an answer to something.

Have you ever wondered what took place in the history before you were ever here? How did things develop? Read below and you will found out on how some of these facinating things have been discovers.       The Incas were found by clues left behind. Some comes from oral history or stories passed down from generation to generation. Some, though, were rather legends than history. Inca artifacts have been dug up or found in grave for the dead. Clothing and textils have survived because of the dry deserts and the old mountains. Archaeologists make sure to keep careful records of any artifacts they find. They also note there exact position. Above are just a few ways that archaeologists discovered things about the incas.       The Puebloans are known for there skill as Basketmakers.  They decided to lead a more settled way of life. They replaced huunting and gathering with farming and much more. They also advanced there houses. They were very smart and used nature to their advantage by building their dweelings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Once they left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizone. Some people there are still descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.       Alantis has been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. It has been explored by archaeologists and marine geologists. It contains remains dating back to 2800 to 1200 BC. There is no doubt that it is the oldest submerged town in the world. They found there surpassed from shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay. They still cannot figure out why the settlement sank, but there are theories. Atlantis is said to be a myth, but a myth that keeps the water exploration going.

DO you know who the Inca's are? DO you want to find out who they are? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to learn about history and things that have happened more than 1,000 years ago? Did you know that their is a National Geographic Investigation that investigates these things? Well then let's find out..       Well discoveries about the Inca have recently come up as a topic lately. So the NGI decided to do some research and find out some things. The Inca originally came from Peru and have no formal system of the alphabet or writing. We also know some of their Emporers in our history classes and things like that. While the NGI was researching they found that the Inca have many intelligent people but also have a lot of what you would call theories about different things like they bury their people in Mountain Cliffs and in big rocks and boulders. Do you know why?       Most of our discoveries come from their artifacts, and other objects that they have left behind while traveling around the World. Their textiles and clothing has survived well and is still in what they call good- condition. Most clothing and cloth and things are destroyed from the rain and storms and maybe some animals that have found their belongings. Looters and Treasure Hunters have also desterbed the Inca area or civilization. Their are also cliff dwellers. The first local cowboys to report the cliff dwelling happened in the early 1880's. But the archaeologist have yet to understand these people's lives.       A few different things are in the ocean. On the ocean floor archaeologist have found many things like clothes, shoes, fur, and more. Divers were sent down to find more ancient artifacts and identify them as to what they are classified as. Artifacts have recently dated back to over 5,000 years ago. Some people are also known as Puebloeans, which is a Spanish word meaning ' village dwellers.'       I hope that you have learned more about the inca's and their culture and thancient artifacts that we have recently found and other things. I hope that soemday you will remeber and come back to this article and realize how long ago this stuff happened so long ago.

They did not do archives for historians.          There first Europeans to meet the inca were amazed that they could run huge empires. But they were ancient quipus now these days noboby knows what the knots mean or what they are. Things we no about the inca is coming from theoral history or stories passed from al the generation to all generation. There passing the stories back and forth was very important so when they would preserve all of the  communitys and the history.        Adventualy we no some of the old stories because they were all witten down by the Europeans who would arrived in  the enpire in the 1532. Some of the visitors were spanish soldiers and priests.        The spaniards do not speak the inca language as very well. So many have not understood what the incas have told them so their descriptions might not be ableto be accurate.and most of the inca stories are or were very legends and that now they are history.       As in many ancient civilization inca artifacts might be objects that were made from some kind of stone pottery gold and silver such materials for it can last a very long time even if they get buried or if they have been buried for a hundreds of years. Some of the artifacts turn up in the ruins of all the buildings.              About 1,400 years ago long before Europeans explored north America a group of people living in the whole four corners region chose mesa verde for their home.

Many people want to learn about the past and how they lived. It might tell how people have evolved back then and how advance were there.   The only stories that the Inca had were written on a piece of string called quipus and no one knows what they mean. They also learned that the Inca buried people in the Andes mountains and this people learned that there were crime because they were buried there because it made it harder for thief's to get and loot the bodies.         The Puebloans were very good craftsmen and were known as Basket makers. What makes them interesting is that they farmed and made pit houses into small villages. They knew how to pottery, had bows, and arrows. Soon they began making houses that were strong and good. They expanded more out of their village and for some reason they went back to their village. They left nothing or evidence of why they left. It could be because there might of been earthquakes, they were attacked, or many other reasons.         The Pavlopetri were an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. They think the Atlantis is older than 5,000 years old. Dr. Jon Henderson thinks its the oldest submerged town in the world. This might of been the most important discovery of them all. There are many question about Atlantis like how advance were they, what did they use to make buildings, how they discovered about pottery, what did the believe in, and many more. This was a time before Christ was born and people were advance but this city is the most advance civilization probably then any other. They had many buildings like courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. Many don't know what has happen to Atlantis and less then 1% of water has been searched in the world.

The Inca didn't have a writing system or a record of their past live. All they left us was these quipus, they were these colorful knots that keep record of their life style and told stories. Many archaeologist found many quipus, But theirs no one that can read the knots. So it made understanding the Inca like solving a mystery. There were these site that helped the archaeologist, but they were located in the Andes mountains. This helped preserve the bodies and structures of the buildings, but also made it hard for the archaeologist to carry their equipment up the mountain and if they found something they would also have to carry that down the mountain. the Inca also left clues like portraits of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. We already know some of the history through oral history or stories passed down through generation to generation. Although there wasn't any record of them they did leave a lot of clues behind for us to examine.           The next civilization is the Puebloans. they were very crafty people they would do pottery and make weapons for hunting. This civilization's population would multiply by a great amount.In 1000 A.D, the Puebloans architecture had advanced, even there pottery changed. Despite the decades they analysis the knowledge remained sketchy. The Puebloans didn't leave any records and what was important in their lives has perished away. the Building was of helped because it showed that there was evidence of a society that, over centuries they accumulated skills and traditions that were passed down from generation to generation. Today's some Pueblo people and other tribes are descendents of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.            The final ancient civilization i will mention is the Lost City of Greek also Know as the Pavlopetri. Many have said that- the fable of Atlantis- was just that a myth. Then an oceanographer discover the city and it was only this year that the marine archaeologist got help by digital technology. This site is covering 30,000 of square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. The site was enclosed and protected by the shifting sands. What the found was beyond their expectations. The exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. Also the sea bed was repleted with thousands of shards of pottery. The archaeologist found ceramic dating back to the end of the stone age. Their investigations revealed 9,000 square meters of new buildings, but what took the archaeologist by surprise was a possible discovery of a Megaron.  this site represented a frozen moment in the past. this was the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece. this was a very extraordinary find but there is still more to discover.              These ancient civilizations are just some of what the archaeologist have found, but there is always more to find because we have yet to discover the rest of the world.

A civilization nobody had remember or even imagined until recently old remains were found . These old remains told us many things about our ancestors. Things that our generation never would've known if it wasn't for these leftovers from the past generations. These remarkable things were only found out only because of artifacts or objects that our ancestors let behind for us to find and remember their culture by.                All of these new discoveries are very important because they tell us how our life used to be back then . This also gives us and idea of how exactly our ancestors had to live their every day life, we have found a great amount of  information and we're sure there is lots more to come. With this new information hopefully we'll get even an idea on how we would've lived, and did live back then . These people had a much harder life and they wanted us to know about it. Someday generations later we will be the ones being remembered as ' ancient civilizations ' and we would want those other humans to acknowledge all of the impactful and memorable things we human beings accomplished and conquered.                   With time, people forget many things. Maybe friends, family, but obviously this civilization wanted to make and impact some day and be remembered. And so it did. Up until this day we remember them.Thanks to all of the remains that they left for us to someday find. We have found all kind of found remains like clothing, ways of maintenance, and even bodies that they buried in very low temperature places so that when found, the can still be studied and displayed to the people. This was not only a way for us to know more about the ancient times but also a way to remember these ancient people. The  ancient Inca's did a very great job at leaving hints and left overs remains for us to find and study . They really made a impact on today's modern world and with all this information, hopefully this great and mighty civilization will forever be remembered.

In source #1 it talks about how they found how the Inca lived and where. In source #2 it talks about how the Puebloans lived as well in their habitats and where in the world they were all located. In source #3 it talks about them possibly finding the lost city also the home of the Pavlopetri.           In source #1, the Inca had no way of leaving a trace of who they were or how they lived so many scientists had to piece everything together. At a point in time the Inca were visited by the Spaniards.  They knew how to speak in the Inca language a little and barely understood what they said so when the scientists asked descendants of the Spaniards if they could possibly translate, the scientists weren't sure if they could have possibly translated wrong or they didn't understand it well or possibly the old stories were all myths so they weren't sure what to believe. Some of the evidence shows the scientists that they lived high in the Andes and worshiped in high mountain peaks. This also shows that they like to be in high places like mountains and such. The bodies showed the scientists how they died and how they lived.            In source #2, the Puebloans lived in North America long before the Europeans came to here to explore. they soon left because of the stone communities around them. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. they were also good at crafts, most of there things were nicely knitted and hand made. Soon later everything started to get a lot better and improve.they didn't leave any records or writings but there were structures to prove they existed. They used 'caveman style' do do a lot of things like set fires and clean clothes and a lot of other things like that. when they left, they all went to either Mexico or Arizona.            In source #3, it talks about the discovery of the lost city and how the Pavlopetri lived before the sea sunk it. they have now found proof that there was a city that was in the middle of the sea before the it sank. the scientists have now discovered that it is the oldest city in the world now. this exploration revealed many kinds of things that we have in our cities today. the city sank because of the sea level, the sea level changes every once in a while and when there was an earthquake it sank the whole city. the scientists have said that Atlantis was a myth but still keeps going and that about less than 1% of the sea has been surveyed.

Most of the discoveries show us how they used to live a long time ago so it helps us. Most of the people back then didn't understand   but they left a lot behind for us to learn about. We don't know how the city ended up under water but we find out eventually.         Most people think that Atlantis is like a lost city but its not, it is just a lost Greek city that inspired a myth. Atlantis was found forty years ago by a British diver. It is the oldest summurged city or anything underwater it could date back to twenty five hundred BC. It was found in Greece, near the coast. The discovery was very important because it shows us how they lived and what kind of achracholture they had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The reason know one knows why it sunk is because it has been so long that there could have been a dock that just broke apart and floated away or an earthquake, and there evn could have been a jsunami. More then any other thing found underwater, the potential of the buildings and the artifacts is amazing. The summerged sit was never re occupied by anyone or anything. When the city was found people started to call it atlantis, and made it a myth. There is only 1% of the worlds ocean floors that have been surveyed, so there is a lot more out there maybe another barried city or two.

The finding lost cities are extremely important to our history and life of people a long time ago. Learning about all of lost cities gives us information to see how much our cities have changed over long periods of time.           First of all, the Incas were a big part to helping us learn about our past, although we have not learned much about them because they do not have a formal alphabet or system of writing, so the Incas did not leave any archives for historians to study. But they did leave clues behind by portraits of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and their way of live. The ancient civilization of the Incas helped us learn way more about our history.          Second,is the Pueblos. The pueblos lived very differently than the Incas. Archeologists had found out many things about the pueblos and how they lived. one of the things they had found about them was the houses they had lived in, they were pit houses that the pueblos had lived in from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. the pit house featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbers supported the roof, and the fire pit had a deflector. There houses were a big part of history and learning about the ways they had lived.            Lastly, the pavloperti settlment dates back some 5,000 years ago. The lost greek city is really important and unique because it is the largest lost underwater city toi be found, and tyhere are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this. We have more imformation about tye lost city because the salt water preserved more artifacts and clothing than expected.

The first civilization was the Inca.they did not leave any records but they're still very important.We can learn a lot about their religion,government,transportation,art, arctexturere,agriculture,and way of life through amazing portraits.With these archaeologists can piece together details of Inca life.The Inca had a special way of recording things,such as little strings with knots called quipus.The way of reading these has since been lost but the importance of them is still there.Stories of the Inca have been written down by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.Most are legend but some have proven to be history.Inca textiles and clothing have survived in sites such as dry deserts of the coasts of Peru,and remote places high up in the Andes Mountains.Archaeologists record everything about where they find artifacts.With this knowledge they can learn more about this amazing civilization.It's important to learn about these people because for many years they not only lived well with a good government system,but also had a vast empire.With the help of aerial help archaeologist can learn about patterns Inca people left in the mountains.With all this important information we can learn about these amazing people.          The next civilization was the Ancestral Puebloans.They lived about 1,400 years ago.They lived in communities built in sheltered acloves in canyon walls.They lived in places like that for 700 years.Then they left their homes and moved away. These people left only there amazing arcitexture for archaeologists to decifer what there life was life.Early Puebloans were known as Basketmakers.They farmed and gathered.There number grew and they becan to build kivas.These stone weall of the large pueblos are reguarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde.This is what makes this wonderful civilization so important to our history.We have much to learn about these people but with each find we're getting closer.         The last civilization is the underwater settlement.This settlement is located on the southern coast of Greece.It covers 30,000 square miles.It's beauty was only found 40 years ago.In it you can find remains as old as 2800 and 1200 BC.But the settlement itself dates back to 5,000 years ago.This old settlement is a treasure.We can learn so much from them just by there pottery and stories.In this settlement explorers say they found buildings,courtyards,main streets,rock-cut tombs,and religous structures.This is unique because there are older sunken settlements then this one but none can be consider to be 'planned' loke this one appears to be.The settlement appears to be an elite society and also reprsents a 'frozen monument of time' which is why this find is so important to our history.       There have been many dicoveries of ancient cities and artifacts that were found in them,but all are very important to our history as humans.I have just told you about three that mean alot to our history.And there are many more with value to them.So when you look at an old city think about it's importance to human history.

Although the europeans killed all of  the Incas they kept record of the stories the Incas told them.

They were also known for there kivas's that were belt under ground.          Pavlopertri was a ancient settlement that was settled 5,000 years ago.

They have dedicated themselves to finding these civilizations from the past to show how interesting they were. How they were different and similar to civilization today, and how they could've and have changed and effected history. Also so that we may learn from the past, so we do not make the same mistakes they did, and their choices that failed.              The discoveries made are important because we now know how they once lived and we can be thankfull for what they might have done to help shape civilization today, and thankfull of this knowledge so we know what has worked in the past and what hasn't. It also helps to shape myths and legends, and bring truth to them. For example the Lost Greek city has been discovered, and this sheds light on - and points to - the fable of the lost city of Atlantis.

They hunted deer and gathered berries.         The people of Atlantis planned their towns.  They made pottery.  Atlantis was the first oldest town to be submerged.  The town that was found was 2800 to 1200 B. C.         The Incas lived in Peru.  They lived in the mountains.  They had no alphabet but they used the quipus to tie knots to show the cattle, the calendar, and the different types of cattle.  The strings were colorful.  The cold weather of the mountains preserved the artifacts well so the archeologists could tell the way of life then.        Archelogists found each location to tell us better information about ancestors lives before our lives.  They will research our lives and see what we lived today now and compare then and now.

The Inca never had a alphebet or an actual writing system. They tied knots in colorful strings to keep records. They left behind artifacts such as, potery, gold, silver, and stone. From those clues it has helped us kinda kow how they lived.              The  Puebloans lived in pithouses. They farm instead of hunting and gathering. They  live in small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make potery and acquired the bow and arrow.               The Pavlopetri discovered many different artifacts from Atlantis. There were buildings and streets. It was like a whole town under water. There were artifacts found there such as, potery, silver, and stone.               Archaelolgy is very important because if we didn't do it then we would never find out about the poeple and things that went on in the past. We can learn about it by discovering artifacts and then study them.

These were found in an underwater city, that was lost years ago and now secrets are being unleased about this mysterious discovery of the past. The Incas were one of the civilizations, archaeologist found out that the had no form of alphabet or a system of writing. All they left behind were their colored strings that were called quipus which they marked their calenders with. They also left beatiful portriats of their religion, art , and architecture, agriculture, government and their way of life. Today nobody has been able to know the meaning of their strings because we can't read them.     The Puebloans were known as basket makers because of their skills in craft. They began to farm which replaced hunting and gathering as their main source of food and supplies. They lived in pithouses that were put into crowed villages, these were usually built on mesa tops but sometimes on cliffs. They learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow which was a better weapon for hunting than the atlatl- a spear thrower. When their population begin to multiply they started building haouse above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. They then became known as Puebloans- village dwellers.     The Pavolpetri known as the sunken settlement goes back 5,000 years. This site covers 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Thanks to the current technology we were able to reveal the world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock cut toombs and religious structures. We also found thousands of sharded pottery.

We have found things about the Inca due to the climate that they lived in, and the great moutain sites. The oceans have helped us greatly in the discovery of the sunken city that has lead to the discovery of the Pavlopetri. The sun dried area of the Four Corners has preserved the Puebloans for a long time. But there are plunty of obsticles that face the team of archaeologist.             Most of what we know about the Incas is from the mountains where they lived for almost 100 years. The mountains are like a giant frezzer that has frozen remains and artifacts from the Incan empire. The mountain tops have done a great job keeping the looters away (people who try to steel artifacts). The mountains cold climate is perfect for preserveing artifact that have given us a clue to the past of the Incas. We have found these colorful ropes that have been used by the Incas to tell stories, count, as a calander and to keep trake of live stock.            The sun dried desert area know as the Four Corners use to be a place for the Puebloans to live and celabrate religous things. The sun has dried and preserved the houses and living places of the Puebloans. When archaeologist went in the found old dwellings and the newest dwellings which changed dramticly over time. Before they use to live in Pithouses (houses that are lowerd a few feet into the ground). The last living places of the Puebloan were tall structers several stories above ground with under gound ceremonial rooms called Kiva. The artifacts recoverd from the places showed that over time that the pottery styles changed from traditional dull gray pottery to black drawings on white background. There is still many things still to be learned about them through the artifacts.             The lost city of Atlantis is no longer a myth told by old Greeks. We have found an underwater city off of Greece. The water has perserved it well and is not easy for looters to get to. This discovery of an underwater city provides us with lots of information about the Pavlopetri. The artifacts from this city has been dated to the end of the stone age making it the oldest sumerged planed city in the world. The artifacts fround in the city are one of a kind because the city was never reoccupied.             The geography, weather and other natrual occreances have preserved these artifacts well but they also make it very chalaging for archaeologiost to get to the artifacts. The ocean is an unforgiving place that dose not like to give up it secreates easily. The city is at the bottom of the ocean and this makes it hard to get all the right equipment and need things to find all the posible artifacts. The mountains make it hard to climb up to the sites to get artifacts espeisaly with equipment to use. Transporting the artifacts back down is even more tricky as some are heavy as well as fragal so they are very easy to break. The hot weater of the Foyur Corners make it hard to funcition well for archaeologist. It is also very easy to get dehydrated in the blistering sun and could easily do just as much harm to the archaeologist.            Even though we have had many set backs, chalages and obsticals we have found ways to overcome and manage to learn many things about the Inca, the Peubloan, and the Pavlopetri. We may have done this yet there are many more to come and many things left to learn from their artifacts and their homelands.

For example the Inca's in the article Ancient Inca: Archeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past, lived on a mountain and that might just be what wiped out their civilization. You don't find many cities on mountains anymore know do you? Though how  a city ended up in the ocean we'll probably never figure out exactly why, but we will always speculate and wonder why.                I think that is one of the main reasons that we search for things is to speculate and wonder why and just hope that someday we will actually find out why this is or why that happened. But we do have some answers like from the article Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and their World. The archeologists found about what time the civilizations started and when they ended.  They found out how they lived at the time and some of their cultural aspects that were obvious and really it is all important so we can better ourselves and mostly it's just learning about a different time and place in history.

Why?, because ancient civilizations like these three are a part of the world's history.  Studying these civilizations can reveal so much of human history, it also satisfies the wondering to the longing of so many people's wanting to know about the past.            These civilizations open up a door to the past through artifacts such as the calenders of the Inca, the cliffs and geography of the Puebloans, and the answers to the many questions of Atlantis -- the lost city/world -- also known as the Pavolpetri.  The main idea is that ancient civilizations can lead to other 'worlds', forgotten cities, and by finding all of these things we can learn more about our world.  Where it came from and sometimes learning about the past can lead to the ideas of the future.            By learning about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri we have discovered ancient writings, buildings, pottery, and many other artifacts.  These artifacts have left archealogists in wonder of what else they could find.  The Inca for example are many times confused with the Spaniards, so archeaologists must always make sure that the site they've found or are looking for is of the Inca.  They have discovered quipus, the Inca calender, which is made up of colorful string tied into knots is one form of technology that probably led to the making of greater technology.            Finding these clues have led archeaologists to new levels, ideas, and ways of discovering the past.  Without these clues we wouldn't know how our ancestors lived and we wouldn't know how our people evolved into what we've become.  So, just kept that in mind.

Archaeologists are people that can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniard's accounts from Inca. Archaeologists sometimes archeology confirms historical records.The fall of Inca are the easy date because the Spaniards murdered the LAST Inca Bingin 1532 and took over the empire.These were fairly prosperous times for the Basket markets , and their population multiplied.Later on in the years they began building houses above ground.Most houses were bulitaginst another in long, curving rows, often with pit-house or two in front. Pottery also changed , from simple designs on dull gray background to black drawings on a white background.                      	DT JJ NNS TO VB NNP , PRP VBD RB VBN IN PRP VBD DT JJ .

Today we are still trying to find evidence of the lost city. Many people belive that the lost city was never there it was all just a myth. Some inca textiles and clothing have survived remarkably. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been presevrved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centries ago, but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archaeologists very much. Other sites are reported to archaeologists who can dig them up carefully. They provide the best idea of all life in Peru before and during Inca rule.

Without these discoveries we wouldnt know much of anything of the people and the way of life. The discovery of Pavlopetri may also be the city that inspired the mythical city of Atlantis. The cities show what kind of temples or churches they had and what the worshiped .       When the first Europeans discovered the Inca's, they were amazed at the Inca's ran the empire. The Incas had no form of alphabet so they had no archives, they put knots in string to count and keep track of things. The Peubloans were nomadic and masters as basket making and other woven things. They clustered in small villages and acquired the bow and arrow. The Pavlopetri is theoldest submerged town in the world. Potery and buildings were found aswell as manumental courtyards.

But some of them like the 'Titanic' and 'Alantis' have been sunken. Now since our technology has been vastly upgraded to new inventions like Submarines and Scuba diving, we can explore farther into our Ocean. Also we've created more tools for use on diging such as bulldozer and jackhammers so we can dig farther into Earth. The plantet has been here for over a million years now and there are many secerect inside of it.           So far we have discoverd ancient civilations and vast ruins. But our lastest discovery has been a sunken city near the city of Neapolis, Greece. It dates back to the time Plato was talking about the sunken city of Alantis. It has 9,000 square feet of land and bulidings surrounding it. This also has been the first time theres been a city that dates back to 1200 BC ' The Glory Days '. Acourse Alantis was a myth, but it keeps our minds going; What is truly down there? and is there really a under water city submerged named Alantis?       Next we come to the Ancient Inca. They had no alphabet or a system that followed writing. They only used strings to keep records of about everything. The first Europeans were very amazed to see that they could keep record of everything only using string. No ones knows what the knots mean today but trying to understand is like solving a huge mystery that took place over a 1,000 years ago. We only know about them because the clues they left behind and how our scientist study there way of life. Mostly what we know comes from stories that were passed on generation to generation. Others come just from oral historie and examination. Some of the Incas got frozen to death on the job and were peserved very good for scientist to examine.           Finally we are going to look at the last group of civilations. The Puebloans. They lived about 1,400 years ago before the Europeans came to America. They lived around the Mesa Verde National Park. They are usually know for there craftsman ship in basket weaving. They were also formely nomadic. They lived in pithouses and were clusterd into villages. They learned how to make pottery and craft bows n arrows. The more efficent weapon was a spear. In the 1,880s there have been sights of cliff dwellers. These 'cliff dwellers are thought to be the Peauoblens people/ ancestors. We have many things to discover and much more. Like the galaxy or the other planets history too. But for right now lets stick to the history of planet Earth.

Have you ever wonder how they use to dress, or what they use to do? Well by making all of this discoveries, we can learn much more about it than before.       Also, it can help us to make a better place of what we are living now. It gives us ideas of what we can do without all this technology we have. It tells us what we are doing wrong and what we are doing right.       Least but not last, all those tools can give us an idea of what we do and why we do what we do today. Maybe one of these groups created or satrted with the ideas of  hot-dogs! Who knows? Right! It is just a matter to investigate and think.

We dont want that now do we? No i dont thin so. Well anyways, they show how our ansisters lived before us and they tell how people could have possibly died off and not survied because of some kind of outbreak, diesise or some other kind of epidimic. This is important because in the first one it says that the bodies on the top n the moutaim were highly perserved. So well infact, that scientiest could do many experments on them that they do with people who have recently died. Its important that arcialogist found that because it tells them something they didnt already know. The second one is important because its about culture and backround, many people want to know about there ansisters so they know who they are. Also because it tells about the Earths hisory, and we neeeeeed to know about that. The third source was important because it tells about how a city suck into the ocean! why wouldnt that be important?! Now that they found that scientiest can know the signs of a city/country/continent sincking! If it happened gradually then we can escape from it in time with scientiest being able to research the suncken Greek city. So in conclusion all this information is very imortant to the world today. It helps us in many different ways. 	DT NN VBP RB JJ . IN PRP VBD RB VBN PRP RB PRP VBP VBP VB VBG JJ NNS IN DT JJ . PRP VBP VBP IN RB VBP PRP .

The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to recored the calender to keep a count of livestock. The first europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archeologists have found many ancient quipus-but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.       Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archeologists and marine geologists and known as pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say.   The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around around 1000 BC. Although discovered by a british oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archealogist, aided by digital technology, were able to property survey the ruins.       So how do we know about a civilization that for nearly a hundred years (1438-1532) ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome? Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together details in Inca life.

The discovery is important because the we wouldn't know what we know today about the past.Such as where they lived and how they died.researchers have been very careful to finding out many details about the past.About every thing that happened to the Inca people and his king and their empire.They found it out through many different ways but they pieced it all together and that is how we know they whole story.They have stories,letters,diaries that tell them basically the same thing so tell put all they details they found and all the information they had about the subject and put it together.

Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, during the classic period, the population may have reached several thousand. It was mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the Kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in in the open. The stone walls of the larges pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde, with their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. Baskets shown evidence of declined in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to the craft. About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before.                                       We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in the letters and diaries.

They can help us learn about history through different time periods and different cultures.            Each of the articles talks about a different civilization with a different culture. The first talks about the Inca people of Peru. The second talks about the Pueblos of Mesa Verde, and the third about an unknown sunken city off southern Greece.            In every article, there are different Artifacts found at sites, and they can all tell us something about life at the peak of that civilization.            Archeologists have found a most interesting way of keeping records for a vast empire such as the Inca. It has been found that the Inca kept track of numbers by tying knots in brightly colored strings, called quipus.            Most of what we know of the Inca has been told orally, by stories and legends passed from generation to generation. Some of these stories have been written down by the Spaniards. These cannot be totally relied on though, because it is not known how well the Spaniards understood the Inca. Also, like a lot of other civilizations, the Inca have left behind Gold, pottery, silver, and some stone implements. Clothes and textiles have also been found that connect to the Inca.            Pueblo Pithouses and Kivas have been found In Mesa Verde National Park. The pithouses were where the Pueblo lived from 550 A.D. to 750 A.D. they were a few feet deep in the ground, and were covered by a roof with supporting timbers. Kivas were like churches to the Pueblos. They were gathering places, maybe used for healing, or to pray for rain, good hunting, or a plentiful harvest.            Not a lot is known about the history of he underwater city, except that it is called Pavlopetri, and that is the oldest sunken city in the world. the site covers 30,000 meters and is covered in pottery.            There are always things to be learned from the past, and maybe it makes it a little more fun to solve a mystery.

They are a time in earth's history which to lots of people is really important because these events and lost city's can really tell us more things about are history that we didnt even know could happen. Some archaeologist spend most of thier lives trying to find out how and why these city's adn town's became under water or lost.           In Ancient inca the town's people would build underground houses/ homes called pithouses. They would normally build these on mesa tops they said they thought it was the 'underworld' but that it was still a home to them. They would also make pottery for some down time and mosty to use as dishes. They would use bow and arrows to hunt for their food, since they didnt have any high quality guns and weapons like we do today. They also had basket makers to get more skilled and good at crafting (clothes,shoes etc.)           They also had people called 'cliff dwellers', Which had started in 1880. The studies show that the anicient inca people were very good and skillful in exact words at making a living, From just what they have around them on their land(s). They would just use nature given and hunted supply's. So over ALL the studies they mosty show that all the lost city's and town's that they knew how to survive without man maid tools,food and weapon's they just used what nature provived them with, They used all the resources around them.           ALANTIS:       While a diver was exploring in the ocean of southern greece he found a sunken underwater city, Which had caused the uprise about the Alantis myth's.       The underwater city dates back over 5,000 years ago before our time. The town is known as one of the oldest submerged lost city's. They estimated that he had sunk underwater over 1,000 b.c. The archaeoligist would want to study building structures ,index fossil's, plant fossil's, old human remains, Artifacts and activities that the lost city's people did such as pottery, basket making and other skillful things. This underwater town is VERY important because it shoes you how they lived long ago and how they lived without the things we have today also because it's a time in our earth's history and for us to learn more about our earth we need to study these things more often.

The Inca used colored strings and knots to count livestock and read a calender. The strings could have been used to keep track of other records also. Today no one knows what the knots mean. Trying to understand the knots is like solving a mystery.               The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. They lived in pit housed also believe used for defense. The pit house was under the ground about 2 feet deep. It was only one living room and the four corners supported the roof. Some pit houses were joined together and made 50 other rooms.

The ancient civilizations that were discovered showed us many phases of how that particular culture evolved and prospered or dwindled. This part of history is an important piece in time.   The ways that the ancient peoples lived and learned is  very different than how we do today. The ancient Inca of Peru had absolutely no form of alphabet of system of writing. All of their history was passed down orally or by word of mouth. The only stories or legends that were written down were written down first by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The Europeans did not speak the Inca language well and may not have interpreted it correctly. They didn't even have calendars, they used quipus or large pieces of colorful strings with knots in them to keep a count of livestock.    Archeologists sometimes have trouble recovering artifacts from the Inca because they lived high up in the Andes Mountains and many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were even buried in caves in cliff faes or on mountain tops.

These lost cities were named the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavelopetri. The 3 cities are very important because they have left some fascinating artifacts, that archeologists can study and learn how they lived.       The first civilization was the Inca. First of all the Incas had no alphabet or system of writing. Although they had made quips to record dates of the calendar. The Incas had amazing portraits of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture government, transportation, and the way they lived life. Some of the Inca's ancient artifacts might be made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Which last a very long time, even if they have been buried for over hundreds of years. Some of these artifacts have been taken by some treasure hunters or looters, but some artifacts were taken centuries ago. The Incas lived in the Andes and they may have even worshiped mountain peaks. Some Inca bodies have been found in caves, mountain tops, or in the freezing Andes. Luckily archeologists could scan the bodies and tell us how they died and how they lived.       The second civilization is the Puebloans. To begin with, the Puebloans were very skilled at crafting, there also known as Basketmakers. Instead of hunting and gathering, they farmed. The Puebloans lived in small pit houses clustered as villages but they were built in mesa tops. they learned how to make pottery, bow and arrows, but a more useful tool for hunting was a spear thrower. Later in about A.D. 750 because of the multiplied population the Puebloans began to build houses above ground. After that the Puebloans changed their life style, the mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture.       The last civilization is the Pavlopetri in Greek Atlantis. This lost city was believed to be a myth, but it was found underwater south from Greece. The city was found to be underwater for as back as 5,000 years. The Pavlopetri is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor, it is believed that it was consumed by the sea. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-out tombs and religious structures. We're luck enough to find this underwater city, because most of these cities have dissolved into the sand.       The three lost cities were thought to be myths. But found by some archeologist they have proved the theory of 'just myths' wrong. They have found fascinating artifacts to explain each finding. Archeologists still have more things to explore in each city.

Well, there are many discoveries archaeologist have made for all of these group of native americans.                   Archaeologist discovered bodies in the Andes that were from the Inca. The bodies would show ,with the advance technology that we have now, how they died and how they lived. Puebloans lived on cliff dwellings for more than 50 years. But later on around A.D. 1300 Mesa Verde , were they live, was deserted. They fable of Atlantis is the world's most enduring myths. They belive it is in the waters off of southern Greece. Archaeologist and marince geologist studied , Pavlopetri.                       In conclusion archaeologist are the best resource to connect us to our past.

For example, The Inca had no formal alphabet and made knots in colored strings called quip-us to record the calender to keep a count of livestock. The Ancient Inca is like solving a mystery because even  though today we have the most advanced technique we still aren't sure what was going on, (1438-1532) No one knows what are the stories tied into the colorful strings. Some Inca's artifacts might have made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver; some artifacts are still hidden on the ruins of buildings or buried for hundred of years.  When a archaeologist find a artifacts they right all way photographic and take notes on what there discovery was. Many Inca's were buried in caves cliff faces, or even on mountain tops, so these was way difficult for the archaeologist because they to to carry all their equipment up a mountain and any thing they found was carried down the mountain to be studied. The Pueboans in Mesa verde were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They where the first ones to lived in a pithouse, they where bulited enclosing walls. There discoveries where very important because they learned to make pottery and the bow and arrow for hunting, than the spear thrower. The archaeologist found that the Kiva was a type of church, where they pried for rain and luck in hunting to eat.We learned from the Pueboans that religion was one of the most important things in there community. We also learned that they used fire for cooking but in winter they probably burned throughtout the village when the alcove rooms where damp.The secrets of the city may had inspired one of the world's mosts enduring myths. All artifacts are useful when studing about the past. There many un none lost cities and the only way to discovery one is to explore the out world. Explores and archaeologists are very important cause there part of history. The lost city reminds me of movies especially titanic and spongebob squarepants. Titanic reminds me alot because the boat that sinked its historic, the boat is a lost city too because most artifacts are still flooding and atach to the boat's wall's. Spongebob is part of the lost city to because theres a whole community living in the bottom of the sea. The investigations revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. The archaeologist discoverd a megaron, a monumental struture with a large rectangular hall and some scientist  suggested that the town had been used by an elite, raised the status of the settlement. Everything that you find is useful, maybe 100years later where gonna have newer discoveries cause there is a lot more down there that has to be found.

This has helped  us learn and is important because it has taught us that  more about our history  now in these days at school ,and also all around the world.For examplr like when the Spainards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and also took over the empire.These discoveries  are very important because in the Inca there was different people, and there was alot and theat caused  many razes and also poeple having kids those kids having the features of there parents at the same time.                                                                                                                          It has heped in so many different ways, also it has been important. The Inca , were burried in cliff faces or moutains tops this has helped to preserve the sites. The Puebloans built theirb dwellings  beneath the overhanging cliffs. The Ancestral  Puebloans lived at Mesa Verde,in a pithouses clustted into samll recesses this was made out of walls made out of poles and mud.For this reason , the things have been getting better.They need to see how things can be well and better.                                       It can laso help them because the building had lasted for a very long time. This building lasted from 2800 to 1200 B.C. The making had to have an extrordinary making.This can give an idea so the buildings can last longer. Also what they found ceramics that lead back to the stone age about 1,200 years earlier.They also found a possible megaron with a structure hall,this was very important.All of what they found was important because we can actually get better at it like the houses or not.This now has helped us alot.

The archaeologists didn't find a lot of items though during that Inca empire. The archaeologists found colored ropes called quipus. The quipus was used to record the calender and to keep count of livestock. The archaeologists were amazed how the Inca could run a huge empire. The Incas left behind clues that form a amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and how they lived in the Inca empire.

The Incas clothing has not been destroyed but the Incas preserved it in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.      The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in A.D. 550. The Puebloans were also known as Basketmakers for their skill during crafting. They settled their way of life by building pithouses which were clustered into small villages but usually built on mesa tops on cliffs. The archaeologists found that the Puebloans knew how to make pottery with their crafting skill also they acquired the bow and arrow which were their efficient weapon for hunting than spear throwing. The Puebloans evolved their pithouses into kivas. The kivas were like churches. In the kivas there were be different ceremonies. In the kivas there were different chambers in different rooms to have the ceremonies and also have cooking during the summer so they can use the fire pits. In the last quarter during the A.D. 1200s the Puebloans has droughts and crop failures. When the cliff dwellers left they south into New Mexico and Arizona by settling among their kin who were already there. Whatever may have happened, some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.      In Greece their are lost secrets in lost underwater cities. Archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri which was a sunken settlement that dates back 5,000 years of time of Homer's heroes. The site which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago it was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. Thanks to shifting sand and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock cut tombs, and religious structures also on the seabed there thousands of shards of pottery. The settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago and at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought. The investigation revealed over 9,000 square meters of buildings. The marine archaeologists discovered a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, which also suggests that the town had been used by an elite, and automatically raised the status of the settlement. Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.

The evidence shows the past and the way of life each civilization lived. It shows that throughout years, humans have evolved within technology or with how the way we live.   Each set of information has taught me that the past is full of mystery that we have yet to learn. I think it is very clear to say that evidence from the past is very important in order to understand human beings.

However, they had many ways to communicate without these things. They made knots in colored strings called quipus to keep count of livestock and to record the calendar. The Europeans were shocked and amazed when they first met the Inca because they could run a huge empire using just strings to keep records. Without anyone to read what these colorful strings mean, the Ancient Inca would be like solving a mystery.   We know about this civilization because of the clues left behind    from the Inca. These clues left behind form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their life-style. Archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life by studying these clues.

The Inca did not leave any sort of alphabet so historians could practice on how the Inca used to live back then. The things we know today are not well answered but we know what they are, for example the quipu is some sort of string design that kept the records of calenders. The knots on these designs are still not well known. For tradition the Inca passed down storeis in order to preserve the community's history. Most of our information we know comes from other things like artifacts and primary resources.             The sunken city still holds some geologists with questions that they want to find an answer to. Geologists say that this is the oldest submerged city yet to be found. This city shows many sources that could help these geologists find their answers. The city is believed to have been 30,000 square meters covering the ocean floor about 5,000 years ago when it sank. The geologists went down with the technology to learn more about this sunken city. This old cities that we have today is a great source to finding out how people used to live back then. The water around the city are so shallow that it is kind of strange. The is a really important find to the geologists and the rest of the people.

It proves the theories that filled some of the holes in history. The thought of a sinking cities, cliff people(Inca), and the Puebloans makes more mysteries of how and why. What sunk the city, why did the cliff people leave, and what happened to Puebloans and their world? All of this is important cause it shows what our world was like before.      The city of Atlantis,The Incas city, and what is left of the Puebloans were found and studied many things were found that said what kind of civilization it was and what they do. Their religion, art, life, enemies, social living, knowledge, and agriculture were all shown on what is left of them. All of it showed their history and resources.      The Incas had an empire they were more scientific than the other tribes. They had calenders that were made of string that kept record on the livestock. The empire were able to run on the calendars and had their success. They were known for living on the Alps and living through unforgivable winters. They grew crops during the spring and store them. They had a religion and structure, but somehow it disappeared with them. The Incas left their empire for no clue why. Many say they left for a religious cause but others say the weather killed their crops leaving them to migrate. The clue that other people lived there was that there were bodies buried and preserved in well condition where our technology we can learn how they lived.      The lost city of Atlantis was found in the waters southern Greece making the myth real. When researched by a team and was found probably the oldest town to have been in the water. Artifacts were found and showed so much of what they were like. The mysteries was how did it sink.      These facts in history filled holes and made new ones. The fact of these being found and researched on means maybe otheer ledgends and myths may be true.

These discoveries are important, because they help us interpret clues about a civlization that were alive hundred of years ago.             Archaeologists are people who are interested in knowing all kind of this stuff, and find artifacts inorder to figure out the stories behind these civilizations. Some of what we know about the Incas came fromartifacts, sites, clothing, and records that wre left behind. historians help us discover the past civilizations. These people have these jobs, beacause they are interested to know how prople's lifes have progressed and technology. The orgins of the Incas are the most difficult to trace; archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about the Inca's predecessors.               Puebloans became knon from their building of homes. Puebloans is a Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers.' The structures are evidence of a society that, over centeries, advanced in skills and traditions and passed them from generation to generation. In 1100 A.D. to 1300 A.D. Ancestral Puebloans were heir of a vigorious civilization, whose accomplishmentsin community living and the arts ranked among the finest expressions of human culture in North America. Whatever may have happened, some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde.                 The lost city is now known as Pavlopetri. What makes this city unique is the fact that it has been sunken under water and still is in tact. Archaeologists aided by digital technology and were able to properly survey the ruins. What they found surpassed all their expectations. The exploration revealed a world of bulding, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tobs and religious structures. Marine geologists have not yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include that it was the result of either an earthquake or a tsunami.

The ancient Incas created a device that counted the days and kept track of the days. This device was called the quipus. The Puebloans are known for basketmaking and are called 'Basketmakers.' Farming replaced hunting and gathering was their main livelihood. The Pavlopetri and the Puebloans are know to be in the same group.                      All of these groups  lived in South America and were advanced in textiles, buildings/religious structures, and in item making. Puebloans built house structures called pithouses. These houses were very simple structures that were easy to make and to be in.  Incas built their some of their buildings on high mountain tops. Due to the building of these buildings on high and cold mountain peaks, these artifacts have been preserved very well and contribute to our knowledge of the ancient Incas, Puebloans, etc. Having their artifacts help us to know more about what they were doing in that time and what they were advanced most in during that time. Seeing these artifacts(mostly the high pyramid-like structures) amazes lots of people because the Incas were good at making high pyramids while England or the Colonies were making guns that were not as hard to make. Making pyramid structures take ALOT of time and energy to make because thet are so colossal and complex. These ancient people are important because they tell us before technology was first used or thought of, they had their own methods and cultures that they would indulge themselves in. They also show that their cloth making was very similar to our cloth or textile making.                   Knowing that these people could have done such things as building elaborate buildings, making beautiful pottery, and keep track of the days shows the modern day that there were other people living in the world during this time period and were very skilled in their cultures. Although looters have stolen precious artifacts, there are still many more that are to be found and many more that will someday reveal all of our questions about the ancient Incas.

They also face weather and natural causes like rain, heat, and humidity. This weaher could damage the artifacts that the archaeologists find. And thats what this article is about.

Finding out about how the ancient civilizations lived are very important so that we do not make the same mistakes that the other civilizations did. Just by where the inca lived was a great discovery, we know that they had to get use to the thin air that was up there in the moutains. The city of atlantis under water was a great find because it is the first submerged city ever found. It was hard to find this city because divers had to go so deep into the water. In conclusion, the finds that they made are very important to the everyday life.

We can learn a lot of boring things from archaeologists and their dedicated work.  They must have a lot of fun digging up old artifacts.       Their work on the ancient cultures has been greatly praised and will be used to torture children in school all over the world.

Some discoveries that were made about the Inca were the many artifacts that archaeologists found.  They discovered objects made from stone, pottery, gold, and silver.  These artifacts have lasted an extensive amount of time, which shows that the Inca were pretty organized and thought ahead.  Their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, and transportation all show us how they lived and what it was like back then.       There were many other discoveries that were made about the Puebloans.  The smoke-blackened walls show that the Puebloans lived in very cold weather, and needed a fire to keep them warm.  The structures of the Puebloans shows that they gained skills and traditions.  They are known to have the finest expressions of human culture in the North American area.       The last discoveries were made of the Pavlopetri.  The lost city was the reason for the fable, Atlantis.  Archeologists found buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures.  They even found shards of pottery.  All of these discoveries were found underwater by archeologists.  Because they found this underwater city, it can tell us more about the Mycenaean society and how they worked.       All of these civilizations play a key role in the discoveries of our world.

Archaeologists have been studying the Inca for a lot of years. Finding artifacts have been a way of researching the past. Finding these artifacts have caused archaeologists to make amazing discoveries.        Archaeologists can study the Puebloans by finding out how they live their life. Also by looking at the way they made their houses and tools.       The pavolopetri can be studied by researching and visiting their homelands. A lot of very important information can be found by doing that. Also by trying to understand these peoples lives.      All of the different ways archaeologists studied made a great impact on what we know today.

When archaeologists find artifacts such as farming techniques, their house structures, alphabet, and others it helps to present the ways we have advanced overtime. Also it proves the ways of how each ancient civilization were different for one another.           The foundings of old artifacts from ancient cities allows us to see how we used to live. They show us the different beliefs that they worshiped. Also how they built houses, farmed, and even drew symbols. It could led to archaeologists using their techniques and showing them to the rest of the world. For example in countries in South America, some people still use the underground house and the Kivas, a ceremonial room. The artifacts that archaeologists have dug up have shown us today the techniques of the past.            The artifacts that have been found, also show our advancements from those time periods. They led us to how we have developed, changed, and invented bigger and better things. For example, the houses of the Puebloans were called pit house and were very clustered into small villages. The pit houses were underground or in cliff sides. Today they have advanced into roomy houses with big yards and bigger neighborhoods. So home structures have evolved. When archaeologists find ruins of ancient civilizations, it helps humans conclude how we have advanced and added on to their techniques.           Furthermore, the findings prove to archaeologists of how each city in the past were different. Such as, the Incas and the Puebloans. They're both different from each other, such as there houses and buildings. The way they all disapered is different also. The Incas were taken over by the Spaniards when they murdered the last Incan king in 1532. The Puebloans supposedly left Mesa Verde to travel south into New Mexico and Arizona. The do not know what for surely happened to their kin. Artifacts helps to show that each civilizations were not the same.          The founding of ancient artifacts have helped us today to discover a few things. They led to prove to us how our type used to live. Also how we have advanced and bettered their ways and teachings. Each civilization was different and the remains show us tremendously how.

Archeologist cam use artifacts found in the living areas of the Aztec, Peubloans, and Pavlopetri. They can study these objects to learn when they were made, how they were used, and what it's made of.   The Aztecs had some quiet interesting objects that archeologists have found throughout the Aztec ruins. They have found quipus which are knots in strings to keep track of livestock and the calender. This shows us that the Aztecs were quite developed and intelligent in order to have a system on how to control records. Many other tools and objects like gold and silver have been stolen by looters but some were left behind in tombs deep in pyramids and the ground.The objects found allow us to know about the things that were buried with the people and the uses of those objects for the 'afterlife' for those people. Some archeologist have found full bodies preserved in the cold of the mountains. They may be able top study these people and learn how they died and what caused their death. All of this is important because it tells us how we as humans use to live in the past. Puebloans, or so called by archeologists, Anasazi , meaning 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies', were known as basket-makers. The baskets they crafted would be extremely important to archeologist and would help them understand the use of the baskets and the material made to be used in these baskets.The pottery, bow and arrow, and spear would be great tools to learn about the daily life of these nomadic people from the ancient times. Their homes, the pit-houses, were very well constructed with living rooms and fireplaces. They were very intelligent to be able to create homes almost like modern ones.   Last but not least the Pavlopetri. There was a lost city found in the in the ocean near the city of Greece. There were remains of an actual planned out community. The city dated back at least 2800 to 1200 BC and it had main streets, courtyards, churches, and homes. There were broken and fixed pieces of pottery in the homes that could be used for further study by scientist. It would let us know about how people long ago have lived. There are many discoveries around the world that provide information of the past lives. It is rather interesting on the types of objects you find in the different regions of the world. All of these objects allow us to learn and study more about our pasts as mankind.

Archaeologists have been searching for ancient civilizations for hundreds of years. Why are they so interested? Why are they so important? Many archaeologists are spending all their waking hours trying to find the lost city of Atlantis. Only one find has come close to being that city. The Pavlopetri found what looks like the remains of an underwater city off the coast of Greece.       Many are thinking it is the lost city of Atlantis. The civilians are ecstatic because their ancestors told them about an ancient civilization that lived underwater. The civilians didn't believe them at first, but after this find, they believe their ancestors at last. They take pride in this find because it was one of the biggest archaeological finds ever, and it was near their territory.       The find of the Incas was another big find in archaeological discoveries. We all knew their were people who lived in America before us. But after this find, we knew how they lived, what they did with farming, and what kind of religious beliefs they lived on. Everyone in America was awed by the find of this tribe. They lived for hundreds of years, but then the Spanish rule came and took over their land, spreading diseases, and killing innocent people.       Everyone want to find traces of ancient civilization. It is important to find out too, because it helps us learn from mistakes, and helps us shape our future. 	JJ NNP NNP RB JJ . NNS VBP VBN VBG IN JJ NNS IN NNS IN NNP NNP VBP PRP RB JJ .

These discoveries are very inportant in the discovery world.           The Inca made knots in differnt colored strings to keep track of livestock or their other needs. This showed archaeologists how smart they were during that time period in Peru.           The ancient Puebloans advanced to double-coursed stone to make houses. This new advancement would have never been discovered if it weren't for the ruins and remains of houses or buildings. From what archaeologists discovered of the buildings, they can determine how they lived.            Archaeologists discovered that the Pavlopetri lived five thousand years ago from ceramics dating back to the stone age. From this discovery, archaeologists can see if their calculations were right or wrong about what time period the Pavlopetri lived in.            Discoveries from the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important beacuse they show archaeologists where they lived, how they lived, and during what time period.

Well.. i have.. so ill tellyou wha they discovered.Discoveries about the inca,the puebolans are so important because, we found out the different languages that they used and we found out what they used to communicate.       The incas used colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. The peubolans were callled the basketmakers because of their skill at the craft. Another reason why the puebolans are important is because they built all their homes by hand with what they had. The incas left behind many happenings to do with their religion, art, and architecure that forma an amazing picture in your head.        In conclusion, these discoveries have hepled us get to know how the inca and puebolans lived and what their religion was.  For example, the puebolans made many baskets, and many other crafts. The inca left behind many things tracing back on how they lived and what their religion was. 	NNP NN NNP PRP RB VBD IN WRB NNS VBN NNS IN DT JJ .

Recently a group of scientists has found an under water Greek city, have studied the Inca and Puebloan people.     The  under water city was found off of the southern waters of Greece.This city may have been what inspired the myth of Atlantis. The diving team of archaeologists has to be extra careful though when trying to get better examples of what the under water city had within itself, because they could drown. The archaeologists still don't know what have caused this city to sink but believe that it was the combination of rising sea levels and an earthquake. This belief and myth will only lead to more intense exploration of this submerged city.      The ancient Inca had ruled a South American empire for almost a hundred years. The scientists that studied the Inca had a rough time because the Inca didn't live just on the normal flat elevations. They lived upon the Andes mountains, making it harder for the scientists to study artifacts and other clues left behind by them. The Inca  also were very strange and hard to study because of the fact that they didn't leave any written records. They only recorded stuff with pieces of string called quipus, that were very hard to understand.As you can see, these people had a large and intricate culture and civilization that is hard for people to understand today.      The puebloan people are a very interesting people for three reasons. One they were first known as basket makers. Two they figured out how to improve their houses into a more efficient housing style. Three they just vanished randomly. These people were called the basket makers because that's what they were very skilled at. These people first lived pit houses clustered into small communities, then eventually thought of a kiva(mainly used religiously), and then evolved in to making 'apartments' out of stone.Scientists believe that these people just left their houses and land because of  drought and crop failures. All in all, the Puebloan people are very interesting for the reasons stated.     In conclusion, these three ancient civilizations still have a lot of studying to do but have been explored enough to bring some truth to any myths or misbeliefs about them.

They were alot like solving a mystery. The Ancient Incas also had many artifacts, that they used. But that was soon all taken away from them when the Europeans came to their land, and they took away everything that belonged to them. This happened in 1532. Almost about everything we know about them comes from the Spaniards who wrote down what they saw. The rest that we know just comes from Incan artifacts. Some Incan textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well.Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca.The Inca lived high in the Andes and may have worshiped some mountain peaks.

Clues thet where left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of thier religion, art and architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologists and others can piece together deatails of Inca life. We know some old stories of Inca life becouse of the old stories they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were spanish soldiers and priests. They describe the Inca in letters and diaries. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts ot ge cold mountins of the Andes.   Puebloans: About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for thier home. Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies.' We now call them Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descendents.

Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus- but still to this day, no one knows what the knots mean. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quuipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock. As soon as we find someone who can figure it out, then we'll finally know what the mean. The Inca have some really great stories they used to tell. the reason we know this is because some of the old stories were written down by the Europeans. Inca made most of their stuff out of stone, pottery, gold, or sliver. we have found many artifacts that were left behind from the Inca.                  Puebloans are know as 'Basketmakers', for their skill and craft. Eventually they started to build houses. They built houses one against another in long, curving rows. Puebloans are also known as, a spanish word meaning, 'village dwellers'. The marterials they used was some sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread. The mortar between the bloacks was a mixture of water and mud. The rooms were big enough for two or three persons.                     I think these discoveries really help us to find out and learn about how our ansecors lived and how they survived without the tools we have today. I hope we can discover some more interesting things about them later on in life.

Fires were built in summer mostly for cooking and during winter they were built when the alcove rooms were damp and uncofortable. Fires probably burned throughtout the village. Using nature advantages, Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. In about A.D. 750 Basketmakers began building houses above gound. they used poles and mud to make upright walls. They built the houses one against another in long, curving rows. They often built with a pithouse or two in the front. It is very important to learn about the Inca , the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.

They found civilizations like the Inca an Puebloans. I believe this is a great discovery. We can learn so much more about ourselfs and our past. We can learn what our ancestors did for fun or for work. We can learn what they ate and if they hunted anything. We can learn about old technology. That is why discovering civilizations like the Incas is a great treasure.

They all also had some sort of downfall as well, whether it was a physical downfall or just being conquered by another nation.  all of these cities have also prospered at one time.   For example, ancient Inca was conquered by Spanish explorers, while the underwater city was sunken and preserved in a bay near Greece.  Other civilizations, such as the Peubloans of Mesa Verde were simply abandoned and moved elsewhere.  These three finds, however, are special in particular because of their locations.  The Inca civilization is in south America, while the underwater city is in Greece.  They are on two separate sides of the world, which means that researchers get a view of two different country's pasts.   Another importance is that they can see the different cultures and skills of the civilizations, such as the peubloans, who are known as the basket-makers due to their incredible basket-weaving skills.  The Inca were known for making pots and jewelery out of clay, gold, silver, and other precious metals.  The Pavlopetri of the underwater city, however, are known for their planned cities, road systems, and Greek style architecture.   Also, some of the cities, due to their climates, even have preserved their dead so well that scientists are able to study their cause of death and even how they lived.   Although all of these cities are differentin their own ways, they all are very important to the study of ancient history due to their living habits and rich culture.

I am going to explain three  ancient civilizations: Ancient Inca, Mesa Verde National Park, and Ancient Greeks  Lost City.          Ancient Inca's archaeologist found ancient quipas,  colorful strings that have knots in them and tells a story . Nobody today knows how to read the knots of the ancient quipas. We know some of the stories because they were either written down by the Europeans or were told orally. Some Inca Civilizations  have been interrupted by treasure hunters. In 1532 the fall of Inca, Spaniards murdered the last Inca king.  it is hard tell the artifacts because many other people occupied there land after them.Mesa Verde National park had may different artifacts.          Mesa Verde's artifacts are most commonly there buildings. They had different types of stone buildings; pole-and-adobe, double coursed stone, and many other types. they lived under over hanging cliffs and, cliff dwellings.       Ancient Greeks Lost City  was fouund underneath water. It is hard tell exactly how it sunk but people have theories. Some of there theories are difference in sea level, earthquakes or a tsunami. Some people knew there was something there, but they didn't know it was a huge greek city. Only one-precent of oceon ground has been searched.Alantas was a myth , but the sorty of Ancient Greeks lost city makes people think there or more out there.

OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY:       *the Inca of Peru created an alphabet to record there history     -they also created the first calender to plan when to have the harvest of crops and animals       -/-supposedly also the end of the world     -Incas also are believed to have created the oral luangauge by passing down there beliefs and stories       *Romans and Incas left behind traces of there past that shaped modern day architectural,government    transportation ,and are ways of life.       In conclusion this is only part of the story , because only 1% of the ocean floor has been explored along with many undescovered lands and past civilizations.

In ancient Inca, there were lots of interisting buildings called kivas and pithouses and had spear throwers for defence systems. Pithouses featured a one living room and the fire pit had an air deflector,storage bins,and pits. A kiva is a hopi word for cerimonial room where cerimonies were held for healing rites or to pray for rain,luck in hunting,or a good crop.Also for gathering places and  sometimes to weave.To enter,go down the ladder through a hole in the roof called a sipapu-a symbolic entrance to the underworld.           The Puebloans built homes underneath cliffs and lived there for less than a hundred years and by AD 1300,the place was deserted for immigration.Their fires in the summer were used for cooking   and in winter,the fires burned down the villages.           Last but never least,artifact of Atlantis were found under the ocean because legend has it that it was sunken and isolated from the world like the Titanic. Recently,undersea explorers found things of Atlantis at the bottom of the sea and the site was 30,000 square meters of sea bottom so, scientists   searched hardly even 1% of the place.

They got so fascinated in things because we wondered how can they run such a huge empire and keep such record of it all. They went all the way back to 1438-1532. They studied they religion, art, architecture, government, transportation and there way of life. For the underwater discovery's they have discover many things like Atlantis and the titanic and many more.             They discovered every thing possible like they way they dresses and and how there clothes looked and they even have some actual clothes they have found and put them in museums.They know how there houses were built and what they had inside of them. Archaeologist have discovered how they got place to place. The boats and how they traveled across them. They learned there spirituals and what they believed and their dances. They had to learn there language. How they wrote and how they got news to each other.            Besides them discovering everything they had to go through some rough times. They figured out how to preserved everything and kept them in good condition. Also going through all the weather and hard conditions. Archaeologist also went though being away from family's and then having to go though the conditions where they were at. Finding Atlantis and having to go under thousands of feet and trying to figure out how to get the big discovery's out of the bottom of they ocean and then trying to get it over and across the world to a museum or something. They did a great job and i love hearing about it in they books.

Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows whta the knots even mean. Without anyone being able to read the stories in the knots, ancient Inca civilization alot like a mystery. This civilization lasted from 1438- 1532. The Inca king was murdered by Spaniards        The first ancient Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. farming replaced hunting an gathering as their main livelihood.They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually bulit on meas tops, but sometimes in cliff recesses.        Another ancient civilization was the lost city of Greek. THis was the oldest submerged town int eh world. This site straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern peloponnese, it is said to have been consumed by the sea around 1000BC. This exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock cut tombs and religious structures.

That is why we have archaeologists to explore other ways of life and how they lived it.Even to understand why it changed or how it happened. Maybe see what we need to improve on or what we need to do to make our life better. To make the whole world better for everyone even the animals and planets.     It is important that we learn more about about different civilations so we understand and learn different ways of life. Thats why archaeologists hvae been exploring and trying to figiure out why this happens or why that happens. To get differenrt ways of life, to undestand why those civilizations dont exsist anymore.      What if our way of life is harming us yet we dont know it yet because we havent explored different ways of life. Or we might even become like those civilizations and become exstinct. Thats why its so important that arcaeologist expolre those civilatizations. To better our world and understand it more.     	NNP PRP VB IN PRP$ NN IN NN VBZ JJS IN PRP .

The test was difficult and hard and it was one of the longest test I have ever token. With all this reading it is overwhelming and weird to see this test is made for kids. In my opinion people will not and should not have to read all of this read all of this. When I mean will not I mean people will just skip over a paragraph or two.Back to the test if it had less reading that would be better but in all a good test.OK i don't know how to make it longer so the end.

It is a good question but there are reasons why there are important. The ancient civilizations may help us understand more of the past and our ancestors.   In Peru, the ancient Inca lived. They used knots to record and stories to explain their history. The clues they left behind of their great culture help us piece together their lives. The Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde were skilled basket makers. These people evolved from a nomadic life to a settled life with farming. In A.D. 1200 their population shifted into cliff alcoves. They were adept builders, artisans and crafters from the evidence they left behind in their cliff dwellings. Off the coast of Southern Greece a lost submerged civilization was uncovered. It known as the City of Pavlopetri. In the Article from The Guardian, it is said it is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predated the time Plato wrote the tale of Atlantis. It is filled with insights of works from the Mycenaen culture. This ancient city is oldest subemerged city found in the world. It may give us insights on its old culture and far older cultures.   These discoveries can help us better understand our ancient worlds and the lost people of the past.   These disoveries of ancient civilizations may also help improve todays world. The knowledge of ancient civilizations can help us even if they are older than what we know. How they developed and expanded their technology and ways can help us do the same. Also how we disover their civilizations could help us explore more of our world. The oceans we could disover more about, the jungles, the cliffs, mountains and other unexplored regions. The disoveries also help us know what our people were like, our past was like. The ancient civilizations can help us.   The ancient civilizations tell us, help us understand more of the past they we ever realized. The Incas on how they ran their empire and influenced others, the Ancestral Puebloans on how they devloped and changed and the lost of Pavlopetri on how much we still have to discover. The ancient civilizations, the past, may help be prepared for future and more.      	DT NNS IN JJ NN NNS VBP CC NN PRP DT TO VB IN WP RB RB MD VB CC DT MD VB WP POS RB JJ IN VBG NN NNS .

For example the ancient Inca of Peru kept records of things using quipus due to not having formal alphabet or a system of writing. If we wanted to send something to another person without anybody else figuring it out we could take the Incans idea by using the quipus.   The Peubloans were known as basket makers due to their skill at the craft. The Peubloans showed us a more civilized way of living. For example, replacing hunting and gathering with farming, making pottery both for art and for daily use, developing the bow and arrow for hunting, and also living in small civilizations known as villages in pithouses.   Lastly the Pavlopetri showed a very modern way of architecture. By develping buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and also religious structures such as temples and churches. Also archeaologists discovered that the seabed was lined with thousands of shards of pottery from this ancient civilization.       As you can see these three civilizations add to our many wonders in the world. We have the Incas who gave us the idea of the postal system due to there idea of relaying quipus around there vast civilization. The Peubloans who brought us the idea of basket weaving, farming, the bow and arrow, building houses above the ground, stone masonry and much-much more. If it wasn't for these three civilizations, the world wouldn't have known about how the Incans did not have an official writing system and that they they used quipus (knots in colored strings) to communicate. Or about the Peubloans being known as basket-makers, and that these artistic people designed houses that were above ground instead of just a one floored house and they also developed multiple rooms, they also developed a ceremonial room that could also be used as a gathering place for people to weave. The ceremonial room was actually under the Peubloans houses. Lastly the Pavlopetri who are probably one of the oldest civilizations found underwater to remain as a whole. This civilization remained as a whole due to the shifting sands that protected the Peloponnesian peninsula. The Pavlopetri were advanced with there architecture. Archeaologists discovered courtyards,bulidings, stone masonry, and even worship centers in this modern civilization under the sea. These three civilizations are wonders.

For an example one of the Ancient people have made a knot on a colored strings which Archaeologists are trying to figure out what it means and what it does. Acient poeple weren't born back then when dinarsours lived those were caveman. Every Archaeologists that find's a peice of valuable stuff. They have to study them really careful. Just like The Mesa Verde because about 1,400 years ago a group of four region of people chose The Mesa Verde as their home.                      The four region people loved their homes until every building were to elabrate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon wall's. Then in the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two the four region people who lived ther had moved away. Now years later Mesa Verde was publised as a national park which preserves a spectacular reminder of the ancient culture. For Archaeologists they call The Mesa verde the Anasazi which means ' The Ancient Ones' or ' Anicent Enemy's'. But now we call them Ancestral Puebloans.                        Everybody knows about Lost Greek CIty that has been undersea since 5,000 (2800 to 1200 BC) years ago! experts say it is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor of the southern peloponnese, it is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. A British oceanographer 40 years ago discovered The Lost Greek City, it was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to proplerly survey the ruins.                      The location of The Lost Greek City is near Neapolis in Greece. their investigtion also revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. they were surprised when they revealed a discovery of a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangle hall. some people find it most amazing about the Lost Greek City that has sumberged for so many years.

The discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because it is important to have knowledge of the past. We also need to know were things originated from. For some people it is important to know about these heritages because some people want to know were there colonies or heritages originated from. Without knowledge of these people we wouldn't know where many of these ancient artifacts came from. For example, how would we know what civilization was like back then, like how they would hunt for food, or how they would make their clothes. We need to know how civilization was back then so we can look over how much things have changed now that we are in the 21st century. The Inca's, the Puebloans, are the Pavlopetri are so important because they made a huge impact on the lives of the people that lived back when. They were considered their own pack, or colonies and that is how people lived back then. They started their own colonies to get by just we do in the   America. Nowadays, people ask how they could survive back then without tv or internet, but back then they didnt even have eletricity so it is important to know how thay lived because people nowadays have their lives made easy when, back 5,000 years ago people barely had enough to get by. So, it is important to know about the discoveries of these people because they made are important to modern society.         	WRB VBP DT NNP NNP NNP NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP NNP NNP .

They learned about Ancient Inca, and how they tied knots. They learned about Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and how they lived. They even learned/ discovered that many civilizations sank under water!            Ararchaeologists have learned tons about the Inca. They know that the Inca lived in Peru. They also know that the Inca's have no alphabet because they tied knots to tell stories and even keep track of crops. These were called quipus. Quipus have many colorful strings tied into knots. But nobody know what the different knots mean. Many people know about the Inca if they relatives from Inca cultures because many stories were passed down from generation to generation. They believed it was important to preserve a community's history. The Inca even left behind many clues when they all left. They left back art, architecture, portrait, agriculture, government, transportation. These can all be pieced together to see how there way of life is. When the Europeans came in 1532, they wrote down the stories they were told by the Inca. No one knows if the stories are right because they couldn't always understand what the Inca were saying. They described tons about the Inca in letters and diaries.  The rest that people know about the Inca is just found artifacts. Some of which were buried with the dead for their afterlife. This is how people pieced together much about the Inca. Some of the Incas clothing and textiles were left behind. Usually, the material would of fallen apart or been destroyed if it got wet. But these were preserved in the dry desserts in Peru. Some were even found on the Andes Mountains. The archaeologists keep very careful records of what they find. They also take many pictures, and they even write down the exact position that the artifact was found.  The origins of the Inca are very hard to trace. But it is very easy to tell when the fall of the Inca was. Its easy to date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532. The Spaniards also took over their empire. The Inca lived high in the Andes Mountains. Many were buried in caves or on mountain tops. This is good because it helps keep looters (people looking for artifacts that shouldn't be) out, but makes it harder for the archaeologists.            The Mesa Verde National Park preserves and ancient culture.  Aarcheologists refer to the people that lived in the placed being preserved as Anasazi. Anasazi is a Navajo word that is translated as ' the ancient ones'. The Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde  lived in houses called pithouses. Pithouses were usually built on mesa tops or in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and were the first to acquire a bow and arrow.  They even made a special tool for hunting called the atlatl.This is basically just a spear thrower. By A.D 1000 the people  started to make better houses. Above ground and two or three stories high. these were joined together with 50 rooms or more. They built fires in summer, but the fires were just for cooking. In the winter, the fire's smoke blackened the village and the blackened walls were/ are reminders of the bitter cold that the Inca's lived through.  Ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde for only 100 years, then Mesa Verde was deserted.             A diver discovered a sunken settlement in Southeren Greece. The sunken settlement dates back about 5,000 years. This was the time of Homer's Heros. Dr. Jon Henderson says, 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' The site takes up about 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. What they have found suprised them. Thy found the settlements enclosure, buildings, structure, and rock-cut tombs. They eventually revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings.Archaeologists discovered that Atlantis is just a myth, but it keeps under water searching going.           So as you can see archaeologists are still learning about ancient Indians.

Earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis have destroyed many civilizations, many people, but still we persevere. And as we progress, we look into the past, to see what we looked like, and how we did things; this sis essential to life. Where is one without the history of how they got to be in this world, how they lived, and how they evolved. The discoveries that scientists make about Inca, Puebloans, and the Palvopetri are essential to us because they represent our previous ways of life, culture, and structure of humanity.       The Puebloans were powerful and resourceful people. basket-makers, they had many things. They way they they lived was evident in what was left behind by them, scientists find many things that show how they lived. Houses, made of sticks and mud, show us how they made shelter for themselves using only rudimentary tools. Tools, showing us how they progressed humans, from leaving a more elementary stage to becoming developed, more complex creatures. And they found evidence that shows that they were farmers, instead of the hunters and gathers that came before them. Finding out how they lived is essential to us; it shows us how they progressed out way of life.       The Inca, a powerful civilization with the power to meet the likes of even Rome, ruled for almost 100 years. Located in the Andes Mountains, these people lived and worshiped here. However, they had no alphabet, just colored strings with knots. They ruled, for almost a hundred years, with out any form of proper records. The Spanish themselves were shocked, how could someone so great, so powerful, live without records? Scientists, however, found different things to help them. They found artifacts to help them see how the people lived, and how they survived. This is a great advancement  in out history.       Finally, the people of Atlantis. Great and powerful also, as science examines them, we see how their culture affects us. It shows us how they too, had large buildings to represent power, and that that they too could lead. All of these accounts help us, and progress us, in our knowledge of the world before us. Things like this are essential.

You surely wouldn't get that question wrong twice, right?  This is the exact same situation with historical findings.  As we excavate and find lost civilizations such as the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, we learn how they lived and how they were destroyed.  It is from this factual evidence that we learn what to do and what not to do.  Archaeology and excavations are important because they teach us about the past and the mistakes that we should avoid from the past.        The Incas are a good example of knowledge from the past.  There is much to learn about the Incas as they were 'a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome' (Gruber).  This is a huge feat, as the Incas were able to match the Roman civilization at a fraction of their time.  The Incas also lived as a civilization filled with art, architecture, religion, agriculture, government, and transportation.  This advanced and rich way of life has taught us about technology, as they were able to accomplish greatness with such primitive knowledge.        Another civilization of greatness would be the Puebloans, as they have advanced greatly through their years.  They evolved from nomadic hunters to settled farmers, from adobe structures to stone buildings, and from pithouses to kivas.  Their progressions were immense, and they have taught us the art of change.        The Pavlopetri civilization has also taught us some things.  It was a grave mistake for them to build their city so close to the coast.  This mistake cause their city to sink underwater, inspiring myths of the mythical city 'Atlantis'.  Overall, these civilizations have taught us about life. 	NNP PRP RB VBN DT NN JJ IN DT NN NN CC RB VB PRP RB IN DT NN . PRP RB MD RB VB IN NN IN NN , RB .

The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Bodies foung in the icy Andes are in such good shape that the experts can use the modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived. The Puebloans were known as the 'basketmakers' for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livehood. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths, the fable of Atlantis have been brought to light from beneath the waters of southern Greece.

First of all to figure out how our ansesters have lived before us. The langueage they spoke the tools they used. And a few others also. All these subjects are important.                The artifacts found by the archaeologist are useful. They are very interseting to. They way they have lived by the things they find, such as the pottery, there clothing, there houses, and all the little things that make up life. When we study the way they lived, it helps us undertstand how we got the things we have today. Because they are the ones whom have started it off. To some people it is very interesting to find out what people liveing way before our time, many of thousands of years ago, did and how they did this or that.                When the archaeologist study artifacts they have found, this can explain why they have died or this land has been lost. This can all tie up to to just mother natuar herself. And once they findout what has happend such as an earthquake they can track it down to see how long arpart it is from each, other earthquack. The things that may have happend the these people, we, now aday can figure what may have happend to them come up with our own conclustions.                In the articles they all have somethings incommen. All the artifacts they have found were mostly kept safe from harm of weather. Such as being in the cold mountains or burryed under the ground andor even being underwater and like decomposeing. The archaeologist can figureout the culture of the artifacts they have found, then put the puzzle together and find out what artifacts goes to which group of people.                 These are my reasons for why having artifacts is so impotant. There are for sure many more reasons why there is more to it of importance. These aew the my reasons to being important. How are these artifacts important to you? 	WRB VBP DT NNS RB JJ .

Incas are a well known name when it comes to old civilizations but, did you know that they bury people in the Andes mountains. With the hidden city of Atlantis most people think it is just a myth but they did find it. Mesa Verde National Park they found these huts that the Anasazi people made called pit houses. Archaeology digs can be a great resource to finding new information about old civilizations.       How you ever seen the commercials about the theme park called Atlantis? Well that park is based off of the Greek myth about, how there was this lavish city called Atlantis and all of a sudden it  vanished and no one can locate it. On the contrary, an archaeologist did some investigating off the waters of southern Greece and there might actually be a city underneath the water that fits the description of Atlantis. This site spans 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor of the Southerner Peloponnese. It was to be consumed around 1000 B.C.  less than 1% of the ocean floor has been examined so this was a great find.       Have you ever heard of the ancient civilization of the Incas? They were located in the Southerner part of Peru. They had an interesting way of keeping track of the livestock. They would make a string calender. This calender help keep track of the livestock by toeing colorful  strings together. No one know what the mean but we are amazed by them. They also made objects from pottery, stone, gold, and silver these lasted a very long time. Some were found in buildings others were buried with its master. Remarkable textiles and clothing were found usually they would have been destroyed by the dampness but, the were persevered by the hot desert.       Mesa Verde  National Park is a national re-severe were the Ancestral Pueblo-ans used to live for 700 years. One of there skills is basket making. After that farming replaced hunting and gathering. They live in pit houses which were usually is in clustered in small villages. Pit house are houses that are square and the the living room floor is sunk in a few feet. Moving fro m Meas Verde they moved to New Mexico And Arizona.       Experiencing the trill if finding a unknown land mark or civilization it indescribable. Swimming to the depths of the biggest ocean looking for the most well known Greek myth in the world. Looking in caves for the remains of a ancient house from a Ancestral Pueblo-ans. Also just maybe wanting to learn more about the civilization we learn about in the fifth grade. Every expedition count because it cost money to go on an expedition. So, if it was not important why would they do it? 	NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN .

Clues left behind can reveal information such as their religion, art, agriculture, government and way of life. Some of what we know comes from stories passed down. Passing on these stories was important to the history of the Inca. We know some old stories from the Europeans who arrived at the Inca empire. They told about the Inca in letters and personal journals. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca come from atifacts that they left behind. Some artifacts turned up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried with the dead for the afterlife. Some Inca fabrics and clothing have survived as well. The fabrics were preserved because of the dry desrets or the cold mountains. Some Inca places have been robbed by hunters or looters. The high, cold mountains preserve bodies of the dead Inca people. The archaeologists can run these bodies through a machine, and learn about how the person lived and why they died.         About 1,400 years ago a group of people cose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they lied here. In the late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved.  Archeologists have named these people Anasazi sometimes translated as 'ancient enemies' We now call them Puebloans. Farming was their main livelihood. They learned to make pottery and made the bow and arrow. About A.D. 750 they began building houses made of poles and mud. These discoveries were important because we would not have discovered their amazing inventions and discoveries.

They learned and adjusted to the way they lived and made mistakes while they were doing it. They made didffrent tools and gadgets to live in there enviroment. They learned to what to eat, kill to eat, and most importanlly they learned how to Live. That is why it is importat to know the Incans, Puebloans, and the Pavloperti.           The Incans were were very smart people that lived in the 1400's and 1500's. They had certain ways of during there writtin, Alphapet, and there Calender. For there calenders they made knots in colored strings called quipus. They used these to keep trck of farming and livestock.Many Forienors were very sueprised to see the Incans run a whole empire off of stings.Still to theis day Archaeologist can not figure out what the diffrent knotes mean.            The Puebloans were very smart in archetecture by building there houses and empire.The Puebloans designed a house called the Pithouse which is a rectangler bottom and slims as it gets to the top and then flqattens out.The Pithouse has a small living room that it lowered a couple feet in the ground and four large lems supported the roof of the house.It also had a fire pit with a smoke reflecter so the house would not fill up with smoke.Even though this house was invented by the Puebloans it still inspired others many years later.              Pavloperti is a Greek dive team of archaeologistthat have discovered one of the oldest submerged towns ever to be found.This town dates way back to Homers heros which is about 5,000 years ago.This submerged city seems to be about 3,000 square meters of the ocean floor.This city was also discovered 40 years ago by British Oceanography which has been left alone until the Anglo-Greek team found this year and can go more into detail about the city. While they have found many inportant artifacts of hostory there is still more to be found.               Although the Incas and Puebloana exsited many years ago they still have inspired many others some years later. Also the Pavlopertri is great diving team and they have discover many artifacts about these people ans im sure they will find many more.

This is why all the ancient people are so important.              The Incans were a very advanced and important society. They had no alphabet for records, only knots on a string. Archeaologist have found many of these cords, but none have discovered there true meaning. Maybe the Incans did this so no one could ever figure out the records, maybe they wanted to keep their society a secret. The Incans went through a great deal of trouble to deliver these cords; because they lived on the top of the Andes mountains they had to climb treacherous cliffs to deliver messages. The Incans have helped give us the language we have today.              Unlike the Incans the Puebloans have living descendants to help discover their ancient past. They are known for their basketweaving. The Puebloans had a more settled way of life. They replaced their life of hunting and gathering for farming in cliff recesses.They were a very crafty folk. They made more efficent weapons and pottery. The Puebloans have given us a very crafty nature.                As great as the Puebloans are the Pavlopetri are even better. They are curious and adventurous people. They have changed history as we know it, by discovering lost cities of ancient Greece.These people work long hours to discover these ancient things.                  In conclusin the Puebloans, Palverti, and Incans have helped us all in so many ways. They have made our society today very advance and who knows maybe one day we'll discover and uncover even more.

The first  Eropeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire usingstrings to keep record.The arhceologist  have found many ancient qupius - but today no one can understand what the knots mean.

There are archaeologist all over the world that are digging up facts about them. There are very interesting discoveries about all of them.              Archaeologists have discovered that the Incas had no formal alphabet or system of writing and live in the Andes. They left nothing for scientist to look at. There was no formal papers or anything like that. Archaeologists have found many quipus, but today nobody knows what they stand for or mean. There has been a lot of art stuff that they have left behind and archaeologists have found.Most people wounder how archaeologist know nearly more than a hundred of years about them. They know this stuff because the Inca tribe left behind things that can relate to religion, government, and their ways of life. They have pieced all these puzzle pieces to make a puzzle. There have been stories passed down from generation to generation about them. Historians have to be very careful when they interpret those things. They also know that the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language very well like they do their own. Some of them may not have understood correctly what the Incas have told them so they wrote what they thought they heard. So because of that, their stories may not be exactly true. The rest of their knowledge came from the articrafts that were left behind when they passed. There objects such as stones, pottery, gold, or silver. Materials such as those things can last a very long time. Most of them have been buried for a very long time and archaeologist can still get information from them. Some of the clothing that the Incas had have survived that long period of time looking very well.Once the archaeologist have all the information from the Incas history, they then compare it with the Spaniards. There have been very different versions of it from both of them. The fall of the Inca was because of the Spaniards murdering the Inca king in 1532 and taking over everybody else.               The Puebloans are so important because of the discovery that historians have made. they explored North America 1400 years before the Europeans explored North America. The first ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. they are most known as basket-makers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main source of survival. People lives in pithouses which featured a living room, 4 corner timbers supported the roof, and that is what keep them mostly dry. They are very important people in history.

THE PUEBLOANS  -lived about 1,400 years ago long before Europeans explored the north America.The puebloans  had flourished at building stone buildings,house,and  whatever else they wanted in there  community they lived in a home town called Mesa Verde.This is now a national park that has all the puebloans artifacts.for more than seven hundred years there descendents lived here.Mesa verde national park preserves the spectacular events in the civilization history there nicknames were called Anasazi this is the Navajo word for ancient ones.The first puebloans that settled in Mesa verde were in 550A.D. They were .known as basket makers for there very skill and crafted basket weaving. these people lived in houses called pit houses clusters into small villages these were mostly built at  messa tops.this was there way of life.They replaced farming with hunting. they learned to make pottery and acuried the bow and arrow.This was a more efficient weapon for hunting then the atlati a spear thrower.this was very prosperous times for these people.The population also started to double about 750A.D.So they had to begin making more houses and that means that they needed more land for all of the population.Walls in these houses were made into fifty rooms or more that they also started to do  paintings on the dull background to make it look more efficient looking.between A.D1100 and A.D. 1300 during the classic age they reached to several thousand it was mostly concentrated and compact villages with many rooms.because if the wide spread of pottery there work was not admired as much.about A.D. 1200 a population shift and people started to move back to the cliff alcoves                    The population shift was caused by weather and they thought the alcoves would be better shelter.What ever the reason they now no that it gave people a reason to become cliff dwellers.When the cowboys found out about cliff dwellers in the 1880's archeologist have sought to understand these peoples lives.From whatever they no scientist still don't no much about this civilization.  but they are trying hard to figure out more this great civilization and all the in habitence to us through all there works of artifacts have taught us i think this is one of the most interesting groups that we can wonder about with all of there artifacts to teach us about there great and wonderful society.                          THE LOST CITY OF ATLANTIS-With the lost city of atlantis the they could not find it at all.this was a city that had alot of myths and many different tales to it.It was told to have untold riches buried within the city or that the waqs an under water society thst was livivng as mermaids.There was also a story that thre was a lost civilzation who took down the city and lived in caves for severel thoysand years.It has been said that it was buried under all ruble in southern Greece.a Greek team of archelogist went on an exploration to find the lost city they also hadf help from geologist all together they called them selves Palovpetri.The suken settlements was dated at 5,000 years ago.Their is no doubt that this the oldest city in the world said DR,John Henderson,associate professer of under water archelogy.it was remaned on surface about 1200 to 2800 B.C long be for glory days.This was not supposed to happen according to the artical it happend simotamesly and they could not stop it for nothing this is why this city is so unique.This is a great city that has inhabited us to see all of there culture and argreculture.

Archaeologists tried to figure out the important things about history.  I have to figure out what made the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri so important in history.     Inca made an alphabet with rope.  They knotted the rope and used different colors to make their alphabet.  The archaeologists also found gold buried in the ground. The last Inca king was murdered in 1532 and the Spaniards took over.     Next is the Puebloans, they lived 1,400 years ago before Europeans explored North America. They left their homes in the late A.D. 1200s. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde, Spanish for 'green table', about A.D. 550. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.     Lastly, we have the Pavlopetri.  At first, the archaeologists thought it was Atlantis; but it was just the sunken settlement that was part of Greece a long time ago. 'It was occupied  land 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought' says Henderson, who co-directed the underwater survey.  They are still trying to figure out how it got underwater and if anyone died.     In conclusion, I found the important things about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri and we learned more about these places.

Artifacts from the ways these people lived are preserved and kept waiting for the chance to be discovered and have their stories told.        One instance could be the Incas. They couldnt write. They were'nt legitimate and were unable to read. So how do we read into their lives? It is truly difficult, but it is also possible. There are oral traditions passed down that their neighboring tribes, the Spaniards, wrote down. These are not totally reliable, for in every truth there are lies or fables, but it is partially the best we have to go on. Otherwise, artifacts such as clothing, pottery, and objects made of different metals can be found. Clothes often are destroyed by the natural process of decay, but they do survive in the case they were buried in the desert or freezing mountain tops. The discovery of many of these objects, along with historical records kept by the European Spaniards, give us so much information. Without this, we would not have a single clue of the time around which the Inca empire fell. We wouldnt know of the religious, agricultural, or eeconomical practices of any of these tribes. They are very important to the discovery of historical facts and legend.         The ocean around southern Greece holds another ancient story with legends untold. The lost city of 'Atlantis' has been discovered, and divers have been exploring it for any new information they could use. The imagery of white pillars, cracked and slowly disappearing, is only the beginning of how right Plato was in his description of the lost city. An elite used this settlement, now his/her remains could be figuratively described as a 'Triton', ruler of the seas. We remain in the dark about much, but the discovery of this sunken city has shed a little more light on the historical subject of Greece. The shards of pottery scattered around the ocean floor tell us much about the lives of the people who used to live in this old undersea city, but much is yet to be found.

Also, they help scientist to better understand how the civilizations lived. Within the discovery of ancient civilizations, there are complications and there are things that help us to better understand the past and different ways of life.              At times understanding a lost civilization is hard when you cannot understand how the lived. An great example of this comes from the Inca. 'The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock.[...] Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus-but today no one knows what the knots mean.' (Source #1) Trying to understand that system that the Inca used, as  one can imagine, could be and most likely is very hard. Almost like a mystery.            Like a mystery, maybe sometimes, but other times are very clear as to how a civilization thrived and carried on. Even what they lived in can help archaeologist learn the civilizations beliefs, not just an entire civilization. Sometimes homes where a link to a civilizations religion and what they believed in. In Source #2, one can infer that even archaeologist sometimes can't understand why a house was built like it was built. 'PErhaps it was for defense: perhaps it was for religios or psychological reasons; perhaps alcoves offerend better protectionfrom the elements.' And other times you might not even know.            In conclusion, Lost civilizations are helpful and they help us learn a lot when we as humans sometimes need to learn a lot about the past to help us in the future.

It helps us determine what happened before our time. We find this out by finding things under ground and in the ocean. We also learn stuff from stories that were passed down from many generations. even though we hear the stories we can not tell if they are true or not because many are just legends. The stories are sometimes written in different languages so people need to get the translated, and people might not know the language well so the words might be a little off then from what they really are.        Clues left behind from the inca create a portrait of the inca's 'religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life'. Archaeologists and others are able to put together details of the Inca life by studying the clues.        Archaeology is a very great thing to have. It's good because we can figure things out and learn the past.

The Athens fished on it and made cool boats out of wood. She says there is no doubt in her mind that this is the oldest town in the world pretty cool huh. This town dates back to 2008 to 1200 BC long time ago. there are old sunken sites around the area that they are trying to find. the town was berried by the ocean in 1000 BC. this year they could only get down to look at it cause they just made good enough technology to get down on the bottom floor of the ocean. They repaved a world of buildings like a city but long lost. they found thousands of shards of pottery.That is the cool stuff they found in the cool under water buildings and stuff pretty cool what they found down in the middle of no where in the ocean.

They discover the Inca had no system of writing and they did not leave things details or anything to study.The Inca made colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of their days. They didnt have calendars they where verry smart and discovered their own ways to do things. If you can read the storys the inca tied into their knots you will understand they are verry much into mysteries, And discovering things. Wich also made it verry hard for historians to reasearch them.   What we know about the Inmca now is they preserve stories to keep their communitys going. Some opf the inca textile has survided such as Clothing, Calendars, Treasures,Valuablkes and other things.   Archeologist who study the inca keep carefull records of what they find so that thewy can discover more and the stories they find will add up .

They used the knots and beads for there calenders also. They also used there writing system to keep track of there live stock. There system is called quipus.       What we know about the Incas mostly came from stories past down from generation to generation. Some stories were written down by Europeans that arrived. The people that came to the empire were Spanish soldiers and priests. They wrote down the Inca's description in a diary or letters.       Some information came from ancient artifacts, or some objects that they left behind. The artifacts were made of stone, gold and silver, or pottery. So most of there stuff was very important to the Inca's seeing as it was made out of gold and silver. One thing that was very important to them was there clothing. The archeoligists tried to preserver most of there stuff, but because of the dampness they were all mostly ruined.       The Inca lived up in the Andes Mountains. A lot of there sites they lived in high points in the mountains. Being way up in the mountains help preserve the sites the archeoligists could bring back artifacts in one piece. Everything they found they took back to study. The dead bodys also helped the archeoligists see how the Inca's lived. Thats how the Incas lived.

All the discoveries, and work that we have done to reveal the history of them isn't quite complete but has mostly payed off.             The Inca are important to the history of today because the more we learn about all the tasks and things that they did are different and unique then what we do today. People say that they are just myths and legends but they really aren't, they are fact. The Inca had a unique and different way of keeping track of their food supply, cattle, and many other things. The Inca used colorful strings to do so, but we don't know how to translate it or know what they mean. Some of what we know about the Inca today was passed on through stories that the Europeans who arrived there in 1532. The only bad part was that the Spanish soldiers and priests didn't know a lot of the Inca's language. Few of the Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters/looters, who took anything that may be valuable. Inca's also lived in the Andes mountains where they may have worshiped the mountain peeks. The mountains are like giant freezers and have kept some bodies in good condition. Experts are still studying the Inca bodies and they have revealed a lot of information about them.             The Puebloans are important to the history of today because they were the first Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde. They were also known as Basketmakers for their skill in basket making. They were formally nomadic, but became more settled in their way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their way of getting food.They lived in small villages, in pithouses to be more exact. Usually built on mesa tops but sometimes on or in cliffs. The Puebloans learned how to make pottery and the bow and arrow which is more efficient way to hunt. Eventually they began to make houses above ground using poles and mud. They used fires to cook and left Mesa Verde and traveled south to New Mexico and Arizona.             The Pavlopetri are important to the history of today because many people think that the city of Atlantis is a myth, but Atlantis is very real. It is the oldest submerged city in the world. Atlantis was first discovered by a British oceanographer about 40 years ago. Experts found ceramics and pottery dating back to 5,000 years ago. Marine geologists still have to figure out why the settlement sank, but their theories include earthquakes or maybe even a tsunami.             The Ancient Inca, the Ancestral Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important to us, because of many reasons. All the discoveries, and work that we have done to reveal the history of them isn't quite complete but has mostly payed off and now we know what they have been doing with their lives.

They are important to us for many reasons one reason being we can learn how they made structures back then. Also we can just learn how they lived and how they survived. Another thing is that We learned how they talked and there body language. We have learned a lot from the Incas and are hoping to learn even more by looking for there things and studying them more.       The Puabloans also taught us some thing. First they taught us kind of how to make a good structure. They also taught us how to live somewhat and how they lived. They taught us about the enemies they had. They taught us their lifestyle and the things they made and how they stayed alive.  They had churches called Kivas that they went to to practice there religion which might of somewhat helped us in how to sort of make churches and how to practice our religions.       The Greek people are very interesting in many ways and taught us some cool things. One of the things was they were the ones that had their city sink. This city was located by Neapolis. The city dates back at least 5,000 years and the cool thing is its still there. This city was Pavelopetri. One scientist says that humans have only discovered 1% of the ocean floor. That means that we should keep looking and some day find another under water city like this one that belonged to the Greeks.       The information I learned about the three civilizations and how interesting an cool their lifestyles were.

One discovery that's important is about Inca is that their king was murdered by Spaniards in 1532 and took over the empire. Another discovery that's important is about Puebloans is that they are known as Basketmakers because of their talent for crafting. Also a discovery that's important is about Palvopetri is that it's believed that Peloponnese has been consumed by the sea in 1000 BC.

They lived hundreds of years ago on the land of America. Archeaologists have dug up remains of the Inca. Some of the stuff looks like it was made yesterday. cause it has been shelterd. From the storms and wearthering. So this is my article over the Inca.

Archaeologists find artifacts and other evidence to try to figure out new things about different cultures before ours. Once they find out about other peoples and how their civilizations worked, they try to apply that to our lifes today.          The Inca were a well known civilization that are studied a lot today. They were a thriving vast empire and had many ways to do things. They did not have a written language, but they thrived still. The Inca were important because we learn form them and try to cennect their story to other ancient empires of the time. The Spaniards came and the empire fell. If we knwo what happened to the Incas we can help ourselves by learning form their mistakes. Archaelolgoists try to find out why this happened so we can prevent it from happening now. All that we have learned from the Incas has helped us today. It helps us better understand what happended to them and what may happen in the future. Aside from being interesting, the Inca culture helps us learn to help tomorrow.          The Puebloans were a people in Mesa Verde. They are also an important peopl. Learning about them is interesting because it is of human nature to be curious about others. Archaeologists study artifacts and structures that can show a lto about the people. THey were atfirst a nomadic tribe that adapted to learn how to farm and build standing houses. It is interesting and important to know how the people before us could do the same things that we do today. If we know aboyt how the people could survive without all out the things we have today, it makes us feel luckier that we have these oppertunitites. It aslo shows us how a people can adapt to their needs and become more modern and smarter. We learn many lessons and things from the ancient Puebloans.          The Pavlopetri were a people that lived in a city that is now sunken. They are important for many reasons. It helps us understand  about a new people and shows that sumbereged cities are possible. It helps us prepare for the future and know what can happen and why. It gives us a more deep understanding of the world and the dangers. The underwater city is not only interesting to people becasuse it is underwater but because it also teaches us about the world.      All in all the ancient cities teach us lessons about what can happen to us and what has happened to others in the past. If we didn't study these cities we would not be able to do what we do today.

These past civilizations aren't only interesting to look at, but are places frozen in time for us to learn about the past. What we discover and learn about these civilizations, the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, help us understand life in their time and how the world has improved and evolved from then.       These discoveres are important for many reasons. One reason is that we can learn more about the past and how life was like in their time. We live in a time where a lot of our things rely on technology like electricity. In those days, they didn't have the luxuries that we have today. Take the Puebloans for an example. They lived in houses called Pithouses located in on mesa tops, but sometimes in cliff recesses. As we take a look at the inside of the pithouse, we can see many similarities between their homes and ours. These houses had living rooms just like houses of today. The pithouses would evolve into kivas. As we can tell from the artifacts, their homes will come closer and closer to what our house are like today. In fact, their name as Puebloans is a Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers.'       Another thing many wonder is how were these civilizations run. The Spanish were amazed to see the Inca civilization using just strings to keep records. The Puebloans created houses similar to houses of today and started to group them together to form small villages. Most of our buildings are still built with that same idea in mind. Sadly, there isn't much for us to know about the governments of these great cultures as many accounts from that time are many times inaccurate.       Also, these discoveries of these ancient civilizations can teach us many lessons. There is a saying in that me can learn from the past. Take the buildings of these civilizations for an example. The houses of the Puebloans had a ventilator which helped push smoke out the building. We still you this same principle today. Their buildings were located in cliffs which gave shelter to their homes. Another example is the city of Atlantis. Even though cities are still built near shores, we now know that cities can become submerged in the sea like Atlantis. Cities have taken precautions when a storm or tidal wave hits them. Lastly, we know about the endings of some of these civilizations. The fall of the Inca is known due to the Spaniards murdering the last Inca king in 1532. We know can know not to do the same actions as these now gone cultures so not to end up like them.       Since we are curious by nature, the past has always interested us. These civilizations help tell the stories of their culture and civilizations. What we discover and learn can help us compare life in their time to ours today. We will always learn more and more about them as the years go by.

Today, no one knows what these quipus are or what they mean. Our archaeologists have made some amazing discoveries, like finding the inspiration of the well known myth, 'Atlantis'. These discoveries lead us to knowing more about the Incas, Puebloans and Palvopetri. These amazing discoveries are extremely important to us because it lets us see into the past and know how it was like for people thousands of years ago.                 One of these discoveries was things called 'quipus'. Quipus are these strings with knots in them. Since the Inca did not have an official alphabet, they made knots in string instead to tell stories. Today, no one knows what they mean. The Incas were very interesting people. They did not have archives for historians to study. However they did leave us their ruins which shows us their amazing way of life. For example, they would bury stuff high up in the Andes mountains so that it would be hard for looters to grab. It also made it hard for archaeologists to study the sites up there. If we have not discovered the ruins on the Incas, then would have never known a culture as amazing as they are.                Another amazing discovery was the Puebloans. These people settled in Mesa Verde around A.D. 550. They are known for their amazing skills of basket making. They replaced hunting with farming for food. About A.D. 750 they started to make houses above ground made from mud and poles called pithouses. The pithouse contained a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four poles made of wood supported the roof. By A.D. 1000, the Puebloans acquired the skill of stone masonry. Pottery also changed from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. The discoveries of the Pueblaons are important because learning about different types of culture and religion can inspire so many people today.               The last discovery that is important is 'The lost Greek city'. This discovery contains an ancient Greek city that sunk about 5,000 years ago. This might sound familiar, a sunken city underwater that has been missing. Yes, it sound like Atlantis. This discovery of the settlement underneath the water inspired one of the famous myths in the world. It is said that this city was probably sunken by a tsunami or an earthquake; maybe even both ! However, geologists still do not know for certain what made the settlement sink. It has remains dating back to 2800 to 1200 BC. This site is very significant because as submerged, it was never reoccupied. This is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Palto wrote his tale of Atlantis. I find this discovery more important than any other because it brings mystery to the world and makes a good myth !               I find all of these discoveries very important because it teaches us more about ancient civilizations. It teaches us about how they lived; what their culture was like; what they believed in, and etc. It must have been amazing to discover these things and have so many questions to ask to make a mystery.

Over the last few years, we have found out a lot about what the ancient world was like. Three of the most important recent archaelogical discoveries include the discoveries involving Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.              The biggest of the threee civilizations, the Inca, were located in present day Peru. With no formal writing method, archaelogists have a tough time uncovering details about the Inca. The Inca created a huge civilization for nearly a hundred years, one that controlled nearly all of South America. However, in 1532, when the Spanish murdered the Inca king, and the Inca civilization suddenly dropped off. So far, archaelogists have found ancient ruins and burials high on the Andes Mountains, as well as textiles and clothes that provide insight into how the Inca went about their daily life.              While the Ancestral Puebloans civilation was not as large as the Inca, they were much older, dating back to A.D. 550, in Mesa Verde. they started with pithouses, but later moved on to building large houses of stone. The Puebloans were also skilled with pottery and hunting with the bow and arrow. After the population grew to a peak of about several thousand, the Puebloans quickly shifted back into the cliffs, arond A.D. 1200, perhaps because of a drought and crop failure.               The last of the three civilizations, the Pavelopetri in southern Greece, is also the oldest, starting around 3000 B.C.. This Greek civilization is signficant because it sank into the water around 1000 B.C.. The sinking could have been caused by an earthquake, tsunami, or sudden change in sea level. This could be the inspiration of the classic myth of the lost city of Atlantis. So far, many artifacts, including ceramics and tombs, have been recovered from underwater, because of the extraordinary preservation of the items in the shallow bay where the sunken city was discovered.                Overall, it is easy to see how these three civilizations provided for the most significant archaelogical discoveries in recent years. These fascinating civilizations each had a unique aspect that set them apart from other civilizations of the time, making them so important today.

The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are all different and important.               The Pavlopetri is a sunken settlement that dates back 5,000 years when Homer's heroes around.  Atlantis is the oldest submerged town in the world. It was dated from 2800-1200 BC before the glory days of classical Greece. This sunken city takes up 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Atlantis is protected in the bay thanks to shifting sands, the exploration revealed consists of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cute tombs, and religious structures. What makes Pavlopetri so important and unique because none can be considered to be planned like Atlantis.              Puebloans lived in mountain tops where they may have worshiped mountain peaks. They liked high places. Incas were buried in caves on cliffs or mountain tops. That has helped to preserve the sites. The Incas are so important because they used some of the most advanced techniques in the world. Ariel photography can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that you can't see from the ground. The fall of the Inca happened in 1532 because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king. A lot of their advanced techniques affected our techniques today, this is what makes them so important.                They Puebloans were so important because of thir skill. They are known as basketmakers because they are really good for craft. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting. They used pithouses to live in. Pithouses had a four corner timber which supported the roof, the firepit had an air deflectoror, and it sunk in a few feet from the ground. the Puebloans affected the crafts and inventions today.

The Greek had a great city, but it sunk and only divers that go deep in the ocean have seen this great city. I wish I could have seen this country and lived on it.  The Greek were very ahead of were we are now. If there country wouldn't have sunk they could've taught us many things.  They could have taught us how to do it better.  We could've also have fought better against the Nazis.  The Inca built great pyramids and sand villages.       The Greek could have also taught us how to make different rope and knots.  They could've taught us how to use money better. They also had many more wars than we did.  They loved to fight in wars that lasted for years.

They are important because of facts and reasons. Discoveries made about these civilizations have led to scientists seeing how people lived in the past. The Inca,Puebloans,and Pavlopetri have influenced discoveries dramatically.        Scientists have found that the Inca had no formal alphabet. They have also found discoveries up in the mountain tops. Artifacts were preserved because of the temprature being so cold. Thes discoveries will lead to many more to come.        Scientists have found that the Puebloans have made hunting items. This artifact was called na atlatl. This showed that the puebloans were good hunters. They had also found that these people lived in pithhouses. This showed they they were civilized.        The Pavolpetri showed a great amount of civilization and artifacts. These are majorly important. Not only to scientists but also to many college students of the world.         Each area has given scientists many things to be proud of. These were great discoveries. These discoveries will lead to many more. Though alto has been found there is still alot of unknown knowledge in the world that needs to be found.

They made knots on colored strings called quipus to record the calendar in order to keep count of all the livestock. When the Europeans discovered the Inca, they were astounded that they could use nothing but knots and string to keep count of all of their livestock.       It's hard to know for sure how the civilization worked back in 1438. The only way that we know for sure that the Inca even existed is because of all of the art work that they left behind. They left art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and a way of life.       All of what we know about the Inca today comes from a different generation. It is passed on from generation to generation and so on. Some of the information may not be as accurate because the tellers of the stories about the Inca people didn't speak the Inca language very well. And some of the Inca stories were legends rather than History.

The Inca's, for example, left behind amazing art and architecture that formed an amazing portrait of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and way of life. The Inca's left knots in colored string called 'Quip-us' to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Farmers today just write it down, unlike the Inca's.                Before the Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde as their home. This group was called the Puebloans. For their skill of basket weaving, they were known as Basket-makers. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main way of livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops and sometimes built in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow an arrow, a more effiecient way of hunting and gathering that the atlatl or spear thrower.                Ever since local cowboys reported cave dwellings in the 1880s, archaeologists have sought to understand these people's lives. But despite decades of excavation, analysis, classification and comparison, scientific knowledge remains sketchy. Yet for all their silence, these structures speak with a certain eloquence. They tel of a people adept at building, artisitic in their crafts and skillful at making a living from difficult land. The structures are evidence of a society that, over cenrturies, have passed accumulated skills and traditioons from generation to generation. By the Classic Period, Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilazation, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank among the finest of human culture in North America.

There are many things that we can learn form the discoveries of ancient people. I think that the discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopertri were important.       The Incas burried some of there dead in the Andes. When the archaeologists found some of the ancient burials they also found som of the Inca clothing an learned how they made it. The Puebloans were very skillful; they made buildings, pottery, and many other things. The buildings that archaeologists found helped them find out how they made the building that are still here today. The Pavlopertri peolpe left there city before it was submerged by water, but they did leave behind many ceramics. After studying the ceramics they decided that they were made a very long time ago, and they also found out how they were made.       Archaeologists found out many things about these ancient people, and all of the things that they learned are very usfull. These discoveries could save us if we ever run out of resources. Discovering these things also helps us learn about our past. The discoveries of the ancient people are important to us. 	NNP PRP VB JJ NNS VBG . NNP PRP VB IN NN IN DT JJ NN WDT VBD IN PRP .

The reason why discovering artifacts about these ancient societies is important is because each little artifact we find on these groups, gives us more information about how they lived, worked, created, and how they battled. The three supporting paragraphs below will be about the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlovian.                 First of all, discovering the ancient history of the Inca's way of life is crucial. It is crucial because, if we uncover most of the history of how they created items and how they worked with such primitive tools to create such masterpieces. Also, we will learn how they fought battles and survived the harsh conditions off the Andes Mountains. Knowing this tells us the history of the Inca's lives, and what rituals / religions they worshiped.                 Secondly, finding as many artifacts as possible about the Peubloans should be the most important priority when excavating an area near this tribe. This group can teach us about construction of pit-houses and kivas'. These people survived for centuries just in these homes and with a little discovering, we could figure out how they were constructed, and how these people worked; also what they worked with. These people can teach us all about the way of architecture and how they advanced in it. The Puebloans, are a very intelligent and advanced race that has created masterpieces that have shown the world that they were ahead of their time.                In addition, searching under water for the great lost Greek city is the one thing that should drive all deep sea archeologists to do. Finding these big sunken cities will reveal to archeologists that this city was once high and mighty, but with a little research on the remains of the civilization, they could determine how the city was crumbled into the sea. once we continue to find these sunken civilizations, we can figure out, if not even put aside some myths of how the cities actually went down. Also, there would be dangers like marine life guarding and swarming these ruins. This would prove troublesome to archeologists, but with a little bit of work we can clear out the area and finally get the important, glorious research we so desperately need.       In conclusion, discoveries about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlovian are really important for they uncover the past and reveal to us the history of each of these cultures. All these societies can be the future of our technology or architecture if we find out the secrets of each of their villages, times, and order systems. Also, we could finally figure out what had happened to these great tribes and monuments thousands of years ago.

That is hard for us, now, to figure out what they were trying to say. But it also makes it more of a mystery. I think it is so cool that after so many years, the city is still preserved underwater.             I think the most important discovery we have made is that the lost city is still here, just underwater. I think that is so cool that the city has survived. '...is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.' Although it was only discovered around 40 years ago, it has been there for a  very long time. It is located underwater, somewhere in Greece.             When finding the underwater city, they also discovered a few other things. Some were types of ceramics. ''We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age...'' This suggests that the settlement was occupied around 5,000 years ago. That is 1,200 years earlier than most people had thought.             Of course since the city is underwater, there is some wondering involved. The main one is, why did it sink? 'Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank.' They do have a few theories, though. Some of the theories are sea level changes, ground subsidences from the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.             The underwater city is truly a mystery. Maybe we will never know exactly what happened to the Inca and their city.

We could see pots, stoves, ect. and see how the civilization went about there day to day lives.            We know that the greek city sank to the bottom of the ocean because of a earth quake or something along the lines of that. We know that the Incas had complex structures and lived in mountanious regions because of what explorers have found. We could know more about these places but looters picked over the top layer of what had been found and now its the archiolights job to find out what was left from before that or what better treasures could be hidden under the ground or inside the structures       We can see now how people that lived before us would have lived, worked, or went about there daily lives because of what was found in the areas that have been uncovered while digging, or diving, or climbing, or any way that you would reach a place were a civilization lived.

Only some of the old stories are known because they were written down by Europeans who arrived in the Empire in 1532. Some Incas told Spaniards stuff but the Spaniards did not understand the Incas langauge. And some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history. the rest of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts or objects they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found. Inca artifacts might be made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Some Inca textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well. Ancient materials are usually destroyed by dampness.

We have Social Studies and history classes that explain a lot about the past and how we have learned from it. One way that we are learning from the past is by looking at artifacts and other clues found about ancient civilizations. Ancient Civilizations show us how much we have learned from our past, and also about how we lived long ago. Archaeologists today are searching for a few ancient civilizations in particular, called the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.       The discoveries of the three civilizations stated above are important to find what happened long ago. One piece of evidence that suggests that this is true is found in the article 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past'. This selection is about what the Ancient Inca tribe was like long ago and how archaeologists now are finding artifacts and evidence as to what happened back then. 'Ancient materials like cloth... have been preserved in the dry deserts... or the cold mountains of the Andes.' this is one quote that shows that archaeologists have found something that was used and made by the Incas long ago. These cloths are used to find more evidence and clues about ancient civilizations such as the Incas.       The ancient people of a sunken city referred to as Pavlopetri also give us clues of the ways of life long ago. According to the article 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets.', architecture was a major part of the people of Pavlopetri's way of life. '...the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.' According to Dr. Jon Henderson, Pavlopetri has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before classical Greece.       With each new day, archaeologists like Henderson find more and more evidence about the past. They are always finding new ways to get evidence, and there is always going to be more artifacts to find. The artifacts that are found by archaeologists are major parts of discovering more about people back then, and are very important. Someday, the things that we use every day will become artifacts for archaeologists hundreds of years from now to find.

What pit houses were made of. How many people could fit inside of them. Here's a little information about Pit houses.       Pit house are really cool. They show how we've been in the future of them we've made awesome houses. We started out with pit houses. That was amazing idea.        What pit houses were made of. They were made of wood and fur. They were hand made. They looked like the roofs of the house.   thats how they were made.       how many people could fit inside one. About 50 people could fit inside  one of them. They had to do their everyday activities in their. Which would of been bunched up.       Those are some cool things about the pit houses. The way there were built. How man people could fit inside. And how houses have came along. So that's good reasons. About the pit houses.

The very first civiliations that was the mysterious of them all was the Ancient Inca.         The ancient Inca of Peru had no alphabet and any system  writing. They didnt leave any aechives for historians to study or learn off of. The only things they have that was found was knots in colored strings called quipus to recored the calender tokeep a count of livestock. Luckly the Europeans have wrote in journals and gave more information about the Inca. But many Archaeologist don't know if it is reall or fake. They found out that the spanish had killed the Inca king.                        About 1,400 years ago, before Europeans even explored North Africa, their was a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose of Mesa Verde. 700 years they have descendats that lived and flourished there, they built a city. In late A.D. 1200s, in span of generations or two, they left their homes and moved away from there land. Archaeologist found varites of weaponds and found Pithouses, Pithouses is what they lived in I was built under ground and then rose up it had sticks holding it up and had a firepit. On top of the roof there was hole to let out the smoke.          The most amazing civilizations ever found was the myth of Atlantis it was the lost city that made an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologist to under water and find the lost city. What they find is that it dates bake farther than the stone age. The most amazing thing of it is that there was world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock cut tombs and religious structures.    After my research on these lost civilizations that there was many intreasting things that couldnt be wrot on paper so this is the end of The Lost Civilizations.

The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records.Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today nobody knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion,art,architecture,agriculture,government,transportation and way of life.If the archaeologists study these clues then they will be able to piece the details of Inca life together. There was a story about Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests.They described the Inca in letters and diaries. The Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language as well as the Inca did. Their stories were legends rather than history.The information being told to the Spaniards wasn't as accurate because they were unable to understand what was being said to them from the Incas.Most of the information we can find out is the artifacts and or objects they left behind and from the sites where artifacts are found. as many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might have or could possibly be made from stone,pottery,gold or silver.These materials lasted such a long time the were used for people who were living and the people who were dead to be used in their afterlife. Some of the Inca textiles and clothing survived remarkably well. The ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness,but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Most Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters,who take anything that might be valuable. Treasures were taken centuries ago,but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often do not tell archaeologists much.Other sites are reported to archaeologists can dig them up carefully.They provide the best idea of all about life in Peru before and during Inca rule. What this whole thing is saying is that basically everything that happened during the time period of the Incan empire. Most of the people that lived in the Incan empire have a lot of history especially the people that were dead I'm pretty sure that the people searching for gold or silver did not care about whether those people were actually dead they just wanted the gold but if they wouldn't have known about the gold the dead would not have been disturbed and they could have had some gold or silver for the afterlife.But then again they could have been that desperate to go through a brave and get gold especially if they didn't know about how the Incan's had put some kind of artifact in the grave with a deader soon for their afterlife how would they use I'm not exactly sure. But there must be a way for them to use it. Puebloan's had a lot to do with basket making because of their terrific skill at the craft the began creating houses.and the discovery  	IN NNP NNP VBD NN TO VB IN DT NN CC DT NN CC RB DT NN IN PRP VBD NNS IN VBN NNS VBN NN TO VB DT NN TO VB DT NN IN NNP NNP JJ NNPS TO VB DT NNP VBD VBN IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN VBG NNS TO VB NNS VBP VBN JJ NN VBZ CC NN NN VBZ WP DT NNS NNP NNP NN WP MD VB DT NNS VBN IN DT JJ NNS , VBG DT NNP NNP VBZ DT NN IN NN DT NNP NNP VBD IN IN DT NNP NN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , NN CC NN IN JJ DT NNS NN DT NNS RB PRP MD VB JJ TO VB DT NNS IN NNP NN NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN NNP WP VBD IN DT NN IN CD DT NNS VBD NNP NNS CC JJ VBN DT NNP IN NNS CC NNP NNP NNP VBD RB VB DT NNP NN IN RB IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNS VBD NNS RB IN DT NN VBG NN TO DT NNS VBD RB RB JJ IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB WP VBD VBG VBN TO PRP IN DT JJ IN DT NN PRP MD VB RP VBZ DT NNS CC CC NNS PRP VBP IN CC IN DT NNS WRB NNS VBP NNP IN JJ NN NNS , NNP NNS MD VB CC MD RB VB VBN IN NN , NN , NN CC JJ NNS VBD JJ DT JJ NN DT VBD VBN IN NNS WP VBD VBG CC DT NNS WP VBD VBN TO VB VBN IN PRP$ NNP NNP IN DT NNP VBZ CC NN VBD RB NNP NNP NN NNS IN NN VBP RB VBN IN NN , CC DT VBP VBN VBN IN DT JJ NNS IN NNP POS NNS CC DT NN VBZ IN DT NNP NNP NNP VBZ VBP VBN VBN IN NN NNS CC NNS , WP VB NN WDT MD VB NNP NNP VBD VBN NNS IN , CC VBG RB VBZ IN NNP NNP VBZ RB VBP RB VB NNS -NONE- VBZ VBP VBN TO NNS MD VB PRP RP JJ NN DT JJS NN IN DT IN NN IN NNP IN CC IN NNP NNP NNP DT JJ NN VBZ VBG VBZ IN RB NN IN VBN IN DT NN NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP IN DT NNS IN JJ IN DT NNP NN VBP DT NN IN NN RB DT NNS IN VBD JJ PRP VBP RB JJ IN DT NNS VBG IN NN CC NN VBD RB VB IN IN DT NNS VBD RB JJ PRP RB VBD DT NN CC IN PRP MD RB VB VBN IN DT NN DT JJ MD RB VB VBN VBN CC PRP MD VB VBN DT NN CC NN IN DT JJ RB RB PRP MD VB VBN IN JJ TO VB RP DT NN CC VB NN RB IN PRP VBD RB VB IN WRB DT NNP POS VBD VBN DT NN IN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN RB IN PRP$ NN WRB MD PRP VBP PRP VBP RB RB NNP CC EX MD VB DT NN IN PRP TO VB NNP NNP POS VBD DT NN TO VB IN NN VBG IN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN DT NN VBG NN DT NN	N		20131024091016	2332		N	20131024091020	2499	2		20131025121001	2381		N	20131026121029	2332		N

The Lost Greek City perhaps?  Nobody new what happened until now.              First, Ancient Inca. The source used is named 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks Secrets of the Past.' By Beth Gruber. Ancient Inca was in Peru. They didn't leave any archives for scientists to study so archaeologists had to research. Inca lived high in the Andes and could have possibly worshipped some mountain peaks. May of their sites were in high places. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by the dampness, but they have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.Some artifacts that they found have been found in ruins of buildings. Others have been found buried in graves for the dead to be used in the afterlife.              Next, Mesa Verde. The source used is named 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World' illustrations by NPS/Roy Anderson. About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. The people who lived here were called Anasazi, before being called Ancestral Puebloans. The first of the Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They were formerly nomadic and lived in pithouses.              Last, the Lost Greek City. The source used was 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets' by Helena Smith in Athens. The secrets of this lost city inspired the fable of Atlantis. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going' said Sakellariou. ' Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find bu there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'              In conclusion, Ancient Inca, Mesa Verde, and the Lost Greek City. They were all home to people of the past and we can learn more about them today. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT NN NNS . NNP NN , NNP NNP . WP IN NNP NNP . DT NNP NNP NNP RB .

These civilization`s have been lost because at some point in history because  most of them have been forced to run or leave the land that they owned. As a result of  displacing these people most of them died on the way to find new land. As an example to use from past history the displacement of these civilizations is like the trail of tears. The trail of tears was when all the White people  didn`t have as much land as they wanted so the whites forced all the native tribes to move which because of this move many natives were sad, which caused them to cry on there journy to find new land. It  is called the trail of tears because many of these native tribes were booted out of there home land which meant that they had to find new land and start there new civilizations all over. It was also labled the trail of tears because alot of loved people died on there  journey but not only to there new land but also trying to find the land was hard.

The objects, paintings, buildings found about Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri give scientists and archaeologists clues as to what life was like for these groups of people. The discovers about these tribes are the reason we have information about them.                                                                                                                                     For example, people found ancient letters, diaries, pottery, textiles, clothing, and many other artifacts about the Inca people. These discoveries can help us conclude traits of the Inca, such as the fact the Inca people spoke their own language. Without any of the evidence we have, we wouldn't even be able to know the Inca people existed.                                                                                                                                                                                                      The same goes for the Puebloans. Some person out there discovered artifacts about the Puebloans and scientists concluded everything we know about the civilization. We know so much information about the Puebloans, and it is all because of researchers and scientists. For instance, archaeologists found a Puebloan church. It gave them an idea about the customs of the Puebloan people and their beliefs.              A diver found an underwater settlement near Greece, which gave geologists and archaeologists an idea of when the Pavlopetri tribe was around and what they were like. Using their own previous knowledge about how the ocean works, they figure the settlement was built around 2800 to 1200 BC. We would never have known this if it weren't for that diver finding the key evidence and also the scientists comparing the present to the past.             There is so much we can learn from artifacts. Buildings can describe what materials were used in the past and how and why people made their houses the way they did. Written material give us ideas as to what language past people spoke and what their everyday life and conversations were like. Paintings and drawings help scientists understand what people from the past thought about. Everything we know about the past tribes was from evidence found today.             One thing many scientists look for is connections from the evidence to present day Earth. It helps give them an idea of how our present day society has formed from the evidence. Scientists also do the opposite by using present-day artifacts to predict what the past was like. It is a good way to understand how the past events effected the future.             Everything we know about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri was from discovery. This is why discoveries are so important. They are the only way we are able to connect to the past.

Also no one nose about the knots . Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful string , understand the ancient inca is alot like solving a mystery .   Some of the inca that we no comes from oral history , or stories , or sometimes generation from generation .   some of no about this things because old stories that they written down by the europeans who arrived in the 1532 .   the fall of the inca is easy to date becuse the spaniards murdered the last inca king in 1532 and took over the empire . some inca were buried in caves in cliff faces , for example , or on mountains tops , or drawling , magzied . bodies where found in the icy andres they where in such good shapes that experts can modern medical scanning equipment to learn and study , research and more about how the people died . And the bodies also reveal information about how they lived .           Source #2 : About 1,400 years ago , long before europeans explored north america , groupies of people lived in corners , for more then 700 yeears . then in the late A.D . 1200s , in the span of a generation or two , they left their homes and moved away . The first ancestral puebloans settled in mesa verde about A.D. 550 they are call basketmakers for they skillat the craft . they were beginning to lead more settled way of life . they lived in pithouses clutered into little villages but usually built mesa tops but sometimes cliff recesse . they learned how to mke pottery , acquired , bow , and arrow , and more efficient weapons for hunting .       About A.D. 750 they began building house above the ground , uprights walls made out of poles and mud . they built houses one against other long ,curving rows . By A.D. 1000 the people of mesa verde had advanced from ple and adobe . 	DT JJ NN IN NN VBD DT JJ , CC NN IN VBG . PRP VBP VBP NNS IN NNS TO VB . RB DT PRP VBP IN DT NNS .

The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the last inca king died in the year 1532 and took over the empire.           The incas lived in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places.

I am writing an explanatory article on lost civilizations now when is ay lost civilizatioms you might think of the fable ''Lost city of Atlantis',well yeah that is a lost civilization in a way even though it is a fable theres way more lost civilizations than you think.this summary is mainly about lost civlizations,well this is my first time actually learning about the lost civilizations like i didnt even know that Atlantis was a real lost civilization but this article mentioned the lost city of atlantis.                    It also mentions some place called,''Mesa Verde National Park'',im not sure where that is at but it mention that it was 1,400 years ago thats way before Europeans explored North America.Well when i think of a national park i think of i think its called,'' redstone national park'',but i forgot where it was located at but yeah i dont really know alot about Mesa Verde National Park so im just going to keep on going with my summary.                                                         Theres another place they mention thats called,''The cliff dwellers'',wow this one was before the Mesa Verde one on top this one was in the 1880s,it says local cowboys first reported it.Some archaeologists have sought to understand these people's lives.The structure are evidence of a society that,over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation.Well that article about the cliff dwellers was kinda short i would of tried to make it longer but i dont think theres no way to.

Without these materials and discoveries, we wouldn't know much about our civilization and how we live today. The information found by historians provide a big amount of information needed to teach students around the world and educate many who want to major in history.                          Based on the information provided in the articles, historians dedicated a huge amount of time to get into the ancient civilizations details and gather as much evidence as possible to learn about the lives of the Incas, Puebloands, and the Pavlovian. Its important to learn about how the world grew into what we live in today. Some may oppose history and what we learn in it but it is what developed and created our world.                                    Sources such as finding rope that the Inca used in their days is one major way a person can learn about the ancient Incas. It gives information such as how they use to keep track of the days...like a calender. As well as evidence from under the sea to objects found in rough geography places. All this information is an important subject we all need to open our minds to because there is still more to find. we never know...one day we will be history.

Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable.The origins of the Inca are more difficult to trace. Archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about the Inca's predecessors. Anything they find about the Inca has to be carried down to the mountain for study. The first ancestral Pueblo-ans are known as Basket-makers for their skills at the craft. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learn to make weapons strong enough for hunting. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before and much mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture.   They built the houses one against another in long, curving rowsa, often with a pithouse or two in the front.

Inca  is the  one who made the quipus the quipus are knots in colered strings and are made to keep record of the calendar.               Mesa Verde is a home for a group of people who lived in the Four Corners.Mesa Verde is now a National Park and it preserves the reminder of the ancient coulture.These are made by basket makers and there population multiplied by the time.When there was fires in the summer it was because there were cooking.                    When a diver explored the waters of southern Greece the found ceramics they also found  thousands of shards of pottery.The Marine Geologist have include sea level changes, ground subsidence.Older generations new  that there was something down there.Plato wrote his allegorical tale of Atlantis. but they say that Atlantis is just a myth.

Archeologies learned about them by learning about their living environment and studying the artifacts that has been left behind. Learning about them was not easy, for example, the archeologists had to do all these research and do any things to find out. For example, archeologists had to swim below to the floors of the ocean to find Atlantist. They also had to climb to the top of mountains so that they could find out where the Incas have lived. The Inca, Puebloans, and Pavopetria were learned by the artifacts that ere left behind and the living conditions.       The Inca lived in high places in Peru which were mainly on high mountain peaks or caves in cliff faces. The Inca left many artifacts, which were thing left behind for hundreds of years, such as clothing and textiles. The clothing and textiles were in good conditions even though they were buried for hundreds of years. Clothing usually got destroyed because of the dampness from the dry deserts. Textiles were usually in good conditions. The Inca sites were usually disterbed by treasure hunters. They usually stole the treasures of the Incas and was taken away.       The Poebloans lived in Mesa Verde. The first Ancestral Puebloan were caled Basketmakers. Basketmakers were good at crafts. They began to settle in a new way by farming instead of hunting. Basketmakers also began to live in pithouses which was built above ground. Instead of using poles and adobe bricks, they used stones which had a greater benefit of building them two or three stories high. Soon, the Poebloans had advanced from the pithouses into using cliff dwellers. They built the cliff dwellings with sandstone and mud.       Atlantis was a city that was located in Greece. It was sunken down and was the oldest submerged town in the world. Atlantis was 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor and because of the shifting sand in the ocean, archeologists found Atlantis. There they saw, the buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock- cut tombs and religious structures.

Two Civilizations were found on land and one was found underwater. Archaeoloists have been looking for these Civilizations to study how they survived.          The first Civilization that they've looked for was the Incas. These archaeoloists have goin to Peru looking for things that the Incas could have used. Incas would make colored strrined knots called quipus,but archaeoloists have found them and they do not know what they were for.Archaeoloists have portraits of the Incas religion,art,architecture,agriculture,government,and way of life.What the archaeoloists know about the Incas comes history and stories.While the archaeoloists were in Peru, they also found artifacts of the Incas. Archaeoloists think the artifacts are made of stone,pottery,gold,or silver.They were found in many different places. They also found the Incas textiles and clothing. The cloth was well not destroyed, but it was kept preserved over time.Archaeoloists have records of the sites of the Incas that were disturbed.The Incas lived high up in the Andes Mountains. The archaeoloists found dead bodies in the mountains and the help reveal how they lived.            The second Civilization that they've looked for were the Puebloans. Archaeoloists have goin to Mesa Verde for things the Puebloans used to survive. The Puebloans were known for their skill at the craft of basketmaking. The Puebleans lived in pithouses. They learned to make pottery and how to use a bow and arrow. For hunting they a spear thrower called atlatl. Their population would multiply. Soon they begin building houses in long, curving rows. Afterthat the Puebloans became more advanced at construction. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, their population grew several thousand. The Puebloans were a vigorous civilization among the finest expressions of himan culture in North America. They built dwellings usind sandstone the size a loaf of bread.               The third Civilization that they've looked for were the Pavlopetri. Archaeoloists have goin under water in southern Greece looking for the lost city of the Pavlopetries. This city dates back some 5,000 years ago. This city was before the days of classical Greece. There are older sunken sites that are not as interstine as this one. The city is 30,000 square meters in the ocean. Archaeoloists have found buildings,courtyards,main streets,rock-cut tombs, and religious structures underwater that was with the city. There are 9,000 square meters of new buildings underwater. Archaeoloists are tring to figure why the city sank. They think it was an earthquake or a tsunami that cased it. Archaeoloists say it is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece. Atlantis may be a myth, but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.

Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what they nots mean. The ancient Inca was like a solving mystery.       Clues left behind by the Inca from an amazing portrait of their religion. By studying these clues, Archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life. The Inca comes from an oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation.       Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. They may not have understood what the Inca told them. And some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history.

There are also some     ancient civilizations that we know about. For example, we know about the Incas the Puebolans and the Pavolpetri. The discoveries archeologists have made over the years are amusing. They can show us how people lived in their time.       Incas were amusing. They made knots on colored string to keep track of livestock   and keep track of the calendar. The artifacts that were discovered by archeologists were made from gold, stone, silver, or pottery. This means that the Incas were dedicated to what the made. The Incas wanted their belonging to last a long time. archeologists also found human remains in the Andes mountains. This means that when a family member dies they don't wan anything to happen to their loved ones so they bury them in the mountains. This shows that families were very close.       People in Mesa Verde were mostly known for basket making. they mostly lived in   pit houses in clustered small villages. At about 750 A.D they started building houses above ground. Their houses were made of upright walls made of pols and mud. AT 1000 A.D their houses were made of thick stone walls.By 1200 A.D the population moved back to cliffs.The attention to baskets became noticeable people began to make more pottery.              Not to long ago, a new civilization was discovered by a British oceanographer. The civilization's name is Pavlopetri. It is located in southern Greece.Archeologists have found buildings,pottery,courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. This civilization was very wealthy no one knows how it got sunk. The evidence that Archeologists lead them to believe that this civilization was very unified.       These civilizations were very different. Their way of government is not at all   simaler. These discoveries let figure out how civilizations worked before modern day technology. Our ways of life is way different then how their was.

In the first topic I will be talking about the Inca then the Puebloans then the Pavlopetri.   The Inca have a wierd way of keeping records they color and put nots in string for records.  The Inca's way of life is their religion, art  and architecture, agriculture,government,transportation.  Some of oral history comes from stories past on from generation to generation.  We also know is from the Europeans describing the Inca in letters and in their diaries.   The Puebloans lived in th canyon walls and in small villages.  Were efficient hunters using bows and arrows in stead of spears.  They houses one against another in long, curving rows, whit one or two pithouses in the front.   The Pavlopetri about 40 years ago that the aid by digital technology, were able to properly surey the ruins.  Thanks to shifting sand and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay the exporation was revealed.  They found a world of buildings, coutyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.

Some of them have been good and others of them have been bad, but with thoes discoveries there has been change. With each new discovery there has been some sort of change that has happened somewhere in the world. Now three of the greatest discoveries have been of the Inca, Puebloans, and the great Pavlopeti.        One of the great discoveries about the Inca are even though they didn't have a formal alphabet they were still able to keep records by using quipus which was a form of knot tying to help keep things orgonized. When the Europeans came they were amazed by how the Inca could keep their giant empire organized with knots. Other important finds about the Inca are their forms of art, religion, architecture, agriculture, governmant, transportation, and how they lived their lives. Most of thoes artifacts are made of pottery, silver, gold, or even stone so most of them have survived but not all. They have found most of them in building that have been discovered, so anything found is an important find in they eyes of an archeologist.        An important find about the Puebloans is their housing, it has been found inside the cliff alcoves of the Mesa Verde. They have found many Puebloan housing facillities there along with some pithouses out in feilds, open land, or prairies. Other artifacts that have been found to be important are thoes of the baskets that the Puebloans had made over time. Even though they had not left any written records for the people of today they are still learning about this amazing culture.        The last important city or town that has been discovered is that of the Pavlopeti. Their city was discovered many years ago but was never able to be researched by archeologists becuase the technical advances to be discovered were not around at the time it was discovered. This city of the Pavlopeti was discovered off the coast of Greece, and one of the great discovery of the town its self. Other great discoveries about the Pavlopeti are that there was many pottery peices found, even though they were all broken they still show great evidence about what the city was like and what type of art they made. One of the greatest finds about the Pavlopeti is how well mapped out the town was, becuase they had found rock-cut tombs, religious structures, there was also buildings, main steet with others and courtyards.        The Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopeti have all been great find from over the years. Even though archeologists haven't been able to get much from them they have learned many new things about how life was back in ancient times. There have been thoes bad finds and thoes good ones, but I would say that these three places were great finds. Thank you for your time I hope you enjoyed.

Not only are they important for learning about our history, but also because we can take the ideas and inventions from this point in time and put our own modern spin on it.                 First, the discovery of the Inca community is important because it provides the best idea about life in Peru before and during the Inca ruling. Also Archaeologists can compare what they learn from the artifacts and sites with the Spaniard's accounts of the Inca and can sometimes confirm historical records. The Inca lived in high parts of the Andes mountains and from the discoveries are assumed to have worshiped some mountain peaks. Most of their sites are in high remote places such as mountain tops, caves or cliffs. Because of the well preserved cites, archaeologists have been able to examine the bodies that have revealed information on their living cycle.                  Next, is the discoveries of the Puebloans are so important because their skillful stone masonry was so astonishing. They had much of an idea of crafts. They were also the first community to farm instead of hunt, and gather as their main livelihood. But even though hunting was masked by farming, still hunting occurred. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting. The discovery of how they built their settlements (Pit houses) is truly amazing. The pit houses featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbers supported the roof. The fire pit in the pit house had an air deflector. To me I think that pit houses were the original houses we have today.                   Lastly, the findings of the Pavlopetri is so significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied. Meaning that it was never touched so it stayed in perfect condition. Also, the findings underwater made the archaeologists think on why it was underwater. This thought made them  come up with the conclusion that the sea level changed, ground subsidence as a result of earthquakes, and or a tsunami. As the world's oldest submerged city it is truly amazing. It not only shows how people lived but also shows natural scientists about how the waters around it are so shallow. In my opinion all of these settlements helped shape our world today. This are some reasons why the discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important.

The discoveries of not only the lost city of Atlantis, but the Inca and Puebloans are so important. They are a big part of new discoveries of anctient civilizations! The Inca lived in Peru, the Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde, and the so called 'myth' of Atlantis is actually true!                    Archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life by studying clues left behind of the Inca's. Some of the things we know about the Inca comes from oral history. That was an important way to preserve a community's history. As in many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts may be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Some textiles and clothing of the Inca have also shown up very well! The cloth as been preserved by dry deserts on Peru's coasts or way up in the cold Andes mountains. The Inca lived in the Andes and many of their sites are in high, remote places. Some Inca were buried in caves or on mountain tops. The mountains act like a good freezer because they can preserve the bodies very well. The bodies can also reveal information about how the Inca lived .                    The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. The Puebloans are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small vilages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. The Puebloans learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow which is a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. Their population expanded and it was prosperous times for basketmakers. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground with upright walls made of mud and poles. By 1000 A.D. the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, the population reached several thousand.                    Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, this sunken sttlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. In Neapolis, this underwater city has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 B.C. This site consumes or covers 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Due to shifting sands and the sttlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of building, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. Ceramics were found dating back to the end of the stone age! 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT NN NN IN NNP . DT NNS IN RB RB DT NN NN IN NNP , CC DT NNP CC NNP VBP RB NNP NNP VBP DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS IN NN NNS .

New settlements can help make you learn how to live. The discoveries made about the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri are important because finding these new settlements can help us learn new things and learn about what can happen to our cities.       Inca lived in the mountains and objects and bodies have been frozen to be kept in good condition. The Inca discoveries can help us learn about how they lived and how they hunted. We can learn many things from new discoveries from the past. The Inca have already helped us learn facinating facts about them       The Puebloans and the Pavlopetri are also facinating. The Puebloan's arts and crafts are very facinating and showed that they were very good at making objects. They were nomadic people and they farmed. We can relate to them because some of the people today are nomadic and very good farmers and very good at art.       The Pavlopetri is a very cool under water settlement. It is located off the coast of Greece and is very unique do to the fact that it is underwater and still in shape. Pavlopetri can tell us, by the buildings that were there, that the peple that lived there were of very high class. The discoveries made about these settlements and people are amazing and interesting.

They had an odd calendar system with strings called a quipus, no one can understand how to read it.The civilization nearly ruled in south america for 100 years (1438-1532) and yet we barely know about them. We can piece together some information about the Incas through their artwork and from stories passed from generation to generation.          The Mesa Verde native american group lived near the 4 corners 1400 years before europeans came to america. The native americans were good at basket makeing and farmin which soon replaced hunting for them. From year 750 to 1300 the population reached several thousand. By about the 1300s Mesa Verde was deserted and nobody knoows why, archeologists know of a drought in the end of 1200s but their not sure why they moved. Around 1880s cowboys saw the cliff houses and archeologists investigated to learn more about those people.          The lost Greek city under the water was a huge find for archeologists. The lost city may have been the inspiration for the myth of Atlantis. The sunken city dates back to 5,000 year ago. The city is 30,000 meters big and is thought to have been under water since 1,000 BC. Sence the city was in a protected bay the city is not very damaged. Nobody knows why it got sank or if it is the inspiration behind Atlantis but some of the people near there say that the older generations knew something was in teh water so it may be the reason behind Atlantis.

The recent discoveries were located in well-known cultures such as the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Could what they have found at these sites affect our lives or could it just be another thing we found that could be cool looking but priceless and pretty much worthless? In this essay I am going to figure out why the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri articfacts found are important to us.        So who exactly are the Inca? The Inca are an ancient civilization that is still around today that are still carrying on the traditions of the elder Inca tribes. As in the article it shows that archaeologists have located ancient remains of things such as pottery and buildings. So are the things found in the Inca city important to us today? The answer to this question many people are asking is yes it is. The reason the artifacts found in the Inca city are important is because the lifestyle of the Inca could help are life. People today could learn about Inca architecture and how to add on to our knowledge of art.        The Puebloans were first formed at around 550 A.D. and were known for many things. Recently there was a question asked if the artifacts loacted in the Puebloans civilization is important to us today since we have far surpassed machinery and artifacts that early people had. The anwer that is easily fit to this question is yes. The reason for this answer is because the Puebloans could have had something very important that we don't have and could be very useful. If you do not think that these ancient artifacts are important and that the newer technology is the way to go just think about how the Egyptians built the pyramids in weeks or maybe even months and how we can barely figure out how to build them. But if you are still dead set on answering this question with a no i will not tell you its bad.        Last but not least are the Pavlopetri which are my favorite. By the city of Neapolis archaeologists have found a city that resembles the fabled city of Atlantis. Artifacts found at this site are buildings, courtyards, streets, and types of pottery. These artifacts are important to our society because there has been a vast amount of stories told about the city of Atlantis that people have grown up with. If your a parent and told your child a story of atlantis but later on he/she thinks its just another fable. Since people have found this underwater city then people have something to look forward to hearing about and knowing that the stories they heard as a child are not fake. Another reason it is important is because maybe we could find documents of the peoples history and just what exactly happened to their city whether it was just a huge wave or for those who are into Greek gods maybe it was Atlantis's patron god of the sea Poseidon that wiped out the city.        The architecture and other designs by the Inca are important to our soceity today because we could take what we learned and build off it. Puebloans are important to us because we can add on to the art we already have and make it more like ancient civilizations. The Pavlopetri are important because it will help people believe in stories more and have things to inspire them to do. I hope you enjoyed my essay on the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.

It inspired many people to keep looking for more lost cities that are submerged. It show archaeologists the way people used the live there life and what technology they had. How they used to communicate and what they believed.         This town is now the oldest submerged town in the world. There are older sunken sites but the lost city is the most unique.  It has remains from 2800 to 1200bc. But a British oceanographer just found this city 40 years ago. They have found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. They have found 30,000 square meters of buildings.         With all the years of exploring this cite they still haven't found out why this lost city was submerged. Many think the sea reveled changed, a tsunami, or a earthquake occurred. With more investigations they have revealed over 9,000 square meters  of new buildings. Only 1 percent of our worlds ocean floor has been surveyed and there still is a lot more to be found.

First of all concluding the Incas, Ancient Puebloans, and Greeks, the Incas in a matter were a very unique civilization. What made them unique is up to question as most historians are baffled as they have to be very careful when they interpret accounts of their history. But what I think what was really unique from their history is their use of the colored knot system called quipus which was to record their calendar to keep a count of livestock. The most interesting thing is that archaeologists do not know what the knots means further leading the Ancient Inca into mystery.    The Puebloans were a group of people living in the Four Corners region in North America and chose Mesa Verde as their home where they flourished for 700 years until mysteriously disappearing. The Puebloan society at first lived a nomadic way of life but throughout the centuries living in Mesa Verde they became to lead a more civilized way of life such as farming and building huts. Throughout their time living in Mesa Verde the Puebloans became skill stone masons which was in my opinion one of the most interesting thing to learn about them. Further living the Puebloans disappeared from Mesa Verde for reasons that are up to question today.    In the islands of southern Peloponnese a lost greek city was found further leading that the myth of Atlantis was true however that was plausible as the city dates back to between 2800-1200 B.C. , a time before Plato wrote about the city of Atlantis. This lost Greek city which is called now Palvopetri was discovered over 40 years ago by a British oceanographer but has been furthered studied by archaeologists today. According to reseach Palvopetri is the oldest subemerged city in the world and may have sunk from a earthquake or tsunami.

We know that a long time ago there was a civilizations going we have found clues such as art religion and portraits. The Incas are a group of people who were in the civilization that was lost. Incas had no formal alphabet or any system of writing. The Incas would tie knots in a string to keep track of the days that go by. They found a way of transportation, Archeologists have found roads.Archeologists found the roads by sand shifting around and revealing main streets, rockin tombs and religous structures.The lost city is 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor.

The Incas were an ancient civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled South American that rivaled the expanse of  ancient Rome. But how do we know that? Clues were left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion,art, architecture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these these clues, I found that archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life.           The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings called quipus to keep records. They used knots in colored strings to record on the calendars.Some of what we kow about the Inca comes from oral history , or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on the stories was an important way to preserve a community's history.            Historians have to be when the spaniards interpret the Inca. Some of them didn't speak the language very well. So their descriptions might not be very accurate.The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts. Some Inca sites have also been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable.            The Inca lived in the Andes mountains and may have even worshiped some mountain peaks.Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces and this has helped to preservethe sites, because looters can't easily get to them. The bodies found in the Andes also reveal information about how they lived. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT NNP .

They are that they inform us how life was back then, how geological events destroy civilizations, and that we still dont know everthing about these people. First they inform us on how life so back then this is shown in the Ican part as it explanes how the made a living. Second, how geoligical events destroy civilizations. This is shown in the lost city as it was destroyed by earthly events. last but not least we dont know everthing about every civilization. If we did we would 'nt have to make these articles as there would be no questions but only answers and a life with only answers isnt a life at all.

The Inca, found in Peru, left many clues about the past. Textiles, clothing, pottery, gold, silver, and other stone objects were found and helped our knowledge of our past. Sadly, looters have found many sites and stole many artifacts. Thankfully, the looter didn't find all the sites or graves. Looters couldn't find many graves because some were buried in the mountain top or in a cave on a cliff face. The Inca left many artifacts for us to find.       In North America, the Puebloans left artifacts that archeologists have discovered. Archeologist have found stone buildings, baskets, pottery, and bow and arrows in Mesa Verda sites. These cave dwellers created their villages in stone and in the sides of mountains. THey were also skilled basket makers. Origninally nomadic, the Pueloans settled in Mesa Versa and began farming. We understand and have knowledge of our past because of the atrifacts we find.       Off of Greece, we have found the lost city. Submerged underwater, is the oldest and largest underwater city we have found. In this underwater city we have discovered a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, religious structures, and thousand of sharts of pottery. This discovery has lead to vast knowledge. The lost city helps us connect our past to the present.       Without these discoveres, what would we know about our past? These discoveries help us understand our past and connect it to the present. It shows how much humanity has evolved over the many years.

The discoveries of the ancient Inca, Peubloan, An Paveloperti so so important because during their time they didn't know how to read or write. So they never wrote down their history. So the only way to learn about them is to study the artifacts they've left behind.                 In source one it says 'The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing' on the first line. this just means that they couldn't write anything down. So like I said before the only way they could leave stuff behind for us to discover would be their buildings and pottery objects.                 In source two it says 'For more than 700 years they and their descendents lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls.' One way these discoveries of the ancient Peubloans are important is because with finding the stone buildings they have left behind it tells us how they survived and lived in North America.                 In source three it says 'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' This is an example of how we have to use artifacts to sometimes discover information about ancient people. Because like this sentence says this old city was underwater so even if they could have been able to write it would have been washed away.                 These are just some of the many reasons why we have to use artifacts to discover information about ancient people sometimes.             	WRB VBP DT NNS IN DT NNP , DT NNPS , DT DT NNP RB JJ .

Everything we have learned has come from artifacts, ruins, left behind pieces of clothing, sculptures, dead bodies, and really the list goes on and on. From these artifacts we find, we are able to piece together, little by little, information about these ancient civilizations.Without these artifacts, we would never know about some civilizations, which would truly be sad. We are able to learn so much just by finding an article of clothing. It truly is amazing.    2- I could not find the question in the passage that I was asked to answer. Sorry but this is not my fault.                                                                                                                       3- I could not find the question in the passage that I was asked to answer. Sorry but this is not my fault.       Part 2   The discoveries I have made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important. Without these discoveries, there would be a lot about ancient times that we would not know about ancient civilizations. '...the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.' It is that way a lot of times. Sometimes you just get lucky with the artifacts that you come across. 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.' Its truly fantastic how one little thing or artifact can uncover so many mysteries about ancient civilization. 'The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found.' Have you ever thought about what we would not have today, if it hadn't been for people uncovering mystery? Its crazy to think that sometimes our fate can rest in the hands of who? Merely little archaeologist who dig in the ground and find old stupid things about past civilizations? Yes. It makes us think about how we are going to preserve our bodies in the future. What if nobody ever found any artifacts from the American civilization? Wouldn't that be crazy? So as you can see, finding artifacts about past civilizations is very important and without those artifacts, a lot of things today would not be the same.   	CD WRB VBP PRP VB WP PRP VBP IN DT JJ .

Some have even changed our ways of thinking about people of a certain time, or whole civilizations. Recent discoveries about the ancient Incas, Ancestral Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have been very important to understand them.                         The ancient Incas of South America created an empire that almost equaled the size of Rome for nearly 100 years. Archaeologists have discovered many findings about them, and they have been very important and useful in the understanding of this great civilization. They have left a great picture of the government, religion, agriculture and more, such as art and architecture, and their way of life. The climate in the region has helped preserve many artifacts just waiting to be found. Textiles and cloth or clothing have been been saved very well by the dry deserts, or cold mountains. The art and architecture, like many ancient civilizations, might be stone, pottery, silver, or even gold, these artifacts can last a long time and give us a clear picture.                 Mesa Verde was once home to a people called, Anasazi; who lived there way before Europeans explored North America. These people are now called Ancestral Puebloans due to their modern day descendants. Before they moved to Mesa Verde, they were nomadic, but they began to lead a more settled lifestyle. The first Ancestral Puebloans arrived in Mesa Verde around A.D. 550. They built their homes into the ground, they were known as pithouses. It was a fairly prosperous time for them, as their population multiplied. By A.D. 1000 the people had evolved from pole-and-adobe construction, to stone masonry. Around A.D. 1200, people began moving into the cliff alcoves their ancestors, centuries before, had lived. The arts achieved while living in the alcoves ranks among the best ever seen in North America.                 The source of what inspired one of the most famous tales in human history- the legend of Atlantis- might have been discovered by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists recently. It is an ancient Greek town dating back to Homer's Heroes; that's 5,000 years! There are remains from before the glory days of Greece. This town is called Pavlopetri. It covers 30,000 square meters off the southern Peloponnese. Evidence shows the town was occupied at least 1,200 years earlier than previously thought.                 All of these were very important discoveries. they helped us understand, ancient peoples, like the Incas and Ancestral Puebloans. Without discoveries by archaeologists we wouldn't know a thing about them. We also discovered the oldest submerged town in the world. These discoveries will help us understand history, and the people who have lived throughout it.

Well this is why i am hear. I am hear to talk bout these things and maybe answer some of your questions.       The first thing i would like to cover is the things we know about the past. one of the things we know is that their was a group called Inca or Peru. we know some about them but no much. we know that they had no alphabet or system or writing, and did not leave archives for historians to study. but we knew that the  Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of  livestock. we know about this method thanks to the first Europeans they have left us many ancient quipus `but know one knows what the knots mean.       so you might be thinking, 'This does not answer any of my question.'Well i think i am about to answer them right about know.Some of what we know about the Inca we know from oral history, or stories past on from one person to the other. But we know some or the things we know from written down story that the Europeans that arrived in the empire in 1532. the rest of what we know about the Inca comes from found artifacts found over the years and from the sites they were found in.       The next thing to discuss would be Ancestral Puebloans and Their World. so about 1,400 years ago a group or people living in four corner regions chose mes verde for their home.for 700 year their people lived there. Through the years the people started to build elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls.Around A.D. 1200s the moved away and left their homes. A national park called Mes Verde National park found all theese homes and preserved a spectacular reminder or this ancient culture. Many archeologist call the people by the name of Anasazi. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550 and were known for there craft skills and making baskets. The Ananias's lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops.Trust me this is not everything to know about the Puebloans, but if i wre to explane every little thing that could take hour so it is time to move on.       The last thing to talk about would be the Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. The first thing you must know is that the ocean has been know for consumeing towns and other things. But none or the other under water towns as you could say are as visible as the Lost Greek City. The Lost Greek city was discoverd anout 40 years ago by a British oceanographer, but only this year that marine archeologist, aided by digital tocknology, were able to properly see the ruins. What had been found supasses all expectations. All thanks to shifting sands and the settlements encloser in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world or buildings, countryards, main streets, rock cut tombs and religious structers. The archeologist's were able to find artifacts that date back to the end of the stone age. The investagation also reveled over 9,000 square meters or new building but the beggest surprise was a posible megaron, a monumental stucture with a large rectangualy hall.       Well hopefully my essay has helped answerd some of your questions.

That means the looters are taking away any artifacts that could possibly be used for research. So what we need to be doing is helping find a way to prevent looting from ever happening. If it keeps on happening than we will never find out about the wonderful ancinet civilizations before oours now.

Discoveries like the discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri and their lifestyles. First lets talk about the discoveries made of the different peoples.      First the Incas we know they were a civilization that ruled South America with an empire that rivaled Ancient Rome from 1438-1532. Although the Europeans arrived in the empire and described them in letters and diaries they did not speak the Inca language well so they may be inaccurate. Historical records of peoples like these are important for us to understand were there empire went wrong and learn from there way of life.      Next the Puebloans the first of them were settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550 they first lived in pit-house until they began building house above ground. Also acquired the bow and arrow more efficient weapon for hunting then their original atlatl (a spear thrower). Then at about A.D. 200 they began to move back to their ancestors way of life on the cliff alcoves and we do not know why. Records like these help understand how we have evolved and how we evolve provided by the information above this helps us understand how far we have come.      Last the Pavlopetri, were the lost city in the waters off southern Greece. This has inspired one of the most famous myths, Atlantis. It dates back to 2800 to 1200 BC much farther back than the Puebloans or Incas. This gives us even more information about our original ancestors. Investigations of this city have found possible governing techniques such as a monumental structure  which suggests it had been used by an elite. It shows how people lived at that time but also is of interest to scientists.      Whether we our leaning about our ancestral past or learning from their mistakes, discoveries like these have helped and will always continue to.

These civilizations can tell us as modern day people about how life used to be. It just amazes me how much can be learned about ourselves through learning about ancient civilizations. The Inca have been very hard to find any information about, because they left no written history. Although they did live in high in the Andes mountain which made for something like a time capsule. ' The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn abour how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived. After reading Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World I realized how much houses and buildings have changed people used to live in houses called pithouses which are just a pit dug a few feet into the ground and then overlayed with sticks and materials to make a roof. These houses had a small hole in the roof for an air duct for fires. After reading Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. by Helena Smith in Athens I realized that there are so many things that haven't been discovered that may be very close at hand but yet so far. In this quote ' Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have been surveyed.' i think well that means that there is alot that we could discover if we could just go a little bit deeper. This is why I think the discoveries about the Inca, Puebloans, and The Pavlopetri are so important.

Well you should. The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri civilizations were all super important civilizations. The Inca's amazing art, the Puebloans great crafts, and the Pavlopetri's crazy good buildings of their time! They were all amazing is the only thing you can say.        The Inca of Peru civilization did not leave archives for historians to study, but they kept records on strings. Also, clues left behind from the Inca helps archaeologists and historians find information about the Inca. The discoveries about the Inca show us, that religion was very important and so was art. Other discoveries show what the Inca built their objects and buildings out of. I think that the Inca of Peru were very advanced for their time based of these discoveries.        The Puebloans left many clues that showed us that they were known as Basket-makers for their skill at that activity. Also, it is seen that the Puebloans started to build houses above ground, with upright poles and mud. This great civilization only lived about 100 years on their main land, and archaeologists have found several reasons on why they might have migrated. Without archaeologists, this ancient civilization would have probably never been found again.        One of the most interesting ancient civilizations, that of the Pavlopetri, went undiscovered for about 5,00 years! The town where the Pavlopetri's lived was sunken at the bottom of the ocean just sitting there waiting to be found. When archaeologists did finally find this magnificent city, it was amazing. Archaeologists discovered a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. The Pavlopetri were definitely way out of their time of civilizations. I think they were one of the most important archaeology finds ever.        All of these very important discoveries of ancient civilizations could have never been done without archaeologists finding them. The importance of archaeologists is getting bigger and bigger as eagerness for finding more new ancient civilizations is growing. I hope one day archaeologists can find our civilization and be just as amazed as I was while reading about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetris.

It might not seem that way in the 21st century, but the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri invented and inovated multiple materials and concepts that we could not live without today.       The first important discovery of the past involves the Puebloans. 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World' by the National Parks Service U.S. Department of the Interior says this: 'Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood...they learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow.' So basically, the Puebloans were some of the first groups of people to settle down, farm, and become civilized, birthing the whole idea of a civilization and nations, cities, countries, etc. While doing so, they invented the process of making pottery, and the bow and arrow, which later evolved (although we kept the bow and arrow) into a gun, which is mainly what the United States uses for protection today.       The second important discovery of the past involves the Inca. 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past' by Beth Gruber states this: 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues, archaeologist and others can piece together details of Inca life.' The archaeologists' discoveries allow them to piece together an Inca past, giving the modern age clues to how people in the past lived. We're learning where we came from, the origin of our ideas and inovations.       For these two reasons, it is concluded that the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri invented and inovated multiple materials and concepts that we could not live without today.

They tell use about our ansesters, and also how some of the main things we use now a days got started. like the Pithouses could of been our basses for our now aday homes. Also the Puebloans lurned ho to make bow and arrows witch we use now for hunting and also for a sport. The kiva was a place that you could go and pray for help with hunting luck, rain, healing, and for good crops to grow. The kiva could be the bases for our modern day churches. Even though you might not think that the discoveries that we make that are about thousonds of years ago might be inportent they really are for a big part of our every day lifes.

The Inca of Peru have a very interesting language they dont have one! They used colored strings to keep all of there records, though nobody knows what they are used for it is fasinating to think how it would even work. The only language form the Inca is oral stories even thought they have changed dramatically from the beggining it still tells us what it was like to live in 1438. Incans have left behing stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Materials last a long time and were even burried for a long time.

The Incas were one of the first technicians to be on Earth.  Incas have made clothing by hand, a writing system, and even calenders that were used by the sun.  The puebloans however were one of many ancient civilizations to farm.  Farming and hunting was their only way to get food because there was no other villages around them.  Greek civilization is by far the most complex agriculural system.  Greeks made temples, kingdoms, drama, and myths.                          Secondly, their agriculture was very different than today.  Incas and Puebloans lived in strong huts, but Greek life was lived in a large empire.  Greeks were polytheism, meaning believes in many gods, like Zeus, Hades, and Poseiden.  Puebloans built a temple to pray for rain for their crops to grow.  Incas however had a religion where some were sacrificed to the heavens.                          Lastly, some people don't know why their temples, and kingdoms disappeared.  It's because of strong storms, and volcanos.  Incas have lived their lives close to a dersert which means the possibility that Inca is buried with sandstorm, and same thig with Puebloans.  Greeks however built one large city named the city of Atlantis, and it is now gone.  The reason why is because that city was made really close to ocean and there was a volcano that errupted.  The city of Atlantis went under water and still is.                             To conclude the importance of ancient civilization, Inca, Puebloans, and Greek are all both very important towards today.  People today still use the tools they used then.

Things such as the pit house and the Kiva are very important to find because that tells how people slept and practiced there art of religion. When they found the pit house it told where and how they lived as far as housing goes. Such as how far it sunk in the ground which is a few feet. These are the reasons I think finding these things is very important for history to be kept and made in the future.

Archaeologists were used to discover most advanced techniques in the world about the Inca's predecessors. photos help find discoveries about Inca.Monuments couldn't be discovered because they were underground. Many other high places in Inca were buried in caves and on cliffs.At that time archaeologist jobs were more difficult. As the archaeologist discovers more things they also discovered bodies found i the icy Andes.People used modern scanning equipment to discover how people died.Bodies reveal also how long they had lived.In Inca of Peru the objects were made from different things like pottery, gold ,and sliver.These objects were discovered       Ancestral Pueblo-ans were first settle in Mesa Verde about A.D.550.They were known as boilermakers which was another object that was part of history. Farming replaced hunting and gathering main things for livelihood. Pottery which was one of the Inca artifacts objects were required for making weapons and more.Pit houses was the houses that they had lived in.The living room sunk in the ground.Fires were built in the summer and were mainly for cooking .In the winter when the alcove rooms were damp and uncomfortable fires would burn throughout the villages.Civilization lasted 100 years long .Many things were left behind like art architecture and the government and other clues a way of life.

Now its the puebloans the puebloans were long before the Europeans found north America lived like about 700 people who live in like about the late A.D 1200s. they are one of the people who live in a different way theyer known for their skill to craft. the people made it to be able tho replace hunting with farming and gathering is what they mostly did for them to live. they're also smart people they make their homes to where it would be safe and could be heated up by a firepit that is set for fire wood to burn and it would no burn their home.         the next set of people live as groups so they are able to srivive together they lived not only by not only to protect each other but also to pich in food or water and they lived in good homes to were it can keep them warm the shelter is not that big but can fit a family. they used different things that help them hunt and farm and live to gether.

Inca made up alot of things like colored string knots called quipus to record calender to keep a count of livestock. Europeans was so amzed when they first met the ancient Inca of Peru. They were amazed because they could run a huge empire using strings to keep rcords. Archaeologist found lots of Inca. But today it seems like it doesnt exist, because no one knows what knots mean.                    Civilization lasted for 94 years, nearly a hundred years(1438-1532) thats almost a whole century. It ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome.  Some of the Inca stories was legends rather than stories. They may not leave have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate.                     The inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountains peaks. Many of theirsites are in remote, high places. Some inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on moutain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes he job of archaeologist more difficult.

We will also learn about their housing and where they live and about their artifacts.          The Incas lived in Peru from 1438-1532.  Clues that were left behind for archeologists helped the archeologists picture life for the Incas.  Archeologists found artifacts that were made from gold, silver, stone, and pottery.  Archeologists also fond textiles and clothing from the sites.  Some archeologists even found some remains frozen in ice in the Andes.           The Puebloans lived in North America and for 700 years they lived there but in the late A.D. 1200s they left.  The first Puebloans settled around A.D. 550.  They were good at basket weaving and they were nomadic.  They then started to settle down and they started to farm.  They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages.  By A.D. 1000 the people started to make better houses.  They then started to make pottery which made the baskets decline in quality.  They then started to build houses called Kivas.  By about A.D. 1300 the Puebloans left.          The  Pavloperti lived in Greece.  There town is one of the oldest submerged town in the world.  Some of their remains date back to 2800 to 1200 BC.  It is believed that the town was consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.  Archeologists have found ceramics which date all the way back to the end of  the stone age.  There are theories of why the town sank.  But we may never know.          That was important information about civilizations a long ago.  We have learned a lot about the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopertri.  I hope you have learned a lot about all these civilizations.

The discoveries that archeologists have found are pretty amazing like metals, pottery, buildings, bodies, scrolls, and documents. The ancient Inca had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They actually mad different colored strings to keep track of everything. They even kept track of livestock with strings thats pretty amazing to me! But nobody knows what these strings tell they could possibly tell stories.         Many archeologists have not found anything before because of grave robbers or looters but in the Andes where some Inca lived the Inca but their treasure on mountian tops or in caves where nobody could get them. Archeologists have found preserved bodies so the experts can scan the bodies and tell them how the Incas lived and what they did. In Atlantis the experts have found main streets, buildings, metals, religious buildings, weapons, scrolls, and documents. They have even found clothes that have been down in Atlantis for a long time which is pretty amazing. Inca lived in Pithouses where it had four corner timbers support the roof. It had a living room sunk a few feet in the ground and the firepit had an air deflector. It also had a antechamber that might of contained storage bins or pits. The Pithouses later became into Kivas.         	NNP NNP : NNP NNP DT NNPS IN DT NNP NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT NNP .

This article is going to provide a brief incite on my opinion.               I feel that it is important that we discovered the Inca because they provided us with the system of string and knots. According to the article, that is the system they used to keep their civilization running so smoothly. Although there is noway of knowing what the knots on the string meant it is documented in the writings of the Europeans. I also think it was good that the Europeans documented what they saw to help depict the Inca civilization. I feel that it is important to see how the Inca lived to help subdue some of the curiosity we have as humans.               I feel that it is important that we found the Mesa Verde civilization because we were able to see how they lived and how organized they were. The Mesa Verde civilization was very well thought out. They left behind the houses that they lived in and they also showed how the were expressed through the art of pot decorating. I think that it would be very important to find some of the baskets that they weaved because you can see what kind of people they were and also how they progressed in their talents throughout the years.                I feel it is important that we found the 'Lost Greek City' because it was a legend that people grew up with all over the world and I think that it is cool that that legend can be confirmed that there really was a lost city in the ocean. Even though it wasn't Atlantis, it is still pretty cool. I think it was important that the town did end up underneath the ocean because otherwise, I feel like another civilization would have probably inhabited it and it would not be how they left it.               I hope this paper provided some incite as to how I felt about the ancient civilizations. I also encourage the reader of this paper to study the ancient civilizations because I think that they are very interesting to learn about and attempt to understand.

The Inca lived in the Andes mountains and may have even worshiped some of the mountain peaks. They use to make knots in colored strings to record the calendar and to keep count of livestock. Some clues they left behind form an amazing portrait of their religion like the art, arcgitecture, agriculture, government, and way of life. By looking at these clues we can piece together details of Inca life.       Some of our knowledge comes from atrifacrs or objects that they left behind for us. The objects might be made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. These materials last a long time, even for a hundred years. Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings or in the graves of the dead.       Most Inca sites are destroyed by treasure hunters or looters, who take nything that they might think is worth some money.       Inca is important because they make us realize that nothing is easy, (like this paper) and that it could be fun to research, search, or reveal the unknown.       And what makes the Lost City so important is that it is the oldest, underwater mystery EVER! And there are many legends told... but im not gonna get into that right now.

The Inca of Peru were very advaned they had no formal alphabet or any system of writing.  They made knots in colored string called quipus to keep record of the calendar and/or to keep count of livestock.  The Eruopeans were amazed that the Inca could run a huge empire with only a string to keep records on.  Archaeologists have managed to find some of these ancient quipus but to this day no one knows how to read or interpret them.  The Inca lived high up in the Andis Mountains so some of the bodies are frozen up there, these bodies can lend us great knowlege of how they lived and what they ate ect.                The Puebloans also called the cliff-dwellers lived in the four corners region of the United States.  These Native Americans were some of the firstin the area to start settleing down and replacing hunting with farming.  They built more permanent dwellings and they learned to make pottery to cook in.  Not much is known about these people, they left no written records and very few pictures so all we know about them is through their buildings and structures.                 The lost Greek city proved a lot of fun family myths to be true.  This ancient city sits on 30,000 square meters of land underwater.  Scientists think that the city was swallowed by the sea around 1000 BC.  Scientists used digital technology to survey the ruins.  Since the city was protected by the bay it was not hard to survey the whole town.  They found all kinds of very very old artifacts which took everyone by surprise proving that it was older than once thought.                 These are just some of the reasons that I think these civilizations are important.

They didn't leave anything for us to study but they did leave knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists found many of the ancient quipus but no one really knows what the knots mean.       Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history. Oral history is stories that get passed down from generation to generation. Passing down the stories was very important for knowing about how they lived.       Also we know some of this stuff because they were written down by the Europeans who went to the empire in 1532. Those people were soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.       We also know from objects they left behind. Such as tools or pottery or even weapons. But also some of them were buried in graves for the dead to use them in the afterlife.       Clothing and textiles also remarkably survive. Usually ancient materials like cloth usually get destroyed by dampness. Especially if they were in the cold mountains of the Andes.       The Ancestral Puebloans       A group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. This happened about 1,400 years ago long ago before Europeans explored North America. For more than 700 years they lived in Mesa Verde.       The first Ancestral peubloans settled in Mise Verde about A.C. 550. They were known as Basketmakers because they were skilled in crafting. Formerly nomadic, they began to lead a more settle way of life. Like farming replaced hunting adn gathering as their man livehood. They lived in pithouses. The pithouses were clustered into small villages. They made pottery and aquired the bow and arrow. The bow and arrow was a more efficient weapon for hunting than the spear.       The peubloans lived in pithouses from about A.D, 550 to A.D. 750. It featured a living room that sunk a few feet from the ground. The four corner timbers supported the roof.       By A.D. 1000 the peobloans of Mesa Verde got better on their artwork. Their artwork advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Pottery also changed. It changed from simple designs on a gray backround to black drawings on a white backround.        In the 1880s local cowboys reported cliff dwellings, archeologists have sought to understand the people's lives. But some of the scientific knowledge remains sketchy. We will never know the whole story: they left no written records and much that was very important in their lives has perished.       Ancestral Peubloans lived in the cliff dwelling for less than 100 years. By about A.D.1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. We know that the last quarter of the A.D. 1200s saw drought and crop failures but these people had survived earlier droughts. Perhaps there were social and political problems, and the people simply looked for new opportunities elsewhere.       When the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexicoand Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there. Whatever might have happened, some of today's Pueblo people, and probobly other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa verde.       Antlantis       The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.       Antlantis has been explared by an Angle-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of sice and wealth of detail is un precedented, experts say.       Atlantis straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is belived to have fallen in the sea around 1000 BC. Although 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists were able to properly survey the ruins.       Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs adn religious structures, In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.       Our investigations also reveald over 9.000 square meters of new buildings. But what really took us by surprise was the discobery of a possible megaron.       Marine geologists have yet to work out why the lost city sank. But theories include that sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earth quakes, or a tsunami.       'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going,' said Sakellariou. 'Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'

The Inca live high in the andes and may even have workshiped some mountain peak and many of their sites are in remote high places but it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult and in high altitude.  So the bodies also reveal information about how they lived. The ancient Icna of the Peru had no formal alphabet or systems of writing and the do not leave there archive.The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire.            The first ancestral puebloans settled in Mesa Verde spanish for green table about A.D.550. They lived in a pithouses clustered into small villages usally built on mesa top but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and the arrow a more efficient weapons for hunting and there are farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood.using  nature to advantage Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging.           Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, archeologists have sought to understand these people lives but despite decades of excation. Yet for all their silence these structures speak with a cretain elquence. We will never know the whole story  left and there is no writing or records and other things that was important.

Historians and archeologists have mentioned that they don't understand what their writings are trying to say. These geographical scientists only have found the artifacts they left behind, and the stories the people has said. We also know how the Incas have done throughout there civilizations because the Europeans had colonized that land, and wrote books of their civilization. The Incas lived high in the Andes for the rich soil and farmland that had been there. We think that the Incas might have worshiped geographical features. So now the scientists are still trying to discover more details of this mysterious civilization.        When the Europeans have arrived to the Americas they encountered a civilization on North America. This civilizations were known as Navajos or Native Americans. We know about these Native Americans because of the Europeans. Later on, the Native Americans influence themselves due to the arrival of the Europeans. They had great farmland to have this civilization on the run. Also they left some artifacts after the end of this civilization.        Greek Mythology has influenced the Marine geologists today to try to discover all of their work. The geologists have tried to intent to complete this mission but they have never found nothing. These people have passed on their superstition by stories. This civilization was 'flooded', and sunk to the bottom of the ocean and was called the 'Lost City'.Today scientists are trying to find out if this was a myth or a fact.

It tells them about what their ancestors where like and how they lived. Finding more about these things educates people and lets them know stuff they may have not known before.            The Incas lived in Peru. They didn't have an alphabet or system of writing so they used colored strings and knots. The Incas left clues for archaeologists to about their religion, art and agriculture, govenment, transportation, and way of life. Some of what we know ab out the Incas came from objects that had been left behind like stone, pottery, gold, silver, textiles, and clothing. Graves and building also gave them information.            Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde. They are known as basketmakers. They lived in pithouses in small villages. Later on they began building houses above ground and over time they got bigger and better. People began to move back into cliff alcoves after time went on. When the cliff dwellers left they went to New Mexico and Arisona.                Pavlopetri is the lost city. It is beneathe the waters off southern Greece. It is the oldest submerged town in the world that was a planned town. Around 1000 BC is when the city was under water. Protected buioldings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, pottery, and religios structures where found.                By finding these things it proved that there are sunken cities. It also tells about other peoples lives that have lived on earth before us. They can study these thihngs to find out more information about the past and even about them.

Althought it was a puzzle we are figuring out what t he little strings ment and more abput their daily lives.       Puebloans are important because they started homes called pithouses, and storage bins made called baskets. They also had a firepit to keep warm. Then invented kivas a different kind of home( above ground and with strait walls).They were heirs of a vigorous civilization, whose accomplishments in the community and arts were ranked the finest expression of human culture in North America.        Pavlopetri's are important because they found over 9,000 square meters of mew buildings underwatwer.It was signifigant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied.

One of these many civilizations was the tribe known as the Inca. The inca were located in Peru. They did not have a form of wrigting and did not leave an archive, so it made it very hard for historians to study them. So how do we know so much? We were able to find portraits that showed how they lived, what they beleived in, and how the society worked. We also ger some of what we know from oral stories that were passed down.   In context, we have learned a lot but only because much effort was put into it.

The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architeture, agriculture, goverment, transportation, and way of life. As in many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver.

Three of them are the Inca's, Mesa Verde, and a lost Greek city. The archaeologists have had a hard time searching all three for artifacts and answers about how they lived.       The archaeologists had a hard time with the Inca's ancient civilization because of treasure looters. Treasure looters are people who go to ancienct civilizations and other places just in search of artifacts that might be worth money. The Inca's lived in the mountains, and had some well preserved artifacts. Archaeologists found sticks with knots of colorful string, which they thing was the Inca's way of counting livestock. Since the Inca's lived in the mountains, it was difficult for the archaeologists to get there with all of their supplies.       The archaeologists discovered how the people of Mesa Verde lived and hunted. They lived in houses called pithouses. They had one wall, and a partial wall. The roof only covered 3/4 of the house, and two walls were left open. The people of Mesa Verde used bows and arrows as their deffense technique.       The archaeologists had the most difficult time getting to the lost Greek city because it is under water. The archaeologists found many artifacts covered in sand because of the water currents. The archaeologists found many buildings, tomb stones, and some pottery while searching the lost city.       The archaeologists had hard times exploring the many ancient civilizations they have found because of where they are located, or because of treasure looters. Overall, archaeologists have found many different ancient civilizations over the past 100 years, and three of them are the Inca's, Mesa Verde, and the lost Greek city.

The Inca, the Ancestral Puebloans and the Lost City are three important discoveries.       First of all, the Inca is an important discovery because it was a mighty empire that came to an end. Artifacts found in the Andes mountains are important because we get to know hoe the manage to live and survive int the colds of Andes.We know we get to know how they kept up with records and number and other daily things.Finding artifacts about the Inca might help us know where the Inca people came from and what language did they speak.       Next the discovery of the Puebloans is important because it's they first well elaborated city found in the U.S. We get to know how they lived.Puebloans were able to build their house on top of rocks.But what we don't know is why they disappeared.Hopefully with artifacts and the new technology we get to know.       Also the discovery of the Lost City in Greek is important because it makes us wonder even  more if Atlantis is real.It's also important because it the oldest city found. The city was also very well organized.       Lastly, all this discoveries are important because we get to know about the pass.Hopefully we will find more cities to help us know even more.

However we are still finding new pieces of history could never have expected.    For example drawings in a cave can tell us alot about history because we can identify the drawing they created with a rock or something. They tell us how was life back then, how did they ate?What foods did they eat?What transportation did they use?What killed them?       However not all pieces of history are true thats why we need to find evidence because if we just say this is what happen and I don't know how I they did it I just assume they did it, I can't say that because you can ruin the other piece of history that are true.

These artifacts help them figure out how the civilizations lived their life, and how hard thier life was for them.      The artifacts are important because we can find what happened years before, how ancient people lived thier life, how they were entertained, and so on. For example the Inca are ine of the civiliztions historains and archiologists are studying. Thanks to artifacts, we now know a lot of stories about them, what they wore, where they lived, what time period they lived in, and so on.        Nother example are the puebloans. They also left artifacts behind such as, their homes baskets, pottery, and so on. by their artifact we know that at one point they made a lot of baskets, farmed a lot ,and so on.     Another example is Atlantis the artifacts found can help find when it was made, which can tell us when thhat civilization was started, or ended.      If we don't find a lot of artifact then we do not know a lot about that certin civilization. Take  the Cliff Dwellers as an example, they did not leave a lot of artifacts, therefore we know almost nothing about them.      As you can see, artifacts play a very important part in uncovering the history on lost civilizations. The more artifacts we; find the more we konow about the civilization. the less artifacts uncovered; the less we know about that civilization.

Most people are fascinated by the civilation from the past. They are fascinated because they want to know more things about and know how it became a lost city in the first place. Artifacts are important becuase it left behind facts and some evidence that we need to know about this. There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the water. Although i think it is important because its great histroy .We can prove the myth. The dates are from 2800-1200B.c before glory days of grease. I think this was an actual city.

For example the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550 . They were known as as Blasketmakers for their skill at at craft. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages . They learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrows for weapons .

They teach us about the past and how different their times were compared to ours. Our cultures and the way we live are different as well. We don't really use our natural resources as much as they did. They had hand written and string calenders, underwater cities, and much more! Although the archaeologists had hard times getting all this information I'm glad that they did because it explains a lot about the past. In the time period we're living in now, we use resources such as gas, oil, and coal. They used their trees, soil, dirt and other things to get by. This is why the discoveries of these amazing places are important to us.

Over time artifacts begin to fade away or become destroyed. weathering and erosion are a very big part of this. if an artifact is found that is eroded, nothng is learned about that civilization. exceptionally, preserved artifacts are a very important find as it shows the culture and prosperity of the civilization.         Ancient Inca is mostly known for its oral history because the artifacts that are found are either badly ruined or not very understandible. Many artifacts are found burried in sand or in graves. The dry climate in Peru helps to keep these artifacts preserved.          There is also other civilizations that are very known, such as Atlantis. This place was mostly a myth until a diver in Greece came across an underwater city. This city is believed to be spread out 30,000 miles uner the ocean. Courthouses, streets, religios structures and thousands of shards of pottery were revealed. Being the oldest town semerged under water, it is also very well preserved and tells about the everday lives of the peole that lived there.            Archeologists are still finding many artifacts located in these spots and continue searching, in hopes to find more about the people that lived there.

The people who go and actually find the artifiacts they have to take a task. The task they go through they have to be very careful.           In acient Inca they had no way of formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives of historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored rope to keep track of their livestock.           The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archarologists have found the stings with knots in them before, but no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.           There have been lots of clues left behind by the Inca. Such as portraits of their religon, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying the remains the atcharologists can piece together some of the ways that Incas' lived. They also have heard differnt stories about the Inca.            The fall of the Inca is easy to date beacause the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The area where they lived had long been inhavited by different peoples. Arvhaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world the discover more about the Inca's predecssors.

You find about the religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.            Archaeologists confirm historical record. Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it. Some Inca textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well. Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that the experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died and how they lived.            Puebloans known as basket makers for their skill at the craft began to lead a more settled way of life. They replaced hunting and gathering for farming as there main livelihood. They learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. The basket makers began building houses above ground from pole and mud. Later on they advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Pottery also changed, from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Cliff dwellings tell of a persons adept of building, artistic in their crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land.            Pavolopetri, the sunken  settlement dates back some 5,000 years is considered a planned town, that's why it is unique. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. What took the investors by surprise was the discovery of a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, which also suggests that the town had been used by an elite, and automatically raised the status of the settlement. 'It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied,' said Elias Spondylis. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece.            The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important. There are a lot of things that are still yet to be discovered. Archaeologists are still searching and finding things right this very moment.

Do you wonder why some historical discovers are so important?There are three very important discoveries such as the Inca,the Puebloans,and the Pavlopetri.          The discovery of the Inca civilizations was important for several different reasons. They did not have a formal alphabet or system of writing instead they made knots in colored string called quipus.Quipus were used as a calendar to keep a count of there livestock.The first Europeans were surprised that the Inca ran there huge empire by using strings to keep records.The stories that were tied into the strings,will probably never be understood.Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion,art, and architecture,agriculture,government, transportation, and there way of life.We also know some of there stories because the Europeans wrote down when they first arrived to the empire in 1532. Historians have to be cautious when they interpret the writings.Some of the information may not be accurate plus some of the Inca stories were legends.Some Inca sites have been looted and taken because they are valuable.The fall of the Inca was known because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king om 1532 and took over the empire.These are some of the reasons why the Inca's are important.            Next,The discovery of the Puebloan civilization was important for several different reasons.About 1,400 years ago, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde to live at.The first Ancestral Puebloans were known as Basketmakers for the crafting skills.They lived in pithouses inside of small villages usually built on mesa tops or cliff recessed.They made pottery and efficient weapons for hunting.By 750 A.D there population multiplied so they started to build there houses above ground instead of below.They changed there building skills to stone masonry which was building houses our of stone.There population soon reached more then one thousand causing them to change there living style to a compact village with many rooms.The Puebloans baskets declined in quality because pottery became widespread.They worshiped in Kiva's or ceremonial rooms.Kiva's were used for healing rites such as praying for rain,hunting, and good crops. Ancestral Puebloans built dwellings beneath overhanging cliffs which they lived in for less then 100 years.Mesa Verde became deserted.The main theory why it became deserted is because of possible migration.There was a possible land depletion. After they left the moved south to  New Mexico and Arizona.This is why the Ancestral Puebloans are important.            Finally,the Pavlopetrians are a Ancient Greek team that learn about Greece. They are a group of archaeologists and marine geologists who studied Greece.A sunken settlement that dates back to about 5,000 years ago was discovered by a British oceanographer 40 years ago.It is called Atlantis because of Plato had a allegorical tale about a sunken continent.Dr.Jon Henderson said 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world' because it has remains dated back from 2800 to 1200 BC long before the days of classical Greece.There are older sunken sites but none of them seem to be planned towns such as Atlantis.Atlantis is 30,000 square meters on the bottom of the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese.It is believed to be consumed by the sear around 1000 BC.The exploration revealed a world of builds and courtyards and many more things.'Atlantis was a myth...' said Sakellariou.This is why the Pavlopetrians are important.            In conclusion,There are three very important discoveries such as the Inca,the Puebloans,and the Pavlopetri.There are many more reasons that are being discovered or have not been discovered yet.Although these are important discovery's there are many more waiting to be discoveries by society and history.

Scientists have been trying to find information on this mysterious empire.             The Inca had no written system, however; scientists have still been able to find clues about the Incan civilization. Some of what we have find out comes from stories passed through generations. Most of what we know about the Inca came from artifacts and sites where the artifacts were discovered. Archaeologists have found objects made from materials such as stone, pottery, silver, and gold. Scientists know the Incans believed in afterlife from artifacts buried in graves. Scientists have found textiles and clothing that has survived through the generations. Many of the sites discovered have been looted by treasure hunters, although some sites have still been useful to scientists. Many artifacts and sites fit with the Spanish accounts of the Inca.             In conclusion, it is impossible to know everything about the Incan Empire. What we have learned though has been good information for our world history. I expect much more to be learned about our world's past.

They belived in an afterlife, spirits, and other agicultrial belifs. They used thread of assorted colors to keep record of things, like a calender, or codes. They had made bueatiful empires, and had made them of stone. Some people call them Anasazio, a navajo word meaning 'the acient ones', or 'the acient enimies'.  The Spanish had arrived in  1532. The Incas befriended them, thinking they were gods, serving them with gold. Then after the being befriended by the Incas, they had taken over the empire, killed the last Incan king, and took all of their gold. Now the Incan empire now lays in ruins, only bits and peices discovered, noone knowing the ways and meaning of the Incas.

If not then you should because this or importent fact you should know. Well even if you don't know i will help you to know the importent fact.        This are some fact of Ancient Ince. The Ince of  Peru didn't real have a alphabet or system of writing. They didn't leave nothing for us to study about. So you may think then how we know about there civilzation for hundred's of year's ago well that easy they left clues like religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government , transportation and way of life. Well some of what we know about them came form oral history or stories passed down from generation to generation. We know some of this stories because they were written by the Europeans who arrived in the emire in 1532. People who study these site keep careful records. People may say then what happen to them well the Spaniards murdered the last Ince king in 1532. Well that all we know about them so far but archaeologists are still trying to find every thing about them but there are just so little we know.        Some facts of the Mesa Verde. About 1,400 years ago a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for thier home. But in the late A.D. 1200's in the spain of a generation or two they left their homes and moved away. Archeologists call this people Anasazi and it mean's the 'the ancient ones'. They are real skill at crafting. In A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, during the classic period the popuation had growen several thousand. About A.D. 1200 another major population shift saw people begain to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancesrors centuries before. In the classic period of A.D. 1100 to A.D. 1300 the Ancestarl Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous cicilzation whose accomplishment in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America. Kiva is like a churches to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. Thats all we know about them for now.        Some facts of the Lost City of Atlantis. One day a diver explores the sunken settlemant beneath the water off sourthen Greece. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths the fable of Atlantis thats have been brought to light from benath the water off southen Greece. Dr Jon Henderson said that is the no doudt  the oldest submerged town in the wrold. It has been remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the classic Greece. The site which straddles is 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off of the southen Pelopnnese, that it is believed to have been consuned by the sea around 1000 BC. Although discovered by a British oceanographer spme 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists aided by diital tecnology were able to proerly survey the ruins Whta the found surpassed all expections. Thanks to shifting sand and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a wroid od buildings, counrtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. IN addition the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. Well thats all the know about the Lost city of Atlantis. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN NNP NNP . CC DT NNP NNP .

Instead, they used knots in string to record data and history. To this day, we have not learned the translation of these knots in English. Scientists have recovered the diaries of the Spanish, and have learned the stories of the Inca. This information can be deemed 'unreliable' due to the fact that the Spanish did not know the Inca language very well, so the stories could be misinterpret or not  translated right. This is a mystery that scientists still don't know the answer to.

But anyways the lost city of atlantis has been looked for over a million times but no one has seem to find any clues until this year. I think they will find out what happened to the lost city. with all of the tchnology we have today we should be able to find it. When we find it we would be happy becouse they need to stop talking about it.

There have been some major discoveries in Inca, the peubloans, and in palopetri.         Inca is known for the unknown of when they made knots in colored string , actually no one knows why they did that either.The clues left behind from the people have displayed good evidence about their religon, transportation, and their way of life. These clues were left behind were from when they ruled the South American empire that rivaled the expanse of  ancient rome.        The peubloans are known for making baskets because they had very high skill at the craft. They mainly farmed alot to get there food. There small villages consisted of  'pithouses' in which they lived. Some ancient people lived in the cliffs known as 'cliff dwelling' , for over 100 years.         Palopetri is a place where a sunken settlement dates back more than 5,000 years ago. Divers have went down deep into the peloponnese wtaers to discover that sunken ship. The divers probly wouldn't have found what they've found today if it wasent for the shifting sands.         All these civilizations are very significant in there own way.

As archaeologists un cover more and more items they find out that the people in these comunities knew math just like us. They used math for so many things such as the calender, they figured out that theres three-hundred sixty days in a year. they also found that they used colorful string to keep track of cattle and other items. Archaeologist found ancient structures that turned out to be the houses they lived in over 3,000 to 5,000 years ago. They also unearthed tools and paintings that show they had a religion, agriculture, a water system and suwers that were used dayly in their every day life. Now we know how smart and brilient they ounce were, all we can do now is keep digging and find more artifacts.

We have learned throughout the years about where they lived, how they lived, and what they looked like. Through all these discoveries we learn something new. When these people had lived the advancements in their technology. In A.D. 500 to A.D. 750 people lived in pithouses. In other discoveries we have found ancient ruins under water.       From these discoveries we can learn more about us and our earth. Its crazy, that without all the technology we have today, they could still have such advanced technology and understanding about everything. Many things were passed on to us and without these discoveries the world would not be what it is today.

This Article will be about the ancient Inca and Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing.            So how do we know about a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expansion of ancient Rome.we know some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. the visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. they described the Inca in letters and diaries.historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. they may not have understood what the Inca told them so there descriptions may not be accurate.               about 1,400 years ago long before Europeans explored north America a group of people living in the fore corners region chose mesa Verde for their home.Mesa Verde national park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture.Archeologist have called these people Anasazi from a Navajo word sometimes translated as the ancient ones or ancient enemies.

There were cluesleft by the Inca. Like an amazing portrait of their religion.Art and many more things. From architecture to agriculture. Government and transportation, and their way of life. And studying these clues led to a great discovery. We learned more about the Incas and the way they lived, thanks to the clues they left behind. We were able to make conclusions, and learn many more things about them. They are a trully amazing group of people. Their thoughts were amazing, their way of life, their way of thinking. It was all great, and we know it all thanks to what they left behind for us.         Interacting with these clues is very dangerous. Historians have to be extremely careful when handling these products. They are hundreds of years old, and can be broken easily. Thanks to our paciense and determination we have been able to learn many things. But we have to be careful, also for us, because of the diseases they could carry. Who knows where they put those things they left. And we must be even more careful for living organisms that could be on them. It is amazing how many things can be leanred from just tiny pieces of history. We learn things about them, but we also learn from them. We learn about their ways of life, we learn from history, we learn from doing.

They did made something called quipus  which were knots with colored strings in order to record a calendar to keep a number of livestock. The first Europeans to discover that the Inca used knots to keep a record were really surprised. Recent studies from archaeologists have discovered many quipus but not know what they actually mean. In understanding the Ancient Inca, its like understanding a mystery without many clues.   A useful thing that has helped us identify their religion, art, architecture, government, transportation, and many more are clues that were left behind. Most of what we know about it is because of oral history, which was a fantastic war to keep a cummunity's history. Spanish soldiers and priests were able to describe the Inca by diaries and letters.Since the Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language, it makes it hard for historieans to interpret the accounts. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts that were left behind.   Something we know about the Inca is that they lived high in the Andes and worshiped mountain peaks. Many Inca were buried in case/mountain tops, which helped to preserve the sites. Expert mountaineers are high-altitude archaologists which work really hard because of looters. They have to go through colds because of freezing mountains!       Mesa Verde Nationa Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World       Mesa Verda National Park serves as a wonderful, fantastic reminder of ancient culture,(now called Anazi) and is translated as 'ancient enemies' or 'ancient ones'. In about A.D. 1000 Mesa Werde's people advanced! Pottery changed now on a white background. Then by A.D. 1300 its population reached to several thousand.During summer, fires were built for cooking, then in the winter the alcove rooms were uncomfortable and alcove rooms. Ancestral Puebloans lived in dwellings for about 100 years! By A.D. 1300 Mesa Verde was sadly deserted. There are many theories for the people's migration, most likely because of social and political problems.       Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets       Atlantis was explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologits have been studying thesunken settlement of the times of Homer's heroes. The site is about 30000 square metters of ocean off the southern Pelopomnsese. Although the settlement was discovered by a British oceanographer, it was this year that it was aided by digital technology! This exciting search revealed courtyards, rock-cut tombs- religious structures, and building. A question still needs to be answered, why did the settlement sank? Marine-geologists have to work in the questions and still need to answer.Overall,  Atlantis is a wonderful myth that may keep going and discover more about underwater exploration going! Who knows what may be discovered in your lifetime!

Alll of them are now lost , but with the help of archaeologists, we were able to find very good details and key information about these civizatins. How they lived, what they ate, or what type of culture did they had. Ancient Inca lived in Desserts and in very high mountain tops, fropm that we can infer  that they were nomadic and farmers. They obviously didnt spend much time on their homes, since they didnt have time for that.   The first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde settles in there for the farming. There , they seemed to have a lot of resourses , hinting archaetects that they stoped form being nomadic to living a more settled way of life.   In the lost city of Greece, the location was were made it so special. It is the oldest city that is underwater. Thought its discovery created huge exitement, to actually explore it was very difficult task.  The underwater city  is very hard to get to. Since it was underwater, archaeologists couldnt say much about the city since it had no terrain to explore.   All tell seem similar in a way, but all were very diffrent.

I think it is impotant because it shows you what they wored, how they lived, and the traditions they had. Some interesting facts aboout the Incas is that they had to were cloths and they didnt have a written language so instead they had to use strings to communicate. Also when they died they were burried in the top of a icy mountain.       Some interesting thing about the Puebloands, is theat they were very talented and they created many tools and did many artistic things. For example, they lived in something the created called Pithouses. That was an invention that consisted of a living room that was underground and the firepit had an air deflector. Next they created a Kiva, it consisted of a ventilator, bench, air deflector, fire-pit, sipapu, and a pilaster. Those are some of the things they created.       The Pavlopetris were very important part of the ancient civilization because they lived underwater and that is very fasinating.

All of them are important because they all have something to do in the past. The Inca made knots in colered strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livesstock.Also the first Europeans to meet th Inca were amased that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Puebloans were  known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. For the Pueblons farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livehood.                                                 The Inca form many ancient portraits of their religion art and architecture, agriculture, goverment transportation and way of life. They could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Puebloans lived in pithouses clustered in a small villages usually built on mesa tops. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more effecient weapon for hunting. After that they begin to build houses one against another in a long curving rows often with a pithouse or two in front.

To record the days in the calendar the Inca made knots in colored strings. No one could understand how they reads the colorful strings. Many things where left behind by the Inca for example. their religion, their are, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of living. We know about their clothes styles because their clothing is well preserved and is in good conditions. The Inca left many treasures that are very valuable. Many photoghraphs ere also found and notes.                        In southern Greece a city was found underwater. Many clues were found that there once was a city in there. A team of archeologist and marine geologist explored and found many information. They found ceramics that are atleast 5,000 years old.

Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architrcture, agricuture, govermentm and ways of life, By these clues archaelogist and others can learn about the Inca's. The inca's lived hugh in the Andes abd many have even worshiped some mountain peaks.

Some Inca textiles and clothing have survived. Usually, Ancient material like cloth are destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry desert on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Also, several Inca sites have been disturbed by the treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today.  The Inca lived in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. As the years pass by many discoveries, and facts about the Inca have been discovered.            The first Ancestral Puebloans were in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. This Puebloans were known as Basketmakers because of their crafting skills. Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for almost 100 years. Mesa Verde was deserted by about A.D. 1300. After some time, Puebloans migrated and there's several theories that caused it. When the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south to New Mexico and Arizona, settling with their kin who were there already. Many of our tribes are descendants  of the Ancestral Puebloans.            The sunken settlement beneath the waters of southern Greece, known as Pavlopetri were explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. Their findings were a surprice to all of them. The exploration reveled a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights in the workings of Mycenaean society. This is how we have been discovering about this important societies.

The artifacts found and discovered can help teach us about their way of life from long ago. The discoveries are crucial to our history.          One of the important discoveries archaeologists have made is about the ancient Inca of Peru. They had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Because of this, there are no written artifacts that historians can study. But, there are other things that we can learn from. The Inca made colored knots and put them in a string to record the calendar to keep count of their livestock. These colored strings are called quipus. Although archaeologists have found these quipus, it is very difficult to figure out what they mean. Alot of what we know about the Inca has peen bassed down orally, or through stories that have been passed down from generation to generation. We now know of the stories because of the Europenas. When they arrived in the Incan empire in 1532, they recorded and wrote down what they heard. So, even though we have no written references from the Inca themselves, we have references from the Europeans. Most of the artifacts that historians find that the Inca left behind, are made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. The reason they made their tools from those materials is because they last a long time and are very durable, which is why we can still dicover them today.          Discoveries have also been made about the Puebloans. Long ago, before even the Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in a region called the Four Corners, chose Mesa Verde for their home. For over 700 years, they and their descendants lived and reproduced here. They eventually started building communities of their own and sheltered themselves and their families in alcoves of canyon walls. Then, sometime during the late A.D. 1200s, they left their homes behind and moved away. The National Park of Mesa Verde preserves a reminder of the acient culture of the Puebloans. Archaeologists have discovered many interesting things about them, and have even called them Basketmakers, because of their crafty skill. They had once been nomadic, and moved from place to place often, but they were beginning to lead more permanent lives. Instead of hunting, they began farming and gathering food. They all lived together in what is called pithouses and were clustered into small villages of amny groups of people. They acquired the skill of pottery, bow and arrow making, and even started to make spears for spearing fish. For a very long time, they were doing reallty well, and the population continued to grow larger. By the time A.D. 1000 the Puebloans of Mesa Verde had advanced their skills from adobe construction, to the skill of stone masonry. Another thing that changed for the better was pottery. It used to be plain and simple, but now, it was detailed and even had interesting designs on it. Somewhere between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, the population may have reached about several thousand people. This time period is known as the Classic Period.          The last empire that has given archaeologists many things to study and learn from would be the Pavlopetri. The settlement of this group of people is now sunken beneath the waters off southern Greece. It is known as a lost city because it is now underwater. It also may have inspired one of the world's most fascinating myths, the fable of Atlantis. This settlement dates back some 5,000 years. People have also said that this may be the oldest town submerged under water. The settlement is said to have been consumed by the sea somwhere around 1000 BC. It was discovered by a British oceanographer about 40 years ago. What him, and many other people discovered from this settlement beneath the sea was far more than they had expected. Because of the shifting sands and the encolsure of the stellemt, it protected the bay. The town underwater revealed many buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and even religous structures. But there was more. Along with all of that, the seabed was covered with thousands of shards of broken up pottery that was once created by the Pavlopetri. The cermics that they found is said to have dated back to the stone age. That dicovery suggests that the settlement was occupied 5,000 years ago. This particular settlement is significant because as a submerged city, it was never again reoccupied after the Pavlopetri. The settlement dicpvered is extremely important to our hisotry because it is the first sunken city that has been found in Greece.          In conclusion, there are many important dicoveries that have been made, with the help of three interesting empires : the ancient Inca of Peru, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. With all the dicoveries that have been made, archaeologists have been able to learn so much from what they have seen.

The discovery of the Incan Empire was very important for researchers because it shows us that they were able to keep track of an entire empire just by using strings called quipus. The Incans also lived in  mountain ranges like the Andes. Since it is very hard to to scale the mountains it was very hard for attackers to be able to reach them. The next ancient civilization is the Puebloans.          Puebloans were very intenlligent for their era in which they lived. It was such an important find for researchers because they had superb architectural skills, in which they built very elaborate communities made of stone and alcoves that kept them secure and safe in the canyon walls of Masa Verde. The Puebloans were also very skilled in the hunting trade. They first used an atlatl which threw spears, later on they built a very high tech bow and arrow, for their time, to hunt. These peple also excelled in the art of pottery and wall building, they created large stone masonry and they also painted with more color and art than just painting a single color. The next important find was the city erected by the Greeks.          Pavlopreti was an underwater city spotted by a team of marine geologists. This city is so important because it dates back to over five-thousand years ago and is one of the oldest submerged towns of all time. The importance of this town is that most of its buildings and houses are intact. This helps the researchers see the beautiful and brilliant Greek architecture. When they were close enough to the city they could see buildings, courtyards, tombs, main streets, and religious buildings, most of them were not destroyed and still stood tall. The team found pottery scattered all over the ground and when they researched them, the pots dated back one thousand and two hundred years before their first assumptions on how old this city was.         All of these civilizations are very impotant because it shows us what our race as humans have excelled in and what new technology each one of them have found. The Incan are important because it shows us that they could keep an entire empire in conrol with strings called quipus. Puebloans are important because of their advances in architecture. Finally underwater city called Pavlopreti was such an important because of their planning of the city and the architectural skills of the Greeks. All of these ancient civilizations show you how skilled and advanced they were for their time.

It will help us show what these societies did wrong and right and we can learn how to better ourselves and our communities.         The Incans were one of the first discoveries.  Ancient Incans used string as their tool to keep records if thing in their society.  To be able to run a society with strings and no words is an amazing accomplishment for a primative society.  Since the Incas also live in the Andes Mountains so archeoligists could learn how their community survived on the side of a mountain.  Even though Incans were a primitive society they could adapt and survive to their environment.        The Ancestral Peubloans became nomadic and replaced their hunting and gathering with farming.  This helps us prove that in any situation their society can change when it needs to.  In their houses they have a firepit that had an air deflecter which meant that it was harder for the fire to be blown out.  This helps us show how even back then human life was intelligent enough to build a working mechanism that them live in harsh weather.        The Pavlopetri were a team of archeoligists and marine geologists that explored Atlantis that ahd been suken beneath the water for centuries.  The sunken city dated back to about 5,000 years ago.  This team Found one of the oldest submerged towns in the world.  Due to shifting sand it preserved this remarkable artifacat and the team found An entire city with courtyards, buildings, churches, and even rock-cut tombs.  This evidence helps use prove that if a civilization could be preserved for thousands of years then we can do the same.       In conclusion the importants of finding these civilizations are cruscial.  The Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri help us make our society better by studying what we did wrong and choosing the right descision.

They had no form of alphabet or any system of writing.This then was very hard to figure out the colorful strings that they had. This was probably their way of communicating however to us we can not understand it and we can not discover much through this. However they do have clues left behind by the Incas. They had a wonderful portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Through these clues we discover more about the Incas and their way of life. The Incas were also a civilization for nearly a hundred years. Those years were 1438 to 1532. We also learn from the Incas from their oral history, or from stories passes down from generation to generation. We know some of these stories because they were written down by the Europeans. They arrived in the empire in 1532. Also the Spanish soldiers and priests described the Incas in things such as diaries or letters. However a problem with this is that the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language very well so historians have to be quite careful when dealing with this to know what they say or mean.       The Inca king was murdered in 1532 and the Spaniards took over the empire. However the origins are hard to trace before this. There was other different people that lived there before and archaeologists have to be careful to know which things are to which certain people.       Many of the Incas sites are in remote, high places. This is because they lived high in the Andes and is said that the may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. This is where some of the Incas were buried. Looters can not get here so it can preserve their sites. However even for archaeologists they have to be expert mountaineers to get up there. This is is a great place to fund them though.The cold isolates their bodies so they are in very good shape and can easy be used for scanning to know how they died. Also these bodies are good for revealing information about how they lived and overall helps archaeologists study more about their kind.       Mesa Verde National Park       Long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living Four Corners chose Mesa Verda for their home. This was about 1,400 years ago. They lived there for more than about 700 years and their descendents also lived there and eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. In the late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved away.       The Mesa Verde National Park however preserves a reminder of this ancient culture. Archaeologist call these people Anasazi. This was form a Navajo word translated as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies. Today we call them Ancestral Puebloans. This reflects their modern descendants.       The first ones settled in Mesa Verda in about A.D. 550. They were formerly nomadic but they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. This was when farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They also started to live in pit houses clustered into small villages. These were often built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. Then they started to learn to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. This was a more efficient weapon for hunting than a spear thrower.       In about A.D. 750, they started to begin building houses about ground. With Upright walls made of poles and mud.From then on these people would be known as Puebloans. This was a Spanish world meaning 'village dwellers.'       Then by A.D. 1000 the people in Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe constitutions to skillful stone masonry. They had wall of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stores high. They were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. At this time pottery also changed. It changed from a simple design on a dull gray background to a black drawing on a white background.       The cliff dwellers of Mesa Verda left and traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona. They settled among their kin who were already there.       Lost Greek City- Atlantis           The fable of Atlantis has been brought to light beneath the waters off southern Greece. It was explored by an Anglo- Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. The sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going' says Sakellariou. He also states that less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed.

Discoveries about the Incas include artifacts left behind, Spaniards' accounts of what the Inca were like, and stories originally told by the Incas that have been passed down from generation to generation. Some archaeologists have even found bodies preserved by the icy Andes mountains that they have been able to exam and find out why these people died.   Discoveries about the Ancestral Puebloans include many things found in the area they lived in, which is now Mesa Verde. Archaeologists have found that the Puebloans used to live in pithouses and that they used to be nomadic, but settled in Mesa Verde and replaced hunting and gathering with farming.      The discovery of the underwater city was a huge discovery for the Pavlopetri. It told archaeologists more about how these people used to live and how their everyday lives were. Archaeologists were also able to determine how old the city was and when and why it went underwater.

They used strings, or quipus, to keep count of population, amount of animals they had, crops, and even days of the year just through these colorul strings. They lived in pithouses and, by A.D. 1100, their population may have reached several thousand. Although no one knows what the quipus says, we can infer and keep looking for new artifacts. These people are important due to my research.

Like the myth of Atlanis come true. There have been a multitude of lost cities found over the years. Painting the picture of our past, intriging people everywhere. Three examples of lost civilizations are Ancient Inca, the Ancestral Puebloans, and the underwater lost greek city.            To begin, the lost civilations are very interesting. First the Ancient Inca, they were a thriving civilization with record keeping, tombs, temples, burial grounds, ect. So what happened to them? The spaniards may have had someing to do with it but no one knows for sure. Second the Ancestral Puebloans, they moved from the home in Mesa Verde but then went back years later. What happened there? Lastly the underwater city, this town was marvelous courtyards, buildings, streets, tombs, and even religious structures. What caused the city to sink? How did it just all of a sudden dissappear? In conclusion, finding these cities is like sovling a puzzle, and even today we are still trying to fit the peices together.            All in all these lost cities are still mysteries amd are still bringing questions up today. What would you do or think if all of  sudden you stumbled upon a city like Atlantis? That could be you.     	NNP NNP NNP PRP VB EX RB VBP VBN NNS .

Their ancestors devoleped many ideas that amricans use today! ideas on farming and pottery told us alot about their socity. they also knew how to make bows, they used them for hunting.          In about A.D. 550, the first Peubloans settled in Mesa Verde. Normadicly they they were begging to lead a more settled way of life. Hunting was replaced with farming, &amp; gatheringas their main livelihood. A good hunting wepon they made was known as the atlatl, or a sper thrower.          In about A.D. 750 they started to build homes above the surface. homes with upright walls made of poles and mud. The homes were oftenly built together in long curving rows. Their were often their were often pithomes or two in front. From then on they were known as peubloans or 'village dwellers.'           Between 1100- 1300 A.D. during the classsic Period, population reached several thousand. Mostly concentrated In  compact villages of many rooms, often with the kivas(,pithomes that evolved, ) that built the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. In about 1200 A.D. another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff  alcoves that shelterd their ancestors centuries before. Nobody knows why they made this move.            In the end, when the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left they travled south into new mexico onad arizona. they settled among their kin who were already there. whatever happened, some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes are decendants of the ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde. they were very special to our history so we can learn and grow from what they did.

There have been findings of artifacts, lifestyles, and how people lived and survived. How archeologists found, studied, and learned about each civilization is all included.       The Inca's are a lot difficult to study because they had no real evidence to help with every finding of their civilization.There is no evidence of the alphabet or writing,they used stings to record things. Archeologists learned about the Incas from clues given from their oral history,old stories,and Inca artifacts. One of the biggest finds for the Inca civilization is found in the Ande Mountains where they found bodies that reveal info about how they lived and died.       The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde, they were known as Basketmakers.They built most of their settlement and made mostly everything they used.They used nature to their advantage and built dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs.They lived in cliff dwellings less than 100 years then went to New Mexico and Arizona settling among family.       The Pavlopetri is an underwater finding under Greece.This is important because it makes the Atlantis story a bit more true and interesting.It also makes the first sunken city to be found in Greece that predates Plato.

Thanks to civilizations such as the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri we now know how they lived, what many of there customs were, but most importantly, how they survived. Knowing how other civilizations lasted and what caused their downfall is what will help today's society to survive. But there are other useful pieces of knowledge left behind that can teach us new and different ways on how to live. All of these societies were unique, and all have impacted us in some way, shape, or from.   The Incas were a daring, advanced, and quite smart culture that built their settlements atop high mountains, so as to protect from any invaders. Although they still eventually faded away, the impact left was enough for us to study. Showing very advanced knowledge in the areas of math and architecture, the Incas created temples that exceeded and researchers limited imagination. Only visible from the sky and on certain days, some Inca temples show amazing patterns using the stars and sun, and this allows us to realize how important the sky was to them. Knowing this we may learn more about our own universe, from a culture that survived almost 600 years ago.   The Pueblans were quite a contrast from the Incas, dwelling mostly in caves and focusing on basketry. But they too, impacted our society. They showed a new and quite innovative way of living that baffled but also amazed those that first saw it, and still does today. There strange customs and homes have show that every civilization is different in their own unique way, and to compare to societies is like comparing apples to oranges.   The Pavlopetri may yet to be the most strange yet wondrous find ever. This glorious lost city was swept under the mighty ocean years ago, and only recently have we been able to study its mysterious  past. The most magnificent and rich city and that surpassed all expectations has shown that even 5,000 years ago, this civilization was more advanced than some today. Although the ocean provides challenges for excavating this underwater mystery, science has exceeded this limitation and we can know thoroughly investigate and learn all that we can. This rare new find has shown scientists around the world how advanced a culture can become over time.   Throughout the history of the Earth, countless societies have existed together, always wondering and always researching. But only recently have we discovered new more exciting things thanks to the advancements we have today. Because of the scientific discoveries, many researchers today know more about the past than ever before.

We have been greatly given clues and the understanding of the world before us.  By these amazing discoveries we are able to know what we started from, because I know we are all curious.  It uncovers the mystery of our past and shows us the sophistication and brilliance of those who came before us.  By leaving behind, scrolls, clothes, drawings, religous artifacts, journals, tablets, and food, we are able to discover our ancestors way of life.

Finding these cities will help us understand how much humans have come along in the past few thousand years.        The ancient Greek city of Pavlopetri is a very unique city because it is one of the oldest and only submerged cities and it is the oldest planned city. Scientists believe that the city was submerged in around 1000 BC. Some artifacts were found that were created as old as from 2800 BC. The youngest of Artifacts that were found are suspected to have been made in 1200 BC. The Submerged city of Pavlopetri is a very unique city as it is the oldest planned city. This doesn't even include it being submerged.        The ancient society of the Puebloans was a pretty important find. It is important to today's society to know where we started from. This society lived in pit-houses for about two-hundred years from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. These pit-houses were built on mesa tops and on cliff recesses. We also need to see how far we came along in tools and weapons. We evolved from using just bows, arrows, and spears for hunting.        We know what we know about the Inca's because of the Europeans who had taken over the Inca's and kept records. When the Europeans took over in 1532, they had written down information about the Inca's in letters and in diaries. This gives us a great deal of information even though archaeologists have to be careful when reading and translating these because the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language. We also found information through artifacts such as clothing, pottery, and more valuable items like jewelery. Some of the Inca treasures were stolen, however, by treasure hunters. Some of these artifacts may have been taken years ago or maybe even just yesterday.        In conclusion all three of these cities were very important finds for today's society. All three involve knowing where the human race evolved from in the last few thousand years and with this we can look at what we will evolve into.

Archaeologists, people who find ancient sites and artifacts, contribute their findings to enlighten us about history. For example, we now know about the Incans and a Greek city rumored to be Atlantis itself.                           Inca, a past civilization of Peru, left behind several clues to help archaeologists determine their everyday lifestyle. One of the things Incans left behind was quipus. Quipus was used by them to record the calender to keep track of livestock. These were made out of corlorful string. Another example of materials left behind would be textiles and clothing, but were remarkably well preserved in Peru's arid deserts or cold mountains. Not all artifacts left behind would be preserved well, however. In fact, some of the sites have been raided by thieves, who might take anything valuable. Another hinderance to finding certain Incan artifacts would involve Peru's geographical locations-cliff faces or mountain tops would be difficult to obtain Incan traces. As you can see, the Incans held a fascinating culture, and thanks to talented archaeologists, we know more about it.                     Long ago, the Puebloans were another gathering of people living close to the Mesa Verde region, before the arrival of European explorers. Other names for these people would be 'basketmakers', as they are good at crafting, and 'Anasazi', derrived from a Navajo word. The Puebloans were assumed to be gifted architecturally, because as their population multiplied, they started to build houses on ground level, containing upright walls, poles, and mud. 250 years later, their crafting skills advanced, and they now constructed strong stone masonry. The stone walls are often referred to as great architects.                      Have you ever heard of a myth telling of a secret underwater city? A lost Greek city discovered may have just been the thing that inspired the myth. Investigated by the Greek team of marine geologists and archaeologists-known as Pavlopetri, it is said the deep underwater ruins could date back to 5,000 years. The city was not always underwater. The site is believed to be consumed by the sea around 1,000 BC. This does not mean that everythig was lost. What marine archaeologists found shocked them. Revealed inside the sprawling ruins was a system of buildings, main streets, religious structures, tombs, and courtyards-not unlike what many of our cities have today. All of this was preserved well underneath the ocean's shifting sands and the site's enclosure in a protected bay. If it hadn't been for this, we might not know nearly as much about the find.                      Pieces of the past definitely do teach us different customs and culture. Without the help of archaeologists, we would certainly be 'left in the dark'. In conclusion, historic sites hold fascinating traces of other civilizations not too different than our own that we need to know more about.

Back in achene times of the Inca of Peru witch had no alphabet or form of writing instead they used knots in colored string called quips. The Inca used the quips to keep records of livestock and also as a calender. Other empires that came across their empire were shocked of what they used to keep track of every thing.       The Incas dident have wrote documents of there history they pasted there story's along verbally so they weren't all that accuert. The only written documents about them are from the Europeans in 1532 they were described in letters and diaries. The rest of our knowledge came from artifacts and objects left behind. some textiles and clothing have survived,ancient clothing uselly get dampen  and destroyed.       Archaeologists who study sites keep vary careful records they write down every thing and take many photos. Archeologist compare all the evidence  they get. Some times they confirm historical records. The most important thing about civilization are to know were they came from,what happened to them and and how they ended. The Inca empire ended when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king on 1532 . the origin of the Incas are much harder to find. The area were they resided was in inhabited by many people.      The Inca lived high in the Andes since they lived ion such a remote place looters couldn't get their easy to rade the toms. But this means its hard for excavation teams to get up there and dig to learn about them. scene they lived so  far up torweds the mounted peak it was vary difficult.      in conclusion the Incas were a fascinating race of humans they had a unite way of writing and keeping  record, thay lived in a variety of places in the words and were still learning new stuff about them to day .

First of all the importance to know about the past is greatly needed, this way we know from when and where we came from. Without them we wouldnt know about our origins. From all this research we have now found out how our ancestors lived their lives, built their homes, and how many of them kept records.

'... had no formal alphabet or system of writing.' However, the first Europeans to meet the Inca were strangely baffled that a huge empire can keep so many records. Some people, archaeologists, have found ancient quipus; they still don't know what those mysterious knots stand for.         There's great difficulty when discovering the past of many of the civilizations. Yet, they do with all the left over artifacts. Like buildings, stone walls, shards of glass, etc. Aside from all the artwork, there has also been plenty discoveries of technology that we have based on today. For example, the Kiva is known as a church where most of the ancestors worshipped in. This was naturally built for this purpose.         In the other articles, they mostly discuss the the difficulties of living in these societies.

Archeologists have found artifacts made of stone, pottery, gold, and silver from the Inca civilizations helping them in their knowledge in learning about the Incas. The Incas lived in the Andes Mountains, which was freezing, and bodies that were left behind froze and were preserved for archeologists to later find. These bodies later helped scientists learn about how they lived and what caused them to die. Ancestral Puebloans also were an important discovery for scientists because when they left, structures were left behind leaving archeologists to wonder about these peoples lives. These structures do tell us of people who adept at building, artistic in thier crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land. The lost city of Atlantis also is important to archeologists because archeologists have found ceramics and other artifacts dating back to the end of the stone age. These discoveries have benefitted archeologists in many ways in the learning of the old civilizations.

To begin, The rest of the knowledge of the Incas comes from artifacts,or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts might be objects made from stone,pottery,gold, or silver.Such materials last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years.Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings.Others are found buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.                      Further more, The most important things to learn about in civilization are where it came from and what happened to it. The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The origins of the Incas are more   difficult to trace.The area where they lived had long been inhabited by different people.Archaeologists have to be careful to make sure exactly which people built which site.archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques in the world to discover more about the Inca's predecessors.You'll see how aerial photography can help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they cannot see from the ground.                                                                                            In Conclusion, Anything they find has to be carried down the mountain for study.The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived.

Second,the Puebloans and their world times were also very important/interesting because,about 1,400 years ago,even before Euopeans explored North America,a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose mesa Verde for their home.For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here,eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls.Baskets show evidence of decline in equality,possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to the caft.              Third,the lost greek city of Puebloans brought civilans from the past have interesting and helpful products to tell us.Historians finding this lost city could give us clues as to what happened to earlier civilizations like its self.Important artifacts for civilizations to leave written documents,statues,religious artifacts,and clothes     Finally,all of this is very important places are extreamly interesting places to lean about!These lands are amazing and i love to re-read these articals over and over again!I hpoe I helped you out!

For one, they taught us a lot about ancient civilizations.       First off, the Inca tied knots in a colored string, called quipus, to record the calendar and keep track of livestock. When the first settlers came they were surprised that they had such a big city, and they kept record with string. Understanding the Inca has not been easy. Even though we've found many quipus, no one knows what the knots mean.        Secondly, the Peubloans built highly complicated stone buildings and structures. The Peubloans were very skilled in architecture and crafting. They also learned how to make bows and arrows, witch was more effective than a spear. There houses where sometimes multilevel and usually very complicated They had rooms for storage and were very efficient.       Lastly, are the Pavlopetri. The Palvopetri were ancient Greeks who built a city that got flooded and was only recently discovered. This city may have started the rumor of Atlantis.

The discovery of the Inca is very important to how this where done back then and how much we as humans have evolved into some thing greater, and what we have learned from these experiences. We can also learn from there mistakes and the messes that they made. if the Inca's where not fond there would be so much about thing that we did not now like the way they communicated with other they poke a lost language. the way they told story's they where told in knots this color but because no one to day can understand them they stay a mystery to all.       the first Europeans to meet this people where amazed  that this people could run and control a huge empire.and at the way they keep records with string. so gust to know a little dis of there information is a gift. Most archeologist are so fascinate the civilization lived for  hundreds of years and from fact seemed to be a rivlie of tone of the world most deadly empires the Rome empire. the Inca civilization lasted from (1438-1532) is one of the most amazing things.        so now you see that it is important to now where you are going to look bake to the last to see what we have done. that is why it is so respected to have information  and knowledge on thing's , because us as humans forget what we have learned.

Even though the Incas had no no formla writing, arcaeologists can piece together their history by what they left behind. We can learn from their art and architecture who they worshipped and how they survived. Many artifacts left behind where made from stone, pottery, silver, and gold which lasts a long time. Since these things preserve so well it can help histortians interrpret what may have happened to the Inca civilization.     The Indians of Mesa Verde help teach about the life before tye United States came from. The first Ancestrial Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. These people began building houses from poles and mud but eveolutianized into skillful masonary. As the civilization pregressed so did their skills with such things as pottery and aricitecture. Though the history of the pueblan sis vague we know that they traveled sout to live with their kind. These Indians helped tteach us about the very first people on North America.     The Pavlopetri are thought to have lived in the noew sunken city of the coast of Neapolis. The city has court yards houses nad many other modern day architecture. Whicvh makes us think that this civilization is more advanced then we think. This city teaches us about the past and how much we still don't know about are ancestors.

But what about the unknown holes in history? Who inhabited the Americas before Europe came over? Archaeologic discoveries provide us with evidence of the ancient people who once lived in the lands familiar to us.       Before Spain took over South America, the Incans lived in the Andes mountains. Archaeologists had difficulty finding information about them, as the Incans did not use written records. Instead of keeping a written record of people and livestock, the Incans used quipus, a collection of knotted strings. But we do have information about how they lived from clues left behind. For instance, there are terraces dug into the mountains. These were made by the Incans to farm on, due to the difficulty of living in the mountains. Also, statues and other carvings can tell us about their worship. Evidence uncovered that they had hundreds of gods!

They have been trying to figure out the past about the civilization, but since they can not translate there writing they can not understand what happened then. They have found artifacts but they have not figured out there language.The civilization was around since 1438-1532, the left behind ruins, pottery, gold,and clothing that has been preserved by the heat of the deserts and the cold of the mountains.            Many have asked,' how do we know so much about a civilization that was around for nearly 100 years, that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome that ruled the south American empire', well the answer to that is that we have been told stories of  this great civilization.We have been told of these great stories of the empire that sevived a lot of hard time, so what happened to this great civilization? The answer is that the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.           The Incas lived high in the Andes and may have even worshiped some mountain peaks. most of these sites are in highremote areas. when the Incas lived in the mountains they would be buried in caves in the faces of the mountains. This has helped to perserve the sites because of the cold.

There are many reasons that we need to study past civilizations for many reasons, to learn from their mistakes and learn where we got knowledge from our past.Reasons that we need to learn form our past is make sure that we don't make the same mistakes that lead to their to their downfall. For example the Incans had fallen because tey were to trust worthy with the Spanish and when the Spanish betrayed the Incas, they lost there king and their kingdom. Another important reason for studing a past society is to learn from our past and where we get our knowledge that we use today. For example, the Puebloans were a advanced people that were more injenuative because instead of being a simple hunter gatherer society they were very skilled farmers and had great craftmanship, which may explain why our modern day society is so successfull, with an ample food supply and advanced technology. These are both distinct important reasons that we need to study ancient civilizations so that we can advance our own.

The Incas artifacts are pretty hard to find because where they lived was very cold. This is also a good thing because they bodies of the dead people have been kept well up there. Left over things from the   Incas have shown they wore textiles, and made pottery.   The Plebeians were also very important to history because they were the first to live a more settle kind of life. They also acquired a better form of hunting with bows and arrows and also a atlatla a spear thrower, and also were very good with basket weaving and pottery.   The Pavlovian would be an important place to know, but historians are having a hard time trying to figure out what they do how they live, and where they come from.

What they don't understand is that these civilizations are apart of our history, and we want to learn what they learned back then, and to see how advanced they were back then. The Inca had no formal writing system and they didn't leave archives for historians to study. They did however, make quipus, which were knots in colored string to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. This lets archaeologists see how the Inca lived and how they kept track of stuff in their every day lives.   The Ancestral Puebloans are known as Basketmakers for their skill at craft. Archaeologists look at their crafts and homes to gather information about wehre they came from and how they lived in their environment. They study the pithouses that were found and the pottery and hunting tools that they used.   The secrets of the lost city of Atlantis has broght many archaeologists to Greece to study the oceans where the ancient city is said to have sunken in. The site that they have found staraddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor and is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. You would think that nothing is able to survive that long under water, and if it did it would be nowhere near the site in which it sunk. That is where you are wrong though. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, teh exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main street, rock-cut tomb and religious structrues. They also found that the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of potter. As you can see, the artifacts that they found can help us discover and understand past civilizations.

The discoveries help us learn the way of life in the past.Archaeologist  today study ancient architecture that was made by hand.                One reason is that learning everthing about ancient can tell us the secrets behind its civilization and generation. The Incas did not leave archives for hitorians to study, but they did have quipis wich were to record the calendar yo keep a cuont of livestock. Archaeologist have found many ancient quipis but it is a mystery to solve what the colorful each colorful knot means. Today we know about this civilizatoin because Incas left alot of clues behind in portraits and storeies that were told from generation to generation. Knowing the way they lived is important to us because it is a very valuble recourse.           Another reason is to know what was it like years ago in this ancient civilization. Such as living in Atlantis before sunken uderwater. Knowing by portraits or drawings can help us understand this. Archaeologist today are still invistigating in order to know.           This is why discovering and unlocking the truths about these ancient civilization is important for us.

Artifacts give archaeologists a clue about how ancient civilizations lived and what they did on a daily basis. With these clues, it helps us find out about our ancestors.             After finding Inca clothing while researching them, archaeologists get an idea  of what they wore and what types clothing symbolized different parts of the social structure. Clay work and buildings are huge discoveries to archaeologists. They get an idea of how they lived and what they built their homes with. The clay work shows them what they carried things in, and if they had artwork, what they worshiped. Letters and notes left from the Spanish after they conquered the Incas shows archaeologists what they experienced when they were there and how they died out.            The Mesa Verde Park in North America symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloans civilization. The park preserves the culture of the people and the place that they once called home. Archaeologists preserved the civilization so that it will be remembered and not just destroyed to make a new house community or shopping mall. The Anscetral Peubloans lived in small houses that were similar to tents called pit houses. Archaeologists discovered that they made pottery and used the bow and arrow. Their pottery contained black drawings on it and farming started to count more of their diet then before. In A.D. 1200, a large amount of the population shifted back into the cliff alcoves, which was a main area that was shown inside of the park. The Ancestral Peublans left no written records but their structure told of people who were artistic and skillful.             Anglo-Greek Archaeologists and marine geologists discovered the settlement known as Pavlopetri. The civilization is found on the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. Archaeologists discovered buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures inside of the sunken city. The city is said to be the oldest sunken structure and is where the tale of Atlantis came from. The Marine biologists are still trying to figure out how the structure sunk , but they think it was sea level changes, earthquakes, or a tsunami.              Artifacts are an incredibly important part of our past. If we did not have any left over, we would not know where we came from or what the past was like.

The objects left behind can give us new ideas and lead us to great discoveries. The buildings and art would inspire many great minds. These three civilizations, the Incans, Ancestral Puebloans, and the Greeks all had major impacts on today's society with their discovery.         The Ancestral Puebloans left behind their homes and other buildings, and their pottery and basketry. This tells us how they lived in their homes and what one of their arts was. We can see the type of pot change to see different trends, and when the quality of the baskets go  down we also see the quality of their pottery going up. all of this tells us many things, such as their cultural trends, and their changes in daily life.         The ancient Incans left behind no record of any kind except quipus, which were strings with knots in them.Quipus were used to record everything from the number of llamas a farmer had to the number of people in the empire. This was amazing to learn that they could run a whole kingdom with nothing but knotted string.         The sunken city of the Ancient Greeks shows that over 5000 years ago, we were capable of planed citys and large monuments. The impact of this discoverd city has sparked new intrest in searching for other sunken citys, because only one percent of the ocean floor has been explored.         These three lost civilizations are all important to modern society in the way their past lives impact ours, and how what they left behind has impasted us.

They are such for three reasons:knowledge, learning from the past, and history.           The reason knowledge is important is so we know the lives of the people at the time. For example, what they wore, used as weapons, and tools, did to pass the time, study math with, and also what they wrote.           Learning from our past is really important! Why learning is such is so we don't end up with another Hitler, or Kim Jung UN, Sudan Hussein, you get the point!!! We don't need another totalitarian military dictatorship claiming everyone except them are evil.           History is perhaps the most important reason that discoveries are important. 'Why?', you ask? Because it can help our children of this and future generations learn from the mistakes our ancestors made and help the world instead of hurting it.           So, now that this essay is complete, one would highly suggest that after reading this you look back to the mistakes of other people during significant events in history and learn from them. Don't let history repeat itself. 	PRP DT VBP IN JJ NNS VBP JJ , CC WRB VBP PRP RB JJ .

These artifacts which were well preserved tell us a unique story.  Whether it was on the daily life of a person in that time period or the religion they believed in.  Either way they both tell a story about the way of life in the past.  Artifacts that are found are very fragile and can be wroth a lot of money.  Most objects that are found are usually put in museums to preserve there history.  Artifacts can be very important because they can tell u something that you didn't know and can also tell you what might happen in the future.  These objects are very rare and are hard to find.  When they are found people are very exited to see something they might of never seen before. People spend there lives looking for some of these objects and they do not always find them.  They could end up rich from there finds or they can be found broke after wasting all there money on these projects.  Overall artifacts that are found are very important to telling us new and important things in life.  They tell us our past and maybe even whats to come, the future.  These artifacts tell a story and can be very interesting.  This is why these artifacts are important to society today.

Archaeologists and Geologists make much of this information possible. With many years of recording and confirming the information sources we now have a basic idea of the ancient civilizations known as the Inca,Greek, and Puebloans.               There are three civilizations that I will talk about that left clues to help us learn about their society.Ancient Inca is a civilization in South America that was alive for nearly a hundred years. The Ancient Inca used quipus to record information, although nobody direcly knows what they meant they are still a very important part of discovering who the Incas were. The Ancient Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde for over 700 years. Puebloans lived in pithouses began weaving baskets and sculpting pottery. Ancient Puebloans lived off of cliff dwellings but bcame desserted in the 1200's A.D. Some of the Ancient Greeks are sunken underwate. Some of the sunken civilizations date back about 5,000 years ago. A city called Pavlopetri covers about 30,000 square feet of ocean floor. There they found ancient building protected by a bay of sand. They found thousands of shards of pottery some that even date back to the Stone Age. These civilizations teach us very helpful information that helps us have a basic understanding of life in ancient civilizations.

They lived in pit houses which were when the living room sunk in a few feet in the ground then the ground supported the roof. They later evolved into kivas. There were a lot of basket makers in this time. Many people were known as Puebloans which is a Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers'        	DT JJ NNP NNS VBD IN NN NNP NNP VBD IN NN NNS WDT VBD WRB DT NN NN NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN RB DT NN VBD DT NNP NNP JJ VBD IN NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN NN NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNS VBD VBN IN NNP WDT VBZ DT JJ NN NN NN NNS POS	2		20131025141013	2461	2		20131025091004	2502	2

The Incas built knots in colored strings to record the calenda to keep a count of livestock called quipus. The Eupropeans were suprised when they found the Incas big empire. They were suprised bcause they never thought Incas could build this big empire and keep records by colored knots. Incas made stuff from stone, potery, gold, or silver. The Incas even made up their own language. The Incas lived high in the Andes and have maybe even worshiped mountain peaks. The Spanicards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. That was the fall of the Inca empire. The Spincards did not speakthe Inca language very well.                   The Puebloans are so important because 1,400 years ago Puebloans lived in the Four Corners region and lived there for over than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here. Eventually after, buildings elaborated stone communties in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. But then, in the late A.D. 1200's they left their homes and moved away. The mystery on why they left never got revealed, no one never found out why left. People lived in pithouses from A.D. 550 TO A.D. 750. They built a living room in their houses that sunk below the ground a few feet.They also used Kiva. Kiva is a Hopi word of ceremonial room. They used Kivas for healing ritesor to pay for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop. Later they were called churches.                 The Pavlopetris are so important because no one never knew that their city and live style was real. People thought it was a myth that there was a city underneath the sea that was once a city along time ago. When searching under the sea the explorers weresuprised at what they found. The exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. Also, the seabed was hiding thousands of shards of potterey. Exploerers found over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. They were very suprised at what else they found which was their discoverey of possible megaron, a monumetal structure with a large rectangular hall.

The Ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet system of writing.They did not leave archives for people to study.Instead the incas had quipus knots  in colored string to record the calendar and keep track of livestock.Archaeologists today found many ancient quipus's but didnt  know their meaning.Without anyone to read the stories in the colorful string quipus's i understanding it is just an ancient mystery.Clues left behind by the incas paitng a protrait of their religion ,art ,architecture,agriculture,government ,and way of life. By studing this archaeologists can peice together details of  Inca life.Some of the knowlege we have is passed down by oral history or stories passed dwn from one generation to the next.some of it also comes from the Europeans stories about the incas too.Inca stories where legends rather than history.The rest of our  knowlege comes from artifacts left by the incas, orsites where they lived or the artifact was found.There where a variety of artifacts that where founds like:objects made from stone ,pottery,gold,silver such materials lasted a long time even if they have been buried for hundreds of years.Some inca texiles and clothing have survived remarkably well.Ancient materials like clothes are usually destroyed by dampness but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Perus coast or the cold mountians of the Andes.Some inca sites have been disturbed by hunters or looters , who take anything that might be valuable;looted sites often do not tell archaeologists much.Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records.They need to learn as much from ever single peice of evidence.Among the important things to learn about a civilization is to learn about where it came from ans what happened to it.The fall of the Inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last Inca King in 1532 and took over the empire.Incas lived high in the Andes many of their sites are remote high places.this was good because a looter couldnt get to the bodies as easily but it makes the jobs of an archaeologist more difficult because they have to carry all of their equipment up the mountain and anything that can be studied has to be brought back down the mountain.The cold mountains act like freezers thast preserve bodies for medical scanning that can be used to find out how they lived.                   Ancesteral Puebloans:Mesa Verde National Park.   ?About 1,400 years ago , long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.The first  Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for'' green table'') about A.D.550.Tthey are known as basketmakers for their skill at craft.Formerly nomadic they where living a more settled life.Farming replaced huntingand gathering as their main livelihood.They bulit pit houses clustered into small villages usualy built on mesa tops but sometimes clipp recesses.They where fairly prosperous badsket makers,and their population multiplied.They bgen builing houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud.Between A.D.1100 and A.D. 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand.It  was made u p of mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the Kivas built inside closing walls rather than out  in open.Ever since local cowbys first reported the cliff dwellings  in the 1800's, archaeologists have sought to understand peoples's lives.We will never  be able to know the full story: they had  left no written  records  and tmuch that was improtant in their lives has perished.They tell of a people  adept at building, artistic crafts, and skillfull at making a living from difficult land.Using nature to their advantage , Ancesrtal   Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs.When the cliff dwellers left the traveled to New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who where already there.                   Lost greek city:Pavlopetri.   Explored by an Angelo greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known and Pavlopetri., the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and weath of details is unprecedent, expert say.'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,'' said Dr Jon Henderson, associate professor of underwater archaeology at the Nottingham.There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, Which is why it is  unqiue.This site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the sourthern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the see around 1000 BC. What they found surpassed all expeditions. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.More than any other underwater site so far,the find offers potential insights into the workings of the mycenaean society.''It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied,'' said Elias Spondylis, who co-directed the survey as the head of greece's underwater atiquities department.It is the first time a sunken city has been found in greece that predates time.

First what I will be talking about is why the INCAS, PUEBLOANS, PAVLOPETRI'S were so important.with that being said I will start the first paragraph talking about the INCAS.                The ancient inca of peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for the historians to study. The inca made nots  in colord strings called 'quipus' to record the calender to keep a count of live stock. The first europeans to meet the inca were a mazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Now I will talk about the PUEBLOANS.                The first Ancestral Pueblaons settled in Mese Verda about A.D. 550. they were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomatic, they were begining to lead a more settled way of life. They lived in  pit houses clusterd into small villages usually built on messa tops but somtimes in cliff recesses.Now i will tell you about the PAVLOPETRIS.                  In this paragraph i will tell you about the ancient civilization from the people known as the pavlopertis. Well first the arckiologist dicoverd over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. they also found that sqares are very usefull in the construcktin of the eiffel tower so yeah there pretty important. Theres anothere reason that the pavloperis are important, they are important becausethe are the first one to descover the ancient town of uranus.                  In conclution ive told you about the INCAS, PUEBLOANS, and the PAVLOPETRIS. so this has been my paper about all three ancient civilisations.

There are so many things discovered such as traits about the life of the tribes that archeologists discovered  at different places. Archeologists have found many ancient quipus. The ancient Inca is like a mystery to be solved. There were so many things such as clues left behind that archeologists have studyed and put pieces of and gathered up that details about their life. Anything that we know now about the Incas comes from oral history and storied that have been passed on for generations.               What archeologists found was ancient quipus. Inca left behind amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life and this showed us their daily life. We know so much of their stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire un 1532. Most of their knowledge comes from artifacts, or objects they left behind such as stone, pottery, gold, and silver. Archeologists who studied these sites keep carefull records. They write down and photograph artifacts. The most important thing to learn about is where it cam from and what happened to it. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may have worshiped some mountain peeks. Many of their sites are in high places like in mountain tops. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies have been found in the icy Andres and they have been in good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning to learn about the people died.                  The Puebloans were a gruop of people who lived in Mesa Verde. They were farmers who lived in small homes known as Pithouses. There was a major population shift that showed that some of the Puebloans began to move back to the clifff alcoves. Archeologists dont know the reason why they did they that but they said it had a large impact on the life of the Puebloans. The late tribe talked about were the Pavlopetri.                 The place where the Pavlopetri lived is now submerged underwater. This site was 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. It was thought to be the atlantian city. No one ever knew if it was a city for sure. There were many things revealed such as world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religous structures.                   Marine geologists have to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.

Archaeologist found clues out about the the incas like how there art was, there religon ,agriculture, tranportation , goverment and more .The incas passed down stories to preserve ther history from genaration to genaration. The incas made things from pottery and stone like many of the things we have now. Many of the incas live in the high mountains of peru.              The puebloans were really skillful people they were often called basketmakers because they were good craft makers.They also make pottery and  they made bow and arrow for hunting because it worked much better than a spear.The puebloans lived in the villages of mesa verde in  pithouses. The puebloans moved from mesa verde to New Mexico and Arizona , they moved here because they were looking for new opportunties because in mesa verde there started to get crop failures political problems , and the soil animals ,and forest were depleted.               The pavlopetri found a suken city that they neve rthought they would ever find. peloponnese is a city in greece that was believed to be consumed by the sea around the time of 1000 BC. The archealogoist found ceramics and many other things in the suken sea. They thought it could have sunk because of the sea level and earthquakes.

Also, it can imfluence or motivate more and more people on the search interesting objects that they have researched online. Types of evidence can be located by the experts that study these kinds of very well. My other responses to these questions are to examin the research sources and use the remaining time that you have. Tools at this point can also help you. It depends on the certain job that you are conducting. This is what my respones are of the following questinos above. Most ideas come from the mind of the person behind it. For example, how else could someone find the Acnient Inca terriory and have been studying it for more than 5 years? This is how you analyze the topic and basically 'disect' it.

The first eupopeans to go to to Inca Peru could use strings to keep the records. The archaeologist can peice together the peices of details they found out about the people in Inca to see what life is like out there. Stories were passed generation to generation.the Spanairds could not  speak the Inca language well , they might not have understood what Inca told them. Some of the Inca stories were legends more than history.                                                                The rest of the facts the archaeologists had were from their knowledge. Inca artifacts were made from pottery, gold, or silver. Those materials lasted a very long time even if they were under dirt or water the material would stay in good shape. You can find some of them under ground. Some parts of Inca are full of treasure hunters today there are people looking fo treasure in Inca.                                                                                                                                                                  The mountains in Inca are like a freezer you can find frozen bodies on these mountains. The archaeologists keep careful records of the treasure they find and photograph them. The Mesa verde is known as basketmakers. Farming replaced hunting so the people can live with food without having to kill animals.

Scientists have found these civilizations underwater in the middle of the ocean and also underground like the city of the dead or the clay warriors protecting the emporer of china in the 1800s.       When found atlantis will bring the united states popularitity up.   Atlantis will bring lots of guests from around the world and the U.S might get out of debt.       When cities go underwater the clay like old day buildings will melt away leaving just piles of mud or they just get washed away.

However, unknown boats appear on the horizon. The emperor calms everyone down saying that the boats come from the gods, and one of them is aboard that ship. What will you do?             The Inca empire had lasted for a near century before being wiped out by the Europeans in 1532. Before being wiped out, they had almost ruled longer to that of the Roman empire. They were so talented, they used pieces of strings -yes strings- to measure time and the livestock. They made patterns from the ground that can only be seen from the sky. However, not much is known due to the fact of thieves and grave robbers.              Like the Incas, the Ancestral Puebloans lived for less than hundreds of years.

The oral history are some stories known because they were written by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. They have to be careful when they interpret theses accounts because some people can not understand very well. Some stories might not be accurate because of the way people might read them. Some of the stuff are the most important things to learn about are in books.       The stories passed by generation to other generations are found or left behind.

They all have artifacts that were left behind from their civilization. Archaeologists are the scientists that find these artifacts, but how they find them differs from the other. Finding these artifacts is very important for our knowing of older civilizations and maybe even our ancestors and their way of living. I strongly believe that all artifacts or remains of an ancient civilization; more specifically the Incas, Puebloans, and Palvopetri people, helps our world discover what lives were lived before our own.                                                                                                                       One example of an important artifact, is clothing, this helps you see what ancient people wore back then. The Inca's cloth has been found and been concluded as a very durable piece of cloth (Gruber). This conclusion was made from how long the cloth had been preserved, which by numbers, is around 450 years. To add, they've been found in the dry deserts on Peru's coast or in the frigid Andes Mountains (Gruber). Many of other clothes would have already been destroyed by dampness or extreme heat.                      Another way of using artifacts to understand life before us is looking in the content of their own ancient structures. Like the Puebloans for example, they started by making pithouses, which is a underground home with the door on top. Which was later upgraded into a kiva, which kind of like an underground chamber that is mainly used for religious purposes (Anderson). Archaeologists also noticed that while the complexity of the Puebloans' structures increased, it chain reacted into the Puebloans' basket making skills to decline. Reason being because the Puebloans were so busy in creating more structures, they forgot about their once-known trademark, baskets.                    Now we have all been told that Atlantis is a myth, but recent findings have led archaeologists to suspect that their once was a civilization called Atlantis that later in its existnence, fell into the ocean. The people of this civilization were known as Palvopetri. Archaeologists have found the site of Atlantis in Southern Greece and it is abundant in shards of pottery. They have also plenty of buildings, rock-cut tombs, courtyards, and statues to name a few (Smith). Thanks to the shifting sands and other natural occurences, these artifacts are were able to survive for almost 5,000 years.

Them also have a lot of things they left behind when the new kind started to rule them. Archaeologists  try to find out new things about how these people lived, what they ate, how they kept track of time and a lot more.                       The Inca trib was located in the in the dry dessert right next to the Andes mountains. it might be had to belive but the Inca left a lot of things behind, including cloths, pottery, jewelery, and art. This helps archaeologists know a little more about how they lived. Most of thses items where made out of gold, sliver and stone. So a lot of thses things are still in good condition. Archaeologists even found some Inca bodies in the mountains. They would not ever find any bodies in the dessert because it is to warm and there bodies would break down and desentergrate. But the mountain act like giant freezers and keep the bodies preserved through out the years.                       Archaeologists have found out some thigs about this tribe. They and no was of keeping track of time, no system of writing, or number or anything. They kept track of this but using strings. And most of what we know about them where passes down from ancient stories, so most of what we know might now be true. Some of the stories where written down by the Europeans during the time the Incas where still alive. We still know a lot of these people even thought they lived over hundred of years ago.                        Archaeologists use some of the best techonolgy to figure out how thses people lived. It is no easy job though. The archaeologists have to carry all the equipment up by hand. And anything they find they have to carry down to study. And also they are master mountainears, because if they where to get stock the would die.

Archeologists from out time have studied the ancient artifacts that have survived from many years ago. We have also found out about them through the stories that were passed through the generations.The stuff that we have learned about them has also helped us learn the ways of how they survived with out much technology.          The  Puebloans had survived in a different way.They had made homes using the materials that they could find around them.the homes that they built had many different parts in it so they would be able to live in it.they were very skillful people.They  build artistic crafts right in their own homes.All of the Indian tribes from years ago had lots of skills.some hunted some were good farmers.They were all special people. the Peubloans moved according with the weather they are having where they lived.They were all survivors in their time and they lived in a different way than we do today.

Many people would argue that earth was different back then but really its pretty much the same for example theres still religion,politics,wars and again people have overcome those harsh distractions in life.       The rest of our knowledge of the inca comes from the artifacts,or objects they left behind and from the sites where artifacts are found.   Some artifacts turn up in ruins of buildings.       Some inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters who take anything that might be valuable to them in any way necessary.

We have learned form them, advanced form them, and have become who we are because of them. Among these ancient civilizations are the Inca, the Publoans, and the Pavlopetri, all very different, and form different stretches of the Earth, but all leaving their mark in history, to one day be found and have their legacy shared throughout the world. Now archeologist around the world are discovering and learning information long lost and forgotten form these ancient civilizations for all to learn.The discoveries made about the Inca, Publoans, and Pavlopetri are important, because it teaches us about the way of life of our ancestors and how time has changed us.        The Inca are one of the most fascinating ancient civilizations, though it lacked much of what today is found to be essential for success, they were able to form a strong empire by creating their own way of doing thing.They had no written language or alphabet but were able to efficiently keep records, by instead tying knots into colorful string.They created beautiful art, architecture, and a government and empire competing to Rome in their own way, differing form anything that had ever been done and has been done sense this time. A lot can be learned form such a civilization, and it's unique ways and customs that made it a successful empire that prospered without today's fundamentals. We may be able to learn of better ways to solve our governments problems by learning about the strange, yet successful ways that ancient civilizations such as the Inca have to offer.        In a completely, yet just as important way the ancient civilization of the Puebloans, can also teach us what we must do if we are to remain a striving nation as it saw it's great rise and saddening demise. We can study this civilization's entire history form the time they arrived at Mesa Verde near 550 A.D to when it was deserted by them around 1300 A.D. This is a major learning opportunity for humans because it allows us to not only know about their way of life, but also how it changed over the course of hundreds of years. We can see their advancements and changes of life, but more importantly it allows us to see into the rise and fall of an ancient civilization as most others do not allow. Throughout history it has been known that the downfall of a civilization is brought upon by another even stronger civilization, but here is one of few circumstances in which it bring upon it's own demise.By studying and learning about the Puebloans, we as well as all nations can learn how to avoid bringing upon one's demise and bring upon solutions that can prevent from once again occurring.        Until the discovery of the Pavlopetri, we had never before studied a sunken civilization, making it a learning experience for the archeologist who are studying it. The Pavlopetri being a sunken civilization, makes it much more difficult to explore and study required much more sophisticated technology and the the help of marine geologist. It being a sunken civilization also has it's advantages, for example since it sunk before humans could re inhabit the area and the water helps preserve the artifacts, it still remains much as it did when it was inhabited meaning it can provide much more information. The discovery of such a civilization finally allows us to put a name   on what the sunken city of Atlantis really is, which is Pavlopetri, a sunken city in Greece near the present city of Neapolis. The discovery of this city may also allow us to finally know why it and other cities like it have sunken, though this still remains unknown. Also the discovery of this city allows us to know of the way the ancient Greek were since this city sunk many years before it was an empire and teach us therefor how it can to be that which it is known as today.The Pavlopetri has taught us very much about the archaeology of sunken cities and civilizations, as well as what the lost city of Atlantis is, and the way of life of the Greek before it became the empire it is known as today.        Overall the discovery made about the ancient civilizations such as the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important for many reasons. They teach us about our ancestors: those who came before us and their way of life, as well as how we has humans have changed over time, and learn how to prevent the downfall of our nation by learning of the mistakes of those that have come before us. All these things are very important for knowing about our past lets us know we are as we are, and learning form the mistakes of those before us, allow us to prevent them form ever again reoccurring and better increasing our chances of success.Learning about ancient civilizations is important because it teaches us who we come from, as well as how to be successful in life, for they who have come before us already know and we must just learn form them.

The Incas made knots in colored string called quipus to record the calendar to keep live stock. But today no one knows what the knots actually mean. Because no one knows what any of the colored string meant. But one of the things we know is some stories because europreans wrote them down and we found them in diaries.  Also the other stuff we know was from the artifacts and objects they left behind, and we found some of there clothing and it actually was in descent condition.       The Puebloans made stone house in the side of cayon walls. They also made little homes called pithouse that eventually evoled into kivas. All they had in them was a fire place and a little hole that shows the 'underworld.' They were made to hold up to two or three men and only were six by eight feet big. These people were also known as cliff dwellers. And these cliff dwellers also made these little homes out of sand stone! In summer they only really used the fireplace, and if they did use it they used it to cook, but in winter they used them to mainly keep warm.       A diver explores the sunken settlement beneath the water off southen greece. But they say there are old sunken places in the world. They also found out that there is this hidden place called atlantis but they are not sure if it is a myth or not.  And only 1% of the worlds ocean floor has been surveyed.

I think its important because then we know about our ancestors and how our people were over 100 years ago. Without knowing any of these things we wouldn't know anything about our ancestors. The paragraph said that the Inca's would use knots for calenders and didn't have an official language. How cool is that? I believe that they were way smarter then half of us are today. They Puebloans would make there house about of stone and there communties in the alcoves of the canyon walls. But then for some reason they all moved away. Without knowing they built there house with stone, then how would we know how to built our houses out of stone. Them Experiencing all those things made us they way we our. And the way our life is the way it is today. We know barley anything about the 'The Cliff Divers' because barley anything was left behind. Back them the ancient people would build fires to cook something or to keep warm. Without them discorvering fire, how would we know what fire is? With them experienceing and creating all these knew things, it made it easy for us to live off the land. So it really is important for us to know about our ancestors and how they lived. Because without that, it wouldn't be too easy for us.

They are all diffrent parts of a story. one of the passeges are about a history class. the other one is about a national geographic.also because they like to talk abuot history.           All the passeges give us information about the text. they all provide details from the artical.they talk about how to make  a pithouse when you use a firepit. then another passege is about a kiva and it describes the parts of a kiva.Not all of the passeges are not the same the next passege is about water.           It talks about a lost city under water and when the tryed to discover a lost city. The lost city was found by Neapolis in Greece.It was a hard discovey for them to find a lost city. they thought that the lost city was a myth.This passeges are all the same becuase they are all myth but people might  go looking for it for them selfs.           The site,which straddles 30,000 square meaters or ocean.it was explored br a guy named Anglo- greek team for archaeologists.the lost city has inspierd othern people to go look for the lost city myth.           These are reasons that all of these passeges are all the same, because they are all myths. some people might not belive in myths but people them selfs might go looking for the lost city or other myths to belive if it is true or fake.

First off, im going to talk about source number one.Well source one was all about how Archeology unlocked all the secrets of the past. It talked about how the ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Archeologist who study these sites keep careful records so they writye down and they may also photograph any artifacts that they might find.      Now im going to be talking about the second source.Source number two is about the Mesa Verde National Park.It starts off by saying that 1,400 years again which was way before the Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.It also talks about how the first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550.     Now for the third and last of all, source number three.The third source is about the Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up his secret.Anglo-Greek is a team of Archeologists and marine goelogists as they were know as Pavlopetri the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years tom the time of Homer's heroes.In an eralier questions it talked about the Archeologist and the problems that they had well mainly the problems that they had was probably getting all of there data organized very good and telling whether it was what they needed or not.      Well there you go, in that paragraph I talked to you a little bit about the three sources.

Archaeologist have  to find old things that look  intesting and clean them up and bring them up to a musimn. Archaeologist have to go through a lot of dangest thing .They dont know if the place is dangest or is there is any animals that could kill them.

They were all trying to like determine things by what they were made of and how they were made. Like in the first source how they tried making the alphabet and system writing that was and is a very important tool now a days. If it wasn't for their help I probably wouldn't be doing this test right know.       In the second source it's like the discovery of houses or shelters which are very, very useful because without them we wouldn't be having a place to protect us from the bad weather we have during the 4 seasons.       For the third source I feel or think it was useful for the start of building, churches, stadiums, and all those other structures we have now a days.       All these people from ancient times are like the start of our whole present we have now a days and without these things our world probably wouldn't be the same at all right know. Also is pretty nice knowing that many people now a days try looking for more information about the ancient times and how they started things, where they lived, what they used to build things, and many other things scientist, archeologist try looking for today. Many people who study that today go on search all around the world sometimes to see new places and too discover new things everyday. These people dig, swim underwater, travel around, and deal with the weather in many places just so they can find more stuff out about all these ancient times and people.       Even if it's been more than a thousand years it's pretty amazing that people try discovering more and more about these ancient times. Also the things people do back in the day without technology and what they wore and also what they ate because they didn't have the things we have today. In my opinion on this whole selection is that it started the whole future for others because what someone never had made things we have today it would be pretty weird knowing that you wouldn't be able to type, print, go on the internet, and etc. Or also being able to use a cellphone or just things like that you don't normally think about because if it wasn't for people back then you wouldn't have all the stuff you have today or will have in the future.

Well for many reasons; these ancient civilizations shaped our future, we are all descended from them, and in order to learn about our history, we must learn about them. Therefore, archaeologists are working hard to uncover the mysteries of our history.             The history of these people; the Inca, Puebloan, and Pavlopetri, stretches back thousands of years, their empires are a mystery to us. Humans are very curious creatures, we will stop at nothing to achieve what we want. So if the leaders of the human race decide that they want their children and their grandchildren to learn about historic civilizations in school, then they will need to acquire knowledge about it.             The history of the Inca, Puebloan, and Pavlopetri civilizations hold many fascinating traditions and different ways of life. With some cultures, there is still a bridge connecting these traditions to ones that go on nowadays. We can also compare our age of electronics to their time, where they lived off the land and changed themselves in order to adapt to the land, whereas now, where we just change the land to adapt to us. It is important that we recognize these changes and point them out. A lot of rich history is out there and is waiting to be discovered. The history of our people is very important, and these three great civilizations are a key part of that history.                 	WRB VBP DT NNS IN NNP , NNP , CC NNP NNS RB JJ TO PRP CC PRP$ NN .

I always loved to hear my histroy  and my past  and you should too.              The Incas, Puebloans, Pavlopetri all have a wonderful story to share. they are all different and yet very simillar , they all tell the story of people who used what nature gave them to the fullest. it is important to learn about their storys because thay shape  manny peoples lifes.  These storys tell us how these people grew  and changes like with the Puebloans, they atared by living in homes under ground and then evolved into 3 story homes. Or with the Inca where they had no form of writing or time over time thay invented the quipus a foam of keeping track of  live stock buy nots on colored string. The Pavlopetir tell us about a island or piece of land once attached to   greece  that sank to the bottom of the sea with  these peoples great city.             You may be woundering why did this affect me? it affected you dear dreared because it change our human  history without these events   oour future might be very different.

Without these dicoveries, we would only have very limited information about the ancient civilizations and how they worked.   'The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not have archives for historians to study.' Due to the fact that the Incas never recorded anything onto paper for future reference, it was more difficult to learn about these ancient beings. Without archaeologists to finds old artifacts, very little would acually be known about the Incas. 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.'

For example, we have learned that they kept track of their calander by using string. Also they kept track of live stock with the strings. The strings have knots on them and no one really knows what they mean. Pueblaons were known because they lived about 700 years in the same place. They lived in canyon walls built by elaborate stone. The Pavlopetri were people who lived in Alantis. Even though they havent found the city itself divers dive in to ocean to look for remains of this lost city.

They made discoveries that we need to refind by learning through what they left behind. For starters the Inca started a new alphabet by using knots in strings, and I think that means their civilization was pretty advanced from the beginning. It would have been better if they passed on this form of writing so people could find out what it means today. Another discovery they made was they perserved their clothes in the Andes moutains. Which means they picked a pretty good location for the town.   The Puebloans also made remarkable discorvies. One was they found North America before anyone else. They also used the resources around them to bulid shelters. They used canyon walls and elaborate stone.   Lastly the Pavloperti lived in the lost city of Atlantis. They lived in one of the most unknown places to us today. Which is a pretty good discovery if you ask me. So now that you know all of these things were important why don't you go out and make a discovery of your own.

The Incas and the looters, The puebloans of Mesa Verde, and the underwater city are perfect examples of this.     The Incas mostLy lived high up in the Andes. this makes it harder for looterrs to get to it. It also makes the archaeologists job harder. they have to trek up a mountain with all their gear on!   The puebloans of Mesa Verde lived first in Pit-houses, then in Kivas, both in cliff recesses. The underwater city off the coast of Greece has been preserved with the help of shifting sands and the fact that looters can't get to it.

Archaeology is important because it helps us trace back your history as human beings.  Tracing back your history is important so we know things like where we started from, or how did we get from here to there.       Looking back into some of the history in the article like 'Ancient Inca', ' Mesa Verde National Park', and 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth' were made from authors that learned about these amazing works of arctictual, artistic master pieces.

Well, they find as much artifacts as they can and then try to connect the stories of the two artifacts.  From there they try to tell why or how those people lived on with their lives, and if we didn't have archaeologists to help us find this out we would never know how to make better housing or other products.       The Inca civilization left many artifacts such as art work, architechural stuctures, government systems, trasportation devises which then hepls us predict what may have happened and how it happened.  For example, the Incas left knots in a colorful string or called quipus to help them record the calendar or keep track of the livestock.  In addition, the Europeans were amazed that Inca built such a huge temple and some of the Europeans wrote this down in letters or diaries.  Story telling for Inca was much more like Oral History or passing down history from generation to generation.  The Spaniards hated Inca because they could not understand the language.                               Inca-       Spaniards hated the incas because they could not understand their language- spaniards murdered the last inca king in 1532 and took the empire and destoried many artifacts      Artifacts such as pottery, stone, gold or silver, textiels, clothing   lived in the Andes mountains, buried in caves       Puebloans-       Pavlopetri- 	VBZ PRP NNP .

Clues left behind by the inca form an amazing portrait of thier agriculture goverment and transportation.       some of what we know abour the inca comes from our oral history, or stories pased from generation to generation. passing on the stories was important way to preserve a communitys history       among the most important things to learn about a civilization are were it came from and what happened to it. the fall of inca is easy to date because the spaniards murdered the last inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The origons of the inca are more difficult to trace. The area they lived in were inhabited by diffrent people.       The inca lived in high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peeks. Many of thier sites are in remote high places. some Inca were baried in caves and cliff faces. For example, or on mounrain tops this has helped preserved the sites because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes the job of the archeoligest dificult. At higher elevations archeologest are expert mountaineers they have to carry all of thier equipment up the mountain before they can start work. any thing that they find has to be carried down the mountain for study. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about the people that died. The bodies also reviel information about how the lived. 	IN WRB VBP PRP VB NN DT NN IN RB DT CD NNS : CD CD VBN DT NN NN NN WDT VBD DT NN IN NN NN .

History can be a very interesting thing to learn about.There are many different civilizations and three of them are; the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavloperti. Also there are many important discoveries made that have gave geologists their knowledge of history.            The Inca are people that live in a civilization in Peru. The Inca had no set alphabet or system of writing. The Inca used quips or colored strings with knots in them to keep records. Geologists have found many ancient quips but still tody no one knows what the knots mean. Most of the things known about the Inca comes from oral history. Some of these stories have been written down by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Objects found from the Inca are things made out of things like stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Also things like clothing and textiles are found in the dry deserts of Peru.             The Puebloans lived in the Four Corners region and in shelters built into canyon walls. Geologisets have found artifacts like pithouses, bows and arrows, pottery, and spears. The Peubloans relied heavily on the pottery that they made. There were no written records of the Peubloans so geologists had a hard time learning everything about their culture.             The Pavloperti were very advanced for their time and had a very important mythical city that was called Atlantis. Marine geologists have found what they think is the remains of the city Atlantis. The civilization dates back 5,000 years and geologists say that Atlantis has to be the oldest submerged town in the world. Geologists have learned that Atlantis covers about 30,000 square meters. There have been ceramics found in Atlantis dating back to the end of the stone age. Less than 1% of the world's ocean floor have been surveyed and Atlantisis the most extrodinary find yet.             Even though history may sound boring many of the things you can learn from it may just supprise you. If it wasn't for learning about history how would you know all of these very interesting things even happened. Three of these interesting civilizations are the Inca, the Peubloans, and the Pavloperti. Hey you never know maybe you may be one of the geologists that uncover the next big civilization.

These three groups of people are very important to the way we live life, many of the things we do and use during the day were invented by them.       The Inca made many advances to their people during the time of their reign. They ruled the South American empire for nearly one hundred years and during their rule they amazingly increased their skill of art, architecture, agriculture, and their way of life.  Many of the things we know about the Inca are passed down from generation to generation. Inca made knots in colorful strings called quipus to record the calender and keep count of livestock, nobody knows what the knots mean.  Much of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects left behind by them.  Artifacts may be made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver.       The first Puebloans were settled in Mesa Verde during about A.D. 550.  They were known as Basket makers for their skill at crafting them. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops or cliff recesses. Skilled at making pottery and used the bow and arrow for hunting.  After living in pit houses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 they started expanding their population and build houses above ground with walls made of poles and mud, but by A.D. 1000 the Puebloans advanced from pole and adobe to skillful stone masonry.  Walls made of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and joined into units of 50 rooms or more.        The Pavlopetri were Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologists.  They were the first known team to explore the sunken settlement of Atlantis.  Without the discovery of them we would have never known who first discovered the sunken town under the sea of southern Greece we all know as Atlantis.  Discoveries have led to over 9,000 square meters of new buildings.  Also a possible megaron with a monumental structure with a lare rectangular hall.  Atlantis is a myth but the thought of having a sea sunken town under the sea is enough to think about for a long time.

The Incas lived in cold and harsh lands of Peru, the Puebloans lived on cliffs of the Mesa Verde, and the Pavlopetri lived in on the now-sunken coastal shores of Greece. They were still able to be simple livers, great craftsmen, and amazing architects.      The Incas were a simple but mighty civilization. The Incas ruled over South America for nearly a hundred years. They used knotted string to record important data, did not have a formal alphabet, and left artifacts such as objects made of stone, pottery, and even gold. This civilization shows us how the ancestors of who we are today survived in very basic ways.      The Puebloans of Mesa Verda were also known as 'Basket weavers' for their crafting skills. They lived in pithouses that eventually formed into kivas, learned to make pottery, and created to bow and arrow which was a more efficient atlatl. The Puebloans that some of our ancestors were great craftsmen.      The Pavlopetri are an Anglo-Greek group of archaeologists and marine geologists that are studying settlements that have been dated back about 5,000 years. This was the time of Homer's heroes. Ceramics were found dating back to the end of the stone age. Over 9,000 square meters of building have been discovered. The investigations have also a possible discovery of a magaron, a huge building with a large rectangular hall. This shows that even some of the oldest of the ancient civilizations were great architects.      The Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri are some of the oldest found civilizations in the world, and have taught us amazing things about the past and their way of life. They lead simple lives, but made great accomplishments that put us where we are today. That makes the discoveries of these places important.

They did not leave much behind for historians and archaeologists to study. However, the Incas left behind clues that archaeologists can use to piece together the ancient Incas' lives. Most of the information said about Incas come from stories told by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. These people described the Incas in letters and diaries. Most artifacts that are found are very precious. They are normally made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. These materials last a long time because they have been buried and preserved for such a long time. Inca clothing and textile have been discovered as well. Cloth and other forms of clothing are usually destroyed by dampness, however these have been preserved because they have been buried in the dry deserts on Peru's coast or the cold mountains of the Andes.       Mesa Verde National Park   Before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region had chosen Mesa Verde for their home. Over the course of 700 years they and their descendants lived here, building stone communities in sheltered areas of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, they moved away. Mesa Verde National Park provides a reminder of this ancient culture. Experts have named these people 'Anasazi.'   The first people who settled in Mesa Verde were known as Basketmakers for their skill at the crafft. They also began farming as a replacement to hunting. They lived in pithouses clistered into small villages built on top of cliffs. They learned to make pottery and later gained the bow and arrow so that they could hunt easier. From A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1300, the population skyrocketed. They continued to flourish until they started seeing drought and crop failures which urged them to leave Mesa Verde.       Atlantis   Everyone has heard the tale of the ancient underwater city of Atlantis. However, archeologists have predicted that Atlantis is just a sunken city off the coast of Greece. The sunken city dates back 5,000 years. Dr. Jon Henderson said, 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' The city is believed to have been devoured by the sea around 1000 BC. It was discovered by a British oceanographer about 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists can use advanced techonology to properly survery the ruins. They had revealed that the city was complete with buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition was thousands of shards of pottery. They had found pottery dating back to the end of the stone age. They also discovered over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. Marine archaologists are intrigued because this city is an example of how adavnced people were back then and what they accomplished with architecture.

All the other zebras called Samuel mean names. One day Samuel decided that he wanted a friend. He went up to talk to one of the more popular zebras, and the zebra just walked away laughing.        Samuel was so sick of being the odd one out, that he would always just stay under the tree all alone. One day a zebra named Jackie came up and decided to talk to Samuel. He was jumping with joy that he finally got to talk to someone. Jackie said that she has always wanted to talk to him but was always too scared. They talk for a long time, but then all the other zebras were making fun of Jackie for talking to Samuel. Jackie didn't care, she promised Samuel that they would be best friends forever. They both lived happily ever after.    The End.......

Also, it becomes even more important when they are about major civilizations like the inca  Pueblos, and Atlantis.          The Inca were one of the most powerful and successful civilizations in history. So, discovering new things about them is very helpful in understanding what they were like. One of the most useful things to find is artifacts. They can tell what the Incas used and how they lived. They also tell what they believed in. For example, the artifacts can have pictures showing what people are doing.           The Pueblos were a very interesting ancient civilization. They lived for hundreds of years in a place were many people wouldn't survive. They had elaborate communities and lived in houses built into walls of a cave. When they left these houses, they also left pottery and other useful artifacts. These were used by archaeologists to learn more about how they lived and where they came from.          The lost city of Atlantis is a sunken Greek city in Greece. It is on the sea bottom and has been explored by many people. It is one of the only societies that is underwater that scientists know about. So, when archaeologists find something they didn't know about, it's an extra big deal.          Overall, artifacts from civilizations can be some of the most useful tools for people to learn about. They can tell what people did back then or even something that they ate. So, these are very important to defining history and where we came from.

These cultures are very important and I'm going to tell you why.             First lets talk about the Inca.They had no form of alaphabet or writing system.Instead they made knots in colorful strings called quipus to record the calenderto keep count of livestock.Many archaeologists have found quipus but they didn't have knots in them and that's what made them unique.Nobody knew how to read it was like solving a mystery.They finally figured it out from clues such as, portraits of their religon, art and architecture, government, transportation,and way of life.That's what made the Inca special.            The next culture is the Puebloans.They came to America before many explores.They chose a region called Mesa Verda.Their nick names were the ancientones or the ancient enimes,They lived in pithouses.The house was very strong that you could fire pits in there.That's what made them special.           The final one is the Pavlopetri.Their nick names were the cliff dewllers because the lift on the edge of cliffs.They make beautiful art.They survived through the coldest winters.That's what made them special           I talked about the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavloperti.They all have their specialities.They were hard to find and figure out.They are very special cultures.Those were the three most hard to figure out cultures.

We now know what they did in they're are as a living, or even to survive. We can look at they're tools and tell if they were gardeners, cooks, hunters, or even travelers. The Paleontoligists have made a breakthrough so we can look back further into w hat life use to be like.             I think that the discovery's being made will really help us to get to know early civilizations even better. All of this is a part of history on how well the Earth has evolved over time due to humanbeings. Now we can just go to a fast food restraunt and order food, the Inca, puebloans, and the Pavlopetri had to hunt for food. This was an amizing and even smart group of people.            We are different from the early settlements, they all had responsibillities as alot of us today dont. They had to to make an effort to to live unlike us. They have advanced so much in such short of time that they even made their own medicines, now we pick ours up from someone that makes them for us.

Some of what we know comes from oral history, or stories passed down from generation to generation, but there is a lot that also comes from artifacts and records kept by many ancient people. Some textiles and clothing have survived remarkably well because of their enviornments and climate. Even bodies found in places such as the Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern scanning equipment to learn about how the people died and how they lived.        Archaeologists have even recently found an entire underwater civilization near Greece that has been hidden for hundreds of years. There are apparently hundreds of buildings and plazas under the sea that were waiting to be found for years.        In conclusion, these findings are all very important because they give us facts about the past and could even help predict the future. Plus, these crazy findings are also very interesting.

The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing but they sill thrived and ruled for nearly one hundred years. Artifacts are like clues left behind so we can learn of the ways of life of The Inca. Most history of the Inca was passed down orally, soem stories are legends rather than history. Europeans described the Inca in diaries and letters, some even wrote and translated Inca stories. Artifacts sometimes confirm Historical record.     Natural geographical features preserve artifacts. The Andes even preserved bodies so well that experts can find cause of death. The bodies also revealed how they lived.         The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known for their skills in basket making. Soon they learned pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon than the atlatl, a spear thrower.     People lived in pit houses for about 200 years, then as the basketmakers population multiplied they began builing houses above ground, with upright walls. From here on the people were known as Puebloans, a spanish word meaning 'village dwellers.' By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Walls of thick, double-coursed stonenoften rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more. Pottery also changed from simple designs on a gray backround to black drawings on a white backround. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before, and mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture.     The population reached several thousand in A.D. 1300. The stone walls were regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde. Baskets began to show a decline of quality, possibly because of the use of pottery. In A.D. 1200 a major population shift saw people begin to move back to the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors. Why they made this move nobody knows. Maybe for religios purposes or better protection. Whatever the reason, or reasons, it gave rise to the cliff dwellings which Mesa Verde is most famous.     Structures tell of a people adept at builing, artistic in their crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land. The structures are evidenc that over centries a society accumulated skills and traditions and passed them down generation to generation.     Ancestral Peubloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. When they left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among kin who were already there. Whatever may have happened, some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancestral Puenloans.             Secrets of a lost city may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis- the city has been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. The settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. There is no doubt that it is the oldest submerged town in the world. it has remains dating long before the glory days of classical Greece. There are older sunken sites but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique.     The site is believed to have been consumed by the ocean near 1000 BC. Although discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine achaeologists, aidedby digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins.What they found surpassed all expectations. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of builings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seebed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. The ceamics found dated back to the stone age.     Investigations revealed over 9,000 square meters of new builings. a suprising discovery was of a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, which also suggested the town was used by an elite, and automatically raised the status of the settlement. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings if Mycenaen society. The site is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied. It represents a frozen moment of the past.     It was the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.                 Ancient ruins or artifacts can put legends to rest or prove stories passed down and told to every generation.

We have found them in building ruins, buried with people in their graves, and we even find text in a code. Archeologists take every single piece of evidence they find about the object to try to understand about it and why they used it. They must record how they found the object and where they found it. Every little piece of information counts towards knowing what it was used for or how they lived.          We could find and figure out how they lived with the ruins left behind. The houses they lived in, ways why they left, it all comes down to evidence of the objects and how it was left. They made things  like the kiva or pithouses. Greece is an interesting place full of mysteries. For example the lost city that is under water. Knowing this that we know from just positions or objects or decoding text, is truly amazing.

They started off buildong underground houses. But then adaspted and started buliding on ground level. They even built buildings 3 stories high. Most of these starting off as just homes. They are part founders of the large multiple story homes we have today.       They also have a lot of important history. They created rock art that told 'stories', or recorded something that happened. This is not only something very interesting for people to look at, it is a way of learningn what life was like for these people.       They also created the first 'churches' called Kiva. The word Kiva means ceremonial room. They included a ventilator, bench, air deflector, fire pit, sipapu, and pilaster. These people were more advanced then some people might think. These things are the basis of our modern day living. This is why these people are so important.

The reason that the Puedloans were important is because they showed us how they built early buildings. They built shelters out of stone, wood, mud, and even in cayon walls.

Well I love to learn about lost civilizations. Lost civilizations like the lost city of Atlantis or the Incas or about the Pueblonans that is something to talk about.                 The lost city of Atlantis it has made everyone think twice about it. Some people say it is true, some not. A Anglo-Greek team think true. They have found old and crazy things down where they believe is the lost city of Atlantis. That is just some info about Atlantis.           The Incas are people how really didn't have much to go off of. The Spaniards came into there land and helped them. By the end of there time the Spaniards had murdered the last empire. They had to move to a better place and let the Spaniards have where they where at. That is about the Incas.            The Pueblones they had to live in pithouse. They changed their life and how they live very often. They where very intelligent people who knew how to change. They made sure to do every thing they could to keep there culture alive. That is the Pueblones.          The lost civilization is a great thing to look up and research. It is a wonderful thing to learn about because it is keeping there culture alive. It can help people start to believe in some of the stuff they did back then. The lost civilization is one of the greatness in life. The lost civilization of Atlantis, the Incas and the Pueblones are now beginning to be more alive. 	NNP PRP DT NN IN JJS NN . WRB IN DT NN NN IN NNP . CC VB IN DT NNP .

All of these civilizations are keys to know how life was back then. Many things like artifacts, drawings, or even rock structures can tell us about the life these civilizations have lived.           The Inca had many things you could tell ur history off of like the huge structures they created, and also the treasures they might of hidden a long time ago.Also the Puebloans made pit houses, very poor houses that might sink into the ground a couple feet, also the Puebloans had compact villages which are in ruins now and you could probably find many missing artifacts in those ruins. On another hand, the Pavlopetri is very interesting, you would never think a whole city vould be sunken into the sea right? But that is quite possible off the coast of Greece where many marine geoligists have found remains of cities under the crystal clear waters of Greece. You could find many artifacts and structures under water, which is key to help finding out about that bit of history.            In conclusion, the discoveries of all these civilizations are very important to the life we have today, because we could easily figure out what life was like back then and how much we have improved the world one step at a time. Im sure we will find many more remarkable discoveries in the near future.

It is important because it helps us learn about what they did back in the day. When we find old stuff it helps us learn how  technology was back in the day. Also, How are technology is more advance than theirs. Also, if some things weren't discovered the world would be different.       Also, When we find old stuff we are probably able to restore it. Also, if we didnt find old stuff we wouldn't know what some stuff are. Some stuff in the pass we use in our everyday lives. Other stuff should've just stayed in the ground. Thats why it is important to discover lost items.

This is important because everyone should know where they came from. It's a large part of who we are. We should also want to know because it can prevent us from making mistakes and learning from them. Last, it's to fulfill our curiousity of all those myths, legends, and folktales we have heard about in or lives.   Lets start with the Incas. Over the past years we have found lots of artifacts, even human remains, from the abannded cities.   From this, we can study how they lived and died. We have discovered that they mysterisally left their homes and died off. Our society can learn and observe this. Plus alot of the world has an Inca heritage.   Second is the Puebloans. The Puebloans are from Europeans who were exploring North America. They their for 700 years but then   left their homes and moved away. Their homes known as 'Pithouses' are good remains to show us their lifestyle also.

These civilizations were some of the most fascinating civilizations of the ancient times. The Greeks helped the world with being the first society to have a democratic government. The Incas helped develop bridges across mountains. And, finally the Puebolans helped build houses into the sides of mountains. These houses were mostly made out of adobe clay. The Puebolans were also master pottery crafters.

Some of the most important technologies we have today are derived from these ancient people. Some of these discoveries made can clue us in to some of the biggest mysteries out there.  I mean, imagine if you found a completely intact city just of the coast of your hometown.  Wouldn't you be curious? I know I would.  Or what about a ruined town on the peak of Andes, wouldn't you want to know what happened to the people or how the town got there? Not only have these discoveries moved us forward with new efficient ways to do things and bright new idea but they satisfy our thirst for knowledge. But what makes each lost city so important and valuable?             The Incans lasted for nearly a hundred years, they dominated most of south America and challenged ancient Rome in expansion! Yet now their great city lays in ruins. But even though it's gone, we still learn about it.  Why? Maybe because it's interesting but also because it set precedence for many great nations to come, the Incas were one of the most successful and dominant world powers of their time so it's no surprise that their culture was succeeded by smaller countries, states and towns.  There is a reason their empire lasted so long, and it is smart to identify what made them a successes before they died out and try and incorporate it into future cities.  That's evolution.  Everything evolves and so do cities.  People looked at the Incas for an example on what to do to make a successful city and what not to do, they took the Inca's best ideas and modified them to make a type of government that worked.                The discoveries made at the ancient Inca sites show us a key step of human civilization evolution.  It also helps us understand our history, and early forms of cities.  Ancient empires are especially interesting because it lets us know what life was like back then and what kind of things worked.                The same goes with the sunken ancient Grecian city.  They were one of the earliest Greek cities and were obviously one of the more domesticated civilizations.  What makes that city so important is not only the sheer mystery of it but also how it played a role in Greek's youth.  This city just brings up so many questions, why was the sinking of an entire city not recorded in Greek history? How did it get to the bottom of the ocean?  Everything about the city screams intrigue and humans are naturally curious.  This city brings up the question on whether or not there are other ancient cities beneath the waves, these cities could clue us in the natural events that occurred thousands of years ago such as a devastating tsunami or the earths surface movement. But the unique thing about the discovery of this city is that it is Greek? So might there be an city of gold in the water too, a.k.a Atlantis?  This topic has piqued human curiosity, and has made us wonder what the ocean could really be hiding.               The settlers of Mesa Verde however are perhaps one of the most intriguing stories ever told. They are called the ancient ones or sometimes even the ancient enemies.  They thrived for 700 hundred years and have lots of descendants.  These people were one of the key steps to civilization evolution and built elaborate towns, cities, and homes.  Their inventions were most impressive for someone of their day.  They definitely played a major role in the evolution of our city system.              These cities clue us in to our past and show us how our way of life has evolved.  They pique curiosity in us and make us want to learn more about what our world was like a lifetime ago.

Many ancient artifacts have been destroyed, but yet many have also been found and are in spectacular condition. We learn what we know about the past by finding artifacts and hard evidence so we can infer things about their cultures and rituals.       The Incas of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing, so historians have quite a bit of trouble discovering information about the Incas. Archaeologists have found many quipus which are colorful pieces of string with knots, but historians have yet to figure out what those knots mean. We know things about ancient Rome because they left behind portraits of their religions, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the ways they lived their lives. Europeans wrote down stories, and they describes the Incas in letters and diaries. The Spaniards did not speak the Incas language, but they could infer what they were doing, however, their descriptions may not be accurate or correct. The other knowledge of the Incas came from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, however some of it was destroyed because of weather deterioration.       We know information about Mesa Verde because some of the Pithouses that they lived in were still around when archaeologists were looking for information about it. In addition, they have skillful stone masonry, and advanced pottery.  They also constructed their buildings very stratigacly, so they kept together well for a long time. Other tribes have also given us information about them.       Sunken settlements have been recently found in southern Greece, so we have been able to  discover information about their culture. It is the oldest sunken settlement in the world, so it is quite remarkable that it was found. The settlement has been protected by the bay, and to the often shifting sands. Another contributing factor is that the water near by is very shallow.       In conclusion, we have been able to find out information about ancient cultures as a result of finding ancient artifacts. These artifacts include writings, stories, poteries, settlements, and different forms of artwork. Without this hard evidence, we would know close to nothing about these ancient civilizations.

These discoveries have greatly contributed to our knowledge about these civlizations today.  The information found about the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very inportant today.       Archaeologists used ancient stories and ledgend to learn more about the Incan civilization.  They have discovered that the Incans were a very advanced socety and achieved greatly.  Archaeologists aslo used evidence they found in the Pueboans in Mesa Verde to find out how they built their shelters.  Puebloans in Mesa Verde lived in pithouses from 550 CE to 750 CE.  Archaeologists were even able to investigate the ruins of ancient greek cities to leart about their culture.  They found that the ruins of their cities were well preserved and still in tact, along with many other artifacts.       The discoveries made by archaologists were very significan to ones understanding of these civilization.  More information is now know about the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.

The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet of system of writing. They didnt leave anything so historians can study on. Some of the stuff we know now about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories or passed from generation to generation.          The Puebloans are known as basketmarkers for thier skill at the craft. Farming was replaced by yhunting and gathering as thier main livelihood. It was mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather than out in the open. Whatever the reasons it gave rise to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is most famous.          The Pavlopetri explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. What they found supassed all expectations. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean.

The Inca people had no written language or actual alphabet so finding out how they led their daily lives was a bit more challenging. Some of what we know nof the Inca people comes from their tradition of oral history, stories passed down genereation to generation. Some of their stories were recorded by Europeans when they came to the empire in 1532. Although they recorded things the Europeans did not actually speak the Incan's languge so we do nopt know how acurate their recordings are. Some Incan clothes and artifacts have survived quite well because of the conditions they were kept in. Some Incan sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters and things may have been stolen.  Since the Incans lived high in the moutains they were buried in caves and enclosed places. The high altitudes have helped to preserve the sites.

They find many things daily.  From the ocean floor to the huge desert they find many things from many different people helping us understand the way they lived and functioned.  I'm going to talk about the Incas, the Ancestral Puebloans, and The Lost City of Atlantis.         First of all, I'm going to talk about the Incas.  The Incas lived during the years 1438-1532.  They did not have a formal alphabet or system of writing, they wrote and kept records by a system called a quipus.  A quipus is a string with a whole bunch of knots in it.  Archaeologist have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows what the knots mean.  Archaeologists are people that find ancient artifacts and figure out how long ago they were used and why.  They also have to figure out how the ancient people lived by looking at where they live and other thing that the archaeologists find.  Some of the things the archaeologists know come from stories passed from generation to generation, artifacts found in the desert or up on the cliffs they lived on, and from the homes they built.        Second of all, some of the items the archaeologists have found are objects made from stone, pottery, gold, silver, and clothing preserved in the hot desert.  One of the most important things to learn about a civilization are what happened to it and where the people came from.  Archaeologists use some of the most advanced techniques to discover more about the Incas like taking Arial photography so they can find patterns in the ancient monument that they can not see on the ground. Some of the things the archaeologists found out are, the Incas lived high up in the Andes mountains and may have worshiped some of the mountain's peaks.  They buried their people in caves on cliff faces or on mountain tops. They also usually put items in with the dead so they could take it with them when they left the earth.       Next, I'm going to talk about the ancient people, Ancestral Puebloans. The Ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde for almost 700 years.  They built huge stone communities in the alcoves of the canyon walls. In 1200 A.D. the Ancestral Puebloans moved away.  The Ancestral Puebloans were known as the Basketmakers for their skill at the craft.  Farming replaced hunting and gathering.  They lived in pit houses in small villages built on mesa tops and sometimes in cliff recesses.  They learned to make pottery and started using a bow and arrow for hunting.  The population increases rapidly during the next few years and so the villages grew to.  The stone walls of the pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built with their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. About 1200 A.D.  the Ancestral Puebloans people began to move back into the cliff alcoves.  No one knows why they made this move maybe for defense, or religious or psychological reasons or maybe the cliffs were better protection from the weather.  The archaeologists found a lot out by the structure of the Ancestral Puebloans villages and structures.  The buildings were evidence of a society that had accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on through the generations.  The Ancestral Puebloans were very smart, they used the nature to their advantage by building their dwellings inside cliffs so they could stay out of the weather, their basic construction material, sand, to make their homes and the mortar between the blocks of sand was a mix of water and mud, and they used their space wisely to grow their crops, build their homes and other structures.       Finally, I'm going to talk to you about the lost city of Atlantis.  Atlantis was found by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist.  The sunken settlement dates back to some 5,000 year.  It is the oldest submerged town in the world.  Its remains date from 2800 to 1200 B.C. It covers 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor.  It is believed that the sea consumed it around 1,000 B.C. When the marine geologists found Atlantis they found court years, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.  Something that took them by surprise was a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall.  Which means the town had been used by and elite.  The marine geologists think there are many things that could have sunk this town. It could have been caused by sea level changes, ground subsidence as a result of an earthquake or tsunami.        Archaeologists have not found everything their will always be something new to find out there.  Now you know about the Incas, the Ancancestral Publoans, and the great lost (not so lost anymore) Atlantis.

Some civilizations may have been really significant in history, others, not so much. All events are significant in history no matter what.       Inca civilizations were a rival against the Roman empire which is quite significant since by that time, Rome was a huge country that rules a big part from europe. Sadly the Inca civilization only lasted for a hundred years since it had falled after the last Inca king was killed by Spaniards.       Puebloeans or also known as Basketmakers had a life of farming that replaced hunting and gathering, they lived in cliffs they cleared out and became known as Mesa Verde or in spanish: green table. Their population increased and for unknown reasons, 1200 A.D. they moved out.       The lost city or Atlantis was insipired by a sunken settlement in southern Greece. Atlantis is one of the most enduring myths that states there is a secret underwater city by the seas of Grece. They found some clues of civilizations living in the 'sunken city' like structures or ceramics. Being sunken meant that noone has ever looted it which means it has stayed as it was 500 years ago apart from the erosion, earthquakes and tsunamis. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going, less than 1% of the world's ocena floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found'.

Like Ancient Inca their king was killed by spaniards and was taken over.                   To know this actually happen they have to find evidence.They have to do research because some of inca's stories were legends rather than history.'Some of inca textiles and clothing also survived remarkable well.'(Gruber)(p.7) They have to look in many records to see if there anything they can learn from it.But they have to be careful when they doing this.                Now they have some evidence they take pictures of any artifact and note the exact postion in which they find it.they find lots of information about artifact they find.Thats how they learn about civilization are where it came from.it can affect our life in sourt of way because we are like trying to find evdience to a histrical event.Some reseachers not always find what they wanted.

Thanks to archaeologists, we are able to discover how people lived back in the ancient civilizations. The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because they help us learn what life was like in ancient civilizations.          Most of what archaeologists know about the Inca is either from artifacts or stories that have been passed down generation by generation, so historians have to cautious with what they have. The Incan civilization did not have a system of writing, instead they used knots of colored string to run their empires. These clues help us know how they lived.          The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde about 1,400 years ago. They were known for their basket making skills and lived in small villages on mesa tops. The houses they built were evidence that the Puebloans not only grew in population, but they also gained more knowledge as they adapted to their knew way of life. They used nature in their favor to build their villages beneath overhanging cliffs. The ruins of those villages help archaeologists know how the Puebloans lived in ancient times.          The Pavlopetri lived 5,000 years ago. Thanks to the geographical area they settled in, ancient cities have been preserved underwater for many years. With what was found, archaeologists were able to infer that the Greeks were wealthy and well organized. They were amazed by the huge buildings that take up 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor.        As you can see, the discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopertri are very important to our present because we learn about our past.

Artifacts and stories. Artifacts have been able to show us more than stories have about these civilizations, but that's only because stories were sometimes only legends.       When it comes to the Incas, we don't have any artifacts actually written by the Incas, but we have quipus. No one these days actually understands what quipus mean, but when the Spaniards visited them, they actually wrote down as much of what they could understand of what the Incas were telling them. Archaeologists have been able to find artifacts that back up the stories written by the Spaniards. The discoveries of the Inca civilization are important because they tell us what life was like in ancient Peru.       In the article, 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Pueblanos and Their World,' we learn about the ancient civilizations of Meas Verde. We learn that they used nature to their advantage by making an atlatl to prey for their food and using pithouses to shelter themselves. Archaeologists have never been able to fully understand the Pueblanos, as they left no written record of their daily lives. The homes and other buildings of these ancestral Pueblanos has influenced more modern buildings such as churches.       A Greek sunken city built and drowned before the fable of Atlantis was ever created may have influenced the myth. This town wasn't found until recently because, believe it or not, humans haven't explored more than 1% of the world's ocean floors. The myth of Atlantis and this sunken city may have influenced some of our modern day culture.       Despite the hard work that archaeologists have to endure, such as mountain-climbing, ocean exploring, and cold weather, they continue working to find information to influence our modern day world.

These civilizations include the Inca,  the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. These civilizations make up part of our world today. Without these civilizations, we would not be where we are today.           One of the great civilizations were the Inca. The Inca had no real alphabet or system of writing. They didn't leave archives for historians to study. They invented the quipus to record the calendar and to keep a count of livestock. Clues left behind by the Inca teach us about their religion, art and architecture, transportation and way of life. By studying these artifacts and clues, archaeologists and others can study and understand the details of Inca life. All of the other knowledge comes from artifacts that were left behind .           The Puebloans were another great civilization. About 1,400 years ago, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. They were known as Basketmakers for their skill at their craft.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa topsbut sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and made the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting.           The last great civilization was the Pavlopetri in Greece. You may heard of Atlantis. Well that is where they lived. Archeologists found pottery dating back to the stone age, building, courtyards, main streets, tombs, and religious structures. Atlantis was a myth that kept underwater exploration going.                  These civilizations made an important part of our world today. They created many things we use in everyday life. Archeologists have discovered many artifacts that have taught us more about history. The old days were the invention and improving days.

The Puebloan civilization is nearly everywhere.The Puebloan were nomads they moved after staying in a place for long.their artifacts show that they changed. they went from hunting and gathering  backetmakers to farmers.their artifacts showed how they got smarter.and after liveing in mesa tops and cliffs  to moveing back to there kin.   the last place is pavoperti that mystreiously sunk. Pavoperti was the insperation of the greek myth of atlanis. not much is know exepcet that it was a big city and there is still alot to look at.   this spots make achaeologist ready to look for more things to learn about old life.

These stories are the Incas, Puebloans,and Pavlopetri. The three of these are very important, and I will tell you why they are important. I will be talking about how they managed to do work, what they slept in, and most importantly how they lived.              To begin with, The Incas of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing, so they practically only talked there own language to each other. The Incas had left no achieves for the historians to study or learn about. But one thing that the historians found was that the Incas would use some type of colored string to tie knots witch was called quipus. They would do this to record the calendar to keep a count on the livestock. Many of the quipus were found but till this day no one knows what the knots mean and without anyone who knows what they mean they wont know what story is behind it. Some of old stories about the Incas we know because they were stories written down. They were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532, they were Spanish soldiers and priests. Most of the Incas belongings were found, it was mostly there pottery, it was made out of gold, stone, or silver. The Incas lived way high in the Andes, many of there sites are in remote high places. Some Incas were berried in caves, in cliff faces, or on mountain tops. It makes it hard on the archeologists to get there corps and examine it, because its so high up in the mountain.             Next, about 1,400 years ago, way before Europeans explored North America a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde as their own home. For more than 700 years their descendants lived and  flourished there. But in the late  A.D. 1200s, they left their homes and moved away. Mesa Verde National Park, preserved a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture.The archeologists have called them Anasazi, from a Navajo word. Its sometimes translated as ''the ancient ones''or ''ancient enemies.'' We now call them Ancestral Pueblaons. They were the first to settle in Mesa Verde, about in A.D. 550. They were known as basketmakers for their skill in crafting. They would farm instead of  hunting for animals. They would live in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.They also learned how o make pottery and use the bow and arrow.Their basic construction material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks.The mortar between the blocks was a mix of mud and water. There space was about for two or three persons. In the winter they would burn fire to keep warm. Some of today's Pueblo people and other tribes, are descendants of theAncestral Pueblaons of Mesa Verde.             Many people have herd the myth's of a long lost city called Atlantis. This was one of the bigest cities that they  have found. The archaeologists and marine geologists known as Pavlopetri, have explored the sunken settlement. It dated back some 5,000 years ago to the time of  Homer's heroes. The city of Atlantis is one of the biggest and oldest submerge town in the world. There are many other sunken towns but no other can compare to this one. This one is unique. If i were able to find some thing in Atlantis it would be to find some type of sculpture or art. This city was found in  Greece,Neapolis. Many are trying to figure out why it is that this city sank. But they found thousands of pottery, like vassles. They did find courtyards, mainstreets, rock cut tombs and religious structures. This city was there even befor crist. So they are cirious about what religion was.

The Inca had a very unique way of ruling their city by government. They used a string horizontally which had many strings attached to it vertically; the vertical strings had knots on them to keep track of supplies and other governmental records. The Inca lived high in the Andes and worshiped some mountain peaks. They buried the dead in caves and cliff faces. this was hard for looters to get their hands on but also for the archaeologists. With the dead bodies the Inca also preserved their clothes in the high mountains. The bodies also told information on how they lived.               In the article of Ancestral Puebloans,this civilization lived in an area called Mesa Verde (which is 'green table' in Spanish). They are known for their basket making and their skills for crafting. They started to Hunt and gather than farm, they lived in a house called Pit house; these house's living room was sunk in the ground for a few feet. It also had a hole on top to let all the smoke come out from the fire inside. The population kept increasing and by A.D. 1300, the population  may have reached several thousands. soon the Puebloans left Mesa Verde and settled into present day New Mexico and Arizona.            In the article of Lost Greek City, this city may have inspired the myth of Atlantis. This city must have been built around 2800 to 1200 BC. This city is unique because it is about the only one that is almost totally complete. This site is about 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. The findings pass the expectations. Thanks to shifting sands and a protected bay you can see main streets, buildings, religious structures, court yards, and statues. the sea floor was covered with thousands of shards of pottery. This city predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Less than 1% of the ocean floor has been seen and there is still a lot more down there that has not been found yet.

Archeologist have been trying to find many clues to learn more and more about there life. They have found clothes , bodies and a settlement that has been sinked for over 5,000 years. It is incredible how they have found so many to clues to let us know how the Inca life was.                              The Incas lived in Pithouses that later on where Kivas. Kivas were used as a ceremonial room. They would use it when there was good crops , luck in rain and a good hunting. The kivas had a whole in the center for the spiritual world to eneter. Many of the objects Incas left behind were made out of stone , gold , silver and pottery. This objects were found urried or in graves with the dead so they can use them in the after life. When the Incas died they were burried in the top of the mountains . The archeologist found the bodies in great shape because the mountain kept the old dead bodies cold like a freezer.                           The Inca fall was in the 1532 when the Spanierds murdered the king and took over the empire. The Inca lived  in the Andres en on moutain peaks.

They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strinds called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of liverstock.                    About 1,400 years ago , long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. for more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of  the canyon walls. Then , in the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away.                      The secrets of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. Explored by an Anglo - Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts.

We can learn a lot about the lost civilizations.               We have learned so much over the years by the things that people have left behind years ago.What really helps us are the clues and artifacts that we have discovered. Some of the things that have  helped us are portraits of art,architecture,religion, and many more things.The artifacts that we have found  helps us to learn about their daily life because sometimes there are paintings on them that give us  information about the lost civilizations.As you can see we can use a lot of things to help us learn about the lost civilizations.                 We can also learn things about the past by their architecture.   Not many people know but today architects still built things that look the same from the years past.Each kind of building has its own style.When you look at one you can see the style that the people used a long tiome ago.So keep in mind next time you see a building maybe you'll spot one that looks like one from a long time ago.Even buildings can help us learn about lost civilizations.                 As you can see there are alot of different ways we can learn about the past.We can learn from the clues that people have left behind.We can also learn by the artifacts that we have found over the years.So keep in mind that whenever you see a building with a weird looking style or if you find a clue it could look or be from years past.Its fun to learn and discover many things from the lost civilizations.

Instead it    had colored knots named, Quipus to communicate with each other. The first Europeans were amazed to find a huge civilized city with only communicating with knots.  Archaeologists have found these colored knots but no one knows for sure what they all mean. The Incas ruled the South America for about a hundred years. The Spaniards did not speak Inca however, they told stories about the Inca empire but some were mostly false than true. Archaeologists have found Inca clothing in the mountains near Peru's coast. The Incas lived in high mountains in the Andes, some Incas even worshiped mountain peaks. The fall of then Inca empire happen in 1532 when the last Inca king got killed by the Spaniards.       The Puebloans civilization chose Mesa Verde as their new home in A.D.     550. The Puebloans were known for their skill in crafting and were called, 'Basketmakers'. They started to farm instead of hunting, made many crating ideas such as, the bow and arrow, pottery and a new type of spear thrower. They started to make houses with about 50 rooms connected with each other.  During A.D 1100 and A.D 1300 the population has reached several thousand. But by A.D 1300 the Civilization was abandoned because some theories suggested that they migrated because their was a drought and could not grow crops properly.       The lost city of Atlantis were a important find in history, because it    showed us that there might be a Greek City under the deep sea.   Archaeologists think it might have sunked in 1,000 B.C. It was founded 40 years ago by a British oceanographer. Its not until last year that modern technology could go beneath the sea to see how big was the city really was. Archaeologists believe it sunk by a earthquake or even a tsunami. It has yet to be Discover all the way down because archaeologists have only studied 1% of the worlds ocean floor.

Also, they might have found tools they used for cooking, and hunting, so they could find out what they used to survive.

Let's Start with the Incas. The Incas lived a long time ago in Ancient Peru where they were known as the Incan Empire. the Incas were the most powerful Empire in Peru before the Spaniards took over and Destroyed. After the Spaniard takeover, little is Left of the Incans. The only thing left of them are the assortment of weapons and stories they left behind.Treasure Hunters and Archaeologists still come to Peru to look for more hidden Treasure that the Incas left.                  Next we have the Anasis, or want we Usually call them The Puebloans. The Puebloans were a Acient Tribe who lived in North America right before the Spainards explored the place. The early Civilization of Puebloans lived in North America  for 1,400 Years in a place called Mesa Verde or 'Green Chair'. Also, The word Anasazi means ' The ancient ones' when translated to English.             Just Like the Incas, The Puebloans Had a lot of cool But old school weapons like Bows &amp; Arrows and Spears, which can still be Found Today. Scientist think that Puebloans Made baskets and were very good at making them too.                                                     They also lived in small Houses called Pit houses.In the Early 13th Century, The Puebloans Suddenly moved to different places. Scientists don't know where or why the Puebloans moved.Maybe they were Forced  By Spaniard Explorers to leave there homes and made them move to the Southern area Like New Mexico Or Arizona: or There was this huge Drought and the Puebloans Moved to a New Area.Like I said Before, Scientist are not so Certain where or why the Puebloans move and it's still a mystery.One thing for sure is that the Remaining Puebloans In North America May still live in Southeastern United States.           So far you've learned how the Incans and the Puebloans lived when they existed.

This article is about a diver explores the sunken in southern Greece. he finds out a secret of a lost city that may have inspired one of worlds most enduring myth. It was explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist anf marine geologist they were known as The pavlopetri. The sunken was settlement dates from back in the days, back some 5,000 years ago of the time or Homer's heroes . In terms of sizes and wealth or detail.  There was this man called 'Dr.Jon Henderson.' He was a associate professor of the underwater archaeology at a University of  the Nottingham. That university has been remained dating from 2800-1200 way longer before the glory days of classical Greece. This article is importion because it tell's you a whole lot of information about it and the things that happnedd back then in the day, and how important it ment to them and their people. They had found surpassed all expectation. The exploration revealed a wprld of building, courtyards, main streets, rock- cut tombs and also religious structrues. They also found 'ceramices' they dated back to the end of the stone age. the settlement were occpied  5,000 years ago, well at least 1,200 years earlier then they had thought. They also revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. There was something that had toke them by surprice , the discovery of a possible megaron, it was a monumental structure with a large rectagular hall, they also said that the town was been used by an elite. Elias Spondylis as who co-directed the survey as the head of Greece's underwater. as it represented a frozen moment of the past. A Theories includdes sea level's changes, the ground subsidence as the results of the earthquakes, or a tsunami.This was every likely of the first two. Locals is in teh nearby town of the Neapolis taht are selighted. This is the first time that a sunken city was founded in Greece that predates the time that plato wrote in his allegorical tale of the Sunken contient of atlantis.Atlantis was a myth but it was a myth that keeps underwater exploration going. Less then 1% of the world's ocean's floors have been surveyed , which its called an extraordinary find , but there are still a lot more down there that will have to be find. I really liked this story because it was enseration and it was giving me a whole lot of information that i really didnt even know about, i really did learn things out of this article.

In all of the storys they were great and powerfull pueblos,or even great towns,and cities and were fasninatied by the idea of one day finding out all the secrets that these cities have hidden. The main resoan the Incas moved out of is because they were almost forced out of their great city when the Spaniards killed their last king but what we know aint so much cause the Europeans who were the first people to encounter them and they were decribied only in the European diarys. But we have found many ancient artifacts that belong to the Incas and many other artifacts,even dead bodys one of the reasons that this is because the Incas would burie the dead on in caves or on the mountain tops because in the mountians the weather prevents the bodys from decomposing.And onother advantege to this is the looters won't get it so easly cause they were buried with things that they thought was needed in the afterlife.But the spaniards took over and rebuilded that city.               And the so called 'Puebloans' were extremly smart for they stated out with a special talent and made use of it for they were talented witth basket weaving and made houses out of it. Then in the future years they were advancing and learned how to made houses not underground but stable houses and had been able to make pottery,and they acuried the bow,and arrow witch was way more effective than a atlati or a spear.And eventualy people form teh village started to explore and move to other land up in the moutains. And they rest eventually moved to the mountains and had were called cliff dwellings.But they were so advanced in that they forgot or wo't that skilled as they were before in their basket weaving was poor and they eventualy were forced to move to new land cause one of the reasons was that hundreds of years of use of the lands they were noting left.And moved to a new land were otehr of tehir kind had settled and theyare now know as   Pueblo people and possible other tribes are decendients of Ancenstrial Puebloans from Mesa Verde.             And an acient city that may have sparked the atlantis myth was found last year of the coast of the southern Greece and was thought to be of a very big wealth and it covers over 30,000 spuare miles and their have been findings of it being more of 9,000 extra square miles witch contains a monumental hall.And many of the discoverys were preseved cause only one city inhabited it and the of many natural causes was sent underwater. Some of the findings were religious tombstone,pottery. But it is thought to be the oldest know city on earth and was only found fourty years after an arcialogist discovered it and they say that less than 1% of the ocean has been explored and hope to find moreout their.

The Ancient  Inca: Arceology Unlocks the Secret of the Wrold this article is important because they have discovered a acient civilization and some ways that they were. Their orgins are very difficult to trace though because many other people or civilizations have lived there. Some things they found about this civilization was how they kept track of their days and of life stock. They did not have regular calindards like us they used colorful stirings though today they dont know what each color stands for. That also helped them rule their empire from (138-1532).They left alot of valuable stuff like religon, art, arcetecture, transportation and their way of living.They are know today for their artifacts stones, pottery, gold and silver. They lived in the Andes and may have worshiped mountain peeks.That was also were they would berry people with things they would need for there net life. People have found clothe and personal belongins of them with helps us know about their ways of life and things.Archeologist found this civilization though though the way their last king was murderd by Spandiards in 1532. After the king was murderd they took over the empire.            The Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Unlocks the Secret of the Past is well known by archeologists for building homes and their pottery. Poblians were the first people to settle in Mesa Verde in A.D. 550. They were also known as Basketmakers. They were very well skilled at crafting. They began to lead a more formal way of life.They were two small viliges. In 750 A.D. they begasn building houses over ground made of poles and mud. In A.D 100 they changed their nway of building and making pottery for a way better way. They built each house against each other and were two or there stories high with all of the houses togeth they would be up to 50 rooms or more.Which is how i think we go the way and just changed it alittle of building houses. During their time in (1100- 1300)they were known in South America for their ranks among the finest expressin of human culture, though in the 1200s their luck wasnt so good. They started sufering of draughts and they couldnt farm anymore. that was like when their civilization kind of dissapeard. Archeologist dont kbnow more about them because they didnt leave any writtings, records, or personal things behind.               The Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. This is a unique city built long before Christe in 1200BC. 'This this the oldest submerged city in the wrold' said Dr. Jon Hensen. People beliveve that this city was consumed by the sea around 1000BC. They found a whole city like the ones here under water it has buildings courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. This is the first suncken city that has been found it is so much like ours but underwater. There has been earhquakes and things like that, that have happened and it hasnt been distroyed. There is still more things to find there.               This what archeologist have found all these old civilizations. these discoveries are very impotant in many diffrent ways like how the people were before us, what they used, what they wore, or what were their homes like, were they lived, how they comunicated. these things are important. All these stories have many important things that we should know.

People wondered about what acient civilications did in the past to learn how they live. Many  Acient Inca had knots called quipus to keep records of stuff like calendars and much other stuff. They say Atlantis is the most advanced and sefecient Anceint Civilication in the world because they say that they have buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock cut tombs, and religios sculpture. When the archeoligist found the lost city they found pieces of shatered potary and shattered clothing beneth the ocean level.            Atlantis was dating from 28,00 to 12,00 BC, long before Greece and Christ. That means it might of been the oldest civilication in the whole world. The Pueblanos were very good craftsmen and were known Basketmakers. What makes them interestine is that they farmed and made pithouses into a small village. The puebloans lerned how to make pottery and acuired the bow and arrow, a more difficult weapon for hunting that atlatl, a spear thrower.             Archeoligist are trying to find answers to anything about the lost civilisations and how they were built and how they were runed. The lost civlisations have good minds to built lost of things in the futer we can do. Like build houses, streets, religios things and so much things in the futer helps us do more things in the futer. The great discover of the 3 civllitasions was a succes because we finnally discoverd the truth about those myths people used to say about the lost civilications and towns in the past.

The findings showed how the Incans, Pueblans and the Pavlopetri lived. For example the incans used quipus or the colored strings to keep count of livestock and to keep records of something. The pueblans made pithouses which showed archaeologists what they lived in. The pavlopetri made a lot of structures like buildings, courtyards, tombs and religous structures, which showed what places they used during there day-to-day lives.       The findings also showed how advanced the civiliztions were. For instance the Incans' advanced technology was how they could live in such high mountains and run that big of a empire. Another example is the Pueblans' advanced technology which was how they made baskets. The Pavlopetris' advanced technology was all the buildings they made.       All in all the findings of the civilizations were very important for history and for archeaology.

I think they are very improtant. You get to understand how people lived back then, what they worshiped, objects that they left behind, and much more. Not everyday you see a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece,finding bodies in the Andes mountains, or find acient culture in Mesa Verde National park.        The ancient Inca of Peru had many important things for people to find. There were bodies in the Andes mountain that were in such good shape because the mountains acted like a giant freezer. Archaelologist can find out how people died back then and how they lived. Archaelogist found textiles and the type of clothes they wore.         Mesa Verde National park preserves a spectacular reminder of the ancient culter. People found out they lived in pithouses. Then they eventually started to build houses above the ground. They left behind baskets, stone, crafts, and etc. The people decided to move and no one knows why, but there was clift dwellings. No one would ever find out.         Not everyday you find a sunken settlement in the ocean. There is no doubt that its the oldest submerged town in the world. It revealed courtyards, buildings, main streets, rock cut tombs, and religious structures. The sumerged site was never reoccupied.

Finding lost cities may be rare, but they are very important to our history and teach us a lot about what life used to be like thousands of years ago.  Lifestyles have changed dramatically, and the lost cities of the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri contribute to the finding of ancient artifacts to lead to the conclusion of how our world has changed.             First, the lost city of the Incas taught us a lot of our past.  In kindergarten you learned the alphabet, and how to count.  Could you imagine not having a formal alphabet or writing system, how would you communicate with people other than talking? The Incas did not have an alphabet, and they used string and colored beads to record the calender and keep track of livestock.  We have also found a lot of clues about our past from the artifacts left behind in Incas time.  The objects found were artifacts made of pottery, silver, gold, or stone. Many Inca clothing and textiles have also survived, so we even have an idea of how our styles in clothing at jewelry have changed.             Second are the Pavlopetri group.  Their city was found sunken in water.  No one knows how or why it sunk but it has remains from 2800 to 1200 B.C.  it was discovered over 40 years ago, but examined this year.  Many building and artifacts such as pottery and clothing were found and preserved for later research.  Ceramics were found and dated back to the stone age, which suggested settlement was occupied 5000 years ago.  The salt water also preserved clothing really well, so this lost city taught us a lot about their styles too.             Lastly, is about the Puebloans. The Puebloans lived much differently from the Incas, but the objects found taught us some of the same stuff.  Out of the lost city of the Puebloans, archaeologists found houses that were lived in. People lived in pithouses from 550 to 750 A.D. They featured one room sunk in to the ground and supported by a roof.  There was a fireplace in most to keep warm.  Also found were building called Kivas.  They are ceremonial rooms usually used for churches. You entered on a ladder through a hole in the roof.  It also had a fire pit, a bench, and a ventilator.             In conclusion, lost cities really mean a lot to our world today.  Things are taught and found that we could have never imagined would ever be taught or found.  It is amazing learning about the changes our lifestyles, and our world have gone through in the years that have past.  Archaeologists have an important job of keeping us educated of our past, and thanks to lost cities and ancient artifacts, they are good at their jobs too. We can never learn everything about ancient times, but lost cities help us learn enough.

I think they are important because of thier artifacts, the way they lived, and how they vanished.                  The artifacts of these ancient places are very interesting.  The Inca made knots with strings called quipus to record their calender, in fact the first Europeans to meet the Incas where amazed to find that they could do this.  The Mesa Verde had pottery and the bow and arrow.  The Atlantis city had pottery, religious structures, and rock-cut tombs.                   The way these ancient races lived was way different then how we liv now.  The Incas lived on high in the Andes mountains and worshiped mountain peaks.  Mesa Verde either lived in pithouses,caves,or Kivas.  The Mesa Verde lived as farmers.  The Atlantis people live in buildings, or other structures.                    Now the most important fact, hoe these races vanished.  The Inca started to go away when the Spaniards killed their last emperor and took over the empire in 1532.  It was never known on how the Mesa Verde vanishied, it was thought that they had crop failure and migrated,or they had social and political problems and looked for opportunities elsewhere.  The Atlanis race may have disipered with the city.  There are theories that suggest an earthquake or tsumai hit the city, but it is never known.                    I think these are the reasons why these finding by archeaogist are the greatist findings ever by them.  Perhaps somday in the future they could find more clues to these answers.

These discoveries are very important to us because it teaches us about our past and it helps us piece together what their lives were like before the technological advancements that we have today. The three civilizations I have studied are the Incas, the Pueblons, and the Pavlopatri. All are from different places and all are different with something in common, that they all hold knowledge of how people used to live at one point and in a certain place.        The Incas, llived in the mountains, in South America. Going to their long abandoned home has given light to the subject, that their life's are so unique to the others of their era. They had advancements that we didn't believe to be available during that time like how they kept record on a piece of string with knots. This is important because we know more about some peoples ancestors.        The Pueblons were a civilization that was once nomads but settled at mesa verde. This was an important place to find because we know that they were smart enough to build houses with fire pits and other things that we have resemblance to today. This would be very interesting to learn if you were their descendant.        The Pavlopatri was a Greek city, before it became below sea level. This city is interesting because no one knows how it became an underwater city, and because there are still some artifacts that haven't been ruined by the water. This can help us learn not only about the Greeks but about geographical issues with water that can possibly happen again.        All of these cities have given us a clue to life back when they were modern. Even though all of these were from different places, they all gave us knowledge. The more we find out about ancient civilizations the closer we will be to finding more about our history.

They lived in high mountains, or in bustling cities, or in remote villages. But they all had one thing in common. They are all dead now. You heard me. Dead. All of them.   But it's what left behind that really matters to us. They left behind the means to understand them, and gain knowledge from them, even if they didn't plan to.   This is why we have archaeologists, explorers, adventurers, etc. They all dig up and find hidden information that none of us knew about to help us understand that civilization and produce new ways to give us new ideas to put in motion.   That is what researching ancient civlizations is all about.

'Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how people died' stated by Beth Gruber described how cold these remote location are and how brutal they can be between life or death.  But, these specific locations helped the Incas' from invaders.        Also, in hunting the Puebloans lived in region where farming replaced hunting more. Mentioned by Roy Anderson that 'They learned to make pottery and acquire the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting that the atlatl, a spear thrower.'  This statement says that hunting got more advanced when the bow and arrow first came. Hunting became more efficient but later declined after it was replaced by farming.  They soon disappeared after farming became more effective.           Finally, in the disappearance of a Greek city was finally awaken questions were asked.  Whether this was the center point of the Greek myth 'Atlantis'.  No one has a clue why the settlement sank under the sea.  Marine Geologist try to predict with various experiments why, when, and how this city sank beneath the ocean. Said by Sakellariou 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going.'  He refers to the fact that fewer than one percent of the world's ocean floor has ever been surveyed.  The mysteries of land and sea have yet to been fully understand.        In conclusion all these articles have a common point of how they lived, hunted, and disappeared without remarks.  These mysteries have yet been solved but, in the future will soon foretell these tragedies with predictions.  Throughout thousands of years modern society still have not given up on how to test the ancient civilizations facts and opinions made my archeologists.

Archaeologists studies of the   Unlocks Secrets to/of the Past. They [archeologists] will tell us facts that have been proven  of the Inca's writing system, artifacts, a little of how they lived, Puebloans, Cliff Dwellers, and Lost Greek city inspired Atlantis myth.           The Inca's of Peru had no formal alpahabet or writing system. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. The very first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. The Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery. Clues left behind by the Inca form ana mazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Some of the old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.            About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of theis ancient culture. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D 550. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. These were fairly prosperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied.            Cliff Dwellers, ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, arecheologists have sought to understand these people's lives. The structures are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on form generation to generation. When the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, the traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who already there.Whatever happened, some Pueblo people today, maybe other tribes, are descendants of the Ancesral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.            A diver explores the sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. Secrets of the lost city have inspired one of the world's most inspring myths. ' The Fable of Atlantis' is one of the myths. The sunken settlement dates back to 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. The area there, is about 30,000 sqaure meters of ocen floor off the southern Peloponnese, Consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C. It was the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece predates the times that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.

We have learned their ways by artifacts left behind by the incas. Some of what we know comes from stories passed from generations. Also from oral history. Some Incan textile and clothing have been left behind as well. Historians have to be careful when the interpret these accounts though. Not all who visited the incas spoke their language, so some of the information may not be accurate. Some incan sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, stealers who take anything that seems and is valuable.

These ancient civilizations include the Inca, Mesa, and underwater city of Atlantis. The powerful Incan empire ruled fornearly a hundred years(1438-1532). Since the Inca had no formal alphabet, they made knots in colored strings to keep records for the entire empire. Some of the Inca artifacts left behind include objects made form stone, pottery, gold, or silver. They might turn up in the ruins of buildings or buried in graves. Some of their textiles and clothes have survived well. Cloth was preserved in dry deserts or cold mountains. Some Inca treasure sites have been disturbed by looters, looking for anything valuable. Archaeologists study sites carefully and record everything to learn as much information as they can from evidence. They then can compare what they learn with the Spaniards' information about the Inca. They lived high in the Andes Mountains in remote places, such as caves or mountaintops. These cold peaks have acted like a giant freezer by preserving bodies and artifacts. These reveal more clues about their civilization and lifestyle.                   About 1,400 years ago, a group of people, later known as the Anasazi, chose to live in Mesa Verde. They eventually built complex stone communities in the sheltered canyon walls. The first Ancestral Puebloans, known as Basktmakers for their craft skills,  came to Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. Now they were farming for their main survival instead of hunting and gathering. They learned how to make pottery and made the first bow and arrow, which replaced the atlatl(a spear thrower.) They lived in pithouses, which later evolved into kivas. About A.D. 750, they began building above ground houses and were known as Puebloans. By A.D. 1000, they had advanced to skillful stone building. The Cliff Dwellers built citys beneath overhanging cliffs. They built with sandstone, mud and water. By A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted.              The underwater city of Atlantis was proven to exist off the coast of Greece by a British oceanographer. It is the oldest submerged town in the world. Shifting sands have allowed marine archaeologists to properly survey the ruins with digital technology. It revealed buildings, courtyards, tombs, and religious structures. The seabed also held thousands of pieces of pottery.

But what if I told you that archeaologists have found things that may have lead to the making of the myth of Atlantis? Yes, its true. Archeaologists have uncovered a sunken Greek city and believe this was the beginning of the stories of Atlantis. But, why study an ancient city that is underwater? The answer is quite simple-the people from the past may have known things that we do not know now. Why is it so important to know about lost cities? Well, lost cities may contain information that can help with science, medicine, culture, and other topics.       But Atlantis was not the only lost civilization. There were also the Incas. Most of the knowledge of ancient Inca is mostly told by recovered artifacts. Most Inca artifacts are made of stone, pottery, silver or gold-items that last a long time. But why collect artifacts? Well, they can tell you about the writing system, music, art, and other lost treasures.       Then there were the Puebloans. Most of them were basketmakers. They learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, which was more effective than the atlatl, or, spear thrower. They lived in pithouses, in-ground homes. Later, pithouses evolved into kivas. When the Puebloans left Mesa Verde, they settled in New Mexico and Arizona.

Their civilization only lasted for nearly a hundered years and ruled a South American empire. Some of the inca life we knew before we found more of the books we knew from stories passed down to person from long ago. when we found the inca we could not understand their language or read it. The rest of the knowledge we have of the inca is the object, artifacts, and books they left behind. The incas fell when the Spaniards murdered the inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. The inca trace went gone probaly cause the spanish took all their stuff and left. The incas lived in the andes and may have even worshiped some mountain peaks.       In source 2 I saw that the Puebloans made houses in pits called 'pithouses' and had a little fire in the middle of the house. they had these houses for two-hundred years. In 750 they began to make houses above ground whith upright walls made of poles and mud. the houses were in curving rows often with a pithouse in front of them. soon they made the houses more protective and made them stone. they made kivas in 1100 and 1300. the kivas are churches that people prayed for rain, luck in hunting or a good crop. they built fires in the summer mainly for cooking.       In source 3 the city of atlantis I think is in the southern waters of greece. the sunken settlement dates back some 5000 years to the time of homers heros. the city is the most oldest one submerged. the site which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is belived to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C.   Thanks to shifting sands archaeologist found buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. They also found thousands of shards of pottery around the area.

Like the Inca is from Peru and had no formal alphabet or a system of writing. They did not know if they left anything behind or if they did. The Inca made a string called the quipus to record a calender to keep count of their lifestock. The first Europeans to to meet the Inca were amazed how they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records.   So how do we know about this civilization? We think that it was told by there family until these days. This culture ruuled the South American empire that rivaled the expanse of Ancient Rome. The Inca lived in high up houses that were called the Andes. Most of their sites are in remote, high places.   High-altitude archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all of their equipment up a mountain before they can start there discovery. Some bodies were found on cold mountains that act like a huge freezer. Bodies that were found in the icy Andes were in such good shape that the archaelogists could use modern medical scanning on the bodies to learn how the Inca's died. The bodies also reveal information about how they live in their cultures.   About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans arrived and explored North America, a group of people that lived in the corner were called the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde as their home. For over more than 700 years ago they're descendents lived and flourished here. Eventually building stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. In the late A.D. 1200s, the span of a new generation left their homes and moved away.   The Mesa Verde park is a reminder of the spectacular reminder of the ancient culture. Archaelogists called these people Anasazi, from the Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or ' ancient enemies.' Now these days people call them Ancestral Puebloans. The very first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in A.D. 550. they are known as the Basketmakers for their really good skill at crafting.   These people lived in pithouses  from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, as they settled agriculture, began. The pithouse had a feautured living room that sunk in a few feet into the ground. Four Corner timbers supported the roof. They had a firepit that had a deflectror. An antechamber was to contain storage bins or pits. The sipapu was a hole for a passage to the underworld, from which they came from. Pithouses later became envolved into kivas.       The secrets of a lost city have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths- the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off of Southern Greece. It was explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of the Homer's heroes and in terms of the size and the wealth, the detail is unprecedent, experts say.   This site is straddled for about 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off the Southern Peloponnese, is belived to have been consumed by the sea around 1000BC. Although it was discovered by a oceangrapher some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, they were able to search the ruins.   Henderson said, 'We found ceramics dating back to the end of the grey stone age, and suggested the settlement that was occupied about 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought.' Henderson co-directed the underwater search. ' Our investigations also revealed about over 9,000 square meters of the new buildings. But what really took us by surprise was the discocery of a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, that also suggests the town had been used by an elite, and automatically raised the status of the settlement.'                                                                                                                                                                                                         hi :) 	LS NNP NNP NNP PRP VBP IN DT NNP NNPS VBP DT NNS WDT NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ JJ CC NNP NNP DT NNP VBZ IN NNP CC VBD DT JJ NN CC DT NN IN NNP NNP VBD RB VB IN PRP VBP NN IN CC IN PRP NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN VBN DT NN TO VB DT NN TO VB NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP JJ NNPS TO TO VB DT NNP VBD VBN WRB PRP MD VB DT JJ NN VBG NNS TO VB NNP NNP WRB VBP PRP VB IN DT NN .

The reason they are so important is because they help us learn about the past. Archaeologists can piece together details of the people who lived before us by studying artifacts that they left behind. Discoveries made about the Inca, the Pueblanos, and the Pavlopetri have helped us understand ancient ways of living.                Archaeologist found out that the Inca made knots in colorful string to keep track of their livestock and to record their calender. To this day no one knows what these stories tied in knots really mean. Most of the information we know about the Incas is from what the Spaniards wrote about them. If we hadn't found the letters and diaries the Spanish soldiers and priests wrote we wouldn't know about the Incas. The cold weather up in the Andes preserved bodies from the Inca civilization. Scientists can use modern technology to find out why the person died. The dry deserts in Peru have also preserved clothing that the Inca wore. If we hadn't found any artifacts like statues, clothes, pottery, or jewelry, we wouldn't know anything about the Incas.                The Pueblanos from Mesa Verde were skilled basket makers. How do we know this? We know this because of the baskets they left behind. Archaeologists learned how the Pueblanos made their houses. They made their houses with poles and mud, but soon advanced to skillful stone masonry. When local cowboys reported cliff dwellings in the 1800's, archaeologist were determined to understand these peoples lives. However, we still don't know the whole story since the Pueblanos never left any written documents. Even the evidence archaeologists gathered seems sketchy.  We still don't know why they disappeared, but there are some theories. These theories include, crop failures, social and political problems ,and droughts.                 Many people are intrigued by lost cities. The lost city of Atlantis is one of them. However this particular lost city isn't Atlantis. A team of Anglo-Greek archaeologists and marine geologists explored the sunken settlement. They found thousands of shards of pottery along the seabeds.  They also found main roads, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. From this we can see how they built their cities in the past and we can also learn about their religion. Theories of why the Greek city sunk include, sea level changes, ground subsidence, or a tsunami.                 All of the things that the archaeologists found has helped us learn more about the past. We have found out so much from the things that they have found. We now know about ancient architecture, religion, art and living styles.               	JJ NNS WRB VBP JJ NNS IN JJ .

For example Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus and in each each colorful string shows a story full of mystery and surprises. But we still haven't found the answer to the mysteries that lay behind this quipus. Archaeologists also found Inca textiles and clothing left behind in the dry desers on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. This was a surprise because many Inca clothing was destroyed by dampness. Archaeologist also found bodies on top of the mounatin cliffs of the Andes, this bodies were remarkly found in good shape in which now they could scan those bodies using modern day medical technology and learn how this people died and how they live.       The Inca Pt. 2:Now in day archaeologist could use aerial photography to find patterns on the ancient monuments instead of seeing nothing on the ground. This Incla discoveries are very important because we would know how they live, how they dress, their religion and how far were they from our technology. But there is still so much to be learn from this civilization like what does those colorful strings mean is a time of tragedy, drought or a time of happiness. I guess someday we wil figure it out.       The Puebloans: We learned a lot about the Puebloans, so much but we still have two questions to answer. One of those questions is that why did the Mesa Verde desserted there settlement On A.D 1300's? The other question is we will never know who lived there? Because they never wrote records, the only thing they found was this magnifecent buildings. Archaeologist have found arts and crafts made this people, in which this was a extradionary find.        The Puebloans Pt. 2:They also found Kiva which meant a Ceremonial room. Archaeologists alos found pottery and buildings that arose to a anormeous height of 2 or 3 stories high in which it occupied 50 rooms or maybe even more. Many archeologists found pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recess. They also found pottery and bow and arrows in which they use to hunt because it was a better for hunting then just a atlatl, a spear thrower. But theres two main questions missing. Why did the people desserted the settlement on A.D 1300's? The other question is who live there?       The Pavlopetri: Also known as the people of Atlantis. Atlantis was a civilization that thought that never existed, but now in day technology, we know it did existed and we know it dates form 2800 to 1200 BC. We also now that this is one of the most unique planned out towns that we had ever found. This imaginary world unfolds a world of buildings, courtyard, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. But in a sudden surprise we also found thousands of shards of pottery.       The Pavlopetri Pt 2:But we know it was built around a protective bay and back then our grand parents say it did existed and now we could support that comment. This settlement was found off southern Greece. But there is still one more mystery left to uncover and it is how did this magnifesint settlement sank? Is it because of sea level changes, ground subsidence, earth quakes, or a tsunami. I guess thats one mystery that we have to look forward to.

The myth of the lost city of Atlantis could or could no be true but archaeologist are trying to find out. The are also trying to study about the Ancient Incas and the Ancestral Puebloanos .                            The Incas made colorful stings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Some Europeans were amazed how they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archeologist have found many quipus but no one understands how to read the knots and what they mean and for us it is like a mystery. The Incas left many clues behind such as portraits of their religion, art and architecture, and their way of life. Most visitors were Spanish soldiers and priest and they would describe the Inca in letters and diaries, but some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history. Archaeologist have also found bodies and they can reveal information about how they lived.                  The Ancestral Pueblanos were known as basket makers for their skill at the craft. They did not have to hunt instead they used farming as their main livelihood. They would live in pit houses clustered into small villages and usually built them on mesa tops or sometimes in cliff recesses. Archeologists found basket and they show evidence of decline in quality.  Archeologist have sought to understand these people's lives, but despite decades of excavation, analysis, classification but still scientific knowledge remains sketchy. They left no written records and much was important in their lives has perished.                    The lost city of Atlantis is one of the most enduring myths. An Angl-Greek team of archeologist and marine geologist explored the sunken settlement. This is the oldest submerged town in the world. Archeologist  a world  of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. They also found the seabed  replete with thousands of shards of pottery. Marine geologist have yet to work out why the settlement sunk, it could of been an earthquake or tsunami that caused this as of right now it still remains a mystery.                     As you can see there are still a lot to uncover. We don't really know a lot of things it's all up to the future geologist, scientist, and historians to find out what happened.

The great thing about this means there is tons of great facades,and ancient cities that nobody can know about and understand. You have probally heard stories about lost cities and places underwater that noone knows about. Well likely it's true. ''But dont think this is true because I believe it's true,think it is true because you believe it is true''. Why dont you go out there and start exploreing the world, you never know what you might find out in the world today. There is so much unexplored land and water that the possabilities are endless. Have you ever had that belief or feeling in your gut that tells you I want to find out more about this. If you have that gut feeling that something is right I would listen to it if iI were you. Do not deny the feeling but 90% of the time I believe that feeling is right. Never second guess yourself when you feel something is right. If you love History and want to be a Historian you have to have that gut feeling and trust it. In Conclusion never say never and you never know what you might accomplish in life.Believe in something and go out their and chase it.

The discovery of Inca was a good discovery because it showed us how this old country was able to run or  keep up with records by using strings. To this day most likely nobody knows what these strings mean.Also its good because through clues we can see what  religion they worshiped also we can see the way of life that they had.Also the bodies that the experts found can help research what sickness they had or what they went through which could explain why the citiy died off.            Ancestral Puebloans was also a very important find as well because it could have been the place that skill of crafts men came from because they were know for there basketmakers.They replaced hunting with famering which they gatherd and used as thier main livelhood, Also they learned how to make pottery which we today have some what alot of.Then they houses out of mud and made them side by side which we can see through history thta this was not the only time that houses were made or built like this,which we benifited from.There population grew and grew pass the thousands and along with that they skills grew to all but the basket makeing which they were know for which is most likely because of thier advancement in pottery.The Puebloans were also know for there cliff dwellers who really proved to be smart because they used thier enviroment to the full by building there dwellings under the overhanging cliffs.So we can see the Puebloans advancments and much more in a way helpd us get to were we are today.       The Pavlopetri is a lost city remains of this city have been found under water and is said to be the oldest submerged town in the world.It straddles 30,000 square meters on the ocean floor said to have been consumed by the sea more than 1000 BC. Although found 40 years ago it was only this year it could be properly surveyd and thabks to the sand on the bottom of they sea the enclosure was protected to today.

It has been discovered that the Incans used strings to record the calender and keep track of livestock. This is important to know  because we might want to do that ourselves.         The Peublo were interesting people. They lived in caves in walls. The discovery of baskets made by the Peublo people are important. They show us that they were good basket-makers. Since they were good basket-makers, they must have been smart.          The Palvopetri city is interesting. It is underwater. It is one of the oldest underwater cities in the world.

Don't you want to l eave something behind and have your great great grandchildren find it?         The Inca of Peru didn't have and leave a formal alphabet or system of writing for historians to study, the Inca used colored strings with knots to keep count of livestock, and keep records. Archaeologists have found many of these quipus, but they still haven't found the meaning of the knots. Clues left behind from Inca tell us that they were very religious, and artistic, they did architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and just lived their daily lives. Pottery, gold, and silver were all left behind such as textiles, and clothing which gives a clue on their way of life.         The Puebloans were known for their basket makers, skill, and craft. They had more of a settled life, and were nomadic people. People lived in pit houses which contained of storage bins and/or pits. They left no written records, and we will never know their whole story.         The Pavlopetri, was sunken back 5,000 years ago. They found buildings, courtyards, tombs, religious structures, and main streets. Archaeologists also discovered shards of pottery which gives of a clue of their interests and belief.        Having pieces of ancient history, is very important. It gives archaeologists a grasp on their daily lives and their culture.

They didn't have the luxuries that we have today: iPhones, PlayStation 3, Xbox- they had simple wooden toys. Archaeologists are people that go out to find these things, and bring them back to get studied.       The archaeologists have gone to the old site of the Incan civilization. There, they found quipus, which was their idea of a calculator. the Inca left behind a lot of information, which helps us find out who they were. Some of what we know about the Incans was passed on by stories. The Inca ruled for almost 100 years, just to be destroyed by the Spaniards. But they left behind a very important legacy, which makes them important.       In Mesa Verde national park, Archaeologists have discovered more artifacts from a different race of people, known as the Ancestrial Puebloans. They lived in Mesa Verde for about 1700 years, and then moved on to a different area. They built pithouses, which were hpuses that were sunken into the ground a few feet, and invented the bow and arrow. Eventually, their houses went from being dirt and wood to stone, and cities were built. Archaeologists have found a lot of baskets and other small items here.       Finally, we have the Pevlopetri, a city that sank underwater in Greece a few thousand years back. I am going to refer to it as Atlantis because this is the city that supposedly inspired that myth. And Atlantis is easier to say. The city dates back 5000 years-Homer's time. The city is 30,000 square meters, and is full of artifacts. Atlantis is full of buildings, gardens, courtyards, tombs, and some religious structures. The city is believed to sink around 1000 BC. Pottery that dates back to the srone age was found. The archaeologists also found a megaron, which would have been used by the Elite, which would have raised the town's status. This is the first underwater city found that dates back to before Plato's famous tale.       These three civilizations have provided doorways into the past, but there is still a lot of world out there to be explored. We have only explored 1% of the ocean floor, so there could be a lost country out there and don't even know it. The world may never know a few things, such as 'What did the dinosaurs look like?' 'Were ancient people nice?' That's what archaeologists are trying to find out.             	NNP PRP RB VBN WP NNS JJ NNS IN VBD IN . WP PRP VBD IN PRP$ JJ NN .

We learn what we know about the past from discovering ancient artifacts or buildings and anything that had writings or pictures.  We can learn how people lived back then by observing these objects and artifacts.                                The discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri are important because we can learn how they lived and what happened to them.            Archaeologists have found many artifacts of the Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.  They have found Inca bodies that are frozen and can determine how they lived and how they died.  Historians have found pithouses and kivas from the first Ancestral Puebloans that show us that they advanced their technology.  Geologists have found many artifacts of the Pavlopetri such as many buildings, courtyards, main streets, and religious structures.            Historians have found some clues about what happened to the Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.  They know that the Incas were killed by Spaniards in 1532 and the Spaniards took over the empire.  The Ancestral Puebloans had crop failures and their land's resources were depleted so they moved into New Mexico and Arizona.  The Pavlopetri's settlement sank due to an earthquake and/or a tsunami.                                	WRB VBP PRP VB WP PRP VBP IN DT JJ .

Archaeologists have developed many ideas and theories about how these three tribes about how they have lived and developed in the past. Each of these three groups have different unique ideas ideas about each. They each have developed different houses, tools, weapons, religous ceremonies, and much more. Even though all these three tribes have not survived to this day, they were all very succesful in the past.                       The Inca was a very succesful tribe living in the Andes Mountains in what is today known as what is Peru. Although the Inca left no archieves for historians to study, archaeologists have figured out hw to read the quipus, which are colorful knots made by the Inca to record the calender to keep count of livestock. There civilizatrion lasted from 1438 to 1532, and they ruled the South American empire. Many clues have been left by the Inca which gave us ideas about their religion, art, and way of life. Much of what we know now about the Inca has come from oral history or or stories that have been passed down.                           The Puebloans were a very succesful group of people, who chose to live in the region kown as Mesa Verde in North America. They lived in North American hundreds of years before the Europeans came. They lived here for more than seven hundred years and there people flourished here. The first settlers that lived in Mesa Verde, replaced hunting with farming, and were known as a very peaceful group of  people. They were known for their great skill and technique of basketmaking and other crafts, such as pottery and weaving. They also made a more efficent hunting tool called the bow and arrow than the usual a spear thrower. Also they lived in pithouses which consisted of a living room, and a firepit. Then in late A.D. 1200s, this great civilazation, left their homes, and moved away.                            In Southern Greece, the secrets of  a lost city may have inspired one of the worl's most famous myths, the fable of Atlantis. This civilazation dates back five thousand years. Archealogists know almost nothing about this civilazation, but they have started searching. This is one of the oldest suberged towns in the world. It has remains dating back to 1200 BC. There is much more to be figured out anout this tribe.                             All in all these three tribe have had there glory days, and know it is to us to figure out about the history thay provide. They each are very unique and different from each other. Archeologists have much more to figure out about these three fantastic civilazations.

They did not leave archives for historians to study but they made knots in colored strings. The knots were called quipus and they were used to record the calander to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but even today no one knows what these knots mean. Clues were left behind the Inca and form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, goverment, transportation, and way of life. The Inca has its history and stories passed from generation to generation. We know some stories beacause they were written ba Eurepeans. They described the Inca in letters and diaries. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well so they couldn't understand what the Inca told them. Some Inca stories were legends rather than history. Archaeologists who study sites keep careful records like writing down and photographing any artifacts they find.

Evidence of their art, religion, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life was also left behind. Much of the information we have discovered on the Incan civilization comes from stories that were written down in their records or passed down from generation to generation. Historians have to treat every single artifact with care in the hope that nothing is permanently damaged. Pottery, gold, and silver are such artifacts that archaeologists have found within the tombs of ones who have died or in the ruins of ancient buildings. Some incan textiles were surprisingly in great condition while others have faded away or broken into pieces, depending on the weather surrounding the objects. Many artifacts have also been taken/looted by people passing by which does little to help the archaeologists. When artifacts are taken by an archaeologist, they often compare them to other items that have been taken around the same area. when archaeologists do find special, peculiar artifacts, they must be careful carrying the items down the freezing mountain for study to preserve the items. Bodies are also some of the artifacts that are found within the mountains. By being able to take these bodies into study, it helps archaeologists find out the reasons for why/ how they died.

The article above have shown the myth of lands that were once there but are now wsaid to be gone. We live in a world where we must know the new technology or even the past history so that we learn from our mistake but we dont know anything about about some land that are gone now. For example, Alantis, we all know that alantis is a lost city that may have been real, but without knowing if it were truelly real! We dont know. if it were real how or why did it sink. without knowing this piece of information, we will not be able to learn from our mistakes. what type of mistakes did the people from Atlantis make to end up dieing. Another thing we will never learn is if they had advace technology at there time or were they using what the other historic people were using. If only we could find a piece of artwork, clothing or even food from the poeple that lived in alantis we would be able to tell what kind of people they were whta they wore or even a minor piece of object like a toy would help us find out even a little how or what we must or must not do.

The artifacts found on the ruins of ancient showed what type of clothings the Incans wore and how the climates were. Archaeologists also found textiles and objects that could probably be made of stone, pottery, gold, and silver. The Publeoans were known for their skill of basketmaking. The Publeoans also created how to make pithouses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the knowledge of bow and arrow, instead of spears. The find of Pavlopetri dated back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented.

Also in finding these artifacts, ruins, and structures is important to learn from the past and not make the same mistakes as they did. For example in source number 3 the Atlantic people were demolished by a serious of massive earthquackes.       Another important reason in finding things from ancient civilizations is that it can tell us about things they ate and climates back in the A.D's. Scientist can learn alot from these groups of acient civilizations because maybe there is a atroied seen back in 1000 A.D that can come back and hit us at any moment.       In conclusion findings from acient civilazations can be very important to modern day Earth.

In the late 1500's the Incans were settling in the high Andes and may have worshipes many peaks. Many of the Incan sites were located very high up in the mountains. This makes it difficult for the acheologist to discover the incan territories. The bodies that are found also help reveal information about how the Incans lived. They then moved away in 1200 A.D.       The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about in 550 A.D. they were known as very skilled workers in the basket making and craft making industries. They also learned how to make pottery, bow and arrows, and more efficient weapons such as a spear thrower for hunting animals. Puebloans had also made little houses to make  a living in they were called pithouses. In the pithouses there were fireplaces,storage bins, and there was also a sipapu (a hole for a  passage to the underworld, from which the people had to come.)   By A.D. 750 they began builing houses above ground  with upright walls made of poles and mud.They used to build the houses one against  eachother in long,curving rows, usually with a pithouse in front. Later pitthouses turned into kivas. People of Mesa Verde had an advancement of pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. By 1200 A.D. the population grew to an abundance size!    During the summer fire was usually used for cooking.     In conclusion are later ancestors set an example for us humans today and made us who we are today. If archeologist didnt discover these artifacts who knows what we would have to this day.

Through these cultures we can learn about their architecture, religion, economy, and even how they lived out their average lives.

The Inca did not have an official system of writing, or archives for future scientists to examine. Instead, they used colors string with knots to hold massive amounts of data from all over their lands. Among the huge amounts of these ropes archaeologists have found, no one knows what they actually represent or mean. This leaves scientists everywhere with a mystery, but it's not just the Inca. Civilizations all over the world leave undecipherable text, but examining artifacts and material objects that the ancients might have used daily can give us a clue as to how they lived hundreds of years ago. Uncovering these ancient mysteries is a priority to understand our ancestors better.                        Up in the Andes mountains in South America, the Inca thrived despite the unforgiving weather and terrain. They used a plethora of innovative farming, hunting, building, and organization techniques but were put down by Francisco Pizarro and his Spanish army. However, they only took the valuables in plain sight, leaving the more durable artifacts for us to study. Not only were artifacts found, but the land was left near untouched even though the weathering and erosion was inevitable.These records mistakenly left behind by the Inca are crucial to discover how they lived their everyday lives. This way, we, as the modern population, can learn from their mistakes and not lose our progress in one mistake.                 The Puebloans at Mesa Verde thrived in alcove in a massive cliff face until around 1300 A.D. The Puebloans thrived in this environment, despite the high elevation and difficulty to gather necessary supplies. Mesa Verde was the home of nomads starting to establish a permanent settlement. They were skilled craftsmen and learned to make pottery, bows and arrows, and spears. By examining the Ancestral Puebloans' homes called 'pit-houses' scientists have discovered smoke-blackened walls, showing that they can create fire and might have burned down homes during the cold, crisp winter months. The main mystery about their civilization is why they left their settlement. Nobody knows if the crops did not grow, if a massive drought occured, or if the natural resources around the area were entirely used up. They might have had social differences or decided to move to a new region. Whatever the reason, it leaves us to marvel at their amazing cliff-side homes and examine the ancients' lives.                Off the coast of southern Greece, a recent discovery was found that might have fueled the myth of 'The Lost City of Atlantis'. The city is definitely the oldest sbmerged settlement in the world, dating back to 2800 B.C., the Classical Greek era. The 30,000 square meter ruin has provided a great deal of information to archaelogists to geologists everywhere. It is believed to have been flooded around 1000 B.C., insisting there was a large flood and more land. Scinetists have discovered large amounts of broken pottery on the sea floor and a megaron, meaning the city was used by nobles and elites of society. The city hold a frozen moment of the past, preserved by the sea, of all things.              Studying minor historical settlements is just as important as studying the widely-known ones. Sometimes they grant a gift like being the oldest submerged city, or how astonishing their architecture was. These civilizations can us a great deal about what life was like all over the world in the past. Studying their mistakes and lifestyles can help us better prepare if history repeats itself.

Uncovering information about people that lived on Earth before us can help us compare and contrast the past and the future. The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are arguably some of the most important discoveries of the ancient world.          Archaeologists have scavenged the globe for bits and pieces of our ancestors. They use special tools and techniques to help dig up artifacts. The Inca are one of the civilizations they have uncovered. The Inca civilization was unique in the way that it kept track of records, like calenders or the number of livestock someone owned. The Incan people had no formal writing system, instead they tied knots into strings to count numbers. The Incas show us that there is always a way to get something done, no matter how difficult the task may seem. They are also en example of how evolved people at that time might have been. To learn about the Incas' every day lives, Archaeologists can study artifacts, listen to stories that have been passed down from generation to generation, or even read notebooks that were left behind by the Spaniards. These discoveries help us in the present day by telling us what the ancient Incans might have done to survive.          1,400 years ago, Mesa Verde was occupied by the people now known as Puebloans or 'village dwellers'. The Puebloans lived in cliff alcoves. They left no written records and most artifacts hey might have left behind have perished. However, the Puebloans left archaeologists another great insight to their lives: their homes. The structures that the Puebloans lived in have provided archaeologists today with clues to how these people lived and thrived. They not only show us what kind of houses they built, but also what kind of things they did, what kinds of materials they had available to them, what they cooked, and even where they slept. They also provide a little insight as to what civilizations in similar geographical areas may have worn because of the similar weather.          The Pavlopetri are one of the most unusuall civilizations in the according to many archaeologists. The Pavlopetri were not destryoed by a conqueror, nor did they move to another area. The Pavlopetri, for a reason that historians have yet to decide, fell into the waters off the coast of Southern Greece. This sunken civilization has shown researchers how earthquakes, sea level changes, and tsunamis can change the geographical look of a town or even a whole city. What archaeologists have found in the waters of this ancient city is astonishing. The water has acted as a sort of camera, keeping everything picture perfect and without change.          Every archaeologist dreams of discovering an artifact that will continue to teach the people today about the past. The Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri are important in how they have shed light on the past and have helped us better understand our ancestors.

The Incas did not have a writing system, which made it difficult to learn about them. The Incas left behind paitings of religion, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. By studying these portraits archaeologist were able to discover more about the Incas. Archeaologist also found many artifacts that helped them learn more about the Incas.

When we usually hear about what they have found we see them as pointless things but, really they're an important part of our daily lives. They teach us about religion, culture, and what our ancestors went through in order to survive. Our ancestors help us learn and progress throughout the years.       Paintings, pottery, and money help us with figuring out what they believed in, what god they worshiped. Most paintings would portray something about a might god that would help them through trouble. Pottery usually would have small drawings in on the outside, usually of hunting, or daily task they had to go through. Coins were found in the Inca territory, maybe that was there way of using money.      Buildings in the lost city of Atlantis were discovered, they way they built stuff could also have a big impact on how we build buildings now. Colosseum built in the Puebloan territory could be the reason why we have stadiums, churches, or houses.     We never really realize what our ancestors left behind help us grow. What they leave us may help with making technology better. It's fascinating to know that we have grown so much and learned from out mistakes just through simple objects like a pot.

One example of this is that ancient Incas of peru is that they had no systems of writing and formal alphabet. Another thing this mention is that archaeologists found some clues about the Incas of Peru. Also we know more about their religion, art, goverment, transportation, and way of life.       In source two it mentions Ancestral peubloans and cliff dwellers . In this the Ancestral Puebloans living on Mesa Verde. It also mentions how they moved south to go to New Mexico and Arizona. They moved there to go settling among their kin that were already there.           The lost city of Atlantis is just a myth that keeps underwater exploring going. A British oceanographer discoverd Atlantis forty years ago. If it weren't for marine biologists and digital technology Atlantis would not even be discovered.       Now that we have archaeologists we can see the history of ancient civilizations. About how they lived, religion, art and archetecture, and etc. If they hadn't left clues behind we wouldn't be able to discover the past.

These places of the bast have helped us in where we are today. If we didn't have these findings we may have made the same mistakes, and not been able to function in government. The Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important to our history.                   Ancient Inca was apart of the world in 1438-1532 in ancient Rome. They had no formal alphabet or system of writing. However, they did have a calendar. They used colored strings, quipus, to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Some of what we know from Inca has been passed down from generations. In 1532 they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire. We also know a lot about Inca because of the artifacts left behind such as, pottery, silver, gold, textiles, and sometimes clothing. Since the Inca's lived in the Andes they may have worshiped the mountain peaks. The fall of the Inca was in 1532 when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king.                       The  Peubloans lived about 1,400 years ago, living in the four corners region. They were known for there skills and craftswork. Puebloans did more farming than hunting. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages. They also learned to make pottery. In the late A.D. 1200s, they left there homes and moved away.                         The Peloponnese is believed to have been consumed by an ocean in 1000BC. They discovered many buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. similar to others they also had pottery. The Peloponnese was off the tip of Greece. There was over 9,000 square miles of buildings! There was also a discovery of a possible megaron,monumental structure with a rectangular hall.                           All in all, these finds were extremely important to our history. Uncovering the past can be useful to the future. Learning these findings will let us know what we have to do in order to be sufficient. Inca, Peubloans, and the Peloponnese are amazing finds in our history.

The Inca had no system of any writing or a formal alphabet.This makes it hard for historians to study about their culture and who they were.Yet,they used strings called quipus to tie knots and keep track of their history.Archeologists found many old quipus,but they could never figure out what they said.The Inca did leave behind many clues about themselves.They left behind their government,art and architecture,transportation,religion,agriculture,and their way of life.                The very first Ancestral Puebloans settled down in old Mesa Verde in around A.D. 550.They are skilled at crafting and are known as basket-makers.They discovered farming and that took place instead of hunting and gathering.Learning about how to a bow and arrow helped improve their weapons.This was a good thing,because bow and arrows were much stronger than a spear thrower.They lived in pit houses which were slightly sunken in the ground and had a air deflector for the fire-pit.                          The Pavlopetri lived in a city in Atlantis called the lost city.It`s called the lost city,because it sunk in the Atlantic Ocean.The city sank about 5,000 years ago and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented.Dr. Jon Henderson even said,'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world!'. What they found in the city was amazing courtyards,buildings,main streets, and religious structures.Thanks to the shifting of sands and the oceans currents,the city was well preserved.                 In conclusion,there are so many discoveries and things to be found.You would be surprised what history could be hiding underneath the oceans floor.From the research of Mesa Verde all the way to Atlantis,there are still many questions on how the cities fall.How did the city of Atlantis sink?What does the quipus`s say?There is so much we haven`t figured out and so many questions still unanswered.

The Inca empire lasted 1438-1532 when the spanish came, and destroyed them. We know several stories pssed from generation to to generation passing on stoies orally. Aritifacts were left behind  such as textiles and pottery that have been preseved.        The 2nd civilization were ancestral Puebloans.   Many of there arifacts were baskets. They were nomadic In the mesa Verde area. Living in pit houses in clusters making villages.    Cowboys reported clift dwellers in the 1880s they left no afrifacts or writing system behind.        Lost city of atlantis was suberged under water in Greece's southern waters. This is the oldest sumberged town dateing back to homer's heroes dating 2800 to 1200BC.the city is very old going back to famous philosipher times.They occcupied the are for some 5,000 years.        The site was filled wih thousands of shards of pottery . They had court yards main streets and reliougs sanctuary, like a planned city.   The city wasnt so diffrent as a modern one. Under water geologist have safley explored.        These ecxincted civlizations have left behind for us to study. Technology of today have dissolved much of the questions, but not all of it. Beacuse of a natrual disaster or of an invastion , or even a mystery that will never be solved.

We have always wanted to discover when we discovered how to use fire or what wars were fought and why they happened. These things from the past have just fasinated us and we continue to look harder and harder to try to figure out how advanced were they, what happened to them, and can we maybe suffer the same fate. I think why we these finds of the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important because they help us answer those questions which cause so much curiousity.   The Incas were a South American Empire that lasted for hundreds of years. They didn't have any form of a writing system so they were not very advance in english. However they kept a great counting system and calender that allowed them to keep track so well of things like livestock. The Puebloans were an anceint civilization that lived in Mesa Verde 'the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls.' They were very advance with stone masonry which helped them make great buildings. The people of Pavlopetri lived in the Southern area of Greece and is believed to maybe the lost city of Atlantis. Pavlopetri was one of the first planned towns of history.. So even though these were all pretty advance civilizations how did they all end.   The Incas ended from the Spanish conquering them, because 	PRP$ NN VBZ RB VBN VBN IN PRP$ NN CC WRB PRP VBD NNP NNP VBP RB VBN TO RB WRB PRP VBD WRB TO VB NN CC WP NNS VBD VBN CC WRB PRP NNP NNP NNS IN DT JJ VBP RB VBN PRP CC PRP VBP TO VB JJR CC JJR TO VB TO VB RP WRB JJ VBD PRP , WP VBN TO PRP , CC MD VB RB JJR DT JJ NNP PRP VBP WRB PRP DT NNS IN DT NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP VBP RB JJ IN PRP VBP PRP JJR DT NNS WDT NN RB RB NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NNP NNP NNP IN VBN IN NNS IN NNP NNP VBD RB VB DT NN IN DT NN NN RB PRP VBD RB RB RB IN NNP NNP PRP VBD DT JJ NN NN CC NN IN VBN PRP TO VB NN IN RB IN NNS IN NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN NN WDT VBD IN NNP NNP NNP VBD NNS IN DT NN NNP '' PRP VBD RB NN IN NN NN WDT VBD PRP VB JJ NNP NNP NNS IN NNP VBD IN DT NNP NN IN NNP CC VBZ VBN TO VB DT JJS NN IN NNP NNP VBD CD IN DT JJ VBN NNS IN NNP NNP RB IN DT VBD DT RB NN NNS WRB VBD PRP VBP NNP NNP NNP VBD IN DT NNP NN PRP , IN	1		20131024171023	2502	2		20131024171005	2338	1		20131025171055	2381	1

Making discoveries allows us to learn about the ancient people and learn their lifestyles.  By learning about the ancien people, we can know how we came to live how we do now.       Archeologists have to be very careful with the artifacts that they come across.  FInding tools, clothes, art, writings, and many more things can be very important.  By finding these things, we can know how they survived in their location.  We can figure out what language they spoke and how they communicated with other people.  With tools, we can know what they used to hung animals or anything like that.  Through art and writing, we can know thier religious beliefs.  By finding little pieces left behind by the Inca, we can form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, and way of life.       In conclusion, having these important discoveries help a lot for us to figure out the ancient life.  Us as humans, we are curious about everything, and being curious about the people many years ago is one of those curiosities that we have.

Many important discoveries from the civilizations help us today to know more about the ancient times.In the next few paragraphs you will learn about the Inca , Puebloans and the Pavlopetri.                 First the Inca of Peru was one of many ancient civilizations. The Inca was a civilization for many years from 1438 - 1532. The Inca had no formal system of writing .They tied knots together called quipus. Many articifacts like stone, pottery, gold , and silver where found.Those artifacts where found in ancient building or even in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. The archeologists learned that the civilization came from and how i fell. The Inca lived high in the Andes , where they worshiped some of the mount peaks.The fall of the Inca was in 1532 when the Spaniards murdered he last Inca king , and then took over the empire.                A second ancient civilization is the Puebloans. The Puebloans lived about 1400 years ago. For over 700 years the Puebloans flourished and lived in there descendents. The Puebloans built stone communities, and sheltered alcoves. Many of the peubloans where know as basket-makers , because of their skill in making crafts. they lived in homes called pitohouses clustered into tiny villages. Puebloans huntented , made potter and guns. The people learned to make pole-and-adobe construction. they made units to live in that had 50 or more rooms. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 was called their classic period. in this period the population was at over several thousand. Over years the pueblonas made new and improved strusture like churches. the church was based on modern puebloan practice. they used kivas for healing rites , to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop season. Ancestral Puebloans lived in dwelling for less than 100 years. By A.D. 1300 the Pueloans was deserted.             One of the most inspired myth was the fable of Atlantis. The town's remains ae dating back to 2800 - 1200 BC. The town was found beneath the waters of Greece which straddles 30,000 square meters. Atlantis was found to be consumed in about 1000 BC. Down in the town many artifcats where found like a ceramic datting back to 5,000 years ago. while investigating the underwater world the archeologists found 9,000 square meters of new buildings , like possible megarons , and a monumental structure. This is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Palto wrote his allegorical tale. Researchers haven't figured out when and why the fall of atlantis was.            All in all there are many ancient civilizations that may be discovered and those where just a few. The Inca, Puebloans and the Pavloperti have gave many opportunities to archeologists to know more about what happened before many where alive. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN WRB JJ NNS WRB VBN CC WRB PRP VBD .

For example in the the Article it says 'Form an a amazing portrait of their religion, art, architecture, and government'.   This shows that they are really advance in their time period. This also shows that they have a good civilization.                Another example in the Article it says 'Cold mountains of the Andes'. This shows that they could survive up there. This also shows that they can hide in the caves from robbers.                         Another example in the Article it says 'Bodies found in the icy Andes  are in good shape'. This shows that they didn't  need to bury the bodies. This also shows that they died because of the cold.

But with new technoligy we can study thease civilizations a littile bit more. for example Atlantis was thought to be just a myth. Now we know that atlantis did exist but got  completly sunken by the water. The incas we dont have much because they didnt have a writting system. But the spanidh did counquer them and they did have a writting system but we cant be sure cuz maybe the spanish couldnt understand the Incas.Mesa verde is one of the longest civilizationsbut we are not sure why they left.

For example, in 1438-1532, the Inca of Peru had no alphabet, so they made knots in colored strings. No body to this day knows what the knots mean, but the strings were very colorful. There were some old stories written by the Europeans, but the Historians had to be careful because they could not understand some of the writing, so it might not be very trustworthy. Most of what everybody knows about the Inca is based on artifacts or stuff they left behind. Some of Inca's sites have been destroyed by visitors, or hunters. Some Inca were buried in caves, or high mountain tops. The bodies found in the mountain tops are in such good shape from the freezing ice that scientists can learn how they died.        About 1,400 years ago, a handful of people living in the Four Corners, picked Mesa Verde as their home. In the late 1200s, they left their homes and moved away after a couple generations went through. People lived in pit houses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. The living room was sank down a few feet under the ground, and four corners supporting the roof. They began to build houses in A.D. 750. The houses were built one against another made of poles and mud.        When cowboys first discovered the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, no body could really figure out how these peoples lives were like. They lived in Kivas, or underground chambers built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. They traveled into New Mexico and Arizona.

Most of the stories in the inca civilization where passed down by generations. We learn about them from written sources from other people that visited the incas but if they did not clearly understand then how reliable is the source. They have to figure out the reliable writings from the unreliable sources this can be very hard to figure out it takes time and no ledge to figure that sort of thing out.         The cliff dwellers we can't really understand them it isa very sketch subject there is not much we now about these amazing people. They made homes out the solid rock faces it is pretty amazing that thet did that with. So little technology. 	NNP NNS WRB JJ VBP PRP RB RB IN PRP .

When Inca was discovered they wanted to know what came from their oral history or stories from their past and what they passed generation to generation. Archeologists and others can put some things together once they have studied the Inca life.The language was maybe the hardest thing to figure out because they couldn't read it until they found out more about the place.       The Puebloans created so many things while they were a civilization. They were basket makers and when that happened their population got way bigger and multiplied. They had some social and political problems and some people just looked for new opportunities elsewhere. The land had its resources and it had a good amount of food growing everyday and they made their homes with things from nature.       Pavlopetri was a city that was under the water. When people found out about this they were surprised by the peoples wealth and the size of the place that was under ground. When they started to clean things around it they found out that it had buildings, courtyards, and main streets. It was the first time Greece has ever had a sunken city and Plato wrote a tale about this. Theories include sea levels and the ground subsidence was from an earth quake or a tsunami.       All in all these were very important because they were all big places and a lot of Historians wanted to know what these places were like and how the people worked, lived, and what they did for a living. These places were important and became a really big important discovery tat took awhile to find out what the civilization became.

Archaeologists have been amazed throughout the passed decade on how many discoveries of artifacts from ancient civilizations. The things archeologists are finding the most puzzling is ho these are artifacts are so well preserved throughout the hundreds of year they have been buried. Preservation is an amazing thing to the discovery of ancient artifacts.                                                       Many historians have been vaguely impressed by the knowledge of the people who know so much about the past of these ancient civilizations who were once there ancestors. Art, folktales, and songs are a key way of keeping history passed on. The Inca civilization did this by making things called quipus, or colored strings with knots in them, these were used to keep track of days and nights like calendar, to keep count of livestock, and to tell stories since the Inca didn't have a formal alphabet. When historians found translations of the quipus they were astounded to know that, that was what those strings meant. Many other civilizations had similar records as the Inca such as the Peublonians and the Pavelopetri.        In conclusion you can see how important these records are to archaeologists. Many of these records help us with many common things we have and do today. So this is why these ancient artifacts are so important for archaeologist to find.

The discoveries made it possible for researchers to uncover ancient artifacts that taught archaeologists more about their civilization. The Inca didn't have a formal writing system for the historians to look at and learn from. What they did find were knots in strings used to keep dates. This 'calendar' was called quipus. When Europeans found the first Inca, they were amazed of how big an empire they were able to create. Without being able to understand the knots at first, understanding how the Inca Empire worked was very challenging for the historians to understand. To make up for the missed information, archaeologists have found clues to things such as religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and other things that help explain the Inca way of life. Accounts had to be carefully interpreted. Spaniards didn't understand everything the Inca had said and created legends instead of facts. The Puebloans lived in one of the four corners called Mesa Verde, which means green table. lksdjbfalksjfb     	DT NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP NNS VBD RB NNP NNP NNS VBD PRP JJ IN NNS TO VB JJ NNS WDT VBD NNS RBR IN PRP$ NNP NNP NNP VBD RB VB DT JJ NN NN IN DT NNS TO VB IN CC VB NNP NNP PRP VBD VB VBD NNS IN NNS VBN TO VB NNP NNP NNP POS VBD VBN -NONE- WRB NNS VBN DT JJ NNP , PRP VBD VBN IN WRB JJ DT NN PRP VBD JJ TO NNP NNP VBG JJ TO VB DT NNS IN JJ , NN WRB DT NNP NNP VBD VBD RB VBG IN DT NNS TO NNP NNP VB RP IN DT VBN NN , NNS VBP VBN NNS TO NNS JJ IN NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , CC JJ NNS IN NN VB DT NNP NN IN NNP NNP VBD TO VB RB NNP NNP VBD RB VB NN DT NNP VBD VBN CC VBN NNS RB IN NNP NNP NNP VBD IN CD IN DT CD NNS VBN NNP NNP , WDT VBZ JJ NNP NN	1		20131024171050	2360	2		20131024171018	2338	1		20131025171050	2381	1

Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. When Europeans arrived in the empire in 1532, the visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They could not speak the Inca language.      Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniard's accounts of the Inca. The Inca lived high in the Andes and even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Some of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This helped from looters, because they cannot get to them easily. The high Andes is like a giant freezer, and bodies have been found in the icy Andes in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equpitment to learn about how people died.      About A.D. 750 they began building houses above the ground. Puebloans are know as the Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers.'Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff acloves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before.

Its was off the southern coast of Peloponnese. It is one of the most unique cities found. The size and the wealth of detail has never been seen before. The city is very unique, well preserved, and its surpassed peoples expectation.                       The city is very unique to everybody that heard or read about the cities ruins. What makes the city so unique to everybody is it was a planned town with smart people and with great detail. Also, it size and the city has never been heard of. The city was very wealthy it had great detail to lots of things in the city. It straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. The seabed was replete with lots of pottery. They also have rock-cut tombs.                          The city is very well preserved the sand under on the sea bed shifted and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay. This city being well preserved is great because it revealed  buildings, courtyards, main streets, and religious structures. The religious structure means the city was well unified under one religion. Main streets also mean there was trade going on in the city. The courtyards is saying the city got together and had discussions which also means that they were unified.                  The city surpassed everyone's expectations of the city. They were so impressed on how wealthy the city was and how unified it was. It also surpassed the expectations by the structure of the buildings on how well it was made and the detail that everything had. They certainly took pride and effort into there work. This also is impressive there pottery is everywhere on the seabed. Which can mean that mostly everyone was skilled. Even though they did not have advanced technology they were still very impressive.                 This civilization is a great even though we have very little information on them all you tell is good by the city. The only question is, 'Why is there nobody there' and ,'Why is the civilization now under water.' Some possible answers might be ,'They got so carried away with making there city a very good town they did not  focus on the natural disasters.' But a counter example might be, 'They had courtyard which where they go and have discussions somebody must of brought up the question.' This might be a red flag. Warning us to focus on religion to be unified ,but do not forget the natural disasters especially now that we have global warming where natural disasters can come without warning. So be prepared because you never know when or where it is going to happen.

Their finds put the pieces together with fact not just with stories or legends. Clothing, pithouses, and pottery are what make the Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri discoveries so important.   We have little information about the strange and mythical inca people. Most of that information comes from spanish soldiers or priests who described the Incas in diaries or letters. One of the most important discoverie we have made about the Inca people are the quipus which are colored strings knotted together in a complex system of knots. From the stories we have assumed that the knots were used for keeping track of cattle or other animals around the Inca terratory. That find was important because it gives us some evidence they did have some kind of system of knots with strings.   The Puebleans are very good at craft and building. One of the most common discoveries we made about the Puebleans are there pithouses made out of mud, clay, and wood. In the pithouses we have found artifacts such as pottery, tools, bows, beds,  and weapons. these finds were important because they help us piece together daily life of the Puelean people.   Pavopetri has had hndreds of stories of untold rickes and amazing technology surrounding in for years. Now that we have found it we have been able to explore this mystical place discovering pottery shattered throughout the ruins. This discovery has been able to help us learn more about these ancient and mystical people.   There will always be ancient civilizations out there hidded as we hunt for unreal mythical version of these magnificant places. We have found out a lot in our history from studying the civilizations. And that is why clothing, pithouses, and potter make the Incas, Puebleans, and Pavopetri peoples discoveries are so important.

Without knowledge of our past it would be a different world as we know it.We have learned so much from our ancestors and we are thankful to all the people that made that possible. This article I am going to write will be about how important it is that we keep searching and studying our ancestors and their way of life. Although some civilizations are hard to learn about due to the way they lived like the Inca's because of their complicated way of keeping records and talking to one another.       The Incan civilization lived in The Andes mountains in Peru. They had a very complicated way of keeping records by making knots on colored strings called 'quipus'. With that they could keep track of livestock, have a calender that was always right and speak to each other almost like a text message. Almost all we know about them has come from oral history.       The Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde about 1,400 years ago. Archeologists called theses people the Anasazi, a Navajo word that is translated to 'the Ancient ones'. Thanks to modern technology we have learned a lot about how they lived and what they did. Archeologists were able to dig up some of there city's and recreate what they lived in called 'Pit houses' with out being able to find these cities we would have no knowledge of how people used to live. Some of their designs are currently being used today which is very helpful and neat looking.       One of my very favorite stories as a young buck was the fable of the city of Atlantis. We have created technology useful to the search of the lost city and have been able to find it thanks to some B.A. technology. The story says that town sunk at least 5,000 years ago and at that time it was one of the most organized civilizations ever. We have learned from exploring the underwater city that the god of Atlantis was Posiden the god of the sea which is funny because the town is under the sea.       What we have learned from our ancestors and their city's is so useful in modern day and will be useful in the future and probably forever. I am thankful that people are willing to risk their life to learn more and become a better world. Without knowing about our ancestors and their cities the world could be a different place. This has truly been a 'blast from the past'.

We always want to know what happened back in the past. We want to know what will happen in the future. We always have that desire to see whats it is like in a different time. Some of the greatest civilizations were a part of the past. Some of these civilizations are mysteries. Three of the best civilizations were the Incas, the Mesa Verde, and the Greeks.        The Incas were are somewhat of a well know civilization today and a mystery at the same time. The Incas are well known for living in the Andes mountain range and their unusal form of writing known as quipus. Quipus is a system of tying colored knots to represent letters and numbers. This applys to our daily lives in the sense that this form of writing is so advanced that we can't understand if even today. We still know lots about the Inca even though we can't comprehend their writings.

They had no alphabet and they didn't have a system of writing, but they have an interesting way of keeping records. What they did was tie knots in a string which is a unique way of keeping records. To this day nobody knows what  the knots mean.                                                                                                                          The Ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde about 550 A.D. They are good at basket making which is why they are called Basketmakers. They lived in shelters called Pithouses. Kivas are gathering places and also used to weave things. To use nature as an advantage the Ancestral Puebloans built their houses underneath the overhanging cliffs.

Well places like these are being discovered and learned about today. The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important because they teach us about ancient cultures and answer ancient legends.             First of the three is the ancient Incan empire which is still being learned about today. The Inca are very impotant because they dominated the Andes and the surrounding areas for a long time. We don't know much about them because their form of writing the quipus 'but today no one knows what the knots mean' and their language is lost to time. They made ancient calendars and thousands of miles of roads proving they were very advanced for their time.  The Inca are a a very impotant ancient civilization.            Secondly the Puebloans are mysterious because they left their homes for no reasons as far as the modern world can tell. 'Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years.'

The Incas had no writing system or formal   alphabet system nor did they leave any archives for historians to study from. The Inca left only clues of their existance that archaeologist had to put together to learn about the Inca. There are stories of Incas from Spaniards and Europeans, but some of them are legends. Luckily, the Inca left some artifacts for archaeologist. Artifacts and the area they were found helped the archaeologist learn more about the Inca.                   The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. Puebloans. Archaeologist found out Puebloans were basket crafters. Through out the years for the people of Mesa Verde, they kept improving in the structures they built and pottery. Then some Puebloans started moving back into cliffs. Archaeologist have no idea why they did it. Puebloans live in cliff dwelling for less than a hundred years. Then they migrated south into New Mexico and Arizona.                           Pavlopetri has sunken about five-thousand years ago. 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr. Jon Henderson. 'There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique.' said Dr. Jon Henderson. Pavlopetri had buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs. and religious structures that were in great condition. The archaeologist search showed over nine-thousand square meters of buildings. 'It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied,' said Elias Spondylis. Pavlopetri is the first sunken city to be found in Greece.

The smallest of things can be some of the biggest keys to uncovering secerts. When archaeologists unlocked the past to the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, it changed the world's point of view.         When looking for clues about the ancient Inca of Peru, archaeologists found many artifacts that later help them unravle the story. They found textiles and clothes, that showed what the conditions were for them to wear certain clothes. One of the biggest clues was the way the Inca documented everything. They would use something as simple as string to record all of the city's infomation. This amazed many that such a big empire can run documents on string. All of the artifacts found play a big role in discovering more about their everyday life. When each artifact is discovered, it widens the whole world's knowledge on the ancient empire.         But archaeologists don't only find amzig stories in far away countries. The Puebloans were right here in America! The Puebloans were very talented . From the artifacts and stories archaeologists can tell they were very sucessful basketmakers and craftsmen. Even today, America keeps the Puebloans in close memory by keeping the area were they settled a national park. Without learning about the Puebloans, we would not be able to reconize them today.         Have you ever heard of Altantis? The city lost under the sea? Well, archaeologists found something that is pretty close. An ancient Greek city was found completly suberged in water. The sercerts and stories were all put together. When exploring, archaeologists were baffled that this had gone unoticed. Suddenly all the myths became reality. The people that lived around the site were filled with excitement and honor, that a story so close to home was revealed.         Without discovering ancient civilizations and learning more about them, humanity would start to question our past. These discoveries effect the people around the historic area and the world. With every new discovery, the world's knowledge expands. It is important to reconize these ancient civilizations because without them, we may not be here today.

The Inca discoveries are rather inportant for they can show details about a vastly unexplored culture. The procurement of Inca artifacts and excavation of ruins shed light on a society of strong religious and spiritual beliefs. We can understand current South American culture better if we research and understand it's ancient predecessors, and as such it is a big contribution to social histories.       The Puebloan finds are a distinct step in understanding Native American histories. Usually due to their nomadic ways there is not a very specific place to study these people's ancient histories. This is a way for many modern Native Americans to learn of their heritage, much like white Europeans can.       The discovery of Pavlopetri is a signifigant step in European history. Based off how it has shown us artifacts dating back to 3000 BC, it can show us a view of the ancient Medditeranean before civilizations like Rome took it over and lost much history. It is also inportant in relation to the fable of Atlantis and other ancient stories.       In many ways, these finds accomplish similar things. They can teach us about lost culture, history and religion. They can help us understand myths and legends better. And above all, we can use this knowledge to expland our histories, and connect our stories into a single tapestry of knowlege and experience on a worldwide scale.

Archaeologists have done a phenomonal job of putting puzzle pieces of their history together to form a detailed description of the lives these ancient people lived.        The first reason that the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were all very important discoveries is the mistakes that we can learn from. When archeaologists make new discoveries about ancient civilizations, we can learn more and infer more about the past. The reason that the past is so important, is becuase we can learn from the people of that time period. We should not make the same mistakes that people made back then, because we know that their empire fell or the food they ate made people sick, etc. In Source #1, the author writes, 'The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing.'   We know now how to read and write. We can communicate with each other and keep records, which helps our country keep things under control.        The second reason that the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were all very important discoveries is that we can learn from their inventions and buildings. In Source #2, the author writes, 'By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together in units of 50 rooms or more.' Ancient people's buildings, I am sure, have helped us advance in our designing of homes and other buildings.        The third reason that the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were all very important dicoveries is our knowledge about ancient civilizations make. In Source #3, the author writes, 'More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings of Maycenaean society.' This tells me that once archaeologists find out more about this civilization, we will be even more knowledgable about ancient civilizations.        The discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri were very important for many reasons. In fact, discoveries about any ancient civilization is very important. I love hearing interesting facts about the way that people in history acted and lived, and I hope that archaeologists continue to discover civilizations of the past.

Three of the most intruiging civilazations were the ancient Inca of Peru, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde, and the dwellers of the sunken city of Atlantis near Greece. These civilizations and myths are  some of the most thought about and reasearched peoples today.              There have been new discoveries that provides us with very astonishing information, such as that the city of Atlantis was real in a geographical way but not a realistic underwater life way. The city of Atlantis dates back to to around 2800 BC. The city itself more or less likely sunk because of Natural Disasters such as a Tsunami or a land slide. At the sight of the Underwater city there were ceramics that dated almost 5000 years ago! The water submerged city of Atlantis is one of the greatest discoveries to date.                The next important civilization were going to talk about is the ancient Inca of Peru. This civilization had no written records. The Inca used quipus or knots in colored strings to mark things such as keping count of livestock. In fact, the only records they kept were the quipus. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history or storytelling. Some of these stories were recorded by the early Europeans that arrived in 1532. There were arrivals that spoke spanish and were called 'Spaniards'. The Spaniards recorded some of the Inca stories too but did not speak the language of the Inca so the interpretations might not be correct.                 The final civilization we'll discuss is the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde. The Ancestral Puebloans communities lived in the shelter of alcoves and canyon walls. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in about 550 A.D. Their highly expert skill in crafting got them the nickname of 'Basketmakers'. The Basketmakers were Nomadic. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. The Ancestral Puebloans usually lived in pithouses.           	RB VBP PRP RB JJR IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ .

Archaeologists are people that help discover and uncover old artifacts. Without archaeologists we may never have been able to uncover the past. The past would just be forgotten           Without learning from the past we would never get smarter as a species. We need to know how the past civilizations lived so it will help us live today and in the future. We may also never know what is true and what isn't. For example we never thought that the myth of Atlantis was remotely real until archaeologists found a underwater city that was 5000 years old. This discovery really brought some light on the myth.           Because the city was underwater it was like a moment frozen in time. The city has not been reoccupied or changed in any way.This means we can learn about life there just by looking at the city.But we can find even more about the past here on land In the Second source it says ' In winter,when the alcove rooms were damp and uncomfortable,fires probably burned throughout the village. Smoke-blackened walls and ceilings are reminders of the biting cold these people lived with for several months each year.' From this observation and more we know how they survived and lived.           We need to know how they survived and acted to better put together the past.Each discovery is like a puzzle piece. We will probably never discover ever artifact from the past but for every one we do discover we add another piece to the puzzle. In hundreds of years archaeologists could be digging and finding artifacts to put together the world we live in now. But unless a major event occurs i don't think so     	NNP PRP IN TO VB IN JJ NNS CC WRB PRP VBD RB PRP MD RB VB IN DT JJ IN NNP NNPS VBP NNS IN NN RB CC RB JJ NNP NNP VBZ PRP MD RB VB VBN JJ TO VB DT NNP NNP JJ MD RB VB VBN IN NN IN DT JJ PRP MD RB VB IN IN DT NNP NNP VBP TO VB WRB DT JJ NNS VBD RB PRP MD VB PRP VB NN CC IN DT NNP NNP MD RB RB VB WP VBZ JJ CC WP NNP NNP NN PRP RB VBD IN DT NN IN NNP VBD RB JJ IN NNS VBD DT NN NN WDT VBD CD NNS NNP NNP NN RB VBD DT NN IN DT NNP NNP DT NN VBD NN PRP VBD IN DT NN VBN IN NNP NNP NN VBZ RB VBN VBN CC VBN IN DT NN VBZ PRP MD VB IN NN EX RB IN VBG IN DT JJ PRP MD VB RB RBR IN DT JJ RB IN NN IN DT NNP NN PRP VBZ '' NNP NN , WRB DT NN NNS VBD NN CC JJ , NNS RB VBN IN DT NNP JJ NNS CC NNS VBP NNS IN DT NN VBD DT NNS VBD IN IN JJ NNS DT NNP POS NNP DT NN CC JJR PRP VBP WRB PRP VBD CC NNP NNP VBP TO VB WRB PRP VBD CC VBN TO JJR NN RP DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN NNP NNP MD RB RB RB RB VB IN DT JJ CC IN DT CD PRP VBP RB PRP VBP DT NN TO DT NNP NNP VBZ IN NNS NNS MD VB VBG CC VBG NNS TO VB RP DT NN PRP VBP IN NNP CC IN DT JJ NN NNS PRP VBP RB VB RB	2		20131024151005	2370	2		20131024151020	2338	2

So how do we know about a civilization that for around a hundred years ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of Rome. The Incans left behind clues that form an magnificent portait of thier religon, art and architecturr, agriculture, government, transpotation, and their way of life.            Some of what we know comes from  oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Passing on this infromation is importiant to preserve a communite's history.

I will be describing their signifacance in being a not so lost city anymore.         The incas had no formal alphabet or system of writing so its kind of hard to understand what happened to them back then. One thing they did do was make knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar and to keep a count of livestock. But we do not know how to read them. One thing we do know is that they ruled South America from 1438 to 1532 this is when their king was killed and the Spanish took over. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from the artifacts.         The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They origanaly learned how to make houses out of mud but then made them out of stone. Between 1100 and 1300 the population could have reached several thousand. They even learned how to make better pottery.         The under water city of atlantis streches over 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. They think the settlement sank because of an earthquake of a tsunami. This is the first time a under water city has been found in Greece.

Us modern humans have began to find out more and more about our past and how we used to live. It is important to know more and more about the past to discover how things were back then. Three big secrets of the past involves, The Ancient Incas, The Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World, and A Lost Greek City.                The Incas, a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a South American empire, left behind mat clues that form an amzing idea on how they used to live. So many clues have been found that we know about their religion, their art and arcitecture, agriculture government, transportation, and how they lived. Some information that we know about the Incas is from oral history. These are stories passed from generation to genration but these are not one hundred percent proven. Some of what we know  is written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish soldiers and priests. They described the Inca in letters and diaries.               About 1,400 years ago, a few people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. The people living there built buildings and elaborate stone communities in the shetered alcoves of the canyon walls. These people were intelligent and built many things, like Pithouses, pottery, wepons like the bow and arrow and spears. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. Around the year 1200 A.D. a ginormous population shift was seen among the people living here. Nobody knows why this happened but a few guesses are that  it was for religous or psychological reasons; or maybe because the alcoves offered better protection from the elements.              The secrets of a lost city named, Atlantis, have brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. Explored bty an Anglo-Greek team of arcaeologists and marine geologists ad know as Pavolaopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years theime of Hormer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. It is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 100 BC. A world of buildings, courtyards, main streets rock-cut tombs and  religous structures have been found under the sea in this area. Along with thousands of shards of pottery. Less than 1% of the earths ocean floor has been investigated so there has to be much more out there.

For many years now archaeologists have been studying the ways of these ancient societies. Their daily life, deaths, and historical stories are just a few things they have found out. Although this information is amazing to have, archaeologists have to go through a lot of trouble to get it.              In the case of the Inca society, decoding their history is quite difficult. Their recording system is made up of strings. Different colors and sizes indicate their events. Since no one knows how to decipher these strings, finding out their history has proven to be very difficult. Also since the Inca were located in the Andes mountains, traveling to find artifacts is another challenge.             Although it took a while, the history of the Puebloans has proven to be much easier to find out about. A national park has already been set up for them to share their history with the world. The Mesa Verde National Park has preserved many artifacts about the Puebloans. They also share information on their homes, weapons, religious places, and many other things. This national park helps preserve the history of the Puebloans.              The Pavlopetri civivlization seems to be the most difficult of the three. The city of Pavlopetri was sunken under the ocean about 5,000 years ago. Constantly moving waters, sand, and sea creatures  cover and uncover this ancient city. You never know when you'll find something today but lose it tomorrow. Archaeologists are in a never ending battle with the ocean to uncover this societies history. The archaeologists studying this city don't even exactly know how it became submerged.               Archaeologists work hard everyday to uncover these mysterious cities. Hard work and determination drive them to discover more so the rest of us can understand our past. After years of digging there is still so much more to find out. Although they are thousands of years and miles apart, these three societies still manage to confuse and amaze our modern world.

Like the constant improvement of the Puebloans helped make future peoples of the world construct homes and/or useful city buildings. And the way Inca kept records on just strings proably helped future civilizations keep records on paper with their own language/ writing. And the Pavloptri made myths about Atlantis to explain things so that it made sense that it's there. These discoveries and improvements of these ancient peoples and civilizations are important to us and society because it helped shape society today.

The discoveries help us know how those civilizations lived and how their daily life was like.       The Incas didnt leave written records of themselves, but they left a lot of important things which were buried or written down in Europeans diaries or journals. The discovery of their things that were made of either gold, stone, or silver showed us how their daily life was like and in what conditions they lived in.       The discoveries of the Puebloans were houses. Their houses have been found in the mountains called pueblos. Those houses were called pitthouses. The archeologists saw how the houses were built. This also showed us their daily life.       Also the discoveries of the Pavlopetri were underwater. Archeologists found lots of houses that were once on land but are now underwater due to some natural causes. These were very to discover because in was more than 30,00 square meters of ocean floor. These discoveries help us know how civilazations lived before us and how our world changed.

They tell us interesting facts we need to know about them, to compare how life was back then to now. If you can see it was very different from now, they had difficulities on getting food, and building there homes. They were very hard working people, they worked night and day to get their job done.      The Incas comes from an oral history,or stories passed from generation to generation. They had alot of amazing things going on around them, like art, architecture, and agriculture.The Incas had visitors such as the Spanish soldiers and priests. Even though the Spanish did not understand anything the Incas were saying they still enjoyed there company. The Incas lived high in the Andes mountains. I believe they lived high in the mountains to stay away from enemies and from being caught. Some Incas even died at the mountain top or even buried in caves.        The Puebloans were the first  settled in Mesa Verde in about A.D.550. They were known as Basketmakers for their skilled work on crafts. They would make a house known as a Pithouse, which was a small living room, with four corner timbers, and a roof. It wasn`t very much for a skilled craftsman, but it was good enough to sleep in.  They would build Pithouses against one another, curving rows. That way it would make it warmer for them and bigger.        It`s a great thing to know about all these facts on ancient people to get to know what has happened in their life. It is very important to know about history because you will need it in life and the history is one of the most important things to know.

Incas were said to have left lots of art, architecture, government, and transportation. Archaeologists have made amazing discoveries because of lots of artifacts they had left from their past lives. Many of those things were also passed down by generations to preserve their history. There are also many Inca myths that we know today and lots of great places. There have also been many weather occurrences that have helped archaeologists discover things that have helped us to the discovery of how the Inca lived. Archaeologists have recorded many things, places, and people from Inca history            The Puebloans period was also known as the Classical Period. Pithouses were used to live in before this time. Pithouses were like small huts that people used before houses. In this period walls of thick, double-coursed stone were made that were about 2 or 3 stories high. I think that their architecture influences the homes we make now. They also made the bow and arrow to make hunting more efficient, as you might now, the bow and arrow was a very useful creation. Also, they made Kivas which resemble churches now.            The discovery made in source #3 is also very important. There have been countless movies and myths about the lost city of Atlantis that people are not even sure if it's true. This discovery proves them wrong. A diver explored a sunken settlement which is thought to be the city of Atlantis. This site is important because it is said that the site was never reoccupied, it is considered a frozen moment of the past. It is also said that not only was it the oldest submerged city, it was also populated and had an interest in natural science. There is a lot more to discover to this city than has already been. To me all of the discoveries made by archaeologists about past lives are very important.

They want to see how the kings lived and what were some of their rules. They want to pass on stories to preserve history. The archaeologists also wanted to compare the what they learned from the artifacts and sites with the Spaniard's accounts of the Inca.         Puebloans and the Mesa Verde National Park preserve a spectacular reminder of ancient culture. Archaeologists wanted to find out more about the Puebloans skill in craft. They lived in Pithouses, the Pithouses featured a living room and an air deflector. They also had Sipapu an underground hole in which people came in. Pithouses later evolved into Kivas. Then there population multiplied. They started to build above ground houses. Archaeologists found out that Mesa Verde went from pole-and-adobe construction to stone masonry. Some houses even had units of 50 rooms. Archaeologists also wanted to find out more about the Puebloans religion during their study they found Kiva, which is a church they prayed for rain, luck in hunting, or good crops.         Atlantis Myth keeps archaeologists crazy looking for clues and more exploration than any other thing. These secrets inspire one of the most enduring myth - the fable of Atlantis. Archaeologists have found ruins of Atlantis. Archaeologists say that there are older sunken sites but none as unique as Atlantis. They have found ceramics dating back to the stone age. Archaeologists also know that maybe they will never find anything, but the search is still going. Atlantis is a myth, but that myth keeps underwater exploration going.

The ancient inca civilation was around from about 1438 up until 1532. the inca had no system of writting and no formal alphabet. they were settled in south america. in order to keep records the inca formed strings. certain clues that were left behind  have portrayed images of the inca religion, art, and architecture. studying these clues helped others piece together the inca life. the inca lived high in the andes and many of their sites are in the remote high areas.       The ancient puebolans civilization were around for about 700 years. the first of their ancestors settled in mesa verde. the lived in pithouses that were clustered into small villages. ancestral puebloans builts their dwellings benath the overhanging cliffs. the puebolans educated themselves to make pottery and specialized in the bow and arrow which was used to hunt.

For example, in the Inca civilization the archeologist have been finding artifacts every day even tough it is hard for them to find them because the Incas lived in remote, high places. The archeologist have been studying Incas homelands and way of life. The artifacts and settlements tell give them a lot of information to find out how this ancient civilization lived.       In addition, the Puebloans civilization also is an important discovery because some of  their homelands were in cliff alcoves that were the homes of their ancestors. The Puebloans are said to live in those areas because of religious purposes or for better protection. Also, the Puebloans  are an important discovery because these people lived in harsh cold for several months with just a single fire.       The Pavelopetri who lived in the lost city of  Atlantis are also an important discovery. This civilization is important because the marine geologists are still trying to figure out what caused the city to sink. This city was found 40 years ago but was completely discovered with the help of technology. The lost city was revealed more by the shifting sands and the enclosure in the protected bay. This site is significant because it has potential insights on the workings of Mycenaean society.

The historians were stressed about it. Some stories that we have heard of come from oral history. The rest of  our knowledge has been from artifacts or objects left behind. Archeologists used the most advanced techniques to discover about this history. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountains for study.       The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in A.D 550. The people lived in pithouses from A.D 550 to A.D 750. At these times, their population increased. By A.D 1000 the people had advanced their type of homes. They now had skillfull stone masonry. Between A.D 1100 and A.D 1300, the population had reached several thousands. Kiva is a Hopi word fro ceremonial room. Underground chambers were also built there. People could also weave there. The sipapu was a symbolic entrance to the underworld.

Like how they were able to track stars and planets with tools of just rock. How well they were at hunting. Or even building their great empires.          We will never truly know the secrets of the past though. Most of the information we have came from folk tales than true history. How did we get the stories? They were told down as an oral tradition. From parent to child and then some. Yet the stories we have may not all be what they originally were since the Spaniards, the first people to meet the Incas, did not completely understand their language, and may have messed up some words.          Yet I find it fascinating that they were able to run a great empire for so long with only little knots and strings. Why knots and strings? Well, they didn't really have a form of writing. So instead they used a system of knots to keep track of everything. But we will never fully understand their labyrinth system.

Instead, they made knots called in quipus, which are colored strings.  Archaeologists have found many quipus over the years, but still nobody knows what they mean. However, the Incas have left behind amazing portraits of their religion, art, archetecture, agriculture, government, transportation systems, and just their ways of life in general.Archaeologists have also found artifacts made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. A lot of these last for hundreds of years. Most turn up in the ruins of buildings; others in buried graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.          The first ancient Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They are known for their skills in basketmaking. At first nomadic, they were starting to lead a more settled way of life. Things such as farming replaced hunting and gathering. The Puebloans lived in pithouses in small villages, usually built on mesa tops, but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned how to make pottery and foudn a bow and arrow, a better weapon for hunting than a spear thrower, called the atlatl.          In Greece, there has recently been an ancient underwater city discovered by divers, oceanogrophers, and marine archaeologists. They believe that the city was submerged by 1000 BC, but it was only discovered about 40 years ago by a British oceanogropher. However, 40 years ago there was not enough digital technology to aid the marine archaeologists in surveying the city, so it had only been surveyed just this year. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlements enclosure, what they found reached all of their expectations. The exploration revealed a world full of courtyards, buildings, rock-cut tombs, religious structures, and main streets. Not to mention the shards of pottery that was also discovered.

I believe that the Inca, Puebloans and the Pavlopetri are the the three ancient civilizations that are the most revealing. The Inca had left behind amounts of things that we discovered, the Puebloans flourished in their old Mesa Verde homes and the Pavlopetri have made a myth become true.             First, the Inca left behind amounts of things that we discovered. They did not leave behind any form of writing but they did leave behind clues that give us an idea of their way of life. An example from the passage Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Pas would be, 'The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found.' The clues gives us information on how the Inca people lived. Another example on the things that we discovered states, 'The lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places.' That shows that the Inca may have liked living in the mountains. The last example about the discoveries of the Inca says, 'Bodies found in the ocy Andes are such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived.' That shows me that the Inca people may have lived uder harsh weather conditions because of the mountains, causing them to possibly die.

We learn a lot from the past of these groups of people from archeology and it's very imporrtant that we understand it properly. The Inca are very smart intelligent people.         The Inca are very smart people to say they had no alphabet or system of writing. The Inca made colored string called quipus to record the calendar and keep check of livestock.These quipus are very important to know, but no one know how to read them. With out somebody that can read it is like try to slide between two rocks with only a inch of space.The Inca have lift behind art, agruculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. These things i just named lets the archeologists know their relion and how they use to live back hundreds of years ago. Some of the history we know are from story pasted down from generation to generation. That was a way to keep the community's history in order. The Puebloans are very uniqe people too.         The first settled Puebloans settled in Mesa Verdein A.D. 550. They're known for their breadbasket making skills. Soon to come farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main way to do things. Soon after that they learned how to make pottery and learned to acquire the bow and the arrow.         Pavlopetri is another name for people that were achaeologists, and marine geologists. These people study the sunken settlements of the greeks. Atlantis was a myth made up by the greeks. They made this myth so underwater exploration can continue. Neapolis is the site for the undersea city. So these people were very serious about their underwater exploration.

The civilizations can give archaeologists information on how they lived. Some of the important ancient civilizations are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.        The Inca had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. the first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using stings to keep records. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Some of what we know about the Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. The rest of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of archaeologists sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops.        The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') about A.D. 550. They are known as Basket makers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pit houses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud. They built the houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pit houses or two in front.(Pit houses would later evolve into kivas.) From here on, these people are known as Puebloans, a Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers.' Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. By the Classic Period(A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300), Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.        Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of  size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr Jon Henderson, associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham. The site, which straddles 30,00 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Although discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of sharp pf pottery. More than any other underwater site so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. Marine geologists have yet to work out the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.        Some of the important ancient civilizations are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. The civilizations can give archaeologists information on how they lived. Many ancient civilizations are so important to our history.

They give us a glimpse of the past, and maybe give us ideas to bring back some of the old culture or ideas.                        For the Incas, their treasures may inspire designers to make jewelery or buildings based on drawings and other everyday items. The religion they had might affect us somehow today after these findings. The books and letters the Spanish wrote to the Incas also give us a peek into the past. The clothing that the Inca wore and left behind were preserved and can be copied to use in the modern day.                      For the Puebloans, their skilled craftsmanship shows us what they did on their free time. They left behind their pithouses, which most people lived in. Over time, the Puebloans shifted from abobe construction to skillful stone masonry. These findings are important because they show us that the Puebloans were skilled craftsman and very civilized.                      For the Pavlopetri, it gave us a huge glimpse at ancient architecture. The buildings were still well preserved and there is still a huge amount of precious material still hidden beneath the ocean floor. These discoveries may lead us to see why Atlantis did sink, and if it could happen to other cities.                      These discoveries can be life changing for many people. The treasures found could inspire people and can influence their ideas. The scientific discoveries can foreshadow a very horrific event that could happen any minute, such as the sinking of a whole city along with its citizens.

Archaeology have studied them for many, many years and still have questions about them. They have also uncovered many things. Many things about the lost civilizations, the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, would not be known if archaeologist hadn't taken their time to research them.   The Incas were discovered by Europeans in 1532. The Incas ruled the South American empire between the years 1438 to 1532. The Europeans were amazed by how the Inca ran their empire using only knots in colorful string. Their is still no one who can read the knots in the quipus.  They used the quipus to keep a record of livestock. Some of what archaeologist know are from oral history told to them from Spanish visitors who were soldiers and priests. They used letters and diaries to describe the Inca.  The Spanish didn't speak the Inca language and could misunderstand what was told to them. We learned the most about the Inca from artifacts left behind. For example some of their textiles and clothing have survived through all of these years. Which help us know how they made their living and how they dressed. They can easily date the fall of the Inca's, since the Spaniards killed the Inca's last king in 1532. The Spaniards than toke over the empire. It's the origins that our more difficult to trace. Due to the many people who have inhabited the area since the Inca's.            All information found in source number 1 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past.'   The Puebloans lived about 1,400 years ago in Mesa Verde for over seven hundred years.In the late A.D. 1200s they moved away from their homes. The first Puebloans were known as Basketmakers, due to their great skill of craft. Soon their farming replaced hunting and gathering. They build little homes called pithouses. Which were build in small villages tight together. They learned how to create pottery and better weapons, such as the bow and arrow. They also used nature to an advantage when creating their many crafts. Their population continued to grow and they build bigger and better houses. Their name which means village dwellers describes them very well. Archaeologist can see how talented they were at the Mesa Verde National Park, where there is a spectacular reminder of their ancient culture.              All information found in source number 2 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World.'    The Pavlopetri is known as the sunken settlement. It was found underneath Southern Greece's waters. It dates,2800 to 1200 BC back to almost 5,000 years ago. Pavlopetri is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor and less than 1 % of the ocean floor has been discovered. Archaeologist were able to find a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. There was also thousands of pieces of pottery found. Since the site has been submerged no one was able to reoccupied the area.          All of the information was found in source number 3 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets.'    Many things about the lost civilizations, the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, would not be known if archaeologist hadn't taken their time to research them. The Inca were very talented and organized people. That were discovered by the Europeans. Many archaeologists have proven what the Spanish told them was true, but there is still alot to be proven. Since no one can read the quipus the Incas still remain a giant puzzle. The Spaniards ended the wonderful rule of the Incas when they killed the king and toke over the empire. The Puebloans were very well talented crafters. They build baskets, pottery, and different types of houses. Their population was very large, so they usually build in villages of multiple story houses that could have fifty or more rooms in it. The first homes they lived in were the pithouses, that later became into the kiva. Their pottery was well crafted with persise details and colors.They got their name from the way they lived, Puebloans means village dwellers. The Pavlopetri was discovered under the Southern Greece waters. Many always thought there was something there, but never looked. Most were amazed by how much there was discovered. It is one of the few areas discovered submerged and not reoccupied. Archaeologists have spend years discovering these ancient civilizations, putting all the clues together.

Like over the years we found alot of stuff like we have found The Kiva is the fire pit,bench and a Air defletor Kiva is a hopi word for cremonial room. Socal now we call them churches it would give you lucj in hunting and alot of other stuff such like Good Crop.The structers are evidence of society that over centuries,accumulaed skills and traditions and passed them on for gnerations.using nature to advantage,Ancestral Puebloans built there dwelling beneath the over hanging cliffs.       Now a days we discorveed the Lost Greek City of  Atlantis it is a place that is under water it was a Diver that found it. He was sunken into the Greece. it has bringon alot of poeple to to light to the Southern Greece.It was one of the most induring methyts. It was explored by The Angelo Greek team known as Pavlopetri it was 5,000 Years old.There is now no doubt that is the oldest sumureged town in the world,' saidDr jon Hendrson,Associet peoffesor of under water archeology at the Universty of Nottingham.       People lived in Pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 as settled agriculture began.Around A.D. 750 alout of stuff was made like basket were made and alot of other stuff.in about A.D. 1000 every thing got realy advanced from pole and adode.Walls of thick,Doubled couresed stone often rose two or three storeies high and were joined toghether into units of 50 rooms or more.

They all will give us information about their past and may help us with our present and future. Also, we can learn new things from it.         What the archeologist discovered about the Incas was that they, used clay and different materials to build walls, rooms, and enclosures. They had farmlands which grew food to eat. All of the different foods the ate and different ideas the Inca's came up with can and will help us with our life style today. The Inca's clothing and materials showed how they kept warm and protected their bodies. The Inca's lived in mountain ranges, cold climates, and high climates. When people would pass away they would use the snow and cold mountains to store away there bodies. The Inca's keeping the bodies in cold measurements, help preserve some what of the bodies. This helped the archeologists know how they died.         The Puebloans were basket makers. They hunted and gathered. They made pottery and used bow and arrows for many different things. They lived in Pit houses; which had a sunken living room, four corner timbers that supported the roof, a fire pit that had an air deflector, and may have contained storage bins or pits. The Puebloans, first started out with adobe and changed into stone to build walls.The population grew and grew over the years. But, then the population shifted. Perhaps they moved back in the alcoves. Maybe because of religious reasons or maybe for protection. But, the archeologists figured out a lot of new things about the Puebloans, that may be key information.          The archeologists discovered so many new things about different religions that may help us in the future. It also tells what they had to go through and what we may have to go through in the future or can prevent from happening.

Archaeologists can't determine what the string and knots mean. The way arichaeologists can determine how the Inca Empire was like is from the clues and the artifacts they find.   The Incas lived in the high Andes, so it makes living a bit more difficult for them, but not impossible. Archaeologists have found some evidence on how the Incan people have lived and the conditions they were in.

One particular ancient civilization were the Inca, they didn't have an alphabet or a system of writing. They would use string and tie knots in them called 'quipus' this tool would be used as a calendar to tell when the crops and or livestock were ready. When the Europeans came over they were surprised at the capability of their ruling power. You may ask how do we know so much about the Inca when they're no more in existence to this day.  Well the Europeans just happened to make journals about the Inca and how they lived what they worshiped and the kind of food they would eat. Another question you may ask yourself is how do we know so much more then what the Europeans wrote. Its very simple actually logical more then simple, the evidence of their ruling was left behind. For example the portraits of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, transportation, and ways of their life.  Now of coarse everything has a beginning and and end. the Inca for instance lived high up in the Andes and even in caves, for the reason why, we don't know to this day. One thing we do know is that the last Inca king was in fact murdered by the Spaniards in 1532.           National Parks are great places to be with family and have fun. On the other hand some place like Mesa Verde National Park, where Ancestral Puebloans lived, are a little to ancient to play with. If you are wondering how old ancient Mesa Verde National Park is, lets just say around 1,400 years ago they disappeared. Their is a difference though in time. The Ancestral Puebloans first settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. The Ancestral Pueblanos were very good at crafts making, about A.D. 750 they knew how to make houses above ground. They also soon started to build with skillful stone masonry instead of pole-and-adobe. You may seem to wonder about this time about how the people were able to spread out into the world. Well it wasn't if they were able to but they had to. The reason why was because of the over population. Soon after though they repopulated and then caused declination in the quality in many materials.           Myths are great story's to tell children for their amusement. Although some might amuse you. One for example is the great myth or story about Atlantis, the great sunken city. Although their have been sitings of the fable of Atlantis in the southern Greece waters. The first thing you may ask yourself is how does a sunken city stay sunken and still have the ability to be seen after many many years. Well the answer to that is the sand settlements that shift and enclose in a protective bay. Now what about the pottery and rock-cuts of buildings courtyards, main streets, and tombs and even religious structures. The big question though is how did the famous Atlantis get to the bottom of the ocean. Well what experts have said is that either an earthquake shook the city and ground subsidence to the bottom or either an tsunami washed the subsidence to the bottom of the ocean. What Dimitris Sakellariou, from the Greek Institute of Oceanography, said was 'It is very likely a combination of the first two,'.

But a question has been asked, why are these cities that we are so fascinated by so important to us. Well there are many answers this question. We can learn the way of life of some of our ancestors that we didn't even know existed. Also we can find out things that the ancient people did that is good for our society so that we can improve our world.  The well known myth of the lost city of Atlantis is a myth to Archaeologist but the ancient cities that they have found are no myth to them at all.        We can learn the way of life of some of our ancestors that we didn't even know existed. This is very important to us, because everyday we strive to learn more about our past so that we can use that information to even better our future life on earth. Also it fascinates everybody to know what life was like for there ancestors. This has always been a fascination for me. When I get a chance to learn about my ancestors, I take that chance and fly with it.         Another important reason why the discoveries about these ancient cities are important to us is because we can take the information of what made these cities very brilliant and add them to our society. With our society we can use all of the help that we can get to make it better. I think that there can be very important lessons that we can learn for these people that have lived in these lost cites long ago.        So these are the reasons why the discoveries of these long lost cities are very important to us. Like I said we can learn the way of life of some of our ancestors that we didn't even know existed.

The information we do have though, is very critical to finding out what these ancient civilizations were. This is why these discoveries are so important to the history of our world.               Information on the Inca is mainly all from oral history or from the stories that Europeans had told. This is because the Inca kept strings records-- records that were held by string. Very few people knew how to interpret these structures so we do not know what some of these mean. Even though direct evidence was found from the Europeans that wrote down some of the Inca's stories, we must be careful when determining and analyzing these because they are coming from a very unreliable source; most of these stories were myths and the Europeans could have also translated wrong when inscribing this.                However, Puebloans have much more direct and accurate information studied upon them because they left behind many ancient structures such as pithouses or kiva; a ceremonial room. They also built their homes on the edges of cliffs and such. Even though we have physical evidence of what there buildings look like we do not have much information on their social behavior, unlike the Inca.                 The Pavlopetri were commonly more known as the city that may have started the myth about the lost city of Atlantis. According to Dr. Jon Henderson this ancient settlement is the oldest under-water city that they have on record and know about. The ocean floor was covered with ancient towns, pottery bits, and many other clues that were a part of the Pavlopetri's way of life.                 Because there is very few information on each of these civilizations, it makes every little bit of information vitally important for the discoveries of history and the furtherly extended knowledge of the world.

I believe we as humans can learn more from different societies and see the different way of life that can help us better understand the evolving of technology and humanity.  The societies were lost and there civilizations were forgotten, but have been revealed through the discovery of artifacts and stories passed down from generation to generation.  Through the passed down stories people have been determined to find these lost civilizations, and they did.        In ancient Inca, archaeologists have determined that the civilization ruled South America from 1438-1532.

We have found some of the biggest discoveries that will allow us to learn about thise amazing empire. These discoveries helped us learn alot about the Inca. They allowed us to learn about the Incas religion, art, archittecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. These discoveries alone let us learn alot about the Inca and we can also use these clues to gather other information about the Inca life. We also made great discoveries about the Puebloans and Pavloperti. It is safe to say that these discoveries were so important because if these discoveries weren't made the great histories of these civilizations would be gone.       People used to think that the Pavloperti (Atlantis) was a myth but these discoveries have been made proving that this great civilization wasn't a myth. The same things could have happened with the Inca and Puebloan civilizations if these things weren't discovered. We also want to know alot about other civilizations because its part of history and its good to learn about history. We can also learn sbout how these civlizations got lost and how they got destroyed. The people of these civilizations could be some people's ancestors how would they know about their family history if these ancient civilizations weren't discoveried.       These discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavloperti are important to our history. If they weren't discoveried these civilizations would be forgotten. Lost history is never good in my mind and in the mind of historians. We can use these discoveries to learn about about these fascinating civilizations. We can also learn about their war tactics and weapons. In conclusion the discoveries of these great civilizatons are very important to history.

But why do we consider these findings important ? i think they're important because they show how advanced they were for the time, their culture, and why did they leave their civilizations?   the findings in these civilizations help us understand how advanced they were. firstly the pueblos built there homes out of mud and etc and they have still survived today. the Incas used strings to work their government.   finding these civilizations artifacts also helps us understand their culture. For example the Incas artifacts found in ruined building help understand their culture. The decline of  weaved baskets quality  in the mesa Verde culture show how popular their crafted pottery became. the whole lost Greek city shows ancient Greek culture.   finally these findings help us see why they left there settlements. In the Greek lost city they've been able to discover that natural occurrences made the city sink. theyr'e still using artifacts today to figure what happened to them.   in conclusion you can see how important artifacts are to discoveries of how theses civilizations worked, their culture and why they died out.

But have you heard of the Incans, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri? I think not. One does not simply know about these three ancient civilaztions. I am here to tell about why the discoveries of the Incans, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important.                    The Incans were from peru and they didn't have a formal alphabet or system of writing. They made knots in colored string called quipus to record the calender to keep a record of livestock. The europeans were amazed and impressed by the ability of the Incans to run a huge empire using just some old strings to keep record. Nobody today can read these ancient quipus so understanding the ancient Incz is a lot like solving a mystery. This discovery is important because it shows that even without an alphabet or writing system, the Incans were able to thrive.                    The Puebloans were from mesa verde and they were skilled crafters. They were known as 'basketmakers' for their great skill of craft. they could make lots of items from bows and arrows, to pottery. They even built their own homes from scratch called Pithouses. They normally had a living room sunk a few feet in the ground and four corner timbers supporting the roof. this discovery is important because it shows how skilled craftsman this civilaztion was.                    These were very important civilaztions because they proved and helped us with a lot of things. The Incans were able to record data with just string and the Puebloans helped evolve crafting.

Did you know that the Inca's made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock that they had. The first Europeans that met the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire, just using strings and knots to keep track of everything. How do we know about a civilization that for nearly 100 years ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient rome? (1438-1532) Well, because the Inca left clues and artifacts that now show us how they lived.

In the three articles, the exploration of new areas excited many people to learn about the mysteries surrounding it. The necessity to further gain knowledge about certain parts of history leads to further exploration, like the Incans, Pueblanos and the Pavlopetri.         First of all, the Incan empire was one of the largest in South America that rivaled the expansion of the Roman empire. They kept record by coloring string and making knots in the string to mark important dates. Most of our knowledge about Incans come from historical stories told by the Spaniards from what they heard, but since the Spaniards did not understand the Incan language very well we can not be certain. The artifacts that some Incans had tell us a great deal about their history. Archeologist compare the stories to the artifacts to see if the stories are true or if they are just legends. Also, ariel photography helps us see patterns in the ground that we normally would not see on foot.         Secondly, the Pueblanos were groups of people who live in Mesa Verde and flourished there. The first pueblanos moved to mesa Verde in A.D. 550 and those people were very skilled in crafting and other arts. Basket weaving quality went down probably because of the rise of pottery. The pueblanos lived in pithouses which were primitive homes that included a firepit and air deflector. Overtime these homes evolved into adobe constructed homes. The Classic period included many more advanced homes. All of the pueblanos houses took advantage of the nature around it, to the benefit of themselves.        Lastly, the discovery of the underwater city of the Pavlopetri gave many greeks hope of further finding more underwater cities. This sunken settlement dates back from 2,800 to 1,200 B.C. The site straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor and it is believed to be consumed by the ocean in 1,000 B.C. Tghe last time this underwater city was occupied can be dated back to 5,000 years ago! The discovery of a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, raises the status of the settlement. There are three theories to why the settlement sank, one of them being that the sea level rise  while the other two  include the found subsiding as a result of earthquakes and a tsunami. Dimitrus of the Greek Institute of Oceanography says it is a combination of the first two. This submerged city is in fact reality but the lost city of   Atlantist is a myth, but this city keeps underwater exploration going. Less than 1% of the ocean floor has been discovered and there is still lots more to explore.         The discoveries of submerged cities keeps many explorers wanting to learn more about lost cities or empires. The necessity to gain further knowledge about new historical sites discovered, leads to the expansion of wanting more knowledge. More and more lost or mysterious sites are being explored for further knowledge and these lead to more and more discoveries.

Many people have may believed that this was a legend or just a make-believe story made by people to surprise their children. That has been until they have found their ruins and now their children would ask themselves how important this would be for them and how would this affect them.      In finding the Incas ruins, aarchaeologist have been able to find what the Incas have done in their past and that they wouldn't be considered forever lost. Their believes would be broought to our civilization. Their ruins would be able to be examined and that they may show us something that they knew and that we didn't know. In looking into them we can find something that we haven't known for a long time. An example is their way of counting thing, they would use quipus. They were some ropes that were knotted to do something for them. Some people still wondered how they were able to use quipus to count and archaeologist are trying to discover how they used it.       Another discovery were the Ancient Puebloans which still would leave us wondering. The discovery of the puobloes showed us that their were people in this world that used to live in pithouses which were underground. In this, they showed us that they were very skillful craftmen and they were to be known as Basketweavers. In the finding of the Ancient Pueblanos this lead to asking why would they leave their new places which were above ground and no longer underground to their first underground homes again?         Lastly the one of the most greatest discoveries was the Lost City of Atlantis. In city was to be thought as a fable until some one had brought it to the light. the city was found in the ocean beneath the southern east of greece. in finding the city many people have been amazed in how the city was constructed. it was very unique even though many other city have been found in places underneath the ocean that have been there longer, too. in the way that the city was drowned many people may have gotten into conclusion about how it was drowned into the ocean.           Many city have been found in many places and had made a big difference in our world. these were just some of the most splendid discovery that were important. These discoveries have changed the ways that we have worked and lived.

The Inca's taught us today about how they used different techniques to do different things.            The Pueblonas taught us how they lived in different houses.

We have so much evidence and if we can find more and more we can find out lots of things about them when they were living. Many architecs have been found in the city and the archarologists can use that evidence to help them about the Inca's and what they did while they were living.             The archaeologists have found so much evidence. They just need to put it all together and find all missing pieces. The Inca's are very important and very mysterious if we can find how they lived then I'm certain that we can find many other things about them too.              The discoveries of the peublones are very important too. If we find pieces of evedence then we can find out how they lived and what they were like. Also mabye some of the evidence will find out why they left their home and moved away.              This evidence of a lost underwater city is very important. This shows that there might still be atlantis, they say it's a myth, but this has brought it back to life. If we find evidence to this city maybe we can find more and more and find the lost city of atlantis.

They developed colorful, knotted strings called quipus   that served as a calendar. After the fall of the kingdom, archaeologists have found many artifacts tied to their way of life, such as   religion, government, and agriculture. The old legends and stories told through many generations represented what the Incas believed in. They buried the dead on hard-to-reach places, such as mountain peaks. These discoveries helped untangle the mysteries behind the Incas' way of life. It showed how they lived under different circumstances, and what they made that affected their lives.             The Pueblos were also an ancient tribe. They settled in Mesa Verde to start a new way of life. They were very skillful in the art of crafting. They farmed, hunted, and developed new techniques for catching animals. They produced the bow and arrow and found it more efficient than a spear. They also lived in pithouses, which contained an underground room, an air deflector, and four timbers that supported the roof.  Basketmakers made great profit making baskets. The people of Mesa Verde began to evolve their way of life, updating their tools. The Ancestral Puebloans built their homes underneath overhanging cliffs, to be protected by the environment.  It was not long until they evacuated their homes and disappeared. These discoveries advanced the understanding of ancient tribes, and how they lived in the past.              The Pavlopetri was an old group of settlers that built a big, tremendous city. The entire city inself was sunken into the deep water depths, which archaeologists have just rediscovered. Broken bits of pottery showed that the Pavlopetri had their own arts and crafts. The discovery of this underwater city advanced the understanding of ancient civilizations.

Ssome of there stories have been passed down from generation to generation. There ancient artifacts might be made from gold, stone or silver. All the things that the the geographers have found has truly helped us figure out haw life was back then.       Pueblos used hunting and gathering as the way of living. they lived in penthouses made out of had stuff. They made lots of pottery. The pueblo ans were like village people. They had churches called kiva. vivas held gatherings, it was a place to pray, have church. The kivia hat heat, benches and air ventilators. The kiva was made up out of stone sand.       Marine geologists are know tars pavlopetri. The marine geologist have found things from 1200 BC.  Pavlopetris have found a sunken citie found in Greece. Only 1% of the ocean floor has been looked at. Marine eoloigst have many devices to help they discover what things are and how old they are when they find something new. Somtimes they find over 9,000 square meters of new buildings.

Most people do not know without their technology we would not be were we are today. From the modern home to jewelry we have many similarities to them.        Archaeologists discoveries of the Inca helped us better understand how they lived in high altitudes. With their discoveries we can find ways to live in high altitudes using improved methods based off of their methods. Another method for living is from the Ancestral Puebloans 	JJS NNS VBP IN IN NN NNS JJ RB VBP RB RB NNP NNP NNS VBP RB VB IN PRP$ NN PRP MD RB VB RB PRP VBP NNP NNP DT JJ NN TO VB PRP VBP JJ NNS TO NNP NNPS NNS IN DT NNP VBD PRP JJR NN WRB PRP VBD IN JJ NNP NNP PRP$ NNS PRP MD VB NNS TO VB IN JJ NNS VBG VBN NNS VBN RP IN PRP$ NNP NNP NN IN NN VBZ IN DT NNP NNP	1		20131024141034	2338	0		20131024151036	2358	1		20131025161040	2381	1

I say this because in the source 2 there is a kiva and that is a pretty advanced house for back then and it was supported by logs mud adn some leaves as filler. My theiry is that atlantis does exist somewere. I say this because on sorce 3 they found a whole city in the water off the land a ways and the incas wouldnt build a underwater city because they couldnt live down there. So I think that when they lived that was land and not covvered by water as it is today. And recent studies have shown that a long time ago around the unided states there was a extra 500 miles of land that is know underwater from the rising seas. It is hard for use to see what is what exactualy because people over the many years would stumble across these sights and take or even move some of the ardifacts so people couldnt find out the real truth about the incas. For what reson you might ask but we dont know why someone would tamper with a amazing anchent chivalitation. If we can find out what the anchent language was that would help us so mutch. We know that the incas used nots on ropes to recor things but there was never a translation for them and some of there so called history can also be a story or a book we dont know and we probably wont ever know.          The incas used an equivalent to our brick today. They used a cut peace of sandstone that was about the size of a loaf of bread. That is how they wwould build there house but the weird but amazing part is that they would somehow build them into the side of a cliff witch to me is amazing that they did that back then.          This is somewhat off topic but the incas village was underwater today but back then it wasnt. So we should spent some time and money to look for atlantis because it could have been on land when they lived but now it can be under what so i think that it would be good to see and look for it and see if there is any other civalazations that we do not know about or that we just never found becuase we never looked for them. Like we know more about space than our own waters so I think that should be the opposite of that and mabye we would find something extrordinary.

For example the Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and the Ancient Greeks. Since we know so little , every shred of evidence we find is extremely important. The things they left behind give us clues of how they lead their everyday lives.             High up in the monumental Andes Mountains lived the Incas a great civilization that rivaled  Ancient Rome. The Incas had no written language instead they kept all their records using the knots on a string.  Which makes it difficult for us to fathom their everyday lives. So any time we find a untouched Incan site everything is recorded, down to the last pebble.               On the cliffs in North America you see the home of Ancestral Puebloans . Their is very little known about these people and why they later abandoned their homes in the cliffs.Since they left so long ago much of the things they used in their everyday lives are gone. Which further proves that no matter what little things are their every bit is extremely important so we can find out how they lived.                Deep down underwater is an ancient sunken city over 5,000 years old. Discovered over 40 years ago but not properly explored until today. This sunken city is frozen in time and since no one ever reoccupied it, is in perfect condition.  This city shows us what Greece was like long ago before the Romans sucked it into their empire. As result the very little we know about the Greeks came from the Romans. This proves that important discoveries such as this will shape history in the future.           The ancient world is a mystery we have not yet completely unraveled. With every clue we find we put a bit more of the puzzle together. Which is why even a shard of pottery is extremely important. Looking at ancient sites helps piece together how  people lived long ago which is why archeology is so important.

There is no doubt that that is the oldest submerged town in the world. the site is 30,000 meters of the ocean floor off the south Peloponnese, believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.            The shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. The seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.

Let's start at the Inca. Throughout time the Inca lived in the country of Peru unbeknowest that soon something should happen to them. Even today we still don't know much about the Inca but we have learned that through the many artifacts found left the Inca used to use things called quipus to keep records. The Puebloans lived in houses called Pithouses and up in the mountains and that there may have been a city of Atlantis were all discovered by archeologists who just want to learn all about our world and our past.

They touched on how they lived and all the artifacts they found.          In the first source explains the Incas way of living. The Incas left behind the most artifacts between the three articles. We also know the most on them I feel. The left behind pottery and gold, silver, and stone. You could find artifacts in their graves and in tombs and all over. They had specific ways to build things because you can tell it was theirs and not the spaniards just by the way the designed them.          In the second source they talked about the Mesa people. One of the key points was the pithouses. They were the average house for the people. Another thing was the Kiva . They were churches. People would parlay for rain there, luck in hunting, or a good crop.           In the third source they talked about the lost city of Atlantis. Everybody thinks its a myth but now they are starting to prove that it is real. Atlantis is the oldest sunken city. They found religious buildings and pottery under the sea. It looked as if the town was growing when it went under. I'm still confused on how and why it went under but that's a mystery that I will later uncover.

He is a beautiful boy and so are his bandmates. Hos vocals are like no other and he and his Little Things nobody can compare to.                When Harry Styles was 16 he took it upon himself to addition for The X-Factor. Making it past the addition and into boot camp. You see not many young boys like Harry make it past this stage. And as expected he was eliminated there. But a judge at the time and throughout the composition saw something in him and 4 other boys. He called them all back and offered them the opportunity to become a boyband. Which they agreed to do. Thus becoming One Direction. Now 3 years later being the biggest boyband in the world.              Harry Styles a name you hear a lot. Hair so curly you could get your finger lost. Curls get the girls just so happens to be a saying that describes Harry very well, being the most popular of the boys. Dark brown curls like Harry's cant stay forever, over the year his hair thinning out. Although his curls still remain. His curls arent all that get the girls though. His green eyes can make you feel as if your weak at the knees. Vibrat green eyes popping out in all his pictures. Eyes like that dont come around everyday, nor do they last. Over the years along with his hair they have darkened. From a bright green to a darker shade. Yet he is still beautiful.             From Up All Night to Take Me Home One Direction sells number one albums all over the world. Not only do they have platnum albums but they have sold out tours. There tours sell out in the matter of minutes, so you better plan ahead if you want to go to a One Direction concert. Havent been to a concert of theyers? Dont worry, the youtube videos tell all. Being young beautiful boys they mess around all the time. Even in the most serious solos the 4 other boys always try to mess around. While they perform What Makes You Beautiful Harry has a solo near the end, as all the boys form around him they make funny faces and rip off his shirt to mess up his solo. You would think he'd mess up with the boys goofing around behind him? Not a word or note missed. Being the biggest boy band in the world they are deffinetly profecinal.              Now that you know some about the boy of few words, you can tell that any of the articals writen on the young boy about being a Wonenizer and false. He may have good looks anc can charm a girl with his smile but his word and talent comes before messing around anyday.

First of all, the Inca was important because the Inca formed an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportration, and a way of life. It was also a textiles and clothing that have also survived remarkably well.            Then, Peubloans was an important because Puebloans were heirs of virgous civilization, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank the finest expressions of human culture in North America. Peubloans may have used kivas for healing ritees or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop.             Finally, Pavlopetri was an important because Pavlopetri is the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unpredecndented, experts say.             These are good  reason to prove that Inca, Peubloans, and Pavlopetri was an important because Inca was an important way to preserve a community's history, Peubloans were the beginning to lead a more settled way of life, and Pavlopetri was the heroesin terms of size.

I think this because we go to school enough days and we go later in the school year. When we have to make up days, we get more days in June and have less summer days when most people want to have time to relax and also we go in later to school when we should jsut go into school in Agust but instead our school days get pushed faster into the year making it in September when we could have already been in school learning about new things that we forgot about turning the summer break.

Archaeologists set action to go to the ruins of where was said the Inca once lived. They found artifacts known as quip us. These instruments were used to record such data, such as&mdash;counting livestock. They were also used to tell stories, otherwise legends. Most Inca lived in the Andes mountains, which archaeologists have inferred that they had probably worshiped the mountain peaks. The Inca had flourished in the Andes, yet some were buried by rubble&mdash;which also helped them to stop being disturbed by looters, who take their artifacts. Did you know the Inca were taken over by the Spaniards? Apparently, Inca do not exist anymore because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king back in 1532. Archaeologists have studied Inca carcass to determine how they've lived and how they've died.       Archaeologists have also studied the Pueblo-ans of Mesa Verde. Thee people were known to be skilled in crafting. They used to live in pit houses, but then have upgraded to houses above the ground. These houses were one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pit house or two in front. They later evolved into kivas. Kivas were the finest built in Mesa Verde. The Pueblo-ans made baskets, which shows evidence of decline in quality. There were also cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde. They built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Sandstone was the basic material used for building. They were shaped into rectangular blocks, along with mud and water between them. They used sandstone to build kivas.       The archaeologists, Anglo-Greek, along with marine geologists, set out into the depths of the ocean to the lost Greek city. 'This city was the oldest submerged town in the world,' says Dr. Jon Henderson, associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham. The team had found ceramics which they say dates back to the end of the stone age. They state that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago. Discovering this city has UNraveled the myth of Atlantis.       With all this being discovered, archaeologists can make inferred conclusions and tell the world how it used to be back when the people of the old age lived. If we have lived in these locations, we can learn about our ancestors and such. We could also learn how much, possibly, pottery meant to our ancestors. Or, we could wonder about the old historical landmarks and think, What exactly happened here? Where did these people go to? Or, even wonder if maybe where your flat is, was where burials or even an old shop was. That is how learning about the people in the past makes our curiosity even larger.

The ancient civilizations from the past helped us modernize the world to what we see today.       The Inca, an ancient civilization of Peru, invented things before we knew about them. The Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing, instead, they left knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Before we have had calendars, the Inca had already discovered a way to easily tell time.       The Puebloans, who lived about 1,400 years ago, chose Mesa Verde as their home. The Puebloans learned how to make pottery, a bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower, and also made pithouses, a fort where there is a fire pit in the middle and the roof is held up by four corner timbers. The Puebloans were advanced for their time.       The Pavlopetri, a lost city which may have inspired the myth of Atlantis, is a town that dates back 5,000 years and is completely submerged in water. The sunken town when explored, revealed to us 9,000 square meters of new buildings. By closer investigation, the archeologists discovered a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall which suggests the town had been used by an elite.       The discoveries of the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri have helped us understand about our past and that other people have had inventions before we hadn't even thought of or had done differently. These discoveries help us know what happened yesterday to better improve the world tomorrow.

Children are told to learn from the past, and not to make the mistakes their predecessors made. This past is found and organized by archeologists and historians, and told to the public with newspaper articles and magazines. Through discoveries from artifacts and the homelands of ancient civilizations, lots of effort on the parts of the archeologists, as well as pure dumb luck on the part of geography, the public has been able to learn about many ancient civilizations.            Archeologists have made many discoveries based off artifacts and cities of ancient civilizations. The buildings of what historians are calling the Ancestral Puebloans, which by A.D. 1000 were made of 'thick, double-coursed stone' and rose more than two stories high to join into 'units of fifty rooms or more', show the culture of a people that were 'adept at building, artistic in their crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land.' Also, Pavlopetri, the 'oldest submerged town in the world,' as a site on the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese has been dubbed by the associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham, Dr. Jon Henderson, has brought many discoveries about how the Mycenaean people lived. This 'world of buildings, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures' show that the town might have been used by the elite, and, as Henderson puts it, 'raises the status of the settlement.'            However, not all of the settings of archeological discoveries were as easy to get to as the cliff homes of the Ancestral Pueboans. Pavlopetri, the underwater city, was discovered by a British oceanographer in               geography and weather conditions can help 1 and 3   difficulties for archeologists 1 and 3     	DT JJ VBZ IN JJ DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN , IN RB NNP NNP VBP VBN TO VB IN DT JJ , CC RB TO VB DT NNS PRP$ NNS NNP NNP NN VBZ VBN CC VBN IN NNS CC NNS , CC VBD TO DT NN IN NN NNS CC NNP NNP VBZ IN NNS CC DT NNS IN JJ NNS , NNS IN NN IN DT NNS IN DT NNS , IN RB IN NN NN NN IN DT NN IN NN , DT NN VBZ VBN JJ TO VB IN JJ NN NNP NNP VBP VBN JJ NNS VBN RP NNS CC NNS IN JJ NNP NNP NNS IN WP NNS VBP VBG DT NNP NNP , WDT IN NNP CD VBD VBN IN JJ , JJ NN '' CC VBD RBR IN CD NNS JJ TO VB IN JJ IN JJ NNS CC JJR '' , NN DT NN IN DT NNS WDT VBD JJ IN NN , JJ IN PRP$ NNS , CC JJ IN VBG DT NN IN DT JJ NNP '' NNP , NNP , DT JJS JJ NN IN DT NN , '' IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN NNP VBZ VBN VBN IN DT NN NN IN NN NN IN DT NNP IN NNP , NNP NNP NNP , VBZ VBN JJ NNS IN WRB DT NNP NNS NNP NNP NNP IN NNS , JJ NNS , JJ NNS CC JJ NNS POS NN IN DT NN MD VB VBN VBN IN DT JJ , CC , IN NNP NNS PRP , VBZ DT NN IN DT NNP POS NNP , RB DT IN DT NNS IN JJ NNS VBD RB JJ TO VB TO RB DT NN VBZ IN DT NNP NNP NNP , DT NN NN , VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN IN NN CC NN NNS MD VB CD CC CD NNS IN NNS CD CC CD	2		20131024151017	2332	2		20131024151027	2338	1		20131025171055	2381	2

The Inca didn't have an alphebet or writing they just used pictures to express things. The Europeans wrote about the Inca's in diarries and in letters. Some of their old homes have been disturbed and there treasures taken and some haven't been discovered.       About 1,400 years before Europeans explored North America a group of people chose Mesa Verde as their home. After a generation or two they moved away leaving there belongings behind. A puebloans (or green table) was one of the first things found. People lived in pithouses from avout A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 as settled agriculture began. At about A.D. 750 they began making houses above ground.       Ever since 1880 when the cowboys reported the cliff dwellings archeologists have sought to understand these people's lives. Because there isn't a lot of evidence of them scientific knowledge remains unknown. However, they have found some evidence, like small things.       Other myths like the lost Greek city of Atlantis may also be a myth. Explorers and scientists have searched for this city before and have not found it. However this would be one of the oldest submerged towns in the world. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC. There are older sunken sites but none can be considered to be planned towns such as Atlantis.       Now all we can do is keep looking to find these lost things. maybe they are myths but they could be true. Many of thes myths are passed down by our ansesters to tell us about the past things that may be true.

They travel the world, and find many things. When you get older, would you like to become an archaeologist?       Achaeologists make a lot of ,oney because the the artifacts they find. They make  about 250 or 300 thousany dollars a year. My friends dad is an archaeologist and he gets paid a lot because of all the stuff he fnds. Did you know that if your an archaeologist the government pays for your plane ticket?       They also get to encounter many different exotic animals. They see elephants, monkeys, different types of fish, wild dogs, wild boars, and lizzards. In the caves they see bats and rats crawling all over the place. It can get a bit creepy at times, but you have to be brave to be an archaeologist. Thats is another reason I would like to be an archaeologist.       Archaeologists even make new friends on their journey. For example, if you need help finding something and someone helps you, they might become your new friend. One time on this show I saw an archaeologist help another guy and his family get home safely, and they invited the archaeologist to stay with them and feed him. That is the reason I want to be an archaeologist.       Archaeologist are very cool. He or she finds artifacts. They make a lot of money. Encounter many different animals. Make new friends. They also have to be brave. A lot of people dont recognize the hard work archaeologist have to do.

Mainly because from this research we can learn more about our own kind and where we came from. We can also learn what happened thousands of years ago on the land we live on today. There are many reasons why, but from what I've learned, here are some why discoveries I've learned about from the Inca, the Puebloans, and t Pavlopetri are so important.       The Inca tribes lived high in the Andes mountains, and they even worshiped mountain peaks! A lot of their tribes were remote, icy, and in high places. Many of the Incas were buried in these icy capsuals and the cold climates acted as a freezer. Not only did this make it harder for tomb looters to get in, but it also preserved the bodies of the Incas and their belongings/ artifacts. Experts can use modern medical scanning and equipment to learn how the ancient tribe lived. This is important because we can discover more about why the Inca tribe died off and why there are no living today.       The Puebloans lived in homes called Pithouses to keep warm and cook food during cold and summer months. The hole in the top of the house was used to let fire escape. From these fires, the Puebloans cooked food and used the fires to keep warm during cold months. A lot of the ancient tribe basket weaved which was usually done inside the Pithouses. When the tribe died off, these Pithouses preserved the baskets and archeologists were then able to learn more about the ancient tribe that once inhabited the Mesa Verde. This is important because archeologists are able to find out more about the tribe.       Beneath the waters of Southern Greece, Marine geologists discovered a sunken city with remains that dated back 5,000 years ago. Although it was discovered about forty years ago, with today's modern technology, geologists were able to survey the area. The exploration revealed buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.

Archeologists had study for many of years to tell us about the Inca, Pueblos and the Pavlovian because of the weird locations. The Incas made it hard for Archeologists because they were up on Andes mountain. It was weird for Archeologists because they had to run back and forth to find minor things to study about the people before us. They only learned so much from the minor remains. But the importance that we found them was great because they effected how we lived today we learn from what they did. We took what they had and added on to it made it better.

There are a few ways we know what happend in the past to present day one way is the sciencefic why of going and looking at the minrals in the ground another way is getting artfacts like in paragragh two ' The First Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records'. This is another example because this shows use that since we found that we can now go back and date all the way back to when the empire was formed what things happend when people died because they keep records like thats which made is way easier for them to find how old just that city to date back when the was formed so  in a way there is a easy way but there is a hard way .

Nobody is able to read or comprehend this strange way of writing.             The only way we have discovered them is that there have been people who have met them and communicated with them. They still could not get very much information on them.             There are preserved bodies and artifacts. The bodies were preserved by coldness or by enclosure. The artifacts were preserved by being underwater or in the ground for a long time. It could be complicated to comprehend these artifacts due to erosion, but that does not mean we can't learn about the Incas.             They lived in cave dwellings and in little huts. They communicated by a special language and text. They could not leave archives for historians to study. The strings were called quipus.

This is why they are.       The ancient Inca of Peru  had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They made colored knots in strings that are called quipus so that they could record the calendar so they could keep track of the livestock.      How do we know some of the old stories? Well we know some of them because they were written down by the Europeans that arrived in the empire in 1532. They were the Spanish soldiers and priests. The rest of our Inca comes from the artifacts, or the objects left behind, and also where they are found.      The structures are the evidence of the society, over centuries, accumulated skills and some traditions and passed them onto generation to generation  and so on. The accomplishments in the community living and the arts rank of the finest of expressions of the human culture in North America.     Secrets of the lost city may inspire one of the world's most enduring myths. The sunken dates back 5,000 years ago. 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' Dr. Jon Henderson said. It straddles about 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off of the Southern Peloponnese, it is believed to be consumed by sea around 1000 BC.      So now I think we know what the big deal is about with all this. Now we know why the Puebloans, the Pavlopetri and Inca is all about. Its part of our history and we can't just ignore it.

Some destroyed, some taken over, and some just disappear with no reason at all. The Mesa Verde, Inca, and the city of 'Atlantis' all are lost civilizations, eroded away over time. Archeologist dig away for things to help explain these 'lost cities' but sometimes, to no avail. Swimming, climbing, and digging are all part of an archeologists work but in these three cities they're going to need all three  skills.              In the Inca civilization, archeologists are unsure what their writing 'language' is yet. You see to keep track of time and livestock, the Inca's used bright colorful strings, leaving archeologists unsure. Though the Spaniards had notebooks to keep notes on the Inca's, archeologists are unsure how much is true, and how much is a legend yet. Through out the years, archeologists have learned very much through the Inca's artifacts left behind... They also examined the bodies of the dead Inca's so they could learn more about them. The Inca's had lived near the Andes so there are dead bodies that the archeologists can climb up the mountains for and since the coldness kept their bodies fresh they could easily do experiments to better see how the economy had worked for them.         In the Mesa Verde, the whole civilization was pretty much mad for art. They learned to Make pottery, Basket weaving, a bow and arrow and also Pit houses! Their population quickly escalated and since they were great with art they quickly learned how to make houses above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. Then once again they upgraded from pole building to skillful stone masonry. There were walls of thick double-coursed stone that often rose 2 or 3 stories high! and were joined together into 50 rooms! The poetry had also changed from simple designs on a dull background to black drawings on a white background. But then... they disappeared, moved to caves, lest their villages for no apparent reason at all. Archeologists believe that maybe there was a threat or a political problem, but at the time it is still unknown.         Finally 'Atlantis' the reason I put that in quotations is because archeologists believed this is the place that started the rumors of a sunken city. years ago a city sunk beneath the depths of the ocean off of the waters of southern Greece. But every one knows the story of the magical sunken city! Though I guess this isn't exactly magical but really a sunken city that just... sunk. Believe it or not that cities been there for the past 5,000 years! And it's the oldest submerged town in the world! When they found it, it surpassed all expectations, thanks to shifting sand and other natural causes, the exploration revealed courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures! To top that off there were thousands of shards of poetry around.             So there have been thousands of lost civilizations. Some were figured out... and some are just lost. Maybe the world will never know the secret of the colorful string or the beautiful artwork, or even the sunken city, we don't know, because all good things have a catch.

Probably not, but it is the only way we can find out about our past as humans. Three discoveries have been found about the Incas, Puebloans, and Greeks. Of all of these the most relevant one is the Incans.                                                           The Incans have an unknown history. Since they did not have a system of writing, the only was we can find out about them is through the artifacts and bodies of these people. The only true recording was from the spanish about how their legends and myths, but not history. This is why the Incan discoveries are important. They found that they used a quipus to keep count of something and use it as a record. The archeologists can even find out how the people lived and died. The Incans were buried in mountains sides, caves, and on the mountain tops. Because some of the bodies were preserved in a good condition, they can scan the and find the cause of death. This is why small discoveries can bring up a ot of information on this tribe.                          The Puebloans lived in th region of North America. There's even a park ran by this tribes desendants. We deffinatly know more about these people than the Incans. We know that they lived sometime in A.D. 1200. Over time they became skilled craftsman and lived in a clustered vilage. Eventualy, they lived in cliffs in the region of the U.S. We have already known about them because some of the cowboys reported of these people in the 1880's. Though we do not know why they left, we do know the structures and artifacts they left. They made temples that are comparable to churches.                           It has always been thought that the greeks were the ones to have started the myth of atlantis. A city was actualy found in southern greece which is under water. Could this city be Atlantis? Possibly, but it is beeing excavated. Archeologists have concluded that it is the oldest underwater city in the world. It was sunken sometime in 1000 B.C. They have found many artifacts like shards of pottery plus buildings, tombs, temples, etc. They are still debating what caused it to sink, if it was a tsunami, an earthquake, or both. but one thing is for certain, it i a wonder of the ancients.

The Incas had a empire greater than the Romans but their empire was destroyed by Spanish conquerors. Now there isn't much known for sure about their life style. Spanish soldiers and priests  wrote down stories told by Incas but it is unknown if the soldiers and priests knew what the Incas said or if they learned the Incas language. Most of the Incas stories have been lost because they had no alphabet or system of writing. The Incas burial sites have been found in the Andes Mountains with objects made from stones, pottery, gold, or silver. The bodies that are preserved tell about how they lived.

To name a few there are the ancient Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. All three   societies existed around a similar time period. Like most ancient civilizations they are   mysterious, Wondrous, and harbor many secrets we have yet to discover.          The Incas lived in around 1438 to 1532. During that time they created an amazing empire with a religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government and even transportation. They lived happy and peaceful lives for many years and we know this because they left behind artifacts, passed down stories and even the Spaniards wrote down accounts of their lifestyle. Though we have many stories from the Spaniards we cannot entirely deem them truthful because the Spanish did not fully understand the Inca language. Incas had a system of colorful knotted ropes used to transport information but because we don't have any living Incas we cant translate or even vaguely understand them. The Incas had an extremely well developed civilization and deserve the widespread popularity they get today.          Unlike the Incas the Puebloans lived for some 700 years. They lived in Mesa Verde for the entire time then strangely in the late A.D. 1200s the entire population all moved away. While they were still there though they were known basket makers and lived in pit houses built into the ground and clustered together. They learned how to make pottery, began to use the bow and arrow, and better for hunting, the spear. They became prosperous and began living in above ground houses. They became more agriculture based and their art became more advanced. Eventually they grew in population to the thousands then suddenly began to move back to their ancestors preferred housing in cliff alcoves. They reverted for no apparent reason.          The Palvopetri were a great community that lived in a now submerged town in Greece.  They lived long and prospered and the town was thought to be occupied by elite due to a building found that very much resembled a courthouse. They think that the town sunk because of sea level changes and earthquakes. Also this is the only sunken ruin found that was created before Plato spread the Myth of Atlantis.          All in All these three ancient civilizations have blown away what we ever expected to come of the traces found of them. Yet we still have so much more of the world to explore maybe we will eventually fully understand these and many more civilizations.

In the discovery of mesa verde national park about 1,400 years ago, long before europeans explored north america.Mesa verde national park preserves a spectacular reminder of this acient culture.Archeologist haved called these people anasazi from the navajio word sometimes transalated as the 'the acient ones' or 'acient eneimies'.               In the lost greek city that have may have inspired atlantis myth gives up secerets of the worlds most enduring myths.

The lost cities and towns allows archaeologists to find many important artifacts. Such places as the Inca, the city of the Puebloans, and the underwater city of Pavlopetri have had many important artifacts. These places have helped find artifacts, clothing, and the way the ancient people once lived.    The Inca people were very important and archaeologists have found many important artifacts. Archaeologists have found clothing, textiles, buildings, and stories of Spaniards. The buildings helped archaeologists figure out how they lived. Stories are still being figured out. Archaeologists don't know if they stories are real or if they are myths. The Inca left many important artifacts behind, but some are still trying to be found.    Mesa Verde and the Puebloans are also very important. They left abandoned buildings behind. This helped archaeologists figure out how they raised crops and lived. Also, houses were found on cliffs. This shows that cliffs probably helped the Puebloans with protection. The Inca and the Puebloans weren't the only important founding, the Pavloperti were also.    The Pavloperti is extremely important. The Pavloperti is an underwater city. This can relate to the myth of Atlantis. Pavloperti also shows how people lived. The buildings and roads were important. there was also religious buildings. Even though the city of Pavloperti is underwater, it has a huge significance.    The city of Pavloperti, Mesa Verde, and the Inca people are very important. They show modern people and archaeologists how people used to live. It was very interesting. Many artifacts were found. Even if they are old houses, and underground city, or old clothing, everything shows something. Everything they have found is extremely important.

Would you like to find out? For millions and millions of years people lived without the technology and electricity that we have today. Can you imagine your life without electricity or without technology? What will you do? Learn how your ancestors did it. Learning about how they lived is really important because it can teach us a whole lot.                   The Incas lived in the high cold mountains of Peru. They did not have heaters to keep them warm or easy water transportation as we do today. So how did they do it to get water across such big tall mountains? This is why it is so important to learn how they lived. Archeologists do not know much because mountain looters or treasure unters have took it all. But what can we learn from the textiles that have been found?                    What can we learn from the city that has been found in the ocean? We can learn alot. For example from the building that were found we can learn about their archictecture. There is alot more to learn. That is why it is so important to learn about this. We welcome you to do so.                    	DT NNP , NNP CC DT NNP NNP PRP RB VBN WRB PRP$ NNS VBD IN NN , CC NN . MD PRP VB TO VB RP .

There are several reasons why. In this article, I'll help you understand why this topic is so important. The main three civilizations in this article are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.                            It is important to discover these civilizations because it gives us knowledge of what we were like in the past. It also lets us learn about how our ancestors lived, what they did, and what they belive in. For some people, this is not important, but for many others, learning about our past is an important task. Learning about early civilizations and how they fell also helps present day countries learn how to prevent their country from falling like their ancestors did all those years ago. Many others are just curios about how people lived before they did. I for one, am curios about how people lived a thusnd years ago, and I wonder ho people will live a thousand years from now.                           In conclusion, I belive that learning about ancient civilizations like the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri is important to us. I belive that one day, we might know everything about how we used to live. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB VBG JJ NNS VBZ RB JJ .

Today we think of them as indians who were uncivilized and barbaric but in reality they were much more intelligent then most of the pepole you'd see out on your street right now. They were the begining of our human civlization, how we got to were we are now, but those same cultures have been decived and betrayed by far more advanced civilizations around the world and its because of that, they no longer excised today.           The Ancient Inca for example, they had no formal alphabet or any system of writing they worked with what they had. Incas tied strings into knots to record the calendar and livestock they were called quipus the strings came in many differnet colors. The knots in those strings are not yet known what they were used for. Not much written history has come to archiologists most of what we know now has come from oral history, stories passed from generation to generation. The only actual written history was from the Europeans who showed up to the empire in 1532. They discribed the Incas in letters and diaries. One of the greatist mysterys of the Incas was that they dissapiered, they vanished no one knows what happened to them or were they whent. The mystery still remains.             The Ancestreal Puebloans are another great example of Ancent civilzations, they lived about 1,400 years ago they chose Mesa Verde for there homeland. That remained there homeland for more than 700 years. One of there uniuqe charicteristics was that they made there homes in the canyon walls. These homes have givin Arciologists alot of artifacts and infomation. They were also expert craftsmen they were known for there basketsand homes. They also replaced there hunting and gathering with farming as there main ways of gathering foods.             Another extermly fancinating culture was the lost greek city that may just have inspired atlanis. It was discovered by an Anglo-Greek team of archareologists and marine geologists.

When humans discovered their ancestors there were new ideas, thoughts and the idea of how we,as humans, where back then different than today. Along with this we are all in common with our genes, traits. When humans found out about there ancestor there were these carzy ideas that we started from scratch and we developed our mids, we became immune to disease, we become alot more smarterand we developed our own laungauge from other tribes. Humans have evolved for so long even still, today we are still changing. The Incas spoke different tounges than the Greeks and the Puebloans.

They are important because we need to know how our ancestors lived in the past. We need to know how others lived in order to compare and contrast. Archaeologists can learn new ways of doing things learning from the cultures from many tribes. Not only is it important, but it is also very interesting finding the ruins of buildings, pottery, stones, people and many other valuable things. It is also important to know how things have changed in the past, from how they are now; in the present. We can also find out why we look the way we do by seeing where we came from. Many tribes have massive statues of their ruler at the time and we can see what they looked like. We can learn how they treated their people, how they acted, and what they did by looking at their carvings and writings from walls or caves. We might even find out what they ate at the time, depending on their surroundings and the shapes and sizes of their pottery bowls. We can find out how they treated their kings or emperor by the size of their king's home and throne.

We learn their ways life by discovering where have they lived, their writing, art, music, and etc.                  How was the Incan civilization so important? The ancient Inca of Peru had no particular formal writing, but they used strings called quipus. they use to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. the people who first met the ancient Inca were the Europeans. They were shocked of how amazing they saw the Inca using strings to keep records. Sadly, the Incan strings could not be decoded or read into, but some clues were left behind by an Inca portrait, religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and ways of life.                             How was the Puebloan empire important? The first Ancestral Puebloans were settled in Mesa Verde around A.D. 550. They are known as 'Basketmakers,' for their skill of crafting items. Later around the civilization, the ways of their lives started to change; ffarmers now began hunting. The Puebloans lived in Pithouses, pithouses were usually placed in clustered, small villages or sometimes cliff recesses. They learned how to make pottery and know how to use the bow. They made bows so it was easier to hunt than using the atlatl, a throwing spear.                 Was Atlantis an actual city? The lost city of Atlantis was one of the great myths. Dr. Jon Henderson states that the long lost city was not the oldest submerged town because 'it was remained dating around 2800-1200 BC, long before the days of Greece.' Can this be true? What people found around Atlantis were shards of pottery and also rock-cut tombs, religious structures and etc. People today still wonder of how the the lost city sank down the ocean.                  It's important to learn the history of the past because we could how they lived and survived. 	DT NNS . . .

Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood.   In about a.d. 750 they began building houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud.   The people of mesa verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.   Walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more .

Archaeologists have recently found out things about the past that most people wouldn't be able to find out about now. The Inca of Peru had no record of a formal alphabet system or a type of writing. The didn't have books for the Historians to study. For calendars they made knots in ropes to keep record of the livestock that they had. Archaeologists have discovered many interesting things about this civilization. Let's get more in depth.       How did these archaeologists find out about these civilizations if they couldn't go back in the past? Well the answer to that question is; They find clues in the area that they focus on then they test them out to see what they were used for, how they were used, who they were used by and what time period they came from. Pretty cool huh?       How do we figure out what all that ancient writing reads? It actually takes quite a while before you can actually read them. Someone first has to translate the alphabet, and then they must use the alphabet that they translated to translate the whole entire text. That might take quite a few years before we could be able to read the whole thing.       We can also learn about the past if there was a diary left behind by a King or Queen. After translating the text we can see what kind of leadership their civilization held, we can see what kind of conditions they lived in and we can also see what kind of life they lead according to those diaries.       If a city was sunken, archaeologists  would most likely go into the ocean to find out everything they can about that city and what it was like before it sunk and learn about the reasons it did sink in the first place. Although it maybe hard for archaeologists to obtain information about these ancient cities, in the end it was definitely worth it when you get to see how they lived before there was any technology 	NNP NNP NNP MD PRP VB IN DT JJ IN PRP JJ MD RB VB RB TO VB DT JJ NN IN PRP .

The Inca lived in Peru, South America. Although alot of their artifacts have been raided by looters, what we have found is amazing. The Inca's mosaics are some of the best in the world, their farming tactics, cuting stair-case cliffs in the side of mountains to grow food, and their travel routes, are all amazing.       The Puebloans lived in the four corners of the world before the Europeans arrived, taking shelter in the stone walls of the canyons. Their houses aren't very elaborate, but they worked for them, and they were protection from the outdoors. Their weapons were the first of their kind, the atlatl (spear thrower) was used for hunting before they acquired the bow and arrow. Which is more efficient than the atlatl.       Have we finally found Atlantis? Maybe not, but there is a very good chance we did. Off the coast of the Greek Peloponnese is a sunken city, might be Atlantis might not. My theory of how it came to be under water is a freak natural disaster happened, like a flood or a tsunami, and it has been sunken since then. No one knows the name of the city, but alot of ceramics were found, scattering the bottom of the ocean floor, maybe they traded with other cultures? But either way, this is a great find.

Let me explain why. Everything we do/have is based from the discoveries of antient civilizations. Modern day would be immensly different if we hadn't discovered antient civilizations, we wouldn't have tools, weapons, even our cell phones! Some example civilizations are, The Inca, The Mesa Verde, and The Lost Greek City of Atlantis.   Well first of all the Inca, have been extremly hard to study, because they had no form of writing. What they did was, they knotted string and colored on it. I have to say would be more than dificult to study. Even with todays technology we still have no idea what these knotts mean. This civilization lasted nearly one hundred years (1438-1532). In 1532 the European showed up and killed the reining king of the Inca and conquered the area.   As for the Mesa Verde, they are extremly imprtant to our developed housing. Their civilizations lasted for seven hundred years! Around the years A.D. 1200s they packed up and moved away, they were gone like the wind. They were known for their beautiful basket making and crafting. One kind of housing are the pithouses. The living room sunk in a few feet, had four corneres, had a firepit in the middle, and were held up with four pieces of timber. they were pretty simple, not much to it. Another type of Mesa Verde arcitecture was the 'Kiva' which was basically like a church, where they could connect with the Gods or even join the afterlife.   The lost Greek city of Atlantis, has been discovered! I guess they can't make anymore goof-off movies that are factually wrong. This settlement is all the way back to the time of Homer's heros. the submerged city covers over 30,000 square meters of ocean floor, on the Southern part of the Peloponnese. The Greek city is believed to have sunk around 1000 B.C. Some things they found dated all the way back to the Stone Age. Which has made us think that this civilization existed over 5,000 years ago.   Have I convinced you? The importance of these civilizatons is greatly appriciated, because I have always enjoyed learning about past life. Just knowing that the past life has affected my life makes me feel like that one day my life will be important to a teenage girl writing an essay on why past civilizations are imprtant.

They all have their own spot to live far away from each other. None of the groups lived in the same time period. In fact, they lived in a far time frame from one another.       The Inca did not have a formal language or a formal way of writing to communicate with each other. They ruled the South American empire in the years of 1438-1532 which is almost 100 years! The Spaniards came to the Inca to take over and rule the South American empire. A lot of the Inca's artifacts were made from stone, gold, pottery, and silver. Many of the Inca sites were invaded by treasure hunters or looters. the Spaniards made it easy for researchers to study the fall of the Inca because they murdered the last Inca king in 1532. When archaeologists went to study the Inca, they found many frozen bodies on the Andes Mountains.       About 1400 years ago the Amcestral Purbloans lived in the Four Corners region in Mesa Verde. They built their communities in the alcolves of the canyon walls. They eventually left there and moved on. They settled in Mesa Verde in 550 A.D. They used pithouses for shelter, came up with the bow and arrow instead of using an atlatl. They were very good at arts and were named the cliff dwellers. Soon, they left and moved up to New Mexico and Arizona. Now, the Pueblo people today are all descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans.       The Pavlopetri people lived in Atlantis some 5000 years ago and is now known as the lost city. Some people now say that this is that oldest sunken cities in the world. The Pavlopetri made this city great with technology and buildings and was very rich. Archaeologists found a megaron, a monumental building with a big rectangular hall. That made them think that this place was used by an elite which automatically made it more interesting to study about it. Marine geologists thought that maybe an earthquake or a tsunami destroyed it and made it sink. This is the first time a sunken city has been found.       These three groups are very interesting to study about. they are all very different in their own ways. They are all in their own parts of the world, they didnt live in the same time period either. one group lived in the mountains, one lived on ground and now has sunken.

There are many difficulties these people must go through while trying to get information. Everything from worn down artifacts to being able to translate these ancient stories to get the information out of them.

The archaeologists know some of the old stories because they were written down by the europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532,also the visitors were priests and spanish soldiers.The priests and spanish soldiers described the Inca in diaries and letters.The historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts because the spaniards didn't speak the Inca language well.Perhaps they may not understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate.Maybe some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history.Inca textiles and clothing also survived remarkably well.Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed be dampness.Treasure hunters and looters diturb Inca sites.The treasure hunters or looters may have taken anything that might be valuable.Now like today looting still goes on,but some treasures were taken centuries ago.              The Ancestral Puebloans were the first to settle in Masa Verde in about A.D 550, because of their skill at the craft they are know as Basketmakers. They were beginning to lead a more settled way of life.They sheltered in pithouses built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They found a way to make pottery and acquired a bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. From about A.D 550 to A.D 750 people lived in pithouses.             Atlantis was explored by Anglo-Greek team of archeaologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri. The area of Atlantis straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese,is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.It was discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago.It was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology,were able to properly survey the ruins. Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank.Atlantis is the first sunken city that has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.`                                 	DT NN IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN IN PRP VBD NNS IN JJ NNP NN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , NN , CC DT NN IN JJ IN DT NNS VBN MD VB NNS VBN IN NN , NN , NN , CC JJ IN DT NNS WDT DT NNP POS NN IN JJ DT JJ NN IN NN , VBP DT JJ NNS VBD VBN VBN IN NNS IN DT JJ TO VB IN DT JJ IN DT NNS VBP RP IN DT NNS IN NNP NNP NNS VBP DT IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP VBD VBN RP IN DT NNS WP VBN IN DT NN IN CD , RB DT NNS VBD NNS CC JJ JJ NNS CC JJ NNS VBN DT NNP IN NNS CC NNP NNS VBP TO VB JJ WRB PRP VBP DT NNS IN DT NNS VBD RB VB DT NNP NN VBZ PRP MD RB VB WP DT NNP VBD PRP , RB PRP$ NNS MD RB VB JJ DT IN DT NNP VBZ VBD NNS RB IN NNP NNS CC VBG RB VBD RB JJ NNS IN NN VBP RB VBN VB JJ NNS CC NNS VBP NNP NNP NN NNS CC NNS MD VB VBN NN IN MD VB JJ IN NN VBG RB VBZ IN , CC DT NNS VBD VBN NNS NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD DT JJ TO VB IN NNP NNP IN IN JJ CD , IN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN PRP VBP RB IN NNP NNP VBD VBG TO VB DT RBR VBN NN IN JJ VBN IN NNS VBN IN NN NNS CC RB IN NN NNP NNP VBD DT NN TO VB NN CC VBD DT NN CC NN , DT RBR JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN , DT NN NNP NNP IN JJ CD TO JJ CD NNS VBN IN NNP NNP VBD VBN IN JJ NN IN NNS CC NN NNS CC VBN IN NNP NNP NN IN NNP NNS CD JJ NNS IN JJ NN IN DT NN NNP , VBZ VBN TO VB VBN VBN IN DT NN IN CD JJ VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN DT CD NNS JJ VBD RB DT NN IN NN NNS , VBD IN JJ NN , VBD JJ TO RB NN DT NNP NNP VBZ VBP RB TO VB RP WRB DT NN VBZ VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ VBN VBN IN NNP IN NNS DT NN IN NNP VBD PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN NN IN NNP	1		20131024131048	2356	1		20131024141057	2370	2		20131025161018	2381	1

We are fascinated by civilization from the past because we want to know how they lived their daily lives &amp; what they did.That's why it is important to know about the Inca, Peubloans and the Pavloptetre.       The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. But there are clues left behind by the Inca forming an amazing portrait of their religion, art and way of life.       The Peubloans; about 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde as their home. The Peubloans lived in Pithouses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting.       Now I'm pretty sure we have all heard of Atlantis! Like have read a books on Greek Mythology, watched the movie, or have learned it in Social Studies. Well the Pavlopetre is what the people were called that lived in Atlantis. We all know its under water and most cities aren't under water. Atlantis has remains of datings from 2800 to 1200 BC; thats why its such a important finding. The most important artifact was the pottery cause the Pavlopetre would write stories on them. One of those pots could have the story of what cause Atlantis to sink.

We are about to find out.                    There important because it shows life on earth and and what  people did before they had everything that we have today, like stores, cars, homes, and technology. The people that live in the A.D era had it really tough, and had to discovery the world themselves and had to find food by hunting and killing animals. That's all we really know about our past here on earth. But archaeologist know so much more.                     Archaeologist find so many amazing things about the life time before us. they found out how they lived how they ate how they and how they left there civilization or how they were captured. They find clues on their life style and then  puts all the piece together and understand why or how they used it and how it helped them. they also discover what they made walls or homes out of or how they made statues or who were the leaders or who was important during that time.                     Who would we ever know if there was a city in the ocean? That's crazy! Who would go in the ocean and look for a city that is said to be a myth and turns out it could've been a real city at one time. Archaeologist do a great job at discovering the past life. They know so much about history, well it makes sense because they help write out history books that we use everyday to understand the past time.                     Overall the job of an Archaeologist is fun, hard but it pays off in the end to have everyone be educated on the history of out world. Even though I hate history myself if it wasn't for them I wouldn't knew how we came to be where we are today.                                             	WRB WRB DT NNS JJ .

It was originally discovered by the British but Greek archeologist were the first to dive into the city.They had found road's, shards of pottery, courtyards, and religious strutchers such as a hall with giant statues pf what they believed to be their gods.

Things like Atlantis, answering our qustions of mystery aand posiblity, as well as the Incas, satisfying our need to know about the past, and finaly the people of Mesa Verde, alowing us to learn about the people who inhabited this land before us.        The underwater city of Atlantis, real or fake? This age old myth has been uncovered thanks to archaeologists. Archaeologist have discovered a city that might support this tale and give it some backing of truth. This find allows us to know more about these myths and qustion our own beliefs.        What Archaeologists have learned about the Inca allows us to know about the lives of ancient people. Hand crafted pottery and large amonts of gold might lead us to know about the social ranking. Frozen bodies tell us more about their everyday life, how they died out, and even the rituals they followed, such as sacrifices.        Mesa Verde and the people that lived there are important to everyone especially the people living in North America. The excavation of these people's ancient lives allows us to find out more about the people who lived on the soil we live on centuries ago.

The inca textiles on the walls and all of their inscriptions could help us learn their way of speech.                            3. The inca would have things made from stone,pottery,gold, or silver we might learn how they make them or find more gold.       Article#2 Q#1. They could learn of how they live and their lifestyles and might find some rare stone or material.                            2. Thats how archeoligists found out about pithouses the Puebloans lived in they had a roof and they sunk a few feet in the ground and had a whole at the top that they would use as a door to get out of it.                            3. They would look at their houses like pithouses and find out that they would update the pithouses to kivas which were churches that were used for their practice of worship. They would also use these to gather around and weave or have dinner or could make pottery.       Article#3 Q#1. Reveals how intelligent people built things and how they lived. Also so we dont repeat their mistakes.                            2. It was the oldest submerged town in the world and they have been looking for that city for a really long time and it was also one of the worlds largest myths.                            3.

Mainly because there is weathering, erosion, tampering, stealing  or breaking. But some reasons we just look for cultures or city is because of our infinite curiosity and fascination for new thing.                   Like the under water city of Greece it has inspired some of the most famous tales like Atlantis.  But there is not much to explain for there is little of the artifacts left probably all the books and records are soaked and destroyed. Then again it is the oldest submerged city in the world so even so there would be little information on how the people lived.               Next city/culture we are going to talk about is the great empire of the Incas!  They did leave a very interesting history knots in ropes to count but sadly we don't under stand them very well.  Even more sad news the Spaniards attacked them and destroyed a lot of artifacts.  but there are burials in the mountain and those are good news because we can uncover the body and learn how they lived.

The Inca were important to 'The Lost Land,' becasue they started the culture by the idea of having different colored string to till the date but the incas did not have any form of writing. They also did not leave any archives for historians. They left many clues behind though by their amazing portrait of their religion like art, architecture, ariculture, goverment and transportation of the way of life. They also inca for what we know comes from the oral history or stroies passed from time to time family to family. passsing these stroies on you had to importantly passes them on. The Inca also textiles and clothing that survied  remakanly well, ancient materials like cloth are destroying because of the wetness in the sea.                  The puebloans lived in the ciff dwellings left somewhat of how there cultures was. Also There pottery and arts left somewhat of what we need to know it has some bits and piece we can fit together to find out more about how they lived.            All this was very important to 'The Lost City,' becasue if we didnt have any of this edivce then we possible would know nothing and could not explore it,and know how there goverment was or their culture or how they lived what it was like to live there if it was a very hard life or easy. If they didnt have lots of soil what they ate.. How it came together as a city in gernal.

They found bodies that belonged to the Inca civilization that gave the archaeologists a good understanding of what the Incas used and what they thought was good for a good afterlife. They lived high in the mountains so it is very hard to find the artifacts that they were using. The archaeologists also found out what they did as a city and what they built.       The Puebloans are a very interesting civilization as well. They lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. That is important because we found out they were skilled at building houses. Local cowboys reported first reported the cliff dwellings in 1880. Ever since then archaeologists have been searching to find out why they are there. The structures let us know that over centuries, skills and traditions were passed down from the Puebloans. The accomplishments of these people are one of the best expressions of human culture in our continent.       The Pavlopetri were a really interesting civilization because their civilization was found underwater. 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr. John Henderson. And he is right. All the things we found about this civilization has been underwater. We are fascinated with this civilization because it shows the advancement in technology that we have made since then. This lost city is very important because it is the oldest submerged town ever. It has many artifacts that show us their way of life. We find the things they used like clothes, weapons, documents, and even government structures.       All of these civilizations are very important and always will be. Some are way up high in the mountains and some are way down low in the water, but either way they are important. All the artifacts show us there way of life and what they used to live like that.

It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC long before the glory days of Greece. The site is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. The sea consumed the city around 1000 BC. They found a world full of buildings, courtyards , main streets, rock cut tombs, and religious structures. According to the excerpt the ancient Incas had no form of alphabet. This helped us to know what kind of reading and writing the ancient civilizations had. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The Europeans were amazed that the Inca could run such a large empire using strings to keep record. Today we have found many quipus but we do not know what they mean .

How the Incas were important       In the Inca's civilization  played a big role in preserving important things for us to study over there weather was also so cold that people would die up in the mountains and the cold weather would preserve their bodies for the archeologists to be able and use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about the ways that those people died.The Inca's land structure also made it difficult for archaeologists to artifacts from there civilizations because they had to climb over mountains with all of their stuff with them.                   How the Puebloans were important       The puebloans were people who could make things out of stone and bricks wich made it easier for them then some people to be able to build structures and houses. They also lived in pithouses and they lived in them from A.D 550 to A.D.750. Some of the Puebloans were basketmakers and their population multiplied. In A.D.750 their civilization began building houses above ground.                   How the  Pavlopetri were important            The Pavlpetri were important because the were apart of the Lost city of Atlantis and they left behind many things like buildings,courtyards,main-streets, rock-cut tombs and many religous structures that we can research and use today with everything they also explained that the mythof Atlantis is true and that it is was a planed town that semergued.

They can reveal clues to the past like pottery, tools, and clothing. They can also show how the life style was of that time period.      First of all, discoveries like these can leave clues to the past! Many artifacts have been found from discoveries like these, including pottery, tools, weapons, and clothing. They can tell you how life was during that time.      Also, they can tell you how the life style was. They did not have luxuries like grocerie stores to get food from, so they most likely had to hunt for their food. Also, they can show how the people were, warriors or peaceful.      In conclusion, these discoveries ARE important! They can reveal clues to the past and how the life style was. It was VERY different from today.

The Inca comes from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation.     The Mesa Verde was about a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their homes. For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here. In the late A.D. 1200's, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away. The Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture.    The First Ancestral Pueblo ans was about when they settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. they are known as Basket makers for their skill at the craft. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pit-houses clusters into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.

That what happened in the past should stay in the past. Yet what they don't understand is that by knowing the past, they can understand the future. The Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are some of the least understood ancient civilizations, and yet, some of the most mysterious.       The Incas were a great empire in the South Americas, and were very efficient, until they were confronted by the Spaniards. The Spaniards caused the complete and total collapse of the empire, and many of the things that the Incas had, many of their knowledge, was lost along with the collapse. And yet, archeologists spend millions of dollars trying to find even a small fragment of their artifacts to know more about the Incas. Why would someone do that? Because by doing so, we are able to understand more about what caused the empire to fall, what could have happened, and what did happen.       Another smart civilization was the Puebloans. They were able to use their surroundings to benefit themselves. If the archeologists knew more about how they did this, they could teach the rest of the world, so that we wouldn't be so reliant on technology, and we wouldn't mess up Earth as much as we are now. The Puebloans created homes using the sides of cliffs in the small valley gorge they lived in. Being very artistic people, they soon took on pottery, and made beautiful pieces. Though their stories and lessons that were on them are now a melancholic dark shade of black.       And the last civilization I will mention is the Pavlopetri. This is one of the most important civilizations, because their cities and towns have been found to exist on land that is now completely submerged. Archeologists and scientists want to understand what happened to this civilization, why their cities sank, thus ruining the existence of them. There are many theories, blaming tectonic movement, but it does appear to be a booster towards the myth of Atlantis.       Based on the findings from these civilizations, and millions more, scientists can piece together the evolution of the human race, maybe not just where it came from, but also where it is going. The scientists can also find how what we have now came along, the evolution of human technology.

Without knowledge of ancestors we would not have made the technology advances that we have. Discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri have given us the chance today to flourish.             The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing like we have today. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar and to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Although, the life of the Inca is quite unknown to us and is a mystery, clues left behind give us insight into their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Oral history of the Inca has been an important way to preserve the society's history, along with old stories written down by the Europeans. The knowledge the Inca civilization has given us has made us advanced in our technology and in our school smarts, but we do not owe it all to them.             The Puebloans are another ancient society we owe our advances and discoveries to. Their structures in cliffs speak with a certain eloquence. They tell of a people great at building, artistic in their crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land. The ancient Puebloans have given us insight into how knowledgeable you need to be of the land you live in so that you may make the most of it. Eventhough, they left their land to to probable resource depletion and infertile soil, they used their sense to move. These people have given us geographical smarts we desperately needed.             The discovery of the Pavlopetri have made us realize that, yes we have explored our vast oceans and seas, but less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. Yes the world has come a great distance from men in caves to men walking on the moon, but none of that matters we still have not seen a fraction of what this planet has to offer. The underwater 'Atlantis' has let us know we r just a tiny spec on this spectacular world of ours.             The ancient civilizations of this world have given us so much knowledge, and they are what shaped our society. Honestly, they deserve the credit of making this planet what it is today. Maybe, in the future we will give them the credit they truly deserve.

I have looked pictures to see if there where any buildings i saw one. I have read a lot of papers on it but i think there was a Atlantis its is under water. many people want to bring Atlantis back up but that would ruin the place where sea animals live. I would not want some one to take my home from me like the sea animals don't want that to happen to them. the site of the under sea city is the cost of Neapolitan, Greece witch is a good place to sea animals. divers have found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, witch suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought. there investigation also relieved over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. but what really took them by surprise was the discovery of a possible megaron, a monument structure with a large rectangular hall. more than any other under water site so far, the finds offer potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society.

The Inca influenced many people by their amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture. They lived high in the Andes. The Inca were buried in caves on mountain tops. The bodies that were found reveal information on how they lived, most of them were in good condition. Modern medical scanning equipment can be used to learn how the people died. The Inca plays an important role in history.        The Puebloans were a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. They are known for being basketmakers. They were extremely skilled craftspeople who learned how to make pottery and also acquired the bow and arrow. The Puebloans lived in the cliff dwelings for less than one hundred years. The Puebloans are an important group.        The Pavlopetri lived in older sunken in sites in the world. In 1000 BC, the Peloponnese is belived to have been consumed by the sea. The sunken settlement dates back some five thousandd years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth. The Pavlopetri were an important team.

These civilizations are important because they all contributed to the worlds civilization now.The Incas are not  important because they had a fancy writing system ,they are important because they kept a calendar using colored strings called quipus ,and they used that to keep count of livestock keep records.      The civilization of the Puebloans helped our civilization because the were the ones known as the basketmakers, and known for the skill at art and craft.They made pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for a better wepon than the atlatl.They ,also went to a construction of building a stonewall for there huts,houses.             The civilization of the Pavlopetri was discovered by an anglo-greek team, the sunken civilization dates back to some of 5,000 years to the time it was found.the area straddles 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor.It revealed buildings, courtyards, main streets, and religious structures.They found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.

They are a part of history. Archology has made alot of discoveries. It tells us about our ancestors and what they lived like. It is a great thing. It helps us with modern inventions. The Inca's were a very smart group of people they used the sun to dry things they used tools to carve and built there houses. They used there brains to figure out and solve a problem using what they had. Personally I think these are people to admir and they have doen so much for us today!

We don't only need archaeologists, we need special types such as high-altitude and marine archaeologists. Marine archaeologists are able to discover artifacts that are underwater such as towns that have sunk or other things that have gone to the bottom of the ocean. High-altitude archaeologists are able to get to artifacts that are high above the ground such as in cliffs and caves in mountains. Without those two specific types of archaeologists we wouldn't have half of the artifacts we have today. We also wouldn't know so much about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.       When archaeologists find artifacts they can find out alphabets of different cultures and the different languages they speak. They can also find ways that they lived and how they survived by things they hunted and stories left behind. They find stories that families used to tell by finding paintings inside of caves and on the side of cliffs. Without these artifacts, we wouldn't have them in museums and students in school wouldn't be able to learn about different cultures and ways of life in school. It's important that we learn how people used to live because it's such a big difference on how we live today.       Archaeologists put themselves in a lot of danger when they are collecting artifacts because some of the situations can be very hazardous. When they are climbing up the side of a mountain, that isn't exactly a walk on the beach. When they are underwater they have to encounter dangerous underwater caverns and they also have to stay underwater for a long time. To be an archaeologist you have to go through a lot of training so you are prepared for those hard situations.       Some artifacts have surprisingly survived well. Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by wetness getting to them. Some have survived by being preserved in the dry deserts of Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Stone pottery, gold, and silver survive a lot better than the other artifacts even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. A lot of these artifacts will be buried in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife. There are a lot of artifacts out there for archaeologists to find and discover. They will probably never find all of them because some areas are impossible to get to and search.       Without archaeologists we wouldn't have the knowledge we have today about past life and how they lived. Archaeologists are a very important part of our society. They provide us with information for school textbooks, displays in museums, and all other things that help us learn about other cultures. We can get a little look at the past when we study artifacts and we can compare it to today's life.

We learned that the Inca of peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing according to 'Past' by Beth Gruber. We have learned about what the first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde lived in. We even found an ancient Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myths according to an article from 'The guardian'.         We have not been able to find much about the Incas.   We do know that they used strings to keep records. Most of what we know has been passed down via oral history. We know some stories from the Europeans that came to the empire.             We have learned about a civilization that has lived on North America long before the Europeans have arrived. This civilization was called the Mesa Verde Ancestral Puebloans. They first lived in houses called Pithouses. It featured a living room that sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbers supported the roof. The fire pit had an air deflector. An antechamber may of contained storage bins. Pithouses evolved into Kivas much later.         We have found a lost Greek city under water near the city of Neapolis. What they have found has surpassed all expectations. Thanks to shifting sand, the city has been exposed. It is the oldest submerged city in the world! It is unique because although there are older sunken cities, this is a very planned out city. Archaeologists believe it was sunk around 1000 B.C. The city is composed of a World of buildings, courthouses, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures.             We may of not found everything, but we have found alot. Discoveries like these a phenomal, and give us more information about what life was like a long time ago.

The way they lived and survived is very odd and unique. They didn't know how to write so we have to get research the information in a different way. Archaeologist study the clues such as an amazing portrait of there religion, art, architecture, government, transportation, and the way of life.       The materials such as pottery, gold, or silver are artifacts found. The clothing found was a great help because it showed us what materials they used to make them last longer and what they would wear in the different seasons. Religion was practiced and valued today as well as in those days. Some valuable materials have been stolen so now we keep a good record on the objects found. With more research we have discovered that farming was practiced and the population in these places was overwelmed.         We shouldnt just base the studies in legends told by people we should actually discover them. With many more studies we have learned or we have gotten a better understanding of  these peoples lives and there methods for surviving. Yet archeologist still study the evidence so we can have information and so our knowledge on this can grow. With some analysis, scientific research, and experiments this will be possible.

This helps them to make books and headines about the inca civilization.            Theres another group called the ancestral puebloans. They settled in Mesa Verde. They lived in a pithouses. The puebloans learned how to make potery and  make a bow and arrow. The bow and arrow was more efficient than the atlatl. The pithouse had four corners lioke a modern house. The spanish had a name for the puebloans it was 'village dwellers.'           The lost greek city is now under the sea. Acheaologist liked the lost city because it inspired them to keep searching for the mythical place called atlantis.

The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus, but today no one knows what the knots mean. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Archaeologists and others can piece together details of Inca life.        Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions might not be accurate, and some of the Inca stories were legends rather than history. As in many ancient civilizations, Inca artifcacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gols, or silver. Such materials lst a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found buried in raves for the dead to use in the afterlife. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well.         Ancient materials like cloth are usually destroyed by dampness, but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.Some Inc sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, who take anything that might be valuable. Some treasures were taken centuries ago, but looting still goes on today. Looted sites often don't tell archaeologists very much. Other sites are reported to archaeologists, who can dig them up carefully. Archaeologists can compare what they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spaniards' accounts of the Inca.        The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff faces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them, but it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult. High-altitude archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died, and they also reveal information about how they lived.

It may also be useful to you again in the future. You may also find your website helpful when you have to write a paper for school or college. Our class website is helpful for all ages.           History isnt a bad subject to study. He helps fills you in on the things you missed while you werent on earth. History is important because it's bound to repeat its self. So for people who thinks history is useless, theres some information for you to share with them. Thats why me and my class are creating this website.           We want to create this webisite to help people so they dont have to struggle. We can give them information that we learn and know to help them. And soom hopefully they wont need to use our website because they will learn the subject and know just as well as we do. Our website can also help teachers. It can help them teach their class the subject and also give them fun activities to do while they actually learn.         	NNP PRP RB VBN DT JJ .

Archaeologists have found many artifacts, but sometimes don't know what they mean.                       One of the reasons why it's so important is because archaeologists want to know how the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri have lived back in history. Some of the things that archaeologists know about the Inca comes from stories told by many generations. Even though they had passes on stories from generation, historian had to be careful. Because the Spaniards didn't speak the Inca language well, they might have misunderstood them. Also many of the stories were legends and not history of the Inca. The Inca did leave objects behind so that meant what was going on in their civilization. The Inca artifact are no different from other ancient civilization because they might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Archaeologists make sure to write down any possible information that they can possibly get out of the Inca artifacts. Just like in Greece where a sunken city has been found. The exploration has found world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures, plus there was thousands of shards of pottery. As Dr Henderson, professor at the University of Notthingham, 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world.' For less than 100 hundred years, the Ancestral Puebloans lived int he cliff dwellings. Soon it was deserted because of the drought, but they have survived other droughts before. Of all the years of intensive use of the land resources, perhaps the it was just depleted, or they might have just wanted to live somewhere else.                         Another reason why it's important is to know how the ancestors came. The very first Ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. Even though Archaeologists couldn't really trace back when the origin of the Inca, they still knew the fall was in 1532. The fall of Inca was the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king which was in 1532. Since the area where the Inca had lived had been inhabited by different people, the Archaeologists didn't know the origin. They had to be careful because they didn't know which people built which site, but to find the Inca's predecessors they used some of the most advanced techniques in the world. The archaeologists used aerial photography to help them find patterns that they can't see from the ground.                         These were some of the most important reasons why these discoveries were made.

First off its teaches the way civilization settled , and how we have evolved . It also teaches us there daily ways of life , religion , and customs. Like we have found out that people of Inca form Peru did no have any formal alphabet or system of writing , that get the minds curious. Its it shows us how hard it was in the past. They didn't have i phones or the internet , not even electricity at all, and we think life is tough well think again ! Ancient discoveries are important to man kind as we know it ,there are still many things we have not yet discovered . Clues are even left behind like art architecture, agriculture,government,transportation and there way of life. If no one hadn't made any ancient discoveries out history book would be empty , no clues no anything . Without Ancient discoveries we would not know anything of our ancestor's to know.       It is important to know about all the ancient discoveries in the world so every country, can know about there ancestry and how it came to be. without any thing to discover life would be plain and boring. Its fun to know how there homes looked , what they ate , how they dressed etc. The thing is it may seem boring , but one day you'll be curious and i can assure you this that your going to know one day , one day.       There are still things we have not yet discovered like we've only explored 5% of the ocean imagine that !! and we barely know any of the animal species , and the scientist think they know everything , we haven't even found the cure for cancer , we have discovered a lot we need to discover lots of things .We still need a lot and i mean a lot to discover still.One day in the foreseeable future we are going to discover everything its just takes the people, time , and patience  With out history there is no future , and without no future there is no us .

They Inca's method was using quipus, which was the use of knots in colored strings. This technique fascinated the many Europeans which were the first in encountering such style of government.             Numerous clues have shown archaeologists valuable information about what type of transportation they used, their government system, religion and culture, art, but most importantly their way of life. Another way the world is informed about the history of the Inca is they way people pass on stories from generation to generation.             Because research has shown us that the Europeans arrived at the Inca empire in 1532, it is believed that they were the ones whom described the Inca in written diaries. Although they may have described them, their information could have not been accurate due to the fact that they had trouble comprehending the Inca language.             Another source of intelligence we have is the ancient artifacts, object, or tools left behind; the location in which they are found is also very crucial. The artifacts are mainly found in disintegrated buildings as well as graves.             Archaeologists who keep records on studied sites always note and photograph the artifact in the exact position they discovered it. They can confirm any doubts they may have by comparing information learned from an artifact and information given from Spaniards' accounts of the Inca.             The most important information leaned from the Inca was the fact that their last king was murdered by the Spaniards in 1532 which lead to the fall of the Inca. Because the place where the Inca used to live was inhabited by other people, it is more difficult for archaeologists to confirm which buildings were constructed by who. However, with the advanced technology we have today it'll be much easier.             In my opinion, the Inca civilization is very unique. I personally have concluded that it was thanks to the Inca that we were inspired to create and run our own society and technology.

Will it change our society? Discoveries were and are really important sometimes. Many explorers had found many interesting Discoveries such as ' The ancient Inca of Peru,' 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World,' The Cliff Dwellers,' etc. Explorers called Pavlopetri.       Explorers unlock secrets of the past, like the ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep records. Archaeologists had founf many ancient guipus, but  no one knows what the knots mean.Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful knots on the string.Clues left behind by the the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life.       Long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. Mesa verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archaeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as ' the ancient ones' or ' ancient enemies.' In these days people call them Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descendants. They and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls.       Since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, archaeologists had sought to understand the people's lives. Despite decades of excavation, analysis, classification, and comparison, scientific knowledge remains sketchy. They left no written records and much that was important in their lives has perished. Ancestral Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread.                 	JJ NNP NNP NNPS VBP RB JJ , CC WRB .

Those knots were called Quipus, they were made out of colored string. The first people that met the Ancient Inca were some Europeans, they were surprised how the controlled such a huge empire using the quipus to keep records.From the quipus left behind by the Inca that archeologist have found they have been trying to figure out what they mean. Other items left behind by the Inca like: portraits of religion, art, cloth (but the cloth doesn't really last hundreds of years), architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their (customs) ways of life have helped us figure out about the Inca life. The Inca have also left behind artifacts made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. The artifacts left behind are usually long lasting materials.The things we know about the Inca we have found out by their remainings or part of the stories (oral history) that we know have passed down from generation to generation.Part of the Oral History was from the Europeans when the visited the Inca empire in 1532. The peoples remains were hard to  find, because where they lived it had been inhabited by many different people. Archaeologists had to very careful and precise the know who which people builted which sites.               Archeologist who study about the past are very, very careful about what they find, and write down exactly what the find. The archaeologist need to learn as much information as they can.The most important things to learn about civilizations are where it came from and what happen to it. Archaeologists use some of the most advanced equipment in the world to learn more about the Inca's history.       The fall of the Inca was an easy date to remember in 1532 the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king, and they took over the empire. Some Inca's lived  in the Andres Mountains, and they may even worshiped some of the mountain peaks. Others lived in buried caves in cliff faces, because the Inca lived so high up, that made the archaeologists job more difficult. The Archaeologist were high-altitude expert mountaineers; they had to carry their equipment up and if they found artifacts they had to bring it back down the mountains. Up in the mountains it was could as a freezer. Archaeologist found frozen bodies and used them for Modern Medical Scanning equipment to learn about how the people died and how was their life experience.                                                     Mesa Verde National Park               Long before the Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the four Corners region chose Mesa Verde as their home. Mesa Verde has been their home over than 700 years; the ancestral Puebloans descendants expanded their family's growth their. Then in the late A.D. 1200s, in span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away.              Mesa Verde National Park has a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archaeologists have called the people from their Anasazi, (from a Navajo word translated as 'the ancient people' or ' ancient enemies') but now their known as the Ancestral Puebloans looking back at their modern descendants.              The first Ancestral Puebloan to settle in about A.D. 550. The Ancestral Puebloans were known as ' The Basketmakers' for their skills in crafts.They learned how to make pottery and acquire the bow and arrow. The started to lead a more calm way. Farming replaced hunting, they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages(usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.) People lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to 750., as settled agriculture began.The pithouses had a livingroom sunk a few feet down under ground. About A.D. 750 they began building house above ground with strait walls made out of poles and mud. They built houses one against another in long, curving rows. Starting from their they became known as the Puebloans a Spanish word meaning 'Village Dwellers.' By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Walls were thick, double course stone often rose two or three stories (floors) high and were put close together into units of 50 rooms or more! Their pottery also changed it went from simple desigh on a dull gray background to black drawings on white background.             Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300 during the Classic Period the population has reached several thousands. The stone walls of the large pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in mesa Verde. With their straight courses of carefully shaped stone.

Ideas from long ago can benefit our society today. Past civilizations can help us prepare for whatever may come our way. It also gives us clues and key facts as to what they majored in education because some people in the United States can argue that schools are not benefiting children's needs to learn.       Ancient civilizations probably had a hard time adjusting to the climate and location,   land wise. Even when you think about people now, it is always hard to communicate or relate to people around you when your new or out of town and you've just moved in. Adapt was and is very hard to do. Inca's always had a trouble fitting in. They would get robbed and treated differently. Its no wonder there civilization collapsed.       Past civilizations can also help us prepare for the future or at least be somewhat   prepared. Ancestral Puebloans were always prepared. They had different techniques of building shelter and artilery. They also had skill which played a key role in advancing in technology. They also used rock like platforms to build a small kitchen. Over the years they had advanced until they submerged to another civilization.       The ancient civilization of Pavlopetri is a well thought out city   and has the most educational impact on us today. Pavlopetri is such a unique town because of how it was planned to be structured. Without technology, which also played a key role in discovering it, Pavlopetri could have never been found. By technology, we could see how these people had a sense of wanting to be unifed in which some people may argue that the United States isn't. The artifacts found also shows how skilled these people were and how this could benefit us today by studying the remain and more of what they studied.       Ancient civilizations, in general, can be a phenomenol benefit to society today.   Ideas such as climate and harsh weather conditions and preparation are helpful for our daily lives.

Throughout the years, new technology has been aiding us on our discoveries of lost and ancient civilizations. Our fascination with learning about ancient society's different from ours, how they were created, and how they were ended has lead us to the discovery of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.

The artifacts the Inca left behind, such as pottery, indicate that the Inca were hard working individuals and were skilled with their hands. They also used other materials such as gold and silver to make items. In our society today, we use things like plastic plates that are disposable and we over produce. There are very few people that create their own things today. The items we buy today are not very good quality and will not last as long as the ruins of the Inca have.                       The stone walls that the Puebloan left behind are remarkable. What makes the walls reamarkable are their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. With an increase of quality in their walls and aslo their pottery their basket making skills decreased. This is what is happening in our current civilization. Our demand for electronic items is greater that our demand for any other man made item. We are blinded by indulgence to see what we truly need for our civilization to survive.                                     Pavlopetri was a society that seemed to be flawless by all that we have found and discovered about them. Yet we have not found the reason why their civilizatin was destroyed. They were not very cautious on their surroundings , and neither is our society. We could be running the same risk as them.                                     Our discoveries of ancient civilization are not only fascinating but are also very educational. We get see what their errors were and that helps us be aware of our possible errors. With the information we aquire from the things they left behind we can strive for a better society. 	WRB VBP PRP$ NNS RB JJ .

Our culture has gathered many ideas from these civilizations such as the Maya, Inca, and Roman empires. We have used lots of ideas from these cultures like Calendars how to make stuff that they used and more things that they made. They didn't have a formal system of writing. The IInca didn't leave any clues for historians to study.       We found their way of life by researching and finding clues about their Religion, Art, Architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Some of the stories we get from these civilizations are passed on from generation to generation. The Inca civilization had diaries and wrote stories about their life. The Spaniards didn't understand the language of the Inca well so some descriptions aren't accurate.       The rest of the artifacts were what scientists found and were studying. The most important things to learn about a civilization uis where it came from and what happened to it. Scientiscts used most advanced tetechniques in the world to discover more about a civilization. The Puebloans had Pithouses where they lived from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. This house had an air deflector. A hole at the top for passage of the underworld. Pithouses later evolved into Kivas. And that is how they found life of these Ancient Civilizatios.

These three cities included the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.            The Inca left a amazing portrait of religion, art, architecture, agriculture, and many more important things we use today all the time. The Puebloans also left the sturcture of houses that were on the sides of cliffs tha we have discovered and that are very  sound in how the have built this answers.The Pavopetri is also important because it show even back then it had roads and side walks but it also sow that to have this type of things you have to have lot of money back then.            As you can see these three cities are very important to what we know today.We can learn how to build better stuctured builds and better communities than the ones we have today.

Based on the artifacts that they have found helped us learn almost everything about them.            The Ancitent Inca had not form of writng. They did not leave very much for historians to study. Historians were able to figure out what they call the quipus. this was made of knots in colored string to record the calendar to keep a count of their livestock. To this day no one knows what the knots mean unless someone who can read the stories tied to the quipus. they also left other clues for us to figure there life out. We learned about their religoun, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their was of life. some of there artcracraft could have come have been made from pottery, gold, and silver. Some of our history came from the Incas. Even some of their clothing was proserved and are able to been seen today. Inca sitings have been bothered by hunters and other people.             The puebloans lived very differnt then we do today. Before the Europeans explored North America, about 1400 years ago, there lived a group of people in the Four Corners region. They did not buy their houses, they had to make them with supplies that they found. They lived in pithouses, they would have a bunch of them in their small villages. The people that put together the house was called the basketmaker. They also learned to make pottery and came up with the bow and arow. Their most used weapon was called the atlatl, it threw their spears.            These artifacts that seem like they would mean nothing do not really mean nothig. These things have helped us come up with all the things we know about these ancient places today. The people that have seen the things that were left make sure that they take carefull records, they do this by taking pictures or writing it down.

The discovery of civilizations, such as the Incan civilization, are very important because it shows how even in ancient civilizations they still had technology that we use today. Some architecture we see today have possibly originated from the Incan civilization. The census we see today originated from the Incan civilization that they used to understand how much resources they required to give to the citizens. Another importance for the discovery of this civilization was that it help archaeologist understand the harsh conditions from thye cold weather Incan's had to face, and their advancements in clothes and other resources to help them survive from these conditions. Today we have advanced materials to survive in the cold snow, but Incans did not have these materials so they often times had to resort to animal fur so they can stay warm. Their buildings must have been fire retardent for them to light fires in them to stay warm in locations where fires are not suitible for other weather conditions. Past civilization are of great importance to the development of our civilizations today and how they are run.   Civilizations from the past are of great importance today for how our world is run today. In the civilization of Mesa Verde, the discovery of this civilization is of importance because it shows how puebloans created advanced buildings to suit their needs to survive in both cold and hot weather. Their buildings have been made to be fire retardent for puebloas to survive during freezing conditionsof winter where snow would become a great threat for survival. To survive during hot summer conditions, puebloans have created windows to ventilate the air to keep it cool for survival. Another importance for the discovery of the civilization of Mount Verde is that they changed their old materials of sticks and mud to adobe bricks to support these new advancements inside their buildings. Adobe was the new material needed for the buildings to be fire retardent which would help them use fires inside their buildings. Adobe was a strong material that would have to preservere during snowy and windy months when debris would cause much damage. Many civilizations from the past help to create the world we know today.   Past civilizations are the reason why our government and other things in the world run the way they do. The ancient city in Greece shows how advanced their civilization was because of the reason the city was still preserved, and why all the old artifacts were able to survive through thousands of years. The materials used for the building must have had to be durable and be water resistant to allow the city to stay in tact which shows how advanced the civilization was. Because artifacts were still preserved, we were able to date back to find that this civilization has been around for thousands of years, and they lived lives close to how we live today. Civilizations from the past caused many of these advancements we see today.

Their are three discoveries that will be explained of their impotance: the discovery of Ancient Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and an underwater city.               The Ancient Inca civilization was an important find because they were much like our civilization today and we can see how we've developed. The inca used string to record count of their livestock. Today, keeping record of things is very important. We can clearly see how we have developed from this. We also need to know how we aquired skills and how they were used many years ago.               Conspicuously we know that the Ancestral Puebloans passed down skills for many generations. How do we Know if they are good skills for life? of course by the discovery of their civilization. Archelogists have realized these skills mad a civilization posper, such as their architecture. Building rooms of hard walls helped them become big towns, which we use today.                The finding of the underwater city of Grease could answer a myth: the myth of Atlantis. This myth has been around for a long time and people have been questoning it. Their finding tells of a unique city, such as the city of Atlantis. This discovery may also warn us about hardships that we could face, such as being swallowed by water.                  Clearly these discoveries are most important for answering questions such as why are our buildings like they are today or why is this skill needed in our life.

Artifacts that have been found are vital to the natural curiosity of people and to those who want to compare them to the things we use today to see how things have evolved and changed since then.  The fact that we have the technology today to study these things is proof enough that we have a more advanced system of studying equipment than the people we are studying.           The study of ancient Incan civilization brings about many interesting topics about the way they lived.  It is pretty amazing that we know as much as we do about the Inca considering that they do not have a formal alphabet or writing system.  The fact that they were able to record the calender and keep count of their livestock on a device called a quipu shows the people were intelligent enough to keep records just by using knots on colored strings.  Although it may not seem apparent by just one look, Incan clothing can tell a lot about the civilization's culture and religion as well.  Spiritual headdresses and robes have been found in other places, telling archaeologists that they believed in the god.  Some clothing in the Incan society could uncover more information that could be difficult to find elsewhere.  Archaeologist use some of the most advanced techniques to discover more about Incan predecessors shows that they put their best foot forward in trying to find out new things about the civilization.              Studying the Puebloan society helps archaeologist compare the items of the past to the ones we have today.  Their pithouses are nothing like to houses of the modern age.  Not only do these pithouses teach us more about what type of architecture they had, they teach us about their spiritual beliefs.  There was a hole for passage to the underworld called a sipapu.  They believed in gods and that they would come up based on ancient myths.  The discoveries made about the ancient Puebloans assist us to build on our technology.  We can use their experiences and devices to create something bigger and better than we have today.  Because we have made such great discoveries about the ancient Puebloans, we can make our generation better and, at the same time, learn about what they used to do.                People have always heard about places like the lost city of Atlantis.  The sunken settlement of Pavlopetri may have inspired that myth.  People are very intrigued by the fact that it is the oldest submerged, planned city in the world.  Marine archaeologist used the digital technology of today to survey the ruins.  They found a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures, revealing so much about their culture and way of life.  In addition to all these things, marine archaeologists found many shards of pottery and ceramics.  It showed how people lived at the time and the shallow waters caused great interest in natural scientists.  The myth of Atlantis led to the discovery of Pavlopetri.  The continuation of underwater exploration has helped scientists discover more about sunken settlements and the kind of things people had there.  This discovery should motivate people to explore the ocean because there is a lot more to be found.                   Humans have a natural curiosity and hunger for knowledge, and it has caused them to make some great discoveries about the ancient Incans, the Puebloans, and the underwater city of Pavlopetri.

Intense excavating of ruins and research through documents adds to the collection of knowledge in the world and pages to its ancient histories. The artifacts, records, and culture left behind by the ancient peoples has led to world to the modern age in which it is today.       The ancient Inca empire was expansive; clues left behind by the Inca lead researchers to discover the richness and wealth of the once-glorious South American civilization. Although the Inca had no formal alphabet or writing system, they kept records using quipus: colored strings tied into knots to keep count of various items such as the days or livestock. Other artifacts from the Inca include ones made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver; these materials have lasted for hundreds of years and have been found to have survived through time, as well as Inca textiles and clothing that have been preserved in the ice of the Andes or beneath the dry deserts of the coasts of Peru.       For more than seven hundred years, a group of people lived in Mesa Verde and transformed it into their home, building a community and a cultural identity, only to leave and move away less than one hundred years after their prosperity had been flourishing. These people have been called the Anasazi, from a Navajo word translated as 'ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies,' but are now called the Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern descendants. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verede in A.D. 550, making homes in pithouses clustered into villages atop mesas and in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and wove baskets, earning them the nickname of 'The Basketmakers.' The buildings and architectural skill of the Ancestral Puebloans had been very high; their accomplishments ranked among the finest cultures in North America. Although they left no written records, the Ancestral Puebloans left  beautifully built structures and art that researchers have used in their search for answers to the questions left behind by the hands of time.       Off of the coast of the Greek city of Neapolis lies a city submerged where the Pavlopetri once dwelled. Having never been reoccupied, the Pavlopetri city represents a still moment of the past. The city is the largest sunken city to have been planned; other submerged cities have been found to be much larger but unplanned. With a large rectangular hall at its center the city suggests use by an elite group of Greeks, raising the status of the settlement, even though the settlement is approximately five thousand years old, as ceramics found have attested to. The finding of the Pavlopetri dwelling has surpassed all expectations, revealing a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, tombs, and religious structures: the makings of an advanced community.       The Inca, Ancestral Puebloans, and Pavlopetri have left behind worlds of ancient treasures- whole civilizations to be researched and new groups of peoples to understand. The artifacts that have been discovered have furthered understanding of the current world, and what the future holds for the world to discover of the past in the future, will open doors to time that has been lost to the ages.

Probably one of the most important things left behind, however, are the buildings that still remain. These structures represent how advanced the people that the archaeologists study. Without them, we might never know what life was like back when the buildings were in full use.        The Incans had magnificent buildings that showed archaeologists and the world how the Incans lived their lives. For example, without the pyramids in Incan land, it would be unknown that the Incans practiced sacrifices. These temples were the place where the sacrifices took place.

The incans lived a very civilized life. Also the Puebloans and the Pavvlopetri. Archeoligists studied and found all different kinds of things about them that inform us greatly in the modern day life. They found many things.      Incans are a very popular civilization that we have learned greatly about. We have figured out many ways of how they used to live. The way they lived is very different from our.       The Puebloans isnt so popular as the inca but is also the same amout of importance. Their land has been dicovered providing many things to inspect. They had fires to cook , and crop failings.

One of the ways we know so much about the Inca is passing stories down from our great, great, great ansetors.The first people to meet the Inca were the Europeans and the wrote stories about the them and that's another source where we get some information.The Spaniards couldn't really understand what the Inca said, so what the Inca told them might not have all been accurate.

This question is the thoughts of many people that wonder about, including some archeologists. The Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are very important for there religion, their remains of artifacts, and agriculture that help historians understand what it was like to be one of them.             Archeologists found clues of the Incas that were left behind. They had left behind their amazing portraits of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. From studying these clues, they could now peice together details of Inca life. The rest of the knowledge came from the artifacts, or objects that they have left behind, and from the sites in which they were found. From this they could find out where they were living and hidding. They discovered that the incas lived in the high Andes and may have worshipped some mountain peaks. Incas life explained many interesting things that helped archaeologists focus on today.            Looking at the life of the Puebloans they found some interesting things that may have been useful to other countries during that period. Some things they noticed were their buildings. they had built houses, one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pithouse or two in front. Pottery also changed, from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background. Farming also accounted for more of their diet than before, and much messa-top land was cleared for agriculture.            Lastly the Pavlopetri people before their town had submerged below the sea. When they had checked out the site where where the town had submerged they found very intersting things that they were very happy to have found. Such as buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. they also found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, and a lot of artifacts and left behind belonings.             The Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri are very important because of there ways of life and new inventions they had created. They all have amazing stories of how they all came to be and are very intersting to know about and get to share with the rest of the world.

One reason is because we can learn from their past mistakes. Another reason is to learn how they once lived. Then a final reason is because we can learn from their past designs. Whether its their weapons,structures,writings, or even money.         Learning from our past mistakes is one of the most beneficial to us. This is because if a past civilization made a huge mistake, we can learn from it and not make the same exact mistake in the future. If we haven't discovered ancient civilizations then we might have already failed which would lead to us falling as a country for the same reasons as the Inca or the Mayans.         Another reason it is beneficial to us is because we can learn how they once lived. This is beneficial to us because it is very interesting to learn about our past. It is human nature to want to learn about our ancestors. Learning about them is very interesting and exciting to know how people long ago once lived.          The final reason finding ancient civilizations is helpful is because we can learn from their designs. If past people built great structures like the pyramids we can learn from this. We can learn how to make things stronger and work more efficiently.           In conclusion discovering these once living civilizations can be very beneficial to us in many ways. Learning from past mistakes. Discovering how they once lived. Then finally gaining knowledge of past designs.If it weren't for these findings our civilization wouldn't be as efficient as it is today.

The Inca Also left little to no archives for historians to examine or study. Some of the first people to make calenders to help with he harvesting of crops, and livestock. The Inca are a difficult subject to study do to no artifacts, stories passed on, and the culture dying quickly. They ruled a south American empire for close to a hundered years, this epire was known to rival the expansion of Rome. They did however leave portraits of their religion, art, agriculture, government, and everyday life of this powerfull empire with a thriving economy.               Another civilization where the Puebloans, more primitive ways where used in such a small sosiety. These people could be found settling in Mesa Verde around A.D 500. They are known for their incredible basket making skills, and origanated nomadic, this was a new, calm, more suttle way of life. Soon they learnd pottery, and advanced their weaponry with one of the first bow and arrows. Puebloans lived in pit houses, in which is a square hole dug into the ground, and a low shelter placed upon it. Advancements multiplied around A.D 750, where houses where built above the surface. These where placed side by side in rows, often having a pithouse in front. They were named 'Puebloans' because this word in spanish ment 'village dwelers'.  ?

All you had was strings with color called Quipus to record lifestock.The Inca's created the system so that people will not understand what the knots mean.        First,the civilization was around nearly a hundred years(1438-1532).The clues that the Inca left behind was portaits of their religion,art/architectecture,agriculture,goverment,transportion,and way of life.By studying these clues it will make it easier to piece the details together of Inca life.The old st ories were writting down by Eurpeans who arrived  at the empire in 1532.The Inca visitors were spanish soldiers and priests, later on the description of the Inca in their letters or diaries.         Second,the rest of our knowledge of ther Inca came from artifacts or the objects left behind.Some of the artifacts were objects made out of stone,pottery,gold,or silver.Some other artifacts are turned up to be in ruins of buildings, and some were even found in graveyards from the dead how they preserved the dead body's.Also some of the Inca's clothing survived very well, like some of ancient cloth are usually destoyed by dampness,but they have been preserved from the dry desert on Peru coast and the cold mountains of the Andes.But some Inca's sites of been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters, the artifacts were even taken a centuries ago.         In addtion, the fall of the Inca's civilization was easy to date because the Spaniards murdered their last king in 1532 then took over the empire.The orgins of the Inca's are way,were difficult to trace then all the other civilzations because of the area they lived had different people who lived in that empire,so Archaeogists had to be careful to make sure that which sites were build by different people.The Inca lived high up in the Andes and may of worship some mountain peaks.Many of their sites are in remote/high places.Even some Inca's were buried in caves or even in cliff faces, or mountain tops.It's also to preserved the body's so the looters won't get to them that easy, so it make's it difficult for the Archaeogist to climb up to get to the body's and they have to carry their equpment all the way up.         As you can see, the Inca's lived in a high remote area and some are even lived on mountain peaks.The Inca's also worship many gods such as mountain peaks.And also remember what it will to live in the Inca civilization.

Since they were located on a mountain range and buried people many artifacts were discovered. This helps people determine how they lived. It can also help people understand why the empire fell and what to do inorder for that not to happen to current countries.   The Puebloans were located on cliffs and near cliffs. They buried their dead in caves. This helped to preserve artifacts which can tell us about the way they lived. This helps us to understand why they lived in the harsh conditions they did.

The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep a count of livestock.  The first Europeans to meet the Inca were impressed that they could run a huge empire with only using string to record everyday.  Today, no one knows what the knots mean.  Finding everything out about the Inca is like solving a mystery.

They let us learn about our past and talk about many interesting things that we may have never known about.          The Incas in Peru is a very important one of them because they kept records in unique ways. They would tell their stories by tying colorful strings together. The Inca past is lot like solving a mystery. Their stories are passed on to preserve the coummunity's history. The Inca also has many interesting discoveries like the Nazca Lines which nobody never knew where they came from. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by hunters and looters. People are still trying to find out where their civilization came from and what happened to it.              The Puebloans is also important because for more than 700 years their decendants lived and flourished in stone communities. Their span of a generation or two left their homes and moved away. Masa Verde National Park preserves their ancient culture. They now call them Ancestral Puebloans. They would build pithouses to live in and they were also skillful in stone masonry. Archaologists are still trying to figure out why they moved and what made them move.          Lastly , the Palvopetri interesting because it is a sunken settlement that dates back to about 5,000 years in Greece. They found buildings, courtyards, main streets, and religous buildings. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates when Plato wrote his tale of Atlantis. People say that Atlantis was all a myth. Divers have explored the sunken settlements. The site is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. It is believed that thye ocean comsumed it all arounf 1000 BC. What they found has surpassed all expectations and it is still talked about today.          They all have many important stories tied to them with some very interesting history. Thats why its important to learn about the past because it has some amazing history behind it all.

In Sources one, two and three, there were many artifacts that Archaeologists found. They were found, beneath overhanging cliffs, under the sea, and under ground. In many ancient civilizations Inca artifacts were found in the ruins of buildings and others were found buried in graves for us to use in the afterlife. They were made up of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Archealogists compare what they learn from artifacts and relate it with our future today. Archaeologists use advanced techniques to find artfacts that will help us discover more about Inca's predecessors. In addition, to advanced technology they use aerial photography to help them find patterns in ancient monuments that they cannot see from under the ground. Most of their artifacts were found in high places such as cliffs and mountain tops. This means archaeologists will have to carry all their equipment up on the mountain before they can start work. They'll usually find bodies in the icy Andes that are in good shape and can use medical scanning equipment. This will help us learn more about how they died. In source 3,the Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists explore settlement under the waters off southern Greece. Some sea life theories include tsunami, ground subsidence and earthquakes.  While exploring the site of the undersea city, they found things that they never believed they would find. This includes courtyards, religious structures and rock-cut tombs. Not to mention they also discovered a megaron this was a large structure. After much investigating, they concluded that it had been used by an elite and was raised by the settlement. There is a whole other world underwater that marine geologists have yet to find. We hope that further studies will help us with the discovery of new animals. Lastly, these clans had many artifacts that helped us find out more about are past. In the future, with advanced technology we hope to find more artifacts that we still have yet to find.

Studying the Inca is difficult due to them having no formal alphabet or writing system and also due to many of their artifacts not being preserved well or being stolen. The only thing the Inca did do was keep track of their livestock using quipus which was a system of tying knots in colored string in order count. Many stories and legends from the Inca have been written down in the journals of Europeans who invaded them and conquered them. One artfifact that is much easier to study is the is clothing articles. Due to them having a dry climate many of their clothing articles have been preserved well making it easier to study the artifacts and find out more about their culture and the way they lived. Many descendents of the Inca have passed down the stories and legends of the Inca for hundreds of years from generation to generation. When the Europeans wrote down the stories and legends that the Inca told them it would've been very hard to understand because they did not speak the Inca language well so there may be many mistakes in the the stories and legends that we may not know about. These stories are kind of important because through their legends and religious stories we could find out what type of religions they had back then. Artifacts have been much harder to find because many of the valuable objects made of stone and silver have been stolen by thieves. The only artifacts that we do have left are very well presererved clothing articles. We can tell what type of lifestyle they used to live by looking at and studying what type of clothes they wore. Many of the sites in Peru such as Macchu Picchu and other historical temples and religious worship areas are very important in finding out more about the Inca way of life. Many of the artifacts found in the shrines and religious temples are also important to finding out how they lived, what gods they believed in and who they worshipped. Many of these artifacts and stories are important to finding out more about South American cultures and the civilizations that started many modern day traditions and maybe even holidays that cultures still celebrate today.

The people who find answers to these questions are archaeologist.There were many cultures before modern humans and we have learned a lot from them. Some of the most important cultures were Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.   The Inca thought us how to create knots in colored string to create a calendar. The Puebloans thought us how to create a community. They built shelters called pit houses. The cliff dwellers thought us that we can make home in even the most inhabitable places. Without these groups we would not be the society we are today. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WP RB DT JJ NNS TO VB NNS JJ IN NN , VBG , CC VBG .

The letters and diaries left behind are transalated by Spanish soldiers and prists, but some of the transalations are not acurate.  Some artifacts are left behind on some sites made of diffrerent materials such as stone, pottery, gold and silver. Supplies had to be carried down and up hills if buildins were up there.

Incan civilizations have been discovered in the Andes, the Puebloans in Mesa Verde, and the Pavlopetri in the oceans of Greece. These discoveries found all around the world have educated the archaeologists of today about ancient civilizations and their way of life.           What make these discoveries of ancient life important to the people of the present? Learning about a civilizations way of life presents an interesting past to which we can learn from. Source #1 tells of the Incan tribes, one that ruled a South American empire that rivaled that of ancient Rome. The Incas had left no written records, causing archaeologists to put together a story of their own. Through the findings of artifacts, archaeologists have learned about Incan religion, art, architecture, government, and most importantly, their way of life. They learn from these artifacts and compare, sometimes confirming a historical record. Archaeologists record as much of the information they gather, whether by the  rise or fall of the civilization, to ultimately learn from the civilization we have inherited our land from.            Source #2 tells about the Puebloans, a civilization who flourished about 1,400 years ago in Mesa Verde. Discoveries about the Puebloans are important to archaeologists today because they tell of how this ancient culture survived and thrived for so many centuries. What this civilization left behind was an example of their skills, priority of religion, advancements, and every day life. Puebloans showed amazing skills in stone masonry and other advancements. This allowed them to build large, strong households of fifty rooms or more. Their pottery showed more intricate designs on more elaborate backgrounds. Once the Puebloans had moved into cave dwellings, archaeologists had found a truly excellent example of their skills in creating a home from difficult land. Their structures show evidence of accumulated skills past down from each generation and even reaching and influencing cultures in New Mexico and Arizona. This ancient civilization had possibly created a culture in states around the southwest and influenced their way of life.            Source #3 tells of an ancient sunken settlement on the ocean floor of southern Greece that belonged to a community known as the Pavlopetri. This civilization had influenced the fable of Atlantis, one of the world's most known legend and dates back to about 5,000 years ago. The discovery of this ancient civilization showed an extraordinary town of buildings, courtyards, rock-cut tombs, and more. 'It is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied,' said Elias Spondylis. This find leads marine geologists to create their own story of how this city fell. This important discovery is the only city found in Greece that dates back to Plato's tale of Atlantis. The Pavlopetri civilization continues to inspire underwater exploration today.              Sources 1, 2, and 3 show why the discovery of these ancient civilizations are significant to the people of today. These three cultures continue to influence more exploration and possibly the cultures of today. These discoveries help people learn about life before us ad a community. That is why the discovery of ancient civilizations is significant to the people of today.

I have 3 reasons my fist is the curiosity of people was filled, second the artifacts and ruins show what kind of artist and architectures they had in these cultures. Finally the last reason is why the civilizations were so important. Ill finish it up with a conclusion.       My first reason on why there discovery was so important is curiosity being filled. Modern humans always wonder about the past. When the archaeologists found the ancient artifacts, and learned more about the civilizations people from around the world found this interesting including many historians, and scientist. The curiosity that was before was now filled when the archaeologist found the cities of Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.       My second reason is the cultures of these civilizations. Ancient Inca was filled with pottery, gold, and silver. these artifacts were found in burial sites; many lasted this long in the ground. The lost city of Alantis had many  buildings, pottery, and other types of artifacts. The Puebloans had pithouses and tools for hunting. All these things show what kind  of civilization they all were. For example the Inca Empire had many natural resources such as silver, and gold. Since that is true the Inca natives most likely mined or dug up as much gold as they could find. The lost city of Atlantis propbably focused on architecture more than others because it had many buildings, and others landmarks. Mesa Verde had little homes but might have went hunting more because there was a lot of hunting tools and weapons found there.       Last reason why is they all were important is because they all gave something to the world. Whether it was science or architecture or even history. that is why it was most important.        This was an article on why these civilizations were so important.

Even tough they had no formal alphabet or writing, we have great artifacts to show what the people excelled at. Pottery, the hand spun clay is magnificent. There life sounds good but the people of Mesa Verde had it great.       The Mesa Verdeians lived in pithouses soon evolving into kivas people came and went to live and start new lands, but the cliff dwellers stayed home and flourished. These people to had no written or spoken language, but at least there home was above water.       Atlantis, the city of sunken treasuers. The great greek city just disapeared under water. Divers have discovered pieces of pottery plates building material all just showing more proof the the city could of sunk. Yet this proves so little since less than 1% of the ocean floor has been discovered.       All these great empires have so much more we could find out. Yet mysteries are still unsolved.

Learning how a lot of the basic things and ideas we use today started is very interesting. Many artifacts and civilizations that we have studied give us today a glimpse into what it was like living in the past.        Knowing the history of a civilization and what happened to it is one of the most important things. Since history is destined to repeat itself, learning how the ancient people dealt with certain problems is very important to our society today. As it says in paragraph 11 of source #1, ' Among the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from and what happened to it.' Our discoveries can reveal how we ended up the way we are today and how culture has changed over the years.        The ideas and inventions of ancient people can show just how advanced their culture was back then compared to the way we live now. In source #2, pithouses and kiva's are explained. If it weren't for the Puebloans, we may have a completely different design for our houses and churches today. Using the natural resources they had, the Puebloans learnt to adapt and mkae what they had useful; a great skill to have in even our modern society today.

The discoveries that have been made about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavloperti also inform people that civilizations actually prospered in that time. It shows how advanced their technology was for that time and how far it has come along.       Everyone knows the tale of Atlantis, but for many years that is all it has been known as, a fable, until now. The secrets of the lost city have been unlocked!  30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Even though this was discovered by a British oceanographer about 40 years ago, it was just this year that the digital technology was developed enough for marine archaeologist to be able to survey the ruins of this ancient city. Pavloperti's ruins were explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist; 'This sunken city dates back some 5000 years, to the time of Homer's heros and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say.'-Lost Greek city may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. By Helena Smith in Athens.       Dr. Jon Henderson, associate professor of the underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham was quoted saying ' There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world, It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. There are older  sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique.' Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank, many theories have been suggested, such as sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami. ' it is very likely a combination of the frist two,' said Dimitris Skellariou, at the Greek Institute of Oceanography.       It is amazing to me that for the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. Even though Atlantis was a myth, it still keeps the underwater exploration of Pavloperti's ruins in action. It also seases to amaze me that the Inca were able to run an empire based on knots in a string. Just the thought of our government trying to run our nation simply based on knots in strings is hard for me to wrap my head around. This is why I believe that the discoveries of the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavloperti are so important.

Also where they would get enough food sources. Where the weather would be good, so they can grow crops too.       The finding of the Pavlopetri is important because this is the oldest submergerd town in the world. They can now research how they lived and survived in their time. They can also expreiment some of the living conditions they had and how they continued living through droughts and failing at growing crops.       Mesa Verde is also an interesting place they dicovered because over 1,400 years ago Europeans lived there. They discovered pit houses and how they were built. That's when the popultion multiplied. Then they believe that they moved out of Mesa Verde because of the loss of food sources and crops. The use of pottery and cliff dwellings also gave away information as to how they lived and what they did as an everyday thing.       The discovery of the Inca of Peru was interseting also. They found clues left behind by the Inca form from of religion, art, architecture, agriculture, a way of life, government, and transportation. The discovered their living conditions by diaries and many other artifacts left behind. They found artifacts that were buried and others in tombs.       Artifacts can help you discover many things, these artifacts for example: helped researchers find out the way of life, how they survied, and what they did. Also weather was a big help with dicovering buildings, streets, and many other things. Reseachers may get lucky and find many other things not yet dicovered.

All that we knew about the Incas have been old stories passed down generation to generation and some old stories from the Europeans. The discoveries of the Inca artifacts have told us what we know now about the Incas. The artifacts we have found show what their culture was like. The finding of their clothes show what whey wore and what conditions they lived in. Its a shame treasure hunters and looters took the artifacts. This has been able to tell us how the Incas dissappeared, when the Spaniards killed the last Inca king.       Mesa Verde is a place in the four corners region where a group of pepole lived for a short time. These people, the Ancestral Puebloans, settled here around 550 A.D. They were nomands that decided to settle in the area. They lived in pithouses, which were a few feet underground with supports at the four corners of the room. They were becoming prosperous and started building better houses above ground. About 500 years later, the population could of been at several thousand. One day, they just decided to give up what they have built and return to the mountain alcoves. Archeologists who became interested in researching these people were having little luck. They left no records and many of the items that were important to them have perished. All we have are their buildings that they built, which show how they lived. They lived pretty welt until about 1300 A.D., when Mesa Verde became deserted.       The fable city of Atlantis, a sunken city that is tied to a great myth, has beed discovered. Found beneath the waters of southern Greece, this is one of the oldest submerged towns discovered. Atlantis, which takes up 30,000 square meters of ocean floor, is said to be submerged around 1000 BC. The exprolations brought up several buildings, courtyards, streets, and various tombs and religious buildings. Geologists are still trying to figure out why the city sank. Some are believing it sank because of sea level changes and ground subsidence. Several people are excited to find it and researchers are continuing to work torwards finding everything the city has hidden.

Archaeologists found many of these quipus but no one knows what the knots mean. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government and the way of life. We know some of the old stories because they have writen them down. And some of the Incas stories were legends not history. Some artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others found buried in graves.          The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde in about 550 A.D. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. about 750 A.D. they began building houses above ground. They built their house against another in a long, curving rows. By 1000 A.D. the people of Mesa Verde advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to stone. Often rose three stories high.

In Inca, we learn they have a huge empire and explore religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life to know the way they used to live. Incas left behind stone, pottery, gold, and silver, which were in the ground for hundreds of years. We also learn that there are thiefs who would be willing to steal anything they see that could be valuable. Discoveries of bodies have also been found in mountains frozen.              Next we learn about the Puebloans and their past. They live in Mesa Verde and are skilled in basketmaking. They were hunters, made pottery, and lived near cliffs.They built houses with mud and poles along with curving rows. They used fire for cooking and they failed to grow crops since the drought ruined it.

However, discovery about the Inca,Puebloans,and the Pelvopetri are truly amazing.   They helped us learn more about the past.      First, the ancient Inca were very difficult to study because they did not have a system of writing. Their art and architecture were clues about how they lived. Artifacts might be golden jewelry or stone pottery.

Well, the findings of the civilizations helps us to understand how we evolutionated over the time. Also, to know how was life back then. And, to understand more the history of humas. Therefore, these findings are very helpful to you and humanity.       The dicovery of the Incas helped us to understand more about math, and how they used architecture to build their cities. The Incas also helped us to know what type of technology they had back then to build and to use in agriculture. These artifacts they used were also to communicate. Also, we learned about their religions and their customs with all the writing they left behind. The discovery of the Incas helped to understand more about life in south America, and its history.       Next, the discoveries of the Puebloans helped us to understand also their culture and beliefs. Also, we learned how they advanced in architecture and math. They had also, great advances in building ceremonial rooms. Archeologists also find many artifacts they used to build and also used in agriculture. The discovery of the Puebloans helped us understand more about their civilization and culture.       Third, the discovery of Atlantis, helped use to prove that it wasn't a myth. Archeologists have find artifacts underwater and other types of structures remaining from Atlantis. Archeologists haven't found many clues or writings of Atlantis due to the fact it's underwater. But, archeologists have find many artifacts underwater that can prove that Atlantis was once a great civilization.         Finally, the discoveries of the Incas, The Puebloans, andAtlantis have helped humans to understand more about the history of civilization. Because the dicoveries we have learned more about history and evolution. They have helped us know the technology they used, their discoveries, and other types of things such as math and architecture. Also, welearned about their beliefs and customs from the writings they left behind. In conclusion, the discoveries of ancient civilizations helped us to understant more about the history of evolution. 	NNP PRP RB JJR WRB VBP DT DT NNS IN NN NNS RB JJ .

Archeologists studied very closely these ancient civilization and got some ideas on how the Inca's lived and how they built their buildings and how they painted their art work.       The first Ancestral Puebloans mostly lived in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. Puebloans are important now a days because they were very skilled on crafting. So maybe crafters now a days get ideas or get inspired with the craft the Puebloans made. Also some of the paintings might of inspired some of our very famous painters.       At last, in source #3 it states that 'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of rhe world's most enduring myths- the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' Meaning these lost city was a very inspiring myth to some people in the world that even made them rich for saying that myth. For example, in Seaworld there is a rollercoasters called Atlantis which of might of had to pay the inventer of Atlantis to borrow their name for the ride. Also, it states that 'As the world's oldest submerged city it is truly amazing. It not only showd hoe people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow.'

It also helps us know more about our ancestors. Some of these discoveries are tools &amp; we can recreate them &amp; help us.       For example, clues from the Inca civilizations help us learn more about their religion, art &amp; architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, &amp; also their way of life. Most of what we know of the Incas come from oral history. The rest comes from artifacts that were left behind. For example, Inca artifacts might have been made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. These kinds of materials last a long time. Some Inca textiles &amp; clothing have been preserved in the dry deserts or cold mountains. To study more of the Inca civilization they need every single piece of evidence they can gather. Sometimes archeology confirms Spaniards' historical records. Also, some bodies found in the Andes reveal information about how they lived. Some of the most important things to learn about a civilization are where it came from &amp; what happened to it.       Also, archeologists have founded pithouses in villages from the first ancestral Puebloans. These pithouses reveal that they lived a more settled life. In this way of living farming replaced hunting &amp; gathering. Later, these pithouses evolved into kivas which were gathering places &amp; sometimes also places to pray. These were also later compared to churches.       Another discovery is Pavlopetri, which is a submerged city. This is sometimes related to the Greek myth of Atlantis. Step by step, more cities have been discovered underwater. These cities encounter that the sea levels have changed drastically or that many natural disasters have happened to make these cities submerged. These types of discoveries help us understand more of our world.

There have been many discoveries that have been made by archeologist involving ancient civilizations that answer those questions.These answers can also give insight on how other civilizations rose to power, lived and thrived, and how they collapsed. The Incas, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri discoveries are important discoveries.      The Incas were an ancient civilization located in modern day Peru.They were so advanced even thought they didn't have a writing system. They developed these strings that had knots that were used to keep track records called quipus. We know that the Inca civilization lasted for about a hundred years (1438-1532). During those years they developed such advanced religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation,and way of life that even rivaled the expansion of ancient Rome. Archeologist were able to decipher the civilization by clues left behind. For example, old books written by Spaniards told the suppose history of the Incas. Also, clues left behind on pottery, textile, and cloth gave archeologists clues about the traditional way of life.Among the most important things, experts were able to learn about how the ancient civilization fell. They know that the Incas were concurred after the Spaniards killed their king. Archeologist had to face obstacles trying to reach the sites on the mountain such as the freezing cold and the tiring hike up the mountain.      Another civilization called the Puebloans were also advanced. They lived in North America in the Four corners region in Mesa Verde. This civilization was known for their crafts. They started out like most civilizations. They started to farm, build pit houses, and develop a society. They used nature to their advantage.They build their houses beneath overhanging cliffs. They also did many crafts. Their pottery left clues behind on their living, background, and agriculture.However, their downfall isn't very known. Archeologist think that they collapsed because of intensive use of land and resources or crop failures.       One of the most interesting civilizations is the Pavlopetri. There town is found sunken in the ocean off the coast of southern Peloponnese. Archeologists and divers have founded that their city is as old as the ancient Greek. They've found pottery, streets, tombs and religious structure underwater. Archeologist are not sure why their city sunk. Maybe it was because of sea level changing, earthquake, or tsunami. Eexperts think that this city inspired Plato to write the story about Atlantis.        All of the discoveries of these civilizations are important. They give insight on our past. If we know our past we can control our future. We can learn from their achievements. Also, it lets us search places we have never search before.Also, it feeds our curiosity. All of these civilizations are important and gives us insight on our past.        	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB NNS VBN IN DT JJ .

Instead of writing like how we do today they would make knots in colored strings called quipus. They used these knots to record the calander to keep a count of livestock. Today archaeologists have found many knots but no one today knows what they mean. This is all important because passing on stories is a good way to preserve a community's history.         Also, the Ancestral Puebloans are important because they are known for building stone communities. This is important because today archaeologists call them 'the ancient ones.' Another thing they are known for is their craft skills. They would make baskets, pottery, and bow and arrows. This is all important today because they lead a more settled way to live.         Lastly, the Pavlo petri are important because they discovered many secrets under water. They dated back to 5,000 years ago. They also studied everythiung that had to do wiuth the undersea city.

Some of the ways are good and can be bad. Also some of them can be different and even the same. Most importantly there are many of them that made the world that we have today.       The Incas had a different alphabet and writing system as we do today. They did funky designs and knots in the different colored strings to represent the calendar to keep track of the livestock. That invention was called the quipus. There are many quipus' that they found but don't understand them and what they mean. Incans did a lot of art, architecture, and things to represent their religion. The only reason that we know about this today is because they wrote these things down by arriving Europeans and in 1532. It was hard for them to understand what they wrote because no body even the Spaniards didn't know. We can also tell by the stone, gold, pottery and silver they made. They liked to live in mountains and when they died their bodies froze so when the archeologists found the bodies, they were easy for them to identify.       The Puebloans lived in different places then most. They were known for their skill and the craft. Instead of hunting they did farming. The places they lived in was smaller and they had to build them. They also did pottery and made this too. In about 750 they started to build houses above ground and walls made of poles and mud. In 1300 they started to make the walls and everything else builable out on concrete.       The Pavlopetri was a sunken settlement about 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. It was very hard to find bodies underwater. In 200 BC there were more sunken sites. they lived different.

These cultures were the begining of mand kind.  They invented alot of things just to be able to survive.  The Inca was a very intelegent group of people the made a calander out of knots and colored string.  Inca is also the most compleicated out of the three because of how they used string and knots for there number system.         The Puebloans are very smart because they built houses called pithouses because the roof sunk in a little bit.  They also lived in canyon walls.  The Puebloans used a spear for hunting until the adapted to the bow which was a more efficent hunting weapon.  They also had a very big use of clay to make pottery.

Although it may be a word that can stand for almost anything, History is a timeless subject that analyzes the depth of the ever-expanding past and allows us to learn about where we came from. Although many may think of history as a chore, there are many areas of history that are rarely discussed. One of them is art. Every civilization had its own way to tell stories and express the emotions of their people. The findings about the Incas, Ancestral Puebloans, and Pavlopetri are significant because they could help us understand and respect ancient life on a deeper level by showing that history can also be appealing to not only historians, but artists as well.                  In Peru, an ancient empire thrived in the rocky Andes Mountains. Their proportions were comparable to that of the Romans. They left behind astounding monuments and artifacts made of gold and silver. Away from the mountains and under the sea, a ancient city lies in a shallow bay. It is said to be the oldest submerged city in the world. The sea bed glistened with shards of pottery. A distance from the depths of the sea, along the arid cliffs of the Four Corners region, a tribe thrives and expresses life through basket weaving and pottery. They began making pottery soon after settling in Mesa Verde. Their baskets were made with intricate and gorgeous designs. This can be of interest of not only historians, but artists as well. It shows that even in ancient life, people could be artistic and express their feelings. This shows that the beautiful art of the past was kept alive throughout the ages                Art is intertwined in everything we do. From the way we speak to the way we think and express or feelings. Ancient life can help us discover the artist within us. It can entertain us with beautiful art like the pottery from the Puebloans and Pavloperti. It can bring forth new knowledge of the arts that were originally unknown. It can bring a new found respect because it allows one to understand that even ancient civilizations possessed beautiful art.

Why you may ask, well they were all a part of history.   The discoveries on ancient civilizations make us know more about the past. They tell us stories of civilaztions ands what they were to them in there time. They tell us so many times in there daily lifes before like how they eat or what they did in life. They show us what kind of part they had in our history books. We can uncover secrets of them that show up in our discoveries. The Incas made these pyminds in South America and made art out of materials from Earth like Gold for example. They maybe hunted wild animals for food and hunted together. They could made tools like spears,knifes, and other tools out of rock or some material that was use full to them.The environment could tell us what kind of life and plants might have been there. The Ecosystem today could can us that they lived near rivers or lakes. Near mountains or hills.   The Lost Greek City showed us that they made there civilzation to be the greatest. Making there Building and things so fancy and to show the world that they were the best at there time. Discoveries like old buildings that show how they made thee buildings and rusted things like tools or jewelery. Like finding a box of treasures near the Lost Greek City that may give Archaeologists clues. Clues to that people may have worn jewelery.   Also the Ancestral Puebnloans which there homes may still be untouched. There homes discovered by us that show that thwey curved into the Earth to make these buildings out of hard rock. there curving tools may have been still there. So these things were important to us and their civilzations because they show us how life was like in the past.   Showing us how they lived,hunted, and how it was back then. To them there lifes were normal, but to us they made history. Even though they never knew it in their lifes and time as they maybe wanted to be become history. Even though in the future they did become it.

They are important because they explain the cultre they had. It is also important because you learn about what they used to live and what they did to survive. Another reason why they are important is that you learn when they were around how long ago when they were around. The final reason why they are important is that you can learn what happened to them and why they left where they were living.          The Incas lived a long time ago from (1438-1532). They were a tribe that had no Alphabet or the system of writing. The Incas used a system of knots to record the calender and to keep a count of lifestock. Archaeologists have found many knotd but today nobody knows what they mean exactly. in 1532 spanish soldiers and priest came to the Incas and described them in there letters and in there diaries. When the historians find these letters and diaries they hace yo be careful when they try to interpret what they mean because the spanish didn't speak the Incas languguage that well. The rest of the knowldge we know about the Incas is there artifacts. The artifacts that the Archeaologists find are made from stone, pottery, gold, and silver. These matrieals we find are over a hundred years old. Finally, the Archeaologists who work on these sites keep careful records on what they are doing and where they found the items.          The Puebloans lived about 1400 hundred years ago before the Euorpeans discovered america. They lived in the four corners region. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about 550 A.D. They were known for their basketmaking skills and crafts. They built houses above ground  with walls made from mud. They also, built houses against another in long curving rows. Puebloans is a spanish word for village dwellers. During the Classic period the population had grown to several thousand. Mesa Verde is spanish for green table.            The Pavlopetri is an ancient city that was found underneath the ocean. Archeaologists have dated the city about 5,000 years ago in Greece. Dr Jon Henderson said 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged city in the world. Its remains date back from 2,800 to 1,200 BC. Marine geologists have yet to make how the city got submerged. The theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence a result from earthquakes, and a tsunami. Archeaologists have found many artifacts from the city.            In conclusion, the discoveries of the Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important because. The Incas have old pottery gold ,stone, and silver we can learn from. The Puebloans lived in houses above ground and they built next to each other. The Pavlopetri was an under water city that is the oldest under water city in the world.

They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calander to keep a count of livestock. We know some old stories because the were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire on 1532. Some Inca textiles and clothing have also suvived remarkably well.

The Pueblos lived in Mesa Verde as great builders and creative minds. The Pavlovian lived in a small advanced town near Greece. These three civilizations even help archeologists today on how we see the past.        The Incas were not a long lasting civilization. They had some trouble with Spaniards. But the Spaniards did not stop them from having a creative but also there intellectual minds. The Incas had magnificent clothing which was perserved by the weather. This can help us see that back then that clothing was not an issue for the history since this small civilization was able to achieve this. They were able to form governments and transportation. This does not just come to one. The Incans were a small but powerful nation teaching us that a creative mind leads to success.        The Pueblo ans were somewhat like the Incas. The Pueblo ans made pottery and had buildings that stood tall and strong. They had lived in pit houses that kept them safe from disasters. These highly almost undestructable buildings help increase the population a lot as they were protected by the buildings. The Puebloans had taught us the ways we can improve the way our structures today could be prepared for anything.        The Pavlovian civilization definitely had passed the Incas and Publicans in terms of there lifestyle. The terrible tragedy of a natural disaster had ruined all of there advancements. These people had made roads, somewhat invincable buildings that lasted from sinking. This was all done in one tiny town. They had done all of this in a short amount of time. The Pavlopetri civilization had taught us the great advancements that we should use today.        In the end, these and other civilizations have taught us the way we live today. The Incas, Pueblo ans, and Petrologist have taught us the arts, building structures, and the way of living. The past is very important because it teaches the present the advancements of the past.

We would not know as much if there were no researchers or things like that.       The first discovery that will be talked about is the Inca. They had no alphabet of a system of writing at all! One thing archeaologists found were quipus. These were colored knots that the Inca used to keep track of their livestock. Some clues left behind were paintings of the Inca religion, are and architecture, agriculture, government, and transportation. When studying these things they can put pieces of how the Inca lived together. Some old stories are told because they were written by the Europeans who came in 1532. These people were Spanish soldiers and priests who described the Inca in diaries and letters. A lot of the information we know about the Incan people comes from artifacts and things that they left behind. Some of those artifacts were made from stone, pottery, gold, and even silver. Some of the Inca clothes and textiles survived with no harm. Most clothes like this are damaged by dampness but these particular things were preserved in the deserts of Peru.

Historians have to be careful whenthey interpret these accounts. The spainards did not speak the language well. They may have understood what the incan told them, sotheir descriptions might not be accurate. And some of the incan stories were legends rather than history. Among the most important thing to learn about a civilization are wfere it came from and what happened to it. The fall of the inca is soeasy to date because the spainards murdered the last incan king in 1532and took over the empire.The origins of the incan empire are more difficult to race.       The area in which they lived had long been inhabited by different people. Archaeologists have to be careful to make sure which people built the site. Archaeologists use some of the most advance techniques in the world to discover more about inca's predecessors. You will see how aerial photography can help them find the patterns in the Ancient monuments that they cannot see from the ground.

The discoverys was that we found real good infomation and we found thing's that we did'nt even know about. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were beginning to lead a more settled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood.         They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops, but sometimes in clif recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more effcient weaponed for hunting than the atlatl, a spear thrower. These were fairly prosperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied. 	NNP NNP .

To begin with, during the ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. But later on Inca began making knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender of their livestock.In fact, the Europeans were amazed by this that they thought they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records.Also, some Europeans who wrote stories had arrived in the empire in 1532. The visitors were Spanish and priests they described the Inca in letters and diaries. The reason why all this was important was because as in today these are some of the things we use today in our daily lives.             First,Inca textiles and clothing have also survived well because of its ancient materials. For example, in ancient times like cloth are usually destroyed by damoness ,but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. Even. archaeologists can learn from artifacts and sites with the Spinard's accounts of the Inca . Although sometimes archaeology can even confirm any historical record you may have. This is important because keeping track of any kind of record is important to many people either because its confidental information or it has to be kept.            Second,Ancestral puebloans is imporatant for several reasons.  The first Puebloans was settled in mesa verde which means 'green table.' Although the gree table is basically known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft.These were sta rting to be useful for farming hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. Archaeologists learned how to make potterty and acquiered the bow and arrow as a more efficient weapon uses for hunting .Many of these people lived in pithouses from A.D 550 TO a.d 750 As Settled ariculture began.   This was important because of these pithouses later on as in today it has became a place for people to live like an apartment or a house.                               Third ,in a lost greek city a sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece was found . The explorers who had found this was an Anglo-greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists which are known as Pavlopetri. In fact, the sunken settlement dates were back about 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes .   Although, this was the first time a sunken city has  been found in Greece that predate the time that Plato had written his allegorical tale of the suncken continent of Atlantis. As you can see these were all very important because of the different myths people found geologists and many others turned ancient times into something that we can still use today.                     Overal, all these different myths were important to man people because we got to  make something more useful and succesful to use. Also, without discovering many of these things we wouldn't have what we have today .Instead we would have to come up with our own things to create our needs. Ancient times helped us to discover why many things happened and now we know what to e xpect from them.   Even though many of the things we haven't exactly found in answer to there are still alot more to be found .

The Incas had a way of keeping recored. This can help us find out how we stared to keep a recored. They would also live in the mountains which would give us information to help people who wanted to live in the mounatins.              The Puebloans  were very important.

Although they used colored strings called quipus to record the calender and to keep track of the livestock. When the first Europeans meet the Inca they were highly suprised by how they could run a huge empire by using strings to keep records of things. Some Archeologists have found quipus butstill today no one knows what the knots on the strings mean. If we dont have anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is like trying to solve a mystery.                  The Inca left behind clues that tell us about their religion, art, and architecture, agriculture, government, and the way of life. All of what we know about the Inca cames from oral history, and or stories passed from generation to gneration, and passing ont he stories was an important way to preserve a community's history.                  I think all of what the Inca did was just the beginning of a new language at the time, and once the first Europeans killed the last of the Inca and took over their empire they kind of just carried everything out of what the Inca did and changed it up a little to where it was understand able.                  The Inca were very productable, they made an entire village full of these things called Pithouses which they lived in from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. They also made this building called an Kiva which had a venilator, bench, air deflextor, fire pit, sipapu, and a pilater. The word Kiva is a Hopi word for ceremonial room. There were undergrund chambers comparable to later churches. As you can see the Inca were very modern people who made the best of what they had and then some.

Finding the Inca civilization is important becuase of the way they live. They use pottery, silver and gold to help them live. Their textiles and clothing are preservative, but also easily destroyed. Some of these sites have though been disturbed. Those who do take anything usually valuable. Archeoligists keep careful records of their findings. The most important thing is finding out where a civilization came from and what happened to that civilization. Archeologists do dangerous things to get their findings.         The findings of the Mesa civilization is also very important. They have lived there in their stone communities for more than 700 years. They farmed instead of hunting and learned how to make pottery and acquire bows and arrows. They also lived in pithouses and made baskets. A.D, 1000 their housing changed and so did their pottery design. There were cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde who dwelled under overhanging cliffs.           Last but not least are the findings of the Lost Greek city that is Atlantis. Divers went under to explore the lost city which is southern Greece. This site takes up 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off of the southern Peloponnese. Exploring this underwater city they found buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. Marine geoligists connot figure out why this site sank. There is still alot to be found.            These are some important findings for these lost civilizations.

The Ancestral Puebloans have used nature to their advantage, they built their homes under overhanging cliffs. When they left, they traveled to New Mexico and Arizona where some of their descendants live today.       The secrets of southern Greece have led to one of the most explored myths in the world, the lost city of Atlantis. It is believed to cover over 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. It is believed that this settlement was occupied over 5000 years ago, but marine biologists have yet to discover why this settlement sank, theories include earthquakes or tsunamis but the real reason is yet to be found. What we do know is that the excitement of an exploration will take place until the truth is revealed.

Although they go through many problems they help us learn about ancient civilizations.             Such as they Lost Greek city, the Lost Greek city is under water so this makes it more difficult for archaeologist look for artifacts. Evens though this city is under water they find many ways to find artifacts to help us learn about ancient civilizations.             Some civilizations are easy to find evidence. Such as the Incas, the Inca's civilizations are easy to search because they are above ground. Although the Inca's civilization is above ground it is very spread out. The civilization being spread out makes it more difficult by making the archaeologist have to look in many different spots.              The Cliff Dwellers are had to investigate because they made their homes in the side of cliff which most likely have either been destroyed by humans or by natural causes. Even though the Cliff Dwellers are had to investigate archaeologist still find away to investigate the ancient civilizations. Sometimes archaeologist dig to find remains of the Cliff Dwellers civilizations.               Although archaeologist go through many problems they still find away to over come it. That is why we know what we know about ancient civilization.

I have came to realize that some of this information i didn't even know.  I am going to tell you about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the pavlopetri.         The ancient Inca of peru had no alphabet or system of writing.  They didn't leave much for historians to study.  The Incas made knotted strings to record things.  They recorded things like the keeping of livestock.  They even put knots in strings to record the calendar. These strings were called quipus.  The Europeans were amazed when they met the Inca and saw that the Incas could run a large empire off of using string to keep record of many things.  Archaeologist have found plenty of quipus, but without nobody being able to read the message tied into the strings we may never have they understanding of Inca. The Puebloans were known as basketmakers.           They were called this because they were good with crafts. Farming for them replaced hunting and gathering as their man livelihood. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. The bow and arrow was more efficient for hunting than the atlati or the spear thrower.  This was good because basketmakers and their population increased.  These people were known as puebloans, a spanish word meaning 'village dwellers'. The pottery also changed from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings with white backgrounds.  The widespread use of pottery meant less attention to the craft of basket.The stone wall of the large pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesaa Verde. The last group I would like to tell you about is the pavlopetri.            The secrets of a lost city was discovered by an anglo-greek team of archeaologists and marine geologists and known as pavlopetri. They mainly saw sunken sites. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. It is believed to have been consumed by the sea about 1000 BC. Even though it was discovered by a british oceanographer about 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. Thanks to the shifting sands the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. Some ceramics were found. They dated back until the stone age. investagations also revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. More than any other underwater sight so far, the find offers potential insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. locals in the nearby town of Neapolis are delighted.             In conclusion, I wonder how much information you now know about ancient history of Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. I have also learned more. I hope you have also.

Now, I will tell you why the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important.       The Inca has been talked about for years now. Some of this information comes from oral history, or stories that have been passed down. Why Inca is so important to us now is because they did not leave archives for historians to study. Knowing about the Inca helps the archaeologists understand a lot more about history. Things we have learned because of the Inca is like a portrait of their religion.       The Puebloans helps us understand our world a little better. Who built the first houses here and lived here. The Puebloans lived in pithouses. Pithouses are houses with a hole in the middle of the roof for the smoke of a firepit to escape. They also made Kiva's, another word for ceremonial room. The Puebloans are important to history because they help us understand living better.       The Pavlopetri are important to us because they found the city of Atlantis. If they had not found this, we would probably still be looking for it to this day. The Pavlopetri also found more things. They have found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age and they have made new buildings that we later found. This is why the Pavlopetri are important.

The weather, and other natural occurrences have helped us learn about them. There are three important civilizations: Ancient Inca's, Mesa Verde, and the lost Greek City.       Ancient Inca:    Ancient Inca did not have a formal alphabet or system of   writing...that we know of. They used quipuis to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Quipus is knots made in a colored string.   How do we know about this ancient civilization? Some of it   comes from oral history, or even passed by generation.       Mesa Verde:   Long before the Europeans came and explored North America-   1,400 years ago, people living in the Four Corners chose Mesa Verde as their home. They lived in stone communties in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. In the late A.D. 1200's, they moved away and left thier homes behind. These Anasazi's are actually an important part of the history you learn today.

They are important to learn about because these civilizations give us clues to what the world was like in ancient times. All over the world archaeologists are studying the ruins and artifacts of ancient civilization.    The artifacts of the Inca can tell us about their civilization. There isn't much left over from the Incans, but whatever we can find to learn about them is interesting. They did not have a language or a written language. They recorded everything using colored string. Spanish soldiers later discovered and wrote letters about the Inca. Most archaeologists aren't sure whether or not to use the letters for information, considering the Spanish barely knew anything about the Inca civilization.    The Ancestrial Puebloans are another ancient civilization archaeologists still have much to learn about. Currently there are modern day Puebloans scattered. Archaeologists discovered Puebloans were nomadic hunter-gatherers, but later changed their ways and became farmers and began making villages. The Puebloans left behind some of their art, such as baskets and pottery. They used the bow and arrow and the spear for hunting, which are very efficiant weapons. Archaeologists do not know if the Puebloan civilization was a violent one.    The Pavlopetri of Greece are another interesting civilization we have yet to learn a lot about. The ruins of their city were recently found under the ocean. Archaeolgists have no clue about this civilization, but the ruins of the city. They have also discovered that this civilization was around about 5,000 years before the original Greece was existant.    These civilizations, like many others, can teach us about the past. Archaeologists can find out about the empires that ruled. They can find out about the civilizations art, weapons, way of gathering food, and their language. And all of this will be in the history books one day. Maybe even our time will be information to learn about in the future.

Archeologists are able to identify how people lived, what they wore, what they ate, all by looking at items left behind. Archeology is important to our life because that way we can understand how far our world has come and understand how it has changed throughout the years. Discoveries about the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri tribes are essential because they provide us with information about how life was like before breakthroughs in technology, or the dgrastic change of lfe.         The Inca were originally from Peru. It was important to study the Inca because they were an important ancient tribe. This was a challenge for archeologists, because the Incan tribes did not have a formal way of writing, so the historians were not able to study archives or books, literature and stories which could have been left behind. Instead, they used strings called quipus to have a calendar and keep record of livestock. It shows us that even though Incan people did not have formal writing that most people in our time have, they still were able to carry out familiar activities in unique ways. To know more about the Inca, historians have studied stories that were passed down through generations, and also artifacts. It is important to see how these artifacts were crafted, so we can get a mental image of how Incans went through life.          The Puebloans were people who lived in the Mesa Verde section of North America. It is important to understand the way of life for them, because they had a very successful lifestyle, and their comunity flourished over time. They bulit actual houses our of wood and rocks, and some of them were over two stories high and had fifty rooms or more. Their population has been estimated around seven-thousand. The Puebloans lived a very elaborate lifestyle compared to others and it was almost a luxurious way of living for people at the time. They have left behind artifacts that have allowed historians to understand their way of life.        Without studying the way of life back then, archeologists would cease to exist and we would be uneducated on how far our world has come today. What people leave behind can help us unlovk the secrets of our world, and how mankind has developed over the years.Without historians, I don't think our world would be able to flousrish the way it has over the years. The study of history has played a huge impact in our lives.

It helps us understand how life was back then and learn from the ideas they had. I think that these discoveries are important in life to everyone. htye should know what these people were like.               The Inca's were a very interesting race. thye built houses and they had a very big empire. I think that if the Spainiards' had not killed them they would still be around. These people are important because they helped us develope house buildin, how to farm and do agriculture. They gave us all those precious stones and things they had.                The Puebloans also thought the scientists many things. They got through alot of trouble to find out who these people were. The Puebloans prospered form basic vases that were dull and gray to art and drawings how they prospered made us better.

In Peru there once lived a ancient civilization lost in time. They were the Inca. Archaeologists have not only learned from the site, but from around it to. Deep in the mountains bodies have been found. This led us to believe that the Inca worship the mountains around them. Europe has also helped us learn more. Spaniards Left written accounts about the Inca and how they fell.            In Mesa Verde there was the Ancestral Puebloans. They gave us ideas about how they lived and worked, but it was a challenge. Since they lived in cliff areas they made it hard for people to come and learn. This also kept raiders at bay. see some time remote areas are a good thing. Their structures told us about their society. Passing on skill showed off in their buildings, such as pit houses and kivas. They used nature to their advantage. Their building were over cliffs! What mighty feats they had to go through to learn.             This is where Atlantis is real. The lost Greek city was found under water! Near Neapolis this was a wonder and a struggle to learn from. Oh, but what wonders it held. Since no one has touched it for thousands of years it was perfect. no robbers and only a little nature to worry about. The people who found this could not believe it. Do you see the lengths people take to learn. Will you do things like this to learn? I know I will.

The Incas where a very intellegent tribe which made them very powerful.We have modern day calenders which help us determine days and events.The calenders all evolved from the Inca tribes quipu.A quipu is a string that contains knots on it that determined the seasons and harvest.

They did not leave anything behind for historians to study for. So finding clues about the Inca is like trying to solve a mystery. The Inca group was a cilvilazation that lasted for nearly a hundered years (1438-1532).           Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion,art,architexture,agriculture,goverment,transportation,and way of life. Archeologists study these clues and bring pieces together to find details of the Inca life.   Then Inca used oral history which is saying your history but by story. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by looters which are treasure hunters. But the most important things to learn about is were the civilazation came from and were it happened. The fall of the Inca date is easy to find because the spainiards murdured the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. But the orgins of the Inca are harder to discover becuase their land  has been inhabited for a long time by different types of people.           This is one of the lost empires of the world, the Inca. Although we barely know about them, more will be discovered in the future because technology will go stronger by then and will track down more about the Inca and the other lost empires. But for now, we will; have to try our best to find out what we can find.

Today I read an article about ancient history. I read how history was like before, what are some of the special features of anciemt history, and some of the secrets of ancient history.       On the first article, I read how history was like before. For example, I learned that the old stories were witten down by the Eurpoeans. Also, that the visitors were Spanish soilderes and priests. Finally, they described the Inca in letters and diaries. The Spaniards did not speakthe Inca language well. The second thing I learned was what were some of the special features about history. One of the most important natural or places is the Mesa Verde National Paark. This park was aroud for the many years. It is very important and sprecial fo many people. The last thing I learned were some secrets about history. One secret was that many arcologists discovered many things underwater. One thing they found were some special type of rocks.       Today I learned many things I did not knoe before. I learned secrets, special places, and things about history that I did not  know before. This as a very interesting article.

These include the study of the Incas and their ways of life as well as the past of Atlantis.  In the Inca tribe, they wove cloth, hunted and gathered, made pottery, did arts and crafts, and wrote scribes and books on their daily life.  These are artifacts that have been discovered, here in todays society.  Archaeologists do face some struggles on finding evidence of the Incas existence.  They do not know exact dates of the events that were enlisted and they have a hard time examining the procedures that the Incas endured.            The lost area just off the coast of Greece, Atlantis, has been rediscovered by geologist willing to risk what they have to learn about our past and the history behind the lost area of Atlantis.  Geologists have found artifacts about the area, such as stones that relate back the the stone age and some cool rocks that have been recently found.  The lost area hides many amazing things that could help our future.  Geologists do struggle to identify why this place sank or what even happened to it.  The mystery will hopefully be solved in the near future.             Thank you for listening to my essay on Earths past.

These civilizations are important to us because they let people know what happened in the past and how ancient technology was invented.  Three important ancient civilizations are the Inca, the Puebloans, and the underwater city.  These civilizations have supplied us with much needed information on ancient civilizations.        The Inca were a south African civilization that ruled for about 100 years.  They made colorful quilts and textiles that have been recovered from their ancient site.  The Inca discovered a way to keep records by using quipas, which were knotted strings that could be read.  The Inca were a well adapted culture that thrived in the fourteen and fifteen hundreds.       The Puebloans were a culture known for their crafting and weaving.  The lived in houses called Pit houses which were dug about 3-4 feet into the ground.  The Pit houses had a fire pit, a supported roof, and storage bins.  The Puebloans also had a church called a kiva.  the kiva was where they prayed and had gatherings. This prosperous civilization lived many great years in the Mas Verde.        The underwater city was found by archeologists of the coast of Greece.  They found underwater buildings from about 5,000 years ago.  This settlement has 9,00 feet of buildings and other structures.  The archeologists are continuing to discover what in the underground city.

Ancient Inca are one of these ancient civilizations. Ancestral Puebloans are also one of these. Last but not least the lost Greek city.                           The ancient Inca have been around for hundreds of years. They are from the country we know as Peru. Most of our knowledge of the Inca comes from artifacts. pottery made from stone gold or silver. Some have been barred for hundreds of years. Some artifacts turn up in ruins of old buildings. Some are preserved by sand or high in the mountains. Spaniards murder the last Inca king in 1532 which led to the fall of the empire.                                                 Ancestral Puebloans also know as Anasazi (the ancient ones). They were also know as the basket makes because of their talent to make pottery. They lived in houses called pit-houses. They learned to make pottery and aquired the bow. They lived in pit houses for about 200 years. Then they built houses with upright walls one right aginst another. Just like today houses which is how all homes are made. The cave dwellers built there houses under over hangs.                              The lost greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth. A diver explores the sunken settlements beneth the waters off southern greece. This city may have inspired Atlantis. The dates date back 5,000 years ago. it is the oldest submerged town in the world. The sight covers 30,000 square meters. Rock cut tombs with thousands of shards of pottery.

Very few people wake up in the morning and think to themselves, 'I'm going to find out how people lived thousands of years ago!'  Yet, some people do, and (God knows it) those people know what they are doing.  However, you might not necessarily know what they're up to.  Archeologists are people that discover and study artifacts from long ago civilizations, people, and animals.  Now, when you hear this, you may think, 'Hey!  Indiana Jones does that!'  Well, no.  Although the main idea of finding artifacts is directly related in Indiana's adventures, most archeologists don't have daily gun battles, and usually they don't try to chase a military convoy to find the holy grail, or whatever.  What they do usually do is study ancient relics...like those of the Incas, Pueblo Native Americans, or maybe even Greek items!  For instance, they might find out things like this!              For about one hundred years, (1440-1535) Inca people ruled over the land of South America.  They couldn't write, so archaeologists didn't know what to expect when they found colored knots in string!  As it turns out, that was a form of counting livestock and other things way back when.  And that's not all that was left behind for us to find!  They also had religious art, and other buildings and items that showed us how they lived, worked and ate.  However, not everything that we know about them was dug up from the dirt.              Some of what we know about incant people was passed down straight from the horse's mouth...or really...their descendants mouths.  Some stories tell about how people from Europe landed in their settlements in about 1532, and about how they came into the new world.  Archeologists can find evidence that parallels these stories in tombs and other buildings in the ruins.  Unfortunate as it may be, looters have robbed many of these grounds.  That is one thing that Indiana Jones has in common with real archeologists: they both scare off looters!  Much more is left to be found about this culture...and as always, we'll have archeologists working on it.  However, there are also other cultures that archeoligists comb in search of treausre.                Native American people used to live in the southwestern United States...and now all that's left of them is their cities of stone.  These people were called the Pueblo Indians, and they lived in many kinds of houses.  Sometimes, they dug huts out of the clay, and other times, they built cities into the sides of mountains.  This gave them the name: Cliff Dwellers.  However, after about 100 years of living in their cliffs, they, for some reason, migrated out of the area, and assimilated with other tribes in the nearby area.  These people are very mysterious...which is the complete opposite of our next specimen.                 Much of Greek culture is pretty well known: for heaven's sakes, a couple book series have been writen about it!  However, archeologists have still been uncovering some of their secrets.  For instance, off the coast of Greece lies a city...under the water!  This is a classic example of archeoligsts finding a hidden site full of relics!  many buildings and ceramic jars were found...which dated back to over five thousand years ago!  This is a huge find...but only one of many.                  People have, since the beginning of time, searched for answers to things that they didn't know.

They have found ancient cities that belonged to the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri that were in places they have never imagined.           In the great Andes, the Inca population once lived and had a great city. Today, there are still great artifacts of the past that archeologists have found. Some of the artifacts you can find includes objects made out of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. There are some found even on Peru's coasts.           Another city is Mesa Verde in A.D. 550 and was home to people known as Puebloans. They are also classified as Basketmakers from their crafting skills. As they gained more population the quality in baskets declined and pottery was used then. They had migrated into the caves of Mesa Verde and lived there for less than 100 years.           In great Greece there once was a city called Atlantis and was home to the Pavlopetri. The city now is underwater but once was thought to be above sea level. 'It remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC.' said Dr Jon Henderson. It was the first time an underwater city was discovered in Greece. But once it was a very massive and planned out city and now a sunken tresure.

It can be very important to us because we can learn from our past and it can help us in our futture. We can learn form outr past for example the archiologists found many artifact that were left behind before the citites were destrored. For example front he Incas, The Puebloans, and the Palvopetri.                    These cities were very old. They are older than 5,000 years ago. They are found all over the world. They are very important to our society because we can see how our ancestors lived and how their culuture was before. We can also learn many things that we dont know from them. One of the citites were even foung=d at the bottom of the sea and they have different knids of myths.                     These cities are very important to us because they help us learn about the past.   They also helpn us learn how opur ancestors were and thei differnet cultures. this is why theses cities are important.

These civilizations have given valuable information and clues to archaeologists who want to discover why the civilizations collapsed. These dicoveries are so important because they help many people know more about the past. If we know more about the past then we'll be ableto understand better how things are to this day. Although some civilizations remain a mystery on why the disappeared, much information has been discovered due to the artifacts found and where the people settled. Ancient civilizations help people understand how cities worked in the past.         To begin with, the discovery of the Incas civilization was imporant since it let archaelogists take a step forward to know more about the past. The Incas, for example, lived on the Andes. Since they lived in the Andes, archaeologists were able to realize that the Incas were preservers. They were preservers since they buried their dead in the caves that were in the Andes. Once those bodies were uncovered, scientists were able to find out that person's cause of death with the technology these days. The importance of finding the cause of death was that with that information, people were able to know how people died in the Inca civilizations whether it was sickness or natural death.         Secondly, we're able to know more about the past and how it works because of the discovery of the Pueblanos. The Pueblanos built pithouses and the importance of this is that archaeologists were able to find out how the architecture was in the past during the time of the Pueblanos. Since the Pueblanos advanced in pottery, archaeologists were able to find that the pueblanos were skilled craftsmen. The pueblanos built kivas which very uncomfortable in the winter. Because of this, archaeologists can conclude that the wethaer must have been harsh in the past. Also, archaeologists have the ability to say that the wether must have been an important component when it came to growing crops.         Finally, the discovery of the Pavlopetri civilization also contributed to learning more about the past. Geological events might have (earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.) sunk the civilization. The importance of this was that the land and its geographical features must have been affected by the movements the earth. Archaeologists were able to learn that the people of the Pavlopetri civilization must have been skilled architects since mainstreets, courtyards, religious structures, and buildings were uncovered. They must have been skilled craftsmen just like the Pueblanos since thousands of pieces of pottery was found all over ther seabed of the location where the Pavlopetri civilization was found.         In conclusion, all these civilization discoveries added to knowledge we have of the past. The more we knoe fromthe past, the more we will be able to understand why things are the way they are today. Many more civilizations are yet to be discovered. It is important to know that without these civilizations, the world will continue being a mystery. Some people forget about the civilizations or say they aren't important but little do they know that the information archaeologists find out about the past civilizations could some how be traced to those people. Without these discoveries, the world would still be wondering how they got to the place they are today.

These new discoveries will lead us to learn more about their culture and way of life. I believe these discoveries can make a lot of changes in our life.   Since the archaeologists and other explorers have been investigating more on past life, we got to learn more and more about our ancestors and how they used to live. These discoveries have also changed some of our knowledge.        How would we know about a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a South American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome? All of the clues left behind by the Inca's have been retrieved by explorers and they have examined it very clearly. The archaeologists and other explorers have put together details of Inca life. The clues left behind can also tell you about what happened to the empire or what what happened to the place that was here thousands, or even millions of years ago. If we had not discovered these clues and had not examined these clues they would still be buried down under, without us knowing anything about it.        We wouldn't even know what happened to the Puebloans and what was their secret to surviving those years were. If our explorers hadn't preceded with their exploring we wouldn't have found the Lost Greek City. Nobody even knew that there was a Greek City under the ocean, before this.         So now you know why discovering all these clues were important and also why these places and people were important.

If they made a mistake making somthing or the empire fell because they did somthing we know not to do that. History is important to learn about because you discover other people and things as well as yourself.       Another important reason is so that these places and artifacts don't just sit there and rot. it is important we uncover them because somthing important or valubale could be inside.       Overall it is important to didcover history from all culters and places. Everyones past is different which means a new discovery for each one.

Seeing that they had no form or writing they had no writen history for historians to study. Instead of having writing though they had a made a system of knots on colored strings called quipus to record their calander and to record the numbers of livestock they had. Europeans who met the Inca were amazed by the huge empire that they managed to run with only knots and strings. Even though Archeologists have found numerous quipus no onw knows how to interpret them correctly. Not knowing how to read the quipus makes understanding the Inca almost impossible.            Most of what we know about the inca is from oral history (the act of handing down history from generation to generation though spoken word). This is mostly unreliable seeing that the Inca liked folklore and legends instead of factual history.            Some stories are known by the Europeans who had arrived there and had written down some of their oral history. Most is not very reliable because the Spaniards did not speak the Inca language very well and may not have understood the inca very well. Their discription of the Inca could have been very accurate.            The rest of the information about the Incas that we know comes from objects left behind, or artifacts. Also the places where they were found. Most Inca artifacts inclide stone, pottery, gold, and silver. All of these materials stand up to weather and do not deterate easily, even after hundreds of years. Some objects are found buried in graves and others found in ancient buildings.            Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters looking for anything to sell. Looting has been going on for centuries aned is strill going on today. The sites that have been robbed often have little to no value to Archeologists.            The people who study these sites keep very accurate records. They write down and take pictures of any artifacts they find and mark the exact position that they found them. So they can get as much information from the artifacts as possible.            One of the most important things to learn from the Inca are how they started and how they ended. The beigenning of the Inca is hard to date, where they once lived is now inhabitted by other peoples. It is much easier to tell when they ended, because the lsat Inca king was killed by a Spaniard and taken over by him. That led to the fall of the whole empire.

The Inca's lifestyle has a very bit impact on how we live today. Historians have discovered the way of Inca's lives through their artwork. The Inca were very artsy people, their alphabet consisted of tying strings in a special pattern. Discovering the Inca's techinques are very important because we get to adapt to their religion and we get to study it too. One religion that we have today has the same worshipping technique as the Inca's. They worship at high mountain tops. Also, the Inca were good climbers, that is possibly how we got the idea of rock climbing. Source #1 (Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past') talks about the Inca's ways of life.       The Puebloan's lifestyle is different then the Inca's, but it is still important to us too. Our house designs may have came from the Puebloans house design called the Pithouse. We have adapted to their church designs, except we changed the design a little. The camping technique where you cook food over a fire, may have originated from the Puebloans idea of fires to cook food. Cowboys were the first people to report the cliff dwellers in the 1800s, giving archeologists hope on discovering their techniques. Source #2 ('Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World') talks about the Puebloans way of life.       The Pavlopetri's living is still different from ours, but probably the closests out of all of the three. We have taken some of their techniques, changed them a little, and made them ours. We have taken some of their pottery shards and discovered them to help us create pots. Their idea of buildings were taken as well, and if you look at a city, you will see tons of buildings. The fable of Atlantis created a story (we created it) but without the artifacts, that really popular and well known story wouldn't have existed. Source #3 ('Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets) talks about the Pavlopetri's lifes.       I think that if we hadn't found the Inca, Puebloans, or the Pavlopetri, our lives would be very affected and different.

They are some of the coolest to know a bought because they were some of the hardest to understand.                The Inca were hard to understand because they were high in the mountains and had no form of alphabet. Insted they used knots and string to keep records. The good thing about the Inca is how they could run huge impires and how they could cannect huge mountains with rope bridges.     The Puebloans weren't as hard to understand because they had a way if they wernt as hard to reach. Plus were not washed away and they were in rows and in great numbers. There houses and weapons were the most advanced at the time becaus they had the bow and they were starting to builed hoses of stone insted of pit houses. They also were advanst in hunting and fishing.       The Pavlopetri were also known as the Cliff Dwellers they were first discovered by the cowboys. They built large houses inside of cliffs they were hard to understand becaus they left. Archeologist do not know why they left becaus they left evry thing. they left pots and just every thing that is whoy they are hard to understand.    That is why these are sme of the most interesting anchet civilizations I thank. the Inca. Puebloans, and Pavlopetri.

Inca artifacts were made of stones, gold or silver. Inca textiles were left in dry deserts or cold mountains to preserve them. This is important to us because it teaches us what other religions are like. It also teaches us that we can preserve our clothes by leaving them in dry or cold places.       We learned that the Puebloans made baskets, pithouses, and kivas. This is important because the pithouses kept people safe and it could help use think of ideas to make houses of our own. Kivas were important because they had a ventilator, bench air deflector, and a fire-pit. It taught us how to  make a house for small gatherings.       We discovered that the Pavlopetri had been consumed by the sea at 1000 BC. We also learned that the lost Greek city had a lot of buildings. The cause of the city to sink was a earthquake or tsunami. This is important because where we live could be consumed by the sea. This is also ompotant because earthquakes and tsunamis can cause a lot of problems in the world.

And when people wanted food, they had to go and work for it. Back then, you couldn't just slouch on the couch, pick up the phone and order any kind of food you want. Now, you may not think that the olden days were important, but without them, the world would be entirely different today.           In the 1500s, there lived an aspiring empire that led on to become of the strongest and largest economies of the time. They were called the Inca Empire. The Inca Empire never had an alphabet or system of writing. They used knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar and keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet them were astonished on how they could run their economy on just strings. The empire has given many people may challenges of uncovering the mystery of the Inca Empire. The Inca has passed down many stories and legends to the modern day world. The Inca was known for their pottery or handwork and crafts such as gold, stone or silver, and these have helped archaeologists find out more about the Incas.           Another empire that also has influenced us in may ways is the Puebloans. These people built their empire on what they called the Mesa Verde about A.D. 550 they are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft.They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts rank among the finest expressions of human culture in North America. Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about A.D. 1300 Mesa Verde was deserted. No one really knows why but maybe they were just looking for a new beginning.           Also, another empire that affected us in may was today were the Pavlopetri people. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths -- the fable of Atlantis -- have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece. Explored by and Anglo-Greek team of aarchaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say. 'it has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. These are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why it is unique,' says Dr. Jon Henderson, associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham. What archaeologists found exceeded all expectations, thanks to shifting sand and the settlements enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.           Do you now see how important the old civilizations were? Because if you don't, you need to go learn some more about it, because it truly is fascinating. And even though you can never go back and discover the world back then, you can always learn more about it. Except instead of going online to look for clues, facts and answers that might not even be true, go to the library and check out a book. Reading a book is a good way to exercise your brain. Now, you may not think that the olden days were important, but without them, the world would be entirely different today.

Here it goes. The ancient Inca of Peru, The Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde, and last but not least the well known fable of Atlantis. These three civilizations have a lot in common, such as how their artifacts and living areas were used to help archaeologists learn more about them.   Lets start with Inca. According to Source #1, the Inca had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Instead, they made knots in colored strings known as quipus were used to record the calendar and keep count of their livestock. The problem here is that no one knew how to read them. So, they also used some of the Inca artifacts and other things that some Incas may have used. One by one, they pieced together the extraordinary details of Inca life. The archaeologists keep records of the sites that they study and visit so they can learn as much information as they possible can. Though the Incas steps were difficult to trace, due to their area being lived in by others, archaeologists are careful to make sure which people build each site. Incas lives high in the Andes mountains and worshiped mountain peaks. Archaeologists found it quite difficult to study the Inca due to their choice of living. This has become worth the sweat since the bodies found helped reveal information of how the Inca lived and survived using modern medical scanning.   Lets go ahead and move onto the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde holds a massive amount of ancient culture that has been left behind. The first Ancestral Puebloans settles in Mesa Verde around A.D. 500. They are also known as Basketmakers at the time due to them being so skilled in crafting them. They made pithouses to live in that would be clustered into small villages built on mesa tops or in cliff recesses. Their population multiplied, talk about prosperous times. In A.D. 1000, they had advanced from pithouses to kivas. They made kivas by building them beneath overhanging cliffs. The construction material consists of sandstone that has been shaped into blocks, the mortar used to stick the blocks together was a mixture of mud and water. Unoccupied rooms in the back or on upper levels were used for storing their crops.   People often think of Atlantis as one of the 'world's most enduring myths'. Well an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists are about to prove that it is not just a myth. The settlement goes way back 5,000 years. The sunken world has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before classic Greece came into play. The site being studied is about 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese. They found ceramics that were back to the end of the stone age. They revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings.   So before you think that ancient civilizations are just a big myth, think again. There is much more to these spectacular days back in time. You may be surprised of what you find.

In the artical about alantis i would love to go and explore that place i would not stop tilli could figure out what the engravements are i woul be going to all of the other old places and reacserch that till i could figure out what it saus.       the message in the lost city could tell you about what could be happing in the feature and could explain the earthquqkes in the other contries or even if the rock is alantis or if there is even such a place it could tella lot. just like in the tombs of the other things that are going to be discorverse. so yes i do think that the stuff that  has been found has a lot of value and is very useful.

Many different people, from many different places, did and discovered many different things. The Inca's, the Puebloans, and the Palvlopetri are just three of the many out there.         The Inca's, 'Unlocked the secrets of the past.' The Inca's were found to form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. This was a typical day of an Inca life. We find all these clues from either, clues they leave behind, or oral history, being passed on from generation to generation. Therefore, I stick with my statement, that the history of the Inca's were important to today's life.        The Puebloans had their own world. They made crafts like baskets and were known as Basket makers. Farming replaced hunting and gathering because they wanted to live more of a nomadic life style. The Puebloans were a main part in history in Mesa Verde because they were the ones that began building houses above ground, making pottery, weaving baskets, farming, and making other tools with what they had. Say the Puebloans had never been around. Mesa Verde today would not be the same. Everyone in the past, has some kind of impact on the future. My generation today will affect what happens in the future. Just like every other one.        The Palvlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. This was no doubt, the oldest submerged town in the world that was so unique. They discovered that the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. If we didn't have the technology we have today we would not be able to do everything that we do. People in the past affected how we come up with tools like them. They inspired us from what they had, to give us an idea.       As you can now see, the Inca's, the Puebloans, and the Palvlopetri are three kinds of people that had an effect on where ever they were located. They have their own special way of putting it out there for us to find it.

We have learned so many important things about the ancient Inca of Peru, like the fact that they don't have a formal alphabet or system of writing; Instead of having an archive to keep records in, they put knots in strings to keep tract of the livestock. Even though we still don't know what the knots mean, the archaeologists are still discovering more and more each day.         Other civilizations have been found as well, like the Puebloans. We have learned about many of their ways of life, like the expertly made baskets that have been found on their land. We now know that the Puebloans made pit houses that they lived in on top of mesas. These people, as archaeologists have discovered, were pretty modern in their way of living when it came to hunting for their next meal. By using a bow and arrow, they could be much more efficient than with the spear throwing.         One of the most intriguing stories ever to be proven true, Atlantis, at least that is what they thought they were seeing when they came across the long ago sunken settlement of the Pavlopetri. Aarchaeologists have slowly put together the pieces of this massive puzzle, and by massive, I mean 30,000 sq. meters of the ocean floor! We have been able to find in this huge city: main streets, courtyards, tombs of rock, and pottery covering the ocean floor.         Even now we still have about 99% of the ocean floors left to discover. Who knows, we might even find the real myth of Atlantis, thanks to these ancient civilizations!

People thought that the Incas were more than history people thought they were legends. although people like treasure hunters have been destroying the Inca's anctient grounds. Archaeologists say that it is easy to put a date in which the Inca's have died because the Spaniards murdered(killed) the last Incas king(leader). The artifacts that the Inca's left behind were from diffrent sites just like in other ancient civilizations.

The Ancient Inca of Peru had no formal way of writing so the archaeologist had to do a bunch of research. They have found that that the people way back then had made knots in colored strings to keep track of their livestock. No one knows how to read the knots or how they are arranged.       Some of what people know about Inca come from oral history or stories passed from generation to generation. Some of what might be true or false we will never know exactly. Another way we are finding out things are archaeologists digging up things from the ground and keeping records of everything they have found.       Religion is one of the things they have discovered. The Inca lived high in the Andes and might have worshiped some mountain peaks. Some of Inca is buried in caves and cliff faces. Where Inca is many of different people have lived. Inca was a country ruled by a king. He was murdered in 1532 and was the last king they had.

Many archaeologists found old ways of living and communicating in each civilization. Although not everything was able to be uncovered within each expedition, many new discoveries were made of each of the civilizations.             The ancient Inca civilization of Peru was very powerful and unique.    The ruled for nearly one hundred years and had an interesting way of communication, or lack there of. In an excerpt form 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past,' by Beth Gruber, we learn quickly that 'The ancient Inca of Peru had Jo formal alphabet or system of writing.' Instead they had what is called a quipus, '... the Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock.' Although we know what they keep a record of, no one is can actually decipher the code these stories and calendars. The Inca civilization was located in the Andes mountains, which made getting to the artifacts difficult. In the end it payed off because 'The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the Andes are in such good shape that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died.' This helps us to see how the ancient Inca civilization came to an end, and helped us to  see how a bit of how life was when they ruled.             We see more interesting and important history within 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World.' This article goes just a bit back before the Europeans explored America, well maybe a little more than a bit. It was actually approximately 1,400 years before that, when '...people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. for more than 700 years their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities...' The article goes on to mainly explain the different types of buildings that were in Mesa Verde. One of these was called a pithouse, and 'People lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D 750... The pithouse featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground.' They go into deeper detail and even have an illustration of a pithouse, but they also found and described a Kiva. 'Kiva is a Hopi word for ceremonial room---here underground chambers comparable to later churches. Based on modern Pueblo practice, Ancestral Puebloans may have used kivas for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop.' The Puebloans built amazing structures and left a lasting impact on America, in fact '...dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there.'             Lastly, an article of a lost Greek city named Pavlopetri discusses how it may have impacted another popular sunken city. The article 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets,' by Helena Smith submerges themselves in facts, and water. They take divers down deep to uncover '...the oldest submerged town in the world... It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece.' But not only was it a submerged city,  it was a historical gold mine, for artifacts that is. 'We found ceramics dating back to the end of the Stone Age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than what we originally thought... Our investigations also revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings.' Although, 'Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.' Thus was a huge discovery, but we must be reminded that 'Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found.'             To sum everything up, we have had some amazing finds that helped us understand life long ago. The ancient Inca got by without any formal communication and their bodies were preserved, allowing us to understand their downfall. The Puebloans created many buildings that are remarkably similar to those we have today. The lost city of Pavlopetri shows us that although we have discovered great things, there are so many more to find. Each of these discoveries is incredibly unique and helpful to our knowledge of ancient history today.

The Inca relied heavily on farming, as we do today. The also made jewelry that might have decided what kind of jewelry and style we use today. The empire flourished and helped to decide what our lifestyle is today.       Mesa Verde is an anchient city that, despite living in mountains, did very well. They might have taught us how to live in the mountains. Also how to survive with primitive things. They taught us how to live in caves. The mountains are hard to live in but they did it.       The lost Greek city might clear up some things about Atlantis and how people think that it is still down there. Also we might learn things about Greek history and how they lived before they flourished. Also we might learn how the weather was like back then and if it has changed between now nad then. There had to be some extreme weather to take down an entire city. So we could learn about that.

Without these discoveries, we might have never figured out what happened to these great civilizations. All three of these societies have rich histroy, and are a very valuable resource for further knowledge.       The Inca lived high on the Andes mountain range in what is Peru today. They worshipped many gods, and to appease the gods, they would make sacrifices to them. Europeans, mostly Spanish soldiers and priests, come to teach Christianity, arrived in 1532. They documented the people's lives in journals and diaries. But, since the Spaniards didn't understand the Incan language very well, the descriptions might not be accurate, which will lead to misconceptions about the Incan people. The mountains are so cold in the Andes that Incans who died had their bodies almost perfectly preserved. Scientists can use modern medical scanning equipment to find how they had gotten there and why.       The Puebloans were a very interesting society. Like the Inca, they worshipped their own gods, but did not sacrifice to them. The Puebloans first built homes, called pithouses, in the desert. These were indents in the ground that were covered with animal pelts and supported by wooden rods from the inside. They were hunters and gathers, both stalking prey and farming. Around A.D. 750, they began to build houses above ground, called pueblos, with mud walls and wood supports. Most of there food was now coming from agriculture, and most mesa land was cleared for farming. These people had places of worship called Kivas.Kivas were dug out of the ground and used for ceremonial purposes. Around A.D. 1300, the cliff dwellers and the Puebloans moved from their dwellings in the desert to someplace else. The reason is unknown why they made this move.       Off the coast of Greece, there is what some might call an 'Atlantis'. This sunken city was discovered and excavated by a group of Anglo-Greek archaeologists. Since the sand and the water have somewhat preserved the stone buildings, this city is truly a arcaeological wonder. Pieces and shards of pottery lay in the sand. The archaeologists even confirmed the site of a megaron, which is a building the elite used, and that raised this sites popularity by     	DT NNS IN DT NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP VBP DT RB JJ NN TO DT JJ NNP NNP DT NNS , PRP MD VB RB VBN RP WP VBN TO DT JJ NNP NNP CD IN DT NNS VBP JJ NN , CC VBP DT RB JJ NN IN JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD JJ IN DT NNP NN NN IN WP VBZ NNP NNP NNP VBD JJ NNS , CC TO VB DT NNS , PRP MD VB NNS TO NNP NNPS , RB JJ NNS CC NNS , VBP TO VB NNP , VBD IN CD PRP VBD DT NNS POS NNS IN NNS CC NNP CC , IN DT NNS VBD RB VB DT NNP NN RB RB , DT NNS MD RB VB JJ , WDT MD VB TO NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNS VBP RB JJ IN DT NNP IN NNPS WP VBN VBD PRP$ NNS RB RB NNP NNPS MD VB JJ JJ NN NN TO VB WRB PRP VBD VBN RB CC NNP NNP NNP VBD DT RB JJ NNP NNP DT NNP , PRP VBD PRP$ JJ NNS , CC VBD RB NN TO NNP DT NNPS JJ NN NNS , VBN NNS , IN DT NNP NNP VBD NNS IN DT NN IN VBD VBN IN JJ NNS CC VBD IN NN NNS IN DT NNP NNP VBD NNS CC NNS , DT NN NN CC NNP NNP NNP CD , PRP VBD TO VB NNS IN NN , VBN NNS , IN NN NNS CC NN NNP NNP IN EX NN VBD RB VBG IN NN , CC JJS NN NN VBD VBN IN NNP NNP NNS VBD NNS IN NN VBN -NONE- VBD NN IN IN DT NN CC VBD IN JJ NNP NNP NNP CD , DT NN NNS CC DT NNPS VBD IN PRP$ NNS IN DT NN TO VB NNP NNP NN VBZ VBN WRB PRP VBD DT NNP NNP DT NN IN NNP , EX VBZ WP DT MD VB DT NNP NNP NN NN VBD VBN CC VBN IN DT NN IN JJ NNP NNP DT NN CC DT NN VBP RB VBN DT NN NNS , DT NN VBZ RB DT JJ NNP NNP CC NNS IN NN NN IN DT NNP NNP NNS RB VBN DT JJ IN DT NN , WDT VBZ DT NN DT NN VBD , CC IN VBN DT NNS NN IN	2		20131025111048	2338	2		20131025111045	2360	2

Some places that i'm going to talk about include The Inca's, Puebloans and finally Pavlopetri. Artifacts make visiting somwhere really fun because you can have fun while learning somthing.        The very first place im going to be talking about is The Inca's. The Inca's is a very old anciant civilization and has been around for more than a thousand years. One thing that you might not know about is that Inca had no formal alphabet or system of writing. I thought that was a very interesting fact. There were so many clues left behind by the Inca's like a amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agraculture, goverment, transportation, and way of life. By studying these clues archaeologists and others can piece together details of the Inca life. A good thing about finding and looking at artifacts is that we get knowledge and learn more about how that civilization lives and what life was like there. Inca artifacts are mostly made from Stone, Pottery, Gold, or Silver. What is amazing to me is that alot of those materials last a long time even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Some of the artifacts turn up in the ruins of buildings. Others are found in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.        Nextly, the civilization Puebloans is a 1,400 years old. Long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their decendents lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Mesa Verda National Park presereves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Many Arche9ologist have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes transalated as the ancient ones.        Lastly, In Pavlopetri im going to to be talking about under water artifacts. These are the most amazing things that anyone could have seen. These artifacts under water can be around for more than 5,000 years. When you find a artifact underwater keep it forever because those things can last forever untill the day you die. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WRB JJ PRP VBZ TO RB VBZ .

So many things that we have little information on, or don't even have a clue that they exist. If we could find everything and understand it, we would have very little issue s left because a lot of problems would be solved. But for now, we are just trying to work our way there.              Ill start off first by talking about the ancient civilization of Inca. The Inca people lived high in the Andes mountains. We know that the Inca civilization ruled South American empire for around 100 years because of clues that they left behind. We have found an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation and ways of life. The Inca had no formal alphabet but they used knots in strings to tell stories, track livestock, and tell the date. Some objects made from stone, pottery, gold or silver were also found, along with some textiles and items of clothing. To find out more about the civilization, high-altitude archaeologist traveled up into the mountains. They discovered many bodies that had been preserved on the mountain through ice. Some bodies were in such good shape that experts could use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died and how they lived while they were alive. It was relativity easy to date the fall of the Inca because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532.              Next  would like to talk about the Pavlopetri. The Pavlopetri lived in the sunken city of Atlantis. The city straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. Oceanographers dove down into the waters to explore this city. 'There is no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,' said Dr Jon Henderson. Thanks to the moving of the sand and shallow ocean waters searching the city was pretty easy. Their investigations revealed over 9,000 square meters of new building, streets, and town squares. Marine Geologist are yet to have found out why the settlement sank.              So many things out there are yet to be discovered. So many mysteries, discoveries to still make and questions that are still being asked. So many answers to so many issues. But the reality is, we have only discovered a tiny portion of what lies out there.

I am going to try to explain why they are and  I hope you agree.       I believe that they all helped develop what we have today. I think that they created a lot of things that we use now. We have made the calender from the Incas. We have made so many discoveries on how we run our society today.       I thank you for reading this, and I hope you agree.

About 500 A.D many Inca tribe members had to defend themselves in these situations. But many just observe the other tribes ways of doing. They observe their housing, artillery, food, members, land.

Hunting is another topic! Many tribes did not have enough weapons for actual hunting so they fished. Most fished in streams, ponds, and rivers. They would then take the game back to their small village and it was expected of them to bring enough for everyone, but to do that almost everyone would have to be out their participating. When the men and children returned the woman and elders were to clean, gut, cook, and serve the fish.   When hunting for deer or other animals in the wild the same rules applied. This is how hunting worked back then.       The last topic is farming, most Inca tribes planted vegetables or fruit mainly whatever would grow in the hot climate. They worked all day and when the big harvest came they needed everyones help. Farming is what kept them alive in winter when hunting was unable to be done due to hibernation.

The discoveries made about the Incas is important because it explains why South America is a Spanish continent instead of Incan. If we never discovered anything about them, we could have thought that the Spanish discovered South America and created countries there, but that isn't true. The Spaniards took over Incan civilization and murdered their king in 1532. The Spanish taught the Incas their language and converted them to their religion. Incan customs were wiped off the face of the earth in no time. If we never discovered any artifacts then we wouldn't know anything about them. Artifacts have helped us learn a lot about other civilizations from different times periods and without them we wouldn't know anything about the past.   The discoveries made about the Puebloans are also very important. The discoveries showed that there were other people living on American soil before Christopher Columbus, Native Americans, and the English got here. All of those people may think that they discovered this continent, but there were plenty of other people living here before they arrived. The discoveries made about the Puebloans also proved that peoples life centuries ago were not that different from ours today. Of course, we have plenty of new technology, but we still lived similar ways. The way they built their homes is very much like ours. If we didn't discover anything about the Puebloans we could be thinking falsely about who 'discovered' this land.   The discoveries made about the Pavlopetri is also very important. If we didn't discover anything about this city then we could be forgetting that there is millions of miles of oceans that are being ignored. The discovery of the Pavlopetri reminded us that that could be answers to our biggest questions about people before us just below the sea. If we never discovered the city, answers about the past could never be solved.

Like an underwater city untouched and perfectly preserved for almost 5,000 years, or or an entire empire keeping records with knots in strings.                    Let us begin with the Inca empire.  The Incas did not have an alphabet nor a system of writing therefore, there were no archives for historians to study.  They did however leave quipus.  These quipus were used from record the calender to keeping track of livestock.  Europeans who had met the Inca were amazed that such a powerful empire could keep records with knotted strings.  Even with many ancient quipus found by archaeology we still do not know what the knots actually mean.  Having these pieces of string does not help us piece together the whole story of the Ancient Inca.  The Incas ruled a South American empire for almost a hundred years.  It even rivaled the expansion of Rome!  There are few clues left behind but they do show amazing things about their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, and transportation.  In addition there are few stories passed down from the Incas.  These stories were written down by early Europeans.  The Spanish soldiers described the Inca in letters and diaries.  Although the Spaniards spoke some of the Incas language they did not speak it well.  Therefore historians must be careful when interpreting the Spaniards counts.  They may not have understood what they told hem so the descriptions might not be accurate(Also, many of the Incas stories were legends rather than history).  The Inca artifacts that were found were objects made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver.  These materials last a long time even if they have been in the ground for hundreds of years.  Many artifacts are found either in ruins of buildings or in graves for the dead to use in the afterlife.  things like cloth are easily damaged by dampness but, with the dryness of Peru's deserts and the cold of the Andes mountains, cloth textiles were kept almost perfectly preserved and in tact.  Like other ancient ruins they attract treasure hunters and looters looking for anything that may be of value.  Some treasures were taken centuries ago but, looting still continues today.  Many sites that have been newly discovered are reported to archaeologists to try and get artifacts before looters discover it.  The archaeologists keep careful records. they photograph, and even write down the exact position the artifact was in when they found it.  They will then compare what they found with the Spaniards records and sometimes confirms a historical record.  Even with all these clues a big question still remains; Where did this civilization come from, and what happened to it?  The fall of the Inca is easily dated because the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532, however the origin of the Inca is difficult to trace.  Archaeologists studying the sites have to be careful to make sure they know exactly which people built which site. Aerial photography helps them find patterns in monuments they cannot see from the ground.  Even with all this information we are still unable to determine a straight forward explanation of the Inca.                  The Puebloans turn,  The first ancestral Puebloans called Mesa Verde their home.  Their decedents lived and flourished there for almost 700 years.  They eventually built elaborate stone communities and sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls.  But, with the expansion of one or two generations they moved away in the late A.D. 1200s.  Now, the Mesa Verde National Park preserves the spectacular reminder of their ancient culture.  Originally archaeologists called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word translated to mean either 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies'.  They are now called the Ancestral Puebloans.  They originally settled in Mesa Verde (Green table in Spanish) around A.D. 550.  They are known as Basketmakers for their skill at the craft.  They were originally a nomadic people and were beginning to lead a more settled life.  they replaced hunting and gathering with farming.  They resided in pithouses grouped into small villages and usually built on mesa tops but occasionally in cliff recesses.  they learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient way of hunting than atlatl(a spear thrower).   They had prosperous times and their population soon multiplied and began building houses above ground in about A.D. 750.  These houses were built using poles and mud for upright walls .  From here the people are known as Puebloans (meaning village dwellers). The people of Mesa Verde advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.  This advancement was made around A.D. 1000.  double-coursed stone rose an average of two to three stories high and were units of 50 rooms or more.  their pottery had also changed from a dull gray background with a simple design to black drawings on a white background.  Between the years of A.D.1100 and A.D. 1300 the population is believed to have reached several thousand.  Their stone walls are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde with straight courses and carefully shaped stones.  their baskets however, declined dramatically in quality possibly due to the introduction of pottery which meant less attention to the craft.  In about A.D. 1200 a major population shift was seen when people started moving back into cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors.  No one is quite sure of why they moved but it is thought that it may have been for religious or psychological reasons; Or maybe even because the caves offered better protection from the elements.

Archeoogist try to understand as much as they can about these cultures but sometimes it is hard.       Archaologists face many difficulties when it came to uncovering the anciet civilization. Sometime treasure hunters who take pieces that will help understand the anciet civilizatons. Archaologist take extra measures to make sure they don't lose ant artifacts or forget where they are.

There is only so much that we know about the Incan, Puebloans and the Pavlopetri. Their artifacts have tought us a lot.       The discovries that people have made about the anicent people are very important. The incans didnt have a formal alphabet, they made knots in string. But no on enow knows what it means. The Eurpeans were the first to meet the Incans and were amzed how much they were advanved in technology. Most incan history comes from oral history or stoies that we have leanred about the people. Only some stories have beem written down. Also many sites where the incan have lived have been looted for their treasures making i thard for us to learn about them. Archeaologits dont much about the history about these amazing people, but most of what we do know comes for the artifacts that we have found. Such as some of the clothing that has able able to be preserved thanks to the mountan peaks of the Andes. Or the sites that might have been untouched because looters couldn't get to them.       Learning about the Mesa Verde has been imporant for us, they were some of the first people to use natural landmarks has shelters. The y had abput 150 houses being bui;t above ground. They were also very skilled basketweavers, as well of measony. they used walls of think, double coursed stone to build their houses two or three stories high. Some buildings have had more than fifty units attached to them. There were more than one kind of people in the Mesa Varde, there were also cave dwellers, people that used natural caves as places to live. They used sandstone to walls using a mixture of mud and water to hold tings together. Archaelolgists have leanrned a lot about how these people lived and how they survied for thousands of years with not a lot of things. The discovery of their artifacts have teached us a lot, like how they bulit their houses, how the made their money, how they were able to surive by growing their own food, and how and why they might have all left the place they lived in and just disappeared.       The lost city of Antanlis is on e of the best discovries that archeaologits have made. They  have been able to use modern technology to discover what lies beneath the ocen floor. Most of the ocean floor around the discpvery is filled with pottery that has ended up there due to sand shifting. Alothough areeaologists dont know exactly why the settlemtn has suken they are trying to figure it out. Even thpugh most of the ity is under water we have stll been able to find artifacts that prove they the city wqas before the glory days that Greece had. New investigations have shown that over 9,000 meters of new buildin g hvae been discovered. One building suggested that the town had been used by an elite and automatically raied the staus of the settlement.  Not much is known about the whole settlement, but what we do know helps us figure out what is was like for the anicent people to be  living during these times.  Some archeaologists thnk that the town was submered by water due to sea level changed, ground settlement as result of earthquakes or even a Tsunami. Town around the submerged city are exicted to be learning sbouyt the new city that people are findin g out more about. The few artifcts that archeaologits have found show a lot about what has happned to the city and its people.       In concusion, the artifacts that archeaoloits are fiding are an important part of the worlds history and that people should keep looking for them so we can find out more of our history.

There are so many ways that people of the past have changed the way we live.            Why are the discoveries that have been made and found about the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri so important? Scientists and Historians have traveled and searched for so many years looking for old artifacts or information about the tribes before. Some parts of these things help us understand the reason why we live like we do now. One way that still is unknown is how did the ancient Inca of Peru understand without no formal alphabet or system of writing? They did not leave archives for historians to study. Inca's made knots in colored strings called quipus, that was the way they kept record of the calendar to keep count of live stock. No one has cracked the code, yet. How do we know about a civilization that for a hundred years ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome? There have been thousands of clues left behind from art, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. Studying and understanding these clues have helped archaeologists and others to find details of the Inca life. Maybe from the way they lived we have copied some of there actions.            People have spread so many rumors about the past that the only way to believe them is with proof. That's why thousands of historians go search for facts of past times. Once a diver explored the sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. Can you believe it? A whole town used to be where a lake is now? People say  that the Atlantis myth is started from the Lost Greek city underwater. Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. The undersea city was found close by Neapolis. Some of the Inca clothing has also survived which could help us make new fabric and advance in that area. Many 'pit houses' have been found. People lived in pit houses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, as settled agriculture began. A pit house shape is basically a tent. Maybe the inventor for a tent got the idea from pit houses? There was also a structure called a Kiva. A kiva was a Hopi word for Ceremonial room. Here underground chambers comparabled to later churches. Based on modern Pueblo practice, Ancestral Puebloans may have used Kiva's for healing rites or to pray for rain, luck in hunting, or a good crop.            Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery.            Most Ancestral Puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted. Several theories offer reasons for their migration. We know that the last quarter of the A.D. 1200s saw drought and crop failures, but these people had survived earlier droughts. Maybe after 100 of years of intensive use the land its resources were depleted.            Some inca textiles and clothing have also survived remarkably well. Ancient materials like cloth are usally destroyed by dampness, but these have been reserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes.            So basically to sum everything up, We have advanced and learned so much off of tribes and how the tribes survived in the base.

We know a lot about them today from letters, journals, and artifacts we find. It lets us know about how other people lived.       The Inca had no form of alphabet, they made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. With these clues, archaeologists can piece together details of Inca life. We know a lot about the Inca from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation. Some of the old stories we know of were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. A lot of our knowledge we know about the Inca comes from artifacts, or objects that they left behind, and from the sites where artifacts are found. Such materials like stone, pottery, gold, or silver last a long time, even if they have been buried for hundreds of years. Some Inca clothing have also survived that were preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes. It helps that Archaeologists who study these sites keep careful records. They write down and photograph and artifacts they find, and not the exact position in which they find them so we can get as much information as we can. The Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire which makes the fall of Inca easy to date. We know that some Inca lived in the mountains because bodies were found in the icy Andes. The bodies also revealed information about how they lived.       We know about the Puebloans from Mesa Verde National Park. Puebloans lived in Pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They began making houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud. Puebloan baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possible because widespread use of pottery meant less attention the the craft. Archeologists have sought to understand the cliff dwellers lives. They never left written records and much that was important in there lives so we will never know the whole story. The structures are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. When the cliff dwellers  left Mesa Verde, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there.                                                                            Today we study Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years ago. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. The site is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. The settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago due to the ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. An investigation revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings. The world's oldest submerged city shows how people lived at the time is also of great interest to natural scientists because the waters around it are so shallow.

The Puealoan civiliation originated from Meas Verde (Table Green). They were known as basketmakers for their very skilled at craft.Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their as there main livehood.they started to build houses by A.D 750 and there populaion expanded.They had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry.

They have made many significants to our society.            The Incas of Peru had no alphabet or any kind of system writing. The Incas would make knots in colored strings to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock which were called quipus. The Inca civilization lasted for nearly a hundred years which was for 1438 to 1532 they ruled a South American empire that fought against the expansion of ancient Rome. The clues left behind by the Incas was a portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture,government, transportation,and the way they lived throughout their lives. The Inca civilization was an oral history and was passed down by many generations to other generations. many Incas were described in many letters and diaries. Many Incas artifacts were made from stone, pottery,gold, or silver. Many artifacts found by the aerologists were mostly weather damaged.             The Puebloans were also significant to our society to this day. The Puebloens lived in this civilization for about 700 years ago before the Europeans went to go explore the Northern side. The First Ancestral Puebloens lived in Mesa Verde in A.D. 550. They were most significant for being known as basket makers. They lived in pithouses that were stuck into small villages built be mesa tops or cliff recesses. To make their resources they used a bow and arrow, and a spear thrower. The Pueoloens stepped up from a pole-and-adobe coursed stone to building two or three story high houses of 50 rooms or more.              The Pavopertic was known as the sunken settlement which dated back 5,000 years back. Because of shifting sands and settlements enclosure it revealed a world of buildings, courthouses, mainstreets,rock-cut tombs and religious structures. The seabed was changed with thousands figures of pottery. Many of the Pavopertic civilization artifacts were found under water and was known as the sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. Theories have said that the settlement sank was because the sea levels have changed, ground subsidence to the result of earthquakes or tsunamis.

The discoveries (Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri) are important because they give archeologists a chance to explore and see how others lived a long time ago.   Starting with the Inca of Peru, they were a difficult study. Historians could not really study them because they did not have a formal way of writing or a formal alphabet. However, they did make knotted colorful strings to keep records of their livestock.

We had a different perspective on how people from different countries used to live their lives.     We learned many new things from them. For example the Inca's did not have an alphabet or writing system; so they would make knots in colored strings to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The Inca's artifacts are usually made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. These materials were intended to last a long period of time.These artifacts are usually found in ruins of buildings, or buried with the dead for their supposed afterlife. Other stuff that also have been discovered is the textile and the clothing. The reason why they were not yet destroyed was because they were in the deserts or the mountains. Hunters that come across and Inca location take anything that might be valuable. Those sites that have been looted are not very good archaeological places. But thee one thing archaeologists do look for is where the civilization came from and what happened to it. Inca was destroyed when the Spanish killed the last Inca king in 1532. Inca's usually lived in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountains peaks. The first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde around A.D. 500. They had a very good still at crafting and were known as the Basketmakers.     All of these new cultures helped us become a better and more understanding.

There is so much we can learn by studying ancient cultures. We can learn things about the culture and human nature itself. We can see how we have evolved.      The ancient Incas for example had an advanced point of view. They lived up in the mountains and made art that could only be seen from high altitudes. They may have even worshiped the mountains as gods and wanted to please them. The people of the lost city of Atlantis were said to be extremely advanced as is shown in their architecture.      I believe that we enjoy learning about these people so we can compare our selves to them. We wish to think about how far humanity has come. We want to learn that we have come farther than such advanced civilizations so that we can call ourselves advanced. That is true human nature.

In this article, I will mainly be focusing on the Incas of South America, Mesa Verde in North America, and the city of Atlantis in Greece. Throughout the years, archaeologists have discovered artifacts and ancient realms, which brings a better understanding of the history spread throughout our world, over the past years.   The exploration of these three civilizations help archaeologists understand how the different cultures managed to live and carry out their lives. When the archaeologists were exploring the Incan civilization, they found a type of alphabet carried on through coloured strings with certain amounts of knots and other tied strings attached to them. This is signifacant because it helps archaeologists understand their system of communication and messaging systems much similar to the letters we send today.   During the discovery of Mesa Verde, the archaeologists discovered workings of the way houses were built and weapons made by the tribes that lived their at the time.   When the archaeologist were investigating ancient Greece and the myth of the city of Atlantis, the came across some helpful information. They discovered that there was in face a city down below the water and much of the remains were preserved. The Scientists came to a conclusion that earthquakes or tsunamis were a possible source for the reason the city was underwater.   As a whole, the discovery of ancient civilizations helped the idea of developement throughout the world and the thought of how these civilizations grew differently from each other.

But how do we learn what we know about the past ? Ancient Inca of Peru didn't have no writing technique or an alphabet. They didn't leave any tools or archives for historians to study . They made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of the calendar . Europeans were amazed with what Inca of Peru had came up with keeping count of livestock. Many historians find these quipus but none seems to know what the knots mean. Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery . Only way of actually understanding something was old stories by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.           How do we know about a civilization that for nearly a hundred years ruled a south America empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome ? Clues that were left behind formed a portrait of their religion , art ans architecture , agriculture, government , transportation , and the way to live.  Archaeologist haven't exactly found out everything but there getting there little by little they are putting pieces together. Some clothing ,Inca textiles are still there you would think they are destroyed but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's coasts or the cold mountains of the Andes .          In source 2 the first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde preserved a reminder of this ancient culture. They call it these people Anasazi ,from a Navajo word sometimes ,translated as 'the ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies', they are now called ancestral Puebloans . They lived in a pit houses . People lived in pit houses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 , as settled agriculture began.  This pit house included a living room sunk a few feet in the ground ,four corner timbers supported by the roof . The fire pit had and air deflector .An antechamber might contain storage bins or pits . These homes later evolved into kivas.They learned to make pottery and acquired  the bow and arrow a more efficient weapon for hunting strategies. Pottery changed from simple designs on a dull gray background to black drawings on a white background . Farming accounted more of there diet than before and much mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture.Between A.D 110 and A.D. 1300,  the population may have reached thousands. It was much more based in compact villages of many rooms.  The stone walls of the large pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde . People started moving back to the cliff alcoves  that sheltered there ancestors before.          Lost Greek city that may have inspired the Atlantis myth gives up secrets . A diver explores the sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece . Explored by an Anglo Greek team of archaeologist and Marin geologist and known as pavlorpetri the sunken settlement dates back some 5,00 years to the time of homers heroes and in terms of size and wealth of details is unprecedented ,experts says. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going,' said sakellariou . 'Less than 1% of the worlds ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found'.  	NNS NN VBD NN . NNP NN CD NNP NNS DT NNS IN DT JJ . CC WRB VBP PRP VB WP PRP VBP IN DT JJ .

Some of those civilizations include the Incan, Ancestal Puebloans, and Pavloptri. These civilzations go back to about 5,000 years ago when they were still alive. They also range from different locations from Peru to under the sea. Although discovering more information about these cities may seem slim, stories, artifacts, and geography helps us in the understanding of these civilizations.       Stories help archeaologist get a better understanding of the civiliations that had came before us. When the Europeans came to the Americas, they wrote notes and stories about the Incan civilations.  Europeans, consisting of Spanish presists and soliders, arrived to the Incan empire in 1532. They wrote down stoies and legends told by the Incan in letters and diaries. Archeaologist were first worrisome of the new found knowledge, because there were afriaid it wasn't exact since Europeans didn't speak their lanuage. Even thought some of the information may not have been correct, but left to a greater knowledge of their daily lives.       Artifacts, objects that they left behind, led researchers to a better understanding of how and when these civilizations lived. Incan artifacts were made of materials ranging from gold to stone found in the ruins of buildings and undergound. Ancestal Puebloans left behind baskets hinting information of their daily lives to researchers. While Pavloptris left behind ceramics and structures leading to the discovery of when they might of had occupied the area. Artifacts were inportant clues to archeaologist because they helped them understand and discover many important facts about civilizations.       Geography was the main contributer when it came to keeping the civilations alive. The geography of the Incan civilization was in the Andes on mountain peaks where it was colder than most places leaving bodies frozen. With those frozen bodies, scientist have been able to learn how they lived. While some Icans lived on moutains, some lived on the deserts. The dry deserts of Peru's coast kept clothes and artifacts still attached. For the Pavloptris, it was their location under the sea that helped scientist. They were constantly hit with shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure, which led to the discovery of the architecture of their city.       As you can see, without stories, artifacts, and geography, many of the great discoveries abou these lost civilizations would not be found. Stories acted as clues and information to their daily lives. Artifacts showed us how they lived there life and when they occupied certain areas. Geography made it possible for the discoveries to be found. Without these three factors, our knowledge about these civilizations would be extremely limited and we wouldn't be as informed as we are now.

They were all ancient civilizations and they were all a mystery and they carry out a huge civilizations but still we haven't discover most of thir past. By doing that we go to their civilization and observe it which is located in South America. And I really adore a mysterious past thats not discovered.       Since we know so little about them we just ask people. Europeans were the first to discover the Inca. They were amazed by their huge empire. The Inca used string to keep records. They were called quipus. By studying all their artifacts they are still a huge mystery today.

How do we learn what we know about the past from lost civilizations? Some come from what we know about the Inca thats come from oral history, or stories passed from generation to generation(source #1). By studing these clues, archaeologists and others can peice together details of Inca life. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may ven have worshiped some mountain peaks.          About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home(source #2). In the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes nd moved away. The first Ancestral Puebloans setted in Mes Verde about A.D. 550. For instance  this was the fist ancestral puebloans in Mesa Verde. Peoplelived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750 as settled argriculture began. The pithouse featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground. Four corner timbers supported the roof. These were fairly prsperous times for the Basketmakers, and their population multiplied.          Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets. The secrets of the lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myt-the fable of Atlantis- have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southeren Greece(source #3). 'There is no doubt tht this is the oldest sumbereged town in the world,' said Dr. Jon Henderson, associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham. What they found surpassed all expectations. Thanks to shifting sands and the settlements enclosure in a protected bay, the exploration revealed a world of bulidings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. In addition, the seabed was relete with thousands of shards of pottery.  Mesa Verde National Park Ancestrial Puebloans and their world. Aso the first ancestral puebloans in mesa verde.          We kno some of the old stories because they were written down by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Archaeologists who study these sites keep carful records.

They hold many secrets that are the answer to why we do things today the way we do them. A few lost civilizations include the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. Scientists and archaeologists work together to uncover the mysteries of these abandoned civilizations by exploring the area and collecting data. They collect data through artifacts, writing, and even dead bodies. Knowing about these objects and settlements is important because it lets us know what happened in the past and how it contributes to our present.                The ancient Inca civilization of Peru lacked a formal writing or alphabet system so instead of finding written archives, archaeologists found colored strings, called quipus. The quipus contained knots inside and served as a calender to keep count of livestock. Our knowledge of Inca also comes through passed on stories, the diaries of the Europeans who arrived in the 1500s, and abandoned artifacts such as clothing, pots, and textiles. When gaining data through artifacts, archaeologists have to make sure they record as much information they can get. Bodies left in the Andes mountain peaks were also considered artifacts. The cold weather preserved the bodies so that they were in a good enough condition for research. All of this gathered information tie together to create what we know about ancient Inca, one of the many lost civilizations.                Another lost civilization we know about is the Ancesteral Puebloans who lived in Mesa Verde over one thousand years ago. The first Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They were talented at basket-making, farming, and building pithouses and weapons. They learned to make pottery and used a bow and arrow. By A.D. 1000, their architectural and agricultural skills increased significantly. They had new construction ideas, new pottery designs, and more farming space. About A.D. 1200, the Puebloans began moving back into the cliff alcoves, their home centuries before. These people became known as cliff dwellers. They built kivas out of sandstone where they would gather together or organize daily routines. Our knowledge on these cliff dwellers and why they left Mesa Verde is limited. When the Puebloan cliff dwellers left, they traveled into New Mexico and Arizona. We even have people today who are descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans.                One more lost civilization is a submerged civilization below southern Greece, also known as Pavlopetri. Even though Pavlopetri dates back 5,000 years ago, marine archaeologists explored it only about four years ago with the help of modern technology. Because the city was enclosed in a protected bay, the courtyards, tombs, structures, and other buildings were revealed. A discovered megaron, a monumental structure with a rectangular hall, informs us that the civilization was of high ranking. We still do not know why or how the Pavlopetri sank but it is likely due to sea level changes, or ground subsidence. Not only is this civilization the oldest underwater settlement in the world, it is also the first submerged city to predate Plato's tale of Atlantis.                The discovery of these civilizations, plus many more, are significant to our history because they let us know about the way people lived before. This can help us because these discoveries might even lead up to new ones. The ancient Inca created their own calender out of strings and had homes high up on mountain peaks. The Pueebloans and cliff dwellers built homes out of sandstone, were skilled in building tools and making baskets.

In this article im going to talk about why the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are important today in time.                 Ancient civilizations are important to learn about because we learn about how they lived and adepted to their land, so that if we can get an understanding of live in ancient times. The Puebloans adepted to their harsh land so that they could survive.                Another reason, is so that we can learn from their technology. For example, Puebloans learned to make homes out of mud and sticks, and from the Incas how to aviod looters by living on a mountain top.                In addition to learn about their technology learning about ancient civilizations help to learn about where we come from and how we got here. For example, how they spanish came over and killed the last Inca king and captured the empire.                We can learn a lot from the Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.Its very important to rememder the thing that ancient civilizations teach use and never forget them. 	WRB VBP JJ NNS IN JJ .

The artifacts discovered by the archeologists has told us that they had no formal alphabet. The Inca invented strings or quipus to keep record of livestock, or the quipus was used as a calendar. Empires used the quipus to keep records, many Europeans were astouned.   Although, the Incas didn't leave many archives, historians were able to find out about what they wore, what language did they speak. Archeologists have discovered clues left behind to tell us their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. The clues allowed archeologists to piece together their life.   Stories of the past were past down by genereation to genereation. They started when the Europeans wrote down about the Incas, in 1532. Soldiers and presits described the Incas in letters and journals. They told of how they dressed, what they ate, how they cared for the sick, their burrials, the way they cared for their livestock, and how they invented machines or tools to help them. Some of these stories may not as well be accurate, because the Europeans didn't speak their language well.   The sites where the Incas were found, often were disrupted by treasure hunters or looters. Archeoloists dig up the sites very carefully and take records and pictures of any artifact they find. Learning about acient Peru, is vital to archeologists, their goal is to know about the Inca and their ways. They compare their evidence to that of the Europeans, sometimes archeology confirms history.   The most important of all the evidence is to find out what happened to this civilization, (the rise and the fall). The Inca was easy, because we know that the Spaniords killed the last Incan king in 1532.   The Inca lived in the Andes or in Peru's desserts. Many of thier homes are in remote sites. Their dead, still buried tell archeologists how they died. The burrials were extremly cared for.

They are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. Formerly nomadic, they were begining to lead a more settled life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithoouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses.They lived in pithouses from A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. They learned to make pottery and aquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient weapon for hunting then the atlatl, a spear thrower.

These discoveries help scientists look into the pass and put themselves in the shoes of our ancient civilization. If archeologists find out about ancient life, it could possibly change our world and help the present predict the future.                   Our ancient civilization had a lot of knowledge and were very skillful. They used colorful strings in place of calendars. They even built stone communities and later made small villages that consisted of pit houses. As soon as they all settled, agriculture began. As population increased, so did houses and communities. This took skillful stone masonry. Farming became an essential part of their diet.                   We will never know the whole story. The ancient civilization left no written records. Most of the important things in their life have perished. The building that are still standing tell a lot about their way of lives though and their skills. The way the civilization made the buildings shows they were artistic in their crafts. They also made their home on difficult land. The structures provide evidence of society. Accumulated skills and traditions have been passed from generation to generation.                   Although archaeologist aren't completely sure how to understand every discovery, they do know its important to know our ancestors life. If we could figure out every discovery that we found, we could maybe have a better understanding of the present and predict the future.                   Our societies and generations continue to progress and develop more everyday.                         Maybe we will discover something and our whole world will change forever...

Some of them    were important and some of them were probably just some dirt or a little bit of rocks. But, in an Archaeologist point of view, those were some important discoveries. For example, if they found dirt, they would be able to know what kind of soil they grew their crops in.                                                    In this case, all discoveries are important because they contribute to the everlasting question of how some of the ancient civilizations were eventually wiped out. Some discoveries, like, carvings on walls, or paintings on walls have a big influence on the answer to that question. The paintings may show what they wore, what they hunted, or even what they ate. Over the years, there have been alot of discoveries of paintings and carvings, and some dicoveries of cloth that some tribes wore, however, Scientists and Archaeologists still dont know what killed most of the tribes other than each other.                                 Though we have found evidence that there was life on earth way before our time, we still dont know what happened to them. Scientists and Archaeologists still have this question echoing in their head,'What happened to Ancient civilizations?'

They have started from nothing and got to an empire and thosands of years.       The Myans had been great people in the first turn of the century from 1000-1500 maybe evan earlier. Tey were mythed to come from asia millions of years ago and millions later start a empire. After they built there empire they would have very different religions. There main one would insist of different gods doing different things. One of them would be to pray to the sun god by sacraficing blood for lots of sun and rain to get good crops.       THe myans would send conquest to try and take over small villages to those who wouldnt want to help in the capital. They would inslave them and make them slaves or the sacrafices.       They had many great traditions but when spanish conquests would come the myans thought they would be friendly but they were wrong. They were having huge wars. Many perople died, thousands probably because the Spanish were in the search for gold and they would hear gold was found in Myan and Aztec civilizations. So they would always try to look for them.       So If you ever plan to travel down south to mexico or further look for the lost empires. By Mexico city youll find huge pyramids built by the myans and aztecs from thosands of years ago and they would also have famous art and statues and sometimes puzzles by them. So try it and youll might like it.

1201	AI-XC	20131118131243	1500	1500	NR			F	649204	8	10457609	Y	53045	       We have heard many stories about lost civilizations and cities. People may say that some of that stuff is just a myth without even doing research and going through different articles or findings to support their claim. I, on the other hand, did my research and studies on lost civilizations, such as the Inca, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. I found very interesting claims and facts that might be helpful for you, the reader, to know. So lets continue with our research.         Lets start of with the Inca. A civilization everybody knows about, but not really sure if more then half of the findings are true. We know that the fall of Inca happened when the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire. Since they lived so long ago, and even since then different people have took over and called this place their own, it is a very difficult place to try to trace. Some Inca were buried in caves or on mountain tops, this has made it very difficult for looters to break into and try to steal valuables from them. Therefore it is a very well preserved site. Even thanks to such cold temperatures from the mountains, this has made it possible for bodies to be in such good shape to study. It is also believed that the Inca might have worshiped mountain peaks. Many sites are in high, remote places. Even though most of this evidence may not be true, since the Spaniards told us about the Inca that know and have learned, we have to trust our instinct and try to find out as much as we can about this civilization to give us a better under standing of how they lived, survived, and thought many, many, many, years ago          Moving on, we come to the Puebloans. It is said that about 1,400 years ago, before Europeans started to explore North America, there was a group of people living in Mesa Verde for their home in the the Four Corners region. In the late A.D. 1200s, they left their homes and moved away, after living here for more than 700 years. They have been called Anasazi, a Navajo word that means 'ancient enemies' or 'the anicent ones'. First settlement in about A.D. 550, the puebloans settled in Mesa Verda, which in Spanish, means 'green table'. Being nomadic, they started to live a more settled way of life. instead of hunting and gathering, they started to farm. Pit houses is what they lived in. It was several feet into the ground. It was four corned and supported the room. They also had a special place where they kept their valuables, an antechamber. They also did crafting and made pottery. Several theories about their migrations are that maybe they moved because of the many droughts they have suffered. All of their plants and soil have been dried out, and as we know they farmed, so this was very harsh for them. They simply got tired of it and migrated away. Some people still have Puebloan blood in them  in New Mexico and Arizona.           Last is the Pavlopetri. This is an ancient Greek civilization that is believed to date back to 5,000 years ago. Some people believe that this city is a myth, but other claims and information say otherwise. It is said that that this city was consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C. The well known name is Atlantis. From moving around sand and the  protection of it in the bay, we have been able to find buildings, streets, tombs, and religious structures. Also shards of pottery. Over 9,000 square meters of new buildings have been reveled. Not many is know about the Pavlopetri, but we can say the reason for the underwater sea is most likely of sea levels, earthquakes, and a tsunami. It shows how people lived and is truly amazing, since it is around waters so shallow. Its was the first sunken city found. As stated by Sakellariou 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps  underwater exploration going.'          In conclusion, civilizations that has been a mystery to all can be figured out with just a little research and studying. I hope that you have found out a lot of new information from reading this. We still don't know a lot about these civilizations. Everybody learns something new each day .Do some studies of your own and see what you come up with, you'll be surprised about all the cool things you can find out by just reading an essay, or an article.

We need to know what happened in our past, so it does not happen in our future. Without everything that have discovered and are going to discover we would know anything about are past.               Everything that we discover will contribute to further discoveries. Like  The lost greek city, elders have known that was there for awhile but we just now got the technology to actually examin it. We can learn alot about are past by just finding old pottery, or bodies ect.Most of the stuff we laern about our past we learn from simple items like clothing, or maybe even large stuff like homes, and towns.

With what I've read and researched is helping me with this article. The studies are over the ancient Inca civilization, the Ansestral Pueboans, and last the Pavopetri civilization.       First, the Ancient Incas were smart peoples. the learned to adapt to there sorondings such as land, weather, nature and more. They mostly hunted at first and they lived in the deserts of Peru. some also  lived in a whole new environment the cold Andes mountains. They adapted by farming and staying warm with new houses. Some sites have been ruined by treasure hunters and looters. Archeologists look for anything the can salvage for our history. They some times even have to climb mountains with some equipment to study there findings and they have to carry it down the mountains to further explore it. The Spaniards finally killed the last kings in 1532 and took over the empire.       Long before the Europeans discovered America there was a civilization the people are presently called the Ansestral Pueboans. They lived under cliffs, and revolutionized there houses over time. they went from hunting to growing crops. They were former nomads. They had a pretty straight forward religion. In the summer fires were only used for cooking but during the winter there were fires through out the villages. There are also many tribes still alive today.       The Pavopetri ccivilization was found under water recently and was a huge discovery. a lot of artifacts such as building and pottery have been distoryed under water. It is off the coast of Greece and is probably where the myth of Atlantis came from.

Their dicoveries showed there was civilization in South America in the 1400s. Things that were left behind show their way of life.       The fall of the Inca was in 1532. We know this because the last Inca king was killed by Spaniards at this time. This is when they took over the empire. The area in which they lived was taken over by many different people.       Many of the Inca sites were in high places, that would most likely not be bothered. Some were buried in caves, or on mountain tops. This was because it was hard for looter to get to them, and they body would be undisturbed. But this made the archaeologists job harder too.

They help is reveal how smart ancient civilizations actually were.     The inca in peru had used strings to document things and had no offical alphebet. They also were important because the artifacts help tell is what they did to survive. There is also been alot of riches found in these civilizations. sometimes they found bodies frozen in time and would be able to learn about how the person died.    The under water lost city in greece was the oldest submerged town in the world. most of the older ones are usualy not consoiderd planned but they think this one was. that make this unique. Also, thanks to the shifting sand, many buildings, courtyards, streets, tombs amd religous stuctures were found. also, the seabed was coverd with shards of pottery. This shows how people lived at the time.     The civilization found in Mesa Verde was home to people way before the europeans discovered america. In this civilization, archeologists found buildings and elborate stone comunties in the canyon walls. The people of this were known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. they lived in pithouses clustered in small villages most of the time on mesa tops.  they were fairly prosperous during this time. they began buildin houses above ground. then they started building adobe with thick walls and were 2-3 stories high, with many rooms. this showed us how advanced they actually were.

The discoveries of ancient civilzations have lead to new ways at looking at the world. The discovery of the Ancient Inca civilzation has lead to the dicovery of new historical facts, and has proven some of these facts wrong. Like when the first spanish met the Inca, it was said that the spanish know what the Inca's were saying, but actully the spainish didn't.        In the finding of the Ancestral Puebloans, we found out what people in that era's houses would look like. Also we found out that this civilzation lived in homes in a side of a canoyn. These houses also sparked some of the idea's for what houses should look like today. Like the Pithouses they used sparked a idea for small apartments, or hotel rooms. The Kiva is like a old example of a church for this civilzation. These places also could hold get togethers out side, and or inside. This is like the idea of family reunions. Also the Ancestral Puebloans used nature as a advantage. Today we also use nature as a advantage, like bunkers will be hidden by soil or a house will be built around a tree, or it could make a tree house.       The finding of the Lost Greek City was very important. From it we learned that Pluto, the famous Greek writer may have made the story of Atlantis from this underwater city. This discovery also may have been one of the first great greek cities just before the Greek golden age. Also it shows that greek city-states may have started before we actully thought. It also is the largest underwater city known to man today. Which makes it very good for historical finds and other great stuff. It also gives scientists a mysetery to solve. That mysetery is how did the city become submerged in water. It also has made nearby towns delighted. Another mystery some scientist agree on is why is the water around the city so shallow. This may be the city Pluto was writting about, but still, less than one percent of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. Which still leaves tons of ocean to find what Pluto was writting about.        So discovering new things that have to do with lost civilzations, will help us actully discover how life in the past was!

The incas made knots in colored string to record the calendar to keep track of livestock they were called quipus.                  The first European to meet the incas were astonished that they could run a huge empire by just using string to keep records. Many archaeologists have found many ancient quipus but today no one knows wat the knot means. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the string understanding the incas is like solving a mystery.

The past holds the keys to the future.  The Inca, Puebloans, and Greeks hold the keys.  Whether the keys unlock the secrets of the future or help us from repeating history of tyrants and poverty the will guide the human race to peace and prosperity.       The Incas learned to rule a vast empire that rivaled Rome, only by using colored strings.  These strings, or quipus, were used to keep track of sates and livestock.  The Inca didn't have a formal writing system but governed with the strings.  Even the first Europeans to arrive in South America and meet the Inca were amazed at the power the quipus had.        The Puebloans also had influential technology.  They created mortar with mud and water.  Mortar is still a building material today.  Their building skill were great as they created building material that is still used to day even if it is a little updated.  The puebloans also discovered the bow and arrow which was used as a primary fighting tool in many countries pre-gunpowder and even after gun powder as some armed forces use a crossbow, a variation of the bow and arrow, for stealth.       Finally, the Greeks were important because they spoke of The Lost City of Atlantis myth when it was right under their nose.  The Greeks had many myths and after this myth that lasted five thousand years turned out to be true who knows what is real.  Did the Greeks ever encounter a minotaur in a labyrinth? Did Medusa turn people to stone? or are these adaptions of what really happened.  Also if the city sank because of sea level changes, ground subsidence from an earthquake, or a tsunami scientist and world leaders can help the human race and set up precautionary measure to ensure less destruction.       The ancient civilizations of the past can benefit the generations of today.  The past can teach the future to help better the human condition.  The Greeks, Inca, and puebloans all help further and better the human race.

The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri have left behind ancient aftifacts that are now extremely significant to modern archaeologists. These preserved objects provide an immense amount of information on the lifestyle, diet, culture etc. of these past settlements. These three informational articles have greatly supported the importance of discoveries to help today's people learn more about the past civilizations and their customs.   The first article, 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past,' by Beth Gruber, states 'Archaeologists can compare ehat they learn from artifacts and sites with the Spainiards' accounts of the Inca.' These discoveries can either deny what was thought to be fact or confirm what was already thought to be true.What is discovered here will go into history and will be read by millions of others. These artifacts will shape the present and future with the information they provide to archaeologists.   The ancient Puebloans have greatly influenced modern society through the discoveries made about these people and their culture. This ancient civilization   The Pavlopetri is a settlement that was discovered deep on the ocean floor and today it gives archaeologists an immense amount of information about their daily life and common objects. The article, 'Lost Gree'...the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.' These preserved buildings are very alike the buildings and structures common today. These people will give the archaeologists information on their lifestyle and cities. This newly collected data can teach people of today new and somethimes easier methods of doing tasks. This information has the possibility of greatly benefiting modern day citizens for the future, as well as educating them on the past.    Discoveries and new information found about ancient civilizations have made a huge difference in society on Earth today. Most of what we know to be part of common life today has originated in some way from knowledge from the past. The Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are just a few of the ancient civilizations that have greatly affected modern life.

Yet curiosity does not even begin to explain the true siginificance of our ancestors and their societies, for history and archaeology helps us connect with those who came before us and learn from their accomplishments and failures alike. The discoveries that have been made concerning the Inca, the Pueblonians, and the Pavlopetri are no exception to this rich tradition of embracing human history, and these civilizations have much to contribute to our knowledge of the intriuging world that came before us.   First and foremost, the excavation of Incan sites greatly impacts our view on history because they were such a complex society. Though they had no formal alphabet or system of writing and therefore could not leave archives for historians to study, the Inca were advanced in other ways. Historians marvel at their quipus, which were knots in colored string that the Inca used to keep numerical records. Because of this simple yet impactful advancement, historians and the general public are aware that the Inca were forward thinking and civilized enough to value a definite system of counting. In addition, the oral history of the Inca is perhaps historains' most powerful tool, for the stories often emphasize religious and societal values. Though they are not a precise facsimile of the original story, they still reveal what may have been important to the Incas, such as their customs and legends that shaped their society. We can find hidden lessons in the Inca's oral history and piece together the daily life of and Inca. Evidently, the quipus and the rich oral history of the Inca once played a major role in their civilization, thus making it significant to the modern world.   Another interesting civilization is without a doubt the ancient Pueblonians, for their advancements in building structures depict their slow but steady forward thinking. The Pueblonians never stopped innovating and perfecting the skill of building, and their determination is seen in the evolution of their structures. Pueblonians began with pithouses, which were primitive underground housing structures that eventually evolved into kivas. By A.D. 1000, the Pueblonians switched from the basic pole and adobe construction to stone masonry, which furthered their success in the building aspect of society. Obviously, the Publonians refusal to stop innovating inspires today's generationto ocntinue to improve our lives, thus rendering the Pueblonians as a significant part of human history.   Last but not least, the Pavlopetri are arguably the most fascinating civilization to study, for the circumstances of their disappearance is thought-provoking on many levels. The civilization tied to this lost Greek city may have inspired the legend of Atlantis, and it is far beyond interesting to examine the lives of a civilization who conceded their existance to water. Historians believe that the wealth of this civilization is unrivaled, which prompts us to wonder what may have become of the Pavlopetri if they had not come to such an abrupt end. Perhaps they could have risen to the level of recognition of ancient Rome if given more time to expand. In another sense, the discoveries centered around the Pavlopetri make us question if a number of other cities are lost underwater, waiting to be found by archaeologists. There is no limit to what history can hold if cities can be located and investigated underwater, which foreshadows greater things to come in the future of archaeology and our knowledge of ancient civilizations.   Overall, history is a rich terrain that humans are obliged to explore 	VBG NN NNS VBZ RB VBN DT NN VBD IN NN NN POS NN NNP NNP NN VBZ RB RB VB TO VB DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS CC PRP$ NNS , IN NN CC NN NNS PRP VBP IN DT WP VBD IN PRP CC VB IN PRP$ NNS CC NNS NNP NNP NNS WDT VBP VBN VBN VBG DT NNP , DT NNPS , CC DT NNP VBP DT NN TO DT NN NN IN VBG NN NN , CC DT NNS VBP JJ TO VB TO PRP$ NN IN DT NN NN WDT VBD IN NNP NNP CC VB , DT NN IN NNP VBZ RB VBZ PRP$ NN IN NN IN PRP VBD JJ DT JJ NNP NNP PRP VBD DT JJ NN CC NN IN VBG CC RB MD RB VB NNS IN NNS TO VB , DT NNP VBD VBN IN JJ NNP NNP NN IN PRP$ NNS , WDT VBD NNS IN VBN NN IN DT NNP VBD TO VB JJ NNP NNP IN DT JJ NN NN NN , NNS CC DT JJ JJ VBP JJ IN DT NNP VBD RB VBG CC JJ RB TO VB DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP NN , DT JJ NN IN DT NNP VBZ RB VBZ '' RBS JJ NN , IN DT NNS RB VBP JJ CC JJ NNP NNP PRP VBP RB DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP RB VBP WP MD VB VBN JJ TO DT NNP , JJ IN PRP$ NNS CC NNS WDT VBD PRP$ NNP NNP MD VB VBN NNS IN DT NNP POS JJ NN CC NN RB DT JJ NN IN CC NNP NNP , DT NN CC DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NNP RB VBN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN , RB VBG PRP JJ TO DT JJ NNP NNP NN NN VBZ IN DT NN DT JJ NNS , IN PRP$ NNS IN NN NNS VBP PRP$ JJ CC JJ NN NNP NNP NNP RB VBD VBG CC VBG DT NN IN NN , CC PRP$ NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD IN NNS , WDT VBD JJ NN NN NNS WDT RB VBD IN NNP NNP NNP CD , DT NNPS VBD IN DT JJ NN CC VB NN TO NN NN , WDT VBN PRP$ NN IN DT NN NN IN NNP NNP , DT NNPS NN TO VB NN NNS NN POS NN NN TO VB PRP$ NNS , RB VBG DT NNPS IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NNP NNP CC RB JJS , DT NNP VBP RB DT RBS VBG NN TO NN , IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NN VBZ JJ IN JJ NNP NNP NN VBD TO DT NN NNP NN MD VB VBN DT NN IN NNP , CC PRP VBZ RB IN JJ TO NN DT NNS IN DT NN WP VBN PRP$ NN TO NNP NNPS VBP IN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ VBN , WDT VBZ PRP TO VB WP MD VB VBN IN DT NNP IN PRP VBD RB VBN TO JJ DT JJ NNP NNP PRP MD VB VBN TO DT NN IN NN IN JJ NNP IN VBN JJR NN TO NNP NNP DT NN , DT NNS VBD IN DT NNP VBP PRP NN IN DT NN IN JJ NNS VBP VBN NN , VBG TO VB VBN IN NNP NNP VBZ DT NN TO WP NN MD VB IN NNS MD VB VBN CC VBN NN , WDT VBZ JJR NNS TO VB IN DT NN IN NN CC PRP$ NN IN NN NNP NNP , NN VBZ DT JJ NN WDT VBZ VBP VBN TO VB	2		20131025111041	2370	2		20131025111023	2360	2

I would say that it helps us find out more about ancient civilizations. Also if we didn't discover any ancient artifacts  i don't think we would have known about the  Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri.               All the discover we made about the Incas. Have had an impacted on what know about them  today. For example we wouldn't know that they one of the first civilizations to have a calender, that they made tool out of stone, and that they had gold and silver. Also, that before we got there some sites were disturbed by treasure hunters.              Secondly, Puebloans lived in a region known as the for corners region.Which is now preserved by the Mesa Verde National Park.They are now known as the Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting there mordern descendents. They were known as basket makers for their skill at the craft.               Third of all, the Pavopetri were known as the cliff dwellers for making there homes under an overhanging cliff. The roofs of there homes created open court yards. We know that last quarter of A.D. 1200's they saw drought and crop failure. Although they had survived earlier drought this was the worst of them all. 	MD PRP VB DT NN IN NN NN VBZ NN .

They had no formal alphabet , or system of writing.  which makes it very hard for us to know there way of life. Archaeologists found a record system called quips . but unforchantly no one knows what they mean . the incan society is very mysterious in many ways.       Another is the Anasazi society of Mesa Verde . they were around about 11,400 thousand years ago .  they lived in elaborate stone community. we know actually quiet a bit a bout this society . archaeologists found textiles and clothing form this era. we do know some about the Anasazi but we could differently know more.       the final society will be the under sea city in southern Greece , it has been known to inspire the story of Atlantis . this one is the most mysterious of all . a ancient lost city hidden in the deep water. it was around about 5'000 years ago . it is 30'000 meters across the ocean floor there isnt much to tell about this city . we barley know about it we do know that they were  like any other city with buildings and court yardsbut thatsabout it       i have just told you about three very old ancient city's . each one different . each one interesting . each one very mysterious . they are story's of lost city's and scoietys around the world that we still know little about. but hopefully we crack the code of these ancient city's and learn more about them.

The invention and findings of these archaic societies have explained to people how different life was in the ancient times. These findings have also given us the knowledge on how technology has advanced immensely.         The ancient Incas of Peru were an intellectual group of people. Though they had no writing system or alphabet, they create quipus to record as a calendar and keep track of livestock. Their textiles and artifacts have helped people discover how they actually lived. For example, the intricate patterns found on textiles have assisted the findings of monuments that cannot be seen from the ground. The Incas contributed greatly to the word of today,but also did the ancient Puebloans.          The ancient Puebloans of Mesa Verde were very skilled and crafty. Today, many people have made more advanced versions of the things that the Puebloans created. For example, the ancient Puebloans built and lived in pit-houses, which today has been transformed into sturdy homes made of wood and cement. Not only did Incas create the first homes, they also built the first church. They built places of worship called a Kiva, which means ceremonial room. These Kivas have been transformed into the much bigger and more intricate churches seen today. Their inventions has helped people discover more information about them, as well as the lost city that inspired the tale of Atlantis.         Beneath the transparent waters of southern Greece, there lays a sunken settlement that inspired the tale of Atlantis, known as Pavlopetri. The most interesting fact about this settlement is that it was a planned city filled with buildings, courtyards, streets, tombs, and religious structures. Not too long ago, marine archaeologists have been able to finally search the lost city and have discovered many new things. For example, investigators were able to find a possible megaron, which gives the idea that the town may have been used by an elite. The ceramics and pottery shards found have also helped archaeologists discovered the city that had fallen.        In conclusion, these ancient cultures have played a crucial role in the discoveries and technologies found today. The artifacts and finding found have proven that they Puebloans, Incas, and the Pavlopetri were intelligent people who have inspired many of the inventions of today.

A lot of their sites are in remote, high places.some inca were buried in caves in cliff faces.   About 1,400 years ago, long before europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the four corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home.   The first Ancestral Puebkians settled in Mesa Verda (Spanish for ''green table'') abput A.D.550.They are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft.   A diver explores the sunken settlement beneath the waters off southern Greece. ''There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world,'' said Dr Jon Henderson,associate professor of underwater archaeology at the University of Nottingham.   The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of acean floor off the southern peloplnnese, is believed to have been cinsumed by the sea around 1000 BC Although discovered by a british oveanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists,aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins.

The Incas artifacted many things with stone, pottery, gold, or silver. They textiles and clothing, the materials were usually destroyed by damoness. Tthe Incas were hunters. Archaeologists study and find things about the Incas. Archaeoloists compared what they learn about artifacts and sites with the Spaniards accounts of the Inca. They found that the Spaniars murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and took over the empire.       Mesa Verde were known for basketmakers and for their skiled at crafts. They made pithouses in about A.D. 550. The people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe contruction to skillful stone masonry. Walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined together into units of 50 rooms or more.They, also, did pottery too.       Lost Greek was a secrats of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths. The sunken settlement dates bakc some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes. In terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. They say it's 30,00 square meters of ocean floor of the southern Peloponnese. It's believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 B.C.

They didn'y leave any archives for the historians to study. They made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep count of livestock. Archeologist have found many quipus.

How about people who lived high in the mountain tops? These stories are true. With the help of Archaeologist, the myths were put to rest and finally the facts were revealed. These discoveries were important because it can help us to know about things that can happen to us in the future.       Archaeologist have found the 'Lost city of Atlantis'. It was discovered beneath the waters off southern Greece. Many speculate on how it sunk. Some say that it was sea level changes. Others say it was due to earthquakes. I think its important that we found the city because we now know that a city can sink. Ceramics were found that dates back to the stone age which suggests that the settlement was occupied around 5,000 years ago. Scientists originally thought it was 1,200 years later than that. The city is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. It is believed that this city was were the Atlantis myths started.       The Puebloans were very skilled at crafting baskets. That's how they got the nickname 'Basketmakers'. They were originally nomadic but started to become more settled. They lived in pit houses in small villages usually built on mesa tops. The Puebloans used to be hunters and gatherers but moved to more of a farming lifestyle as they got more settled. Archaeologist have found their deserted homes and are wondering why they deserted them. They believe that maybe there was a severe drought. Another theory is they got forced away. Either way, it has taught us about droughts and conditions in the past in that area. That's why it's important that cowboys reported their dwellings and archaeologist have looked into them.       The Incas were a great society. They kept record of events with rope and knots. They survived for a very long time. That is until the Spanish came and invaded their society. The Spanish killed the last Inca king. They lived high in the Andes. Some Spanish kept record of their society but not a lot. It is why we don't know a lot about them. It has taught us to keep good record of what happens in the present and to preserve the past.       As you can see, it was really important that archaeologist found these society's. They have taught us a lot. Although archaeologist have had some tough challenges, they still got a lot of the information and recorded it. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN DT JJS NN IN NNP .

They can also see how modern civilizations has grown and adapted. Artifacts that are no longer used can tell how the ancient people survived and lived before modern technology.       The Inca Civilization ruled for about a hundred years and only left a portion of things they had. This is because the spanish conquistadors had visited and destroyed most of what they had. Looters could have also stolen important artifacts. Weather could have also harmed artifacts, but many survived.       Records were also kept by the spaniards, but they didn't speak the Inca language very well so they could not really interpret what they said. They also did not have a formal system of writing. One document could have the same essential information as another but be written in a different format or words.

Where the streets are nothing but diamonds and glitter. Where everything is just. . . amazing! The 'Lost City' of Atlantis and been a unique Greek myth for many years.               'The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.' -Helena Smith. The lost city is a important find because people can find out if all of those crazy myths are true.               The written tablets will be the most important find for man. We would be able to find out more information about how people used to live, such as religion and education. People can also find out how man started. How can we explain the way humans first began with out using any specific religion? Through what they have left behind for us study.               Many people also have curiosities about these specific ideas. This website will help you answer all of these questions plus more!

Why are people so fasinated about civilizations about the past? Any ideas? Well my best guess is that they want to be informed about things that went one earlier in history, it would be cool just to know a new undiscoverd city. they want their unanswered questions to be answered, like what mistakes did they do that made them decline?                  Why is the lost city such an important find? it might be the truth of the myth of antlantis, might be such an important find because it shows us how they lived in ancient times                 Lastly, what would be the most important item to leave behind when trying to discover an ancient civilization? it would probably be some sort of writing because it would tell us how theyve evolved from the past, also a journal or some type of personal reocard that tells us more about that person and what they did for a living.               In concution, i have discussed three main questions about about the ancient civilization.

The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Pavloperti is very important to us.          The Inca civilization is located high in the Andes Mountains was a very active civilizations during their time period (1438-1532). The Inca had no formal alphabet or a system of writing. The Inca civilization believed that their rulers would be sent to the afterlife, like Egyptians, and when the ruler of the Inca people died; the Inca people would preserve the body and burry it away with gold, silver, and many other tools that the people believed the ruler would need in the afterlife. The Inca had a textile and clothing that survived over hundreds of thousands of years. The Inca welcomed the Spaniards with open arms, but in 1532, The Spaniards betrayed the Inca for all they did for them by killing the last king of the Inca people. After the murder of the king the Spaniards took over the Inca empire.          Over 1,400 years ago, before Europe began exploring America, a group of people settled in the Four Corners region. Archeologist who studied these people called them Anasazi, from the Navajo work traslated as, 'ancient ones,'  or 'ancient enemies. The Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'green table') around A.D 550. They were known as Basketmakers for their skill in craftsmenship. They were once nomadic. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as a main livelihood of the Puebloans. They learned many diffrent crafts such as, pottery. They also learned to create new weapons such as, the bow and arrow. The Puebloans lived in Pithouses. The Puebloans left their territory and decided to move elsewhere. The Pueblo people and other tribes are decendants of the Ancestral Puebloans.            From myth to reality, the ancient underwater city that inspired the myth of Atlantics has been discovered. The discovery of this ancient underwater city was 30,000 square miles on the floor of the ocean off the southern Peloponnese. The archeologist found many diffrent wonders of this city. They found buildings, courtyards, main streets, and rock-cut tombs and creligious structures, like churchs. They also found verious shards of pottery on the seabed. The people believed that this ancient city was shallowed up by the sea and was placed at the bottom of the ocean. This is the first underwater city ever discovered in ancient Greece.

One reason why it could  be important is so we could learn from our mistakes. Other reasons are it could simply be facinating. Also we could learn how to not run an empire. These are some of the reasons studying ancient civilizations is important.     Learning from our mistakes. That could single handedly be the most important thing we learn from ancient civlizations. Such as war, a country can be torn apart by war. Or certain laws that govern us, we need to be careful when choosing them. Choosing leaders is a major factor if a kingdom will thrive or not. Learning from our misakes can help a kingdom thrive.    In conclusion studying ancient civiliztions can be a very impotant thing. They can help govern our society. We could learn from previous mistakes. It can help us decide if a leader will be a bad one or a good one. All and all studying past civilizations is one of the most imporant things we learn, wether it's in history class or it's in real life.

If so then these discoveries will interest you. Ancient discoveries are an important insight to an ancient culture. This article will tell you about one discovery made and about two cultures.            Firstly, in 1969 a sunken city was discovered by a British oceanographer but due to a lack of technology available it was explored in 2009 by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists. It was known as Pavlopetri and dates back some 5,000 years, and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented. In the words of Dr Jon Henderson 'There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. It has remains dating back from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece....' It is 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese and is believed to be consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. If not for shifting sands and being in an enclosed bay exploration may have not revealed the buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, religious structures, and the seabed was covered with shards of pottery. What really took the scientists by surprise was the discovery of a possible megaron, a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall, which raised the status of the settlement. Marine geologists have still not found out why the settlement sank (as of 2009) theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence because of earthquakes, or a tsunami.            Now from below the sea to the top of the Andes in Peru. The Inca ruled an empire from 1438-1532 that rivaled Rome. They had no formal alphabet or system of writing, they used knots in colored string called quipus to record the calender to keep a count of livestock. Since no one knows what these knots mean the job of understanding the Incas is like solving a puzzle with a missing piece. Most of what we know comes from artifacts and oral history, some of the old stories are known because they were written down by Spaniards in 1532 in letters and diaries. We have to be careful when interpreting these accounts for the Spanish did not know Inca language well. Since being in the dry deserts or cold mountains in Peru some textiles have survived unbelievably well. We know that they fell in 1532 when Spain killed the last Inca king and took over their empire.            About 1400 years ago the Anasazi lived in the Mesa Verde area. The first Anasazi are known as basket-makers for their skill at the craft. They lived in pit-houses on Mesa tops or in cliff recesses. In c. 750 A.D. they built houses above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. They are now known as Puebloans or 'village dwellers'. In A.D 1000 they advanced from pole and adobe to skillful stone masonry walls often rose two or three stories in units of 50 or more and the diet changed mostly to agriculture. Circa 1200 A.D people moved back in the cliff dwellings of their ancestors.Why? No one knows for sure. They used nature to their advantage building beneath overhanging cliffs . In A.D 1300 Mesa Verde was deserted no one knows why.            Did some of these paragraphs leave you hanging? Yes? That is why discoveries are important they don't leave scientists wondering about what happened to these ancient people. So now do you want to go discover something?

Second,Puebloans were very smart, they built there dwellings underneath overhanging cliffs; there basic material was sandstone,they would shape it into rectangular blocks aproximatly the size of a loaf of bread.The mortar between the sandstone was a mixture of mud and water.They lived in the cliff dwellings less than 100 years,by 1300 A.D Mesa Verde was deserted.Because they started to see crop failure, so perhaps they looked for new oppertunities elsewhere.After they left Mesa Verde they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, among there kin that were already there.           Third,Pavlopetri live in Greece there settlement was found beneath waters, the sunken settlement dates were around 5,000 years ago.It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC long before the days of classical Greece. There are older sunken sights in the world but none can be considered towns such as this.They revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildings,the find offers potential insights in the working Mycenaean society.           Finally, thats what is so important about the Inca,Puebloans,and the Pavlopetri.As you can see they are very interestingto learn about.

Examples of these civilizations are the Incans, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri. These discoveries are important in how they have aided us in learning about the past.                  To begin, the discoveries we have made about the Incans help us study their lives. For example, we have uncovered textiles and clothing that can tell us about Incan lifestyle. The style of the clothing hints what the weather may have been like, what resources they had, or even what the fashions were back then. Also, there were bodies uncovered from the Andes that can inform us of what the people ate or how wounds were treated. Not to mention we can learn how the civilization ended.                  In addition, the Puebloans were an important find too. The artifacts left behind tell a story of what events occurred. We know by A.D. 1300, the Puebloans left Mesa Verde. We don't know why currently, but once we find out, we can learn from their mistakes. We would know what not to do in order to prevent that from happening to us. Furthermore, many of the people in Mesa Verde are in some way descended from the Puebloans. By studying them, those people can learn about their ancestors.                 Finally, the Pavlopetri may help us understand more about one of the infamous legends heard around the world, the legend of the city of Atlantis. This civilization may result in us finally knowing if the city of Atlantis ever did really exist. It will let us learn more about the evolution of us also. We can study the architecture and the way the city is set up. And let's not forget how this will keep underwater exploration going in hopes of finding more things.                 To close, discoveries of past civilizations have aided us greatly. From them we have learned how the people's lives were back then, how they built shelters, and how our civilizations came to be as they are today. Hopefully, we will continue in uncovering more miraculous finds.

Though we have found many relics that come from our past scientists still have a long way to go to find a great portion of our history. Recently scientists have discovered what is the remains of an ancient Inca civilization The Inca textiles and clothing have been recovered from the site and have survived remarkably well. This find shows us what the Inca's once used as clothing. We have discovered that the Inca's were buried in caves in cliff faces and on mountain tops. Doing this has helped preserve the sights, because looters cannot easily get to them. the Inca didn't have a formal alphabet or system of writing. Using a portrait you can identify many different topics such as religion, art, and architecture. Most of what we know comes from oral history or stories passed down from generation to generation???.       Long ago their were the pueblos who had chosen there settlement to be Mesa Verde. They made pithouses to live in from the years of A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde advanced from pithouses to thicker walls, double coursed stone often rose 2 or 3 stories high and were joined into 50 rooms or more. Fires built in summer were mainly for cooking. In winter many fires  burnt throughout the village. when the people of Mesa Verde left they traveled south into new Mexico and Arizona.                 Do you know the myth based on The Lost City of Atlantis? Scientists have discovered what is supposedly Atlantis. A city found at the bottom of the ocean. their is not very information that could be recovered because of the artifacts being submerged for so long. It was found near Neapolis. the investigation revealed 9,000 square meters of buildings.       These three sites have shown scientists many different things about many different locations and people. With these discovers scientist have learned a lot more about our ancient history. 	NNP DT IN PRP$ NN RB VB VBN .

All three llost Civilization were important from past world to the modern world. They were the first to make important things that were used today.                              The Incas of Peru didn't have Alphabelt or system of writing. The europeans were amazed when they found out about the Incas were able to keep a huge empire with just writing it into a strings of records. The Incas lived in the high Andes Mountain many of their sites are in high remotes areas. They were known for nearly a hundred years and rivaled against rome.  They were the first one to make portriats of their religion, art, architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. The Fall of the Incas was when the spaniards murdered the Last Inca king in 1532. This Information discovered by archeologist made them think what they did and didn't to make them survive in that time. The cold mountains in the Andes act liuke giant freezer for dead bodies from the incas.                                           The Puebloans lived about 1400 years ago before europeans explored North America   A group of people living in the four corners chose masa verde as their home. In A.D 1200s in the span of a generation they left their homes and moved away. The Puebloans were known for their craftmanship and started building pithouses clustered into a small village usually built on a mesa tops. They also made pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for a more efficient weapon for hunting and a spear thrower. In A.D 750 they began building houses from above ground with a upright walls made of poles and mud. By A.D 1000 they had evovled their houses from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone mastery. The Puebloans then began building Kivas a ceremonial chamber in front of rooms. Archeologist studied the tools and items their used in their time to learn more about what they did to their empire, trading, and their civilization. The archeologist were amazed what the puebloans mad for shelter the pithouse.  About A.D 1300 mesa verde was deserted. Several theories offer reasons for their migration. By A.D 1200s saw drought and crop failures. When cliff dwellers of mesa verde left they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kins who were already there.                                                            The secrets of the lost cites in southern greece was found by marine geologist and archeologist. they were known as the pavloperti the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years ago the time of homer heroes. It is the oldest submerged town remaining beneath the waters dates back from 2800 to 1200 Bc long before the glory of days of the classical greece. It straddles 30,00 sqaure meter of thge ocean floor of the southern Peloponnese and has been believed it was consumed by the sea around 1000 bc and was discovered by a british explorer some 40 years ago. They found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age. It has over 9,000 square meters of new building. Marine geologist and archeologist were amazed and suprised on what the discovered and find under beneath the ocean of southern greece.                                       Archeologist found something important about the three different civilization in different places. They learn about what the did to survive against intruders and what cause them to disappear around that time. Archeologist also learned the tools they made before were still used in the modern world today.

These ancient civilizations allow us greater knowledge of our past as human beings and will further let us improve our qualities of life.   The Ancient Inca ruled for nearly one hundred years. Throughout this time they were able to run a huge empire using strings, called quipus, to keep records. The Inca had no written language or alphabet, so it is fascinating to learn more about them through different artifacts including clothing and every day items. One main reason archaeologists study the Inca is because of their well preserved artifacts. Artifacts hidden in the Andes mountain are still in very good condition even after hundreds and hundreds of years. With these we can more easily learn about the past of people before us.   The lost city of Pavlopetri has confirmed many people's beliefs that there is an Atlantis. This city has been submerged for 5,000 years and is now being explored by divers in southern Greece. Untouched by nothing but sea life and water, this city is intriguing to everyone.  It is in our human nature to be curious about the things unknown to us.   The Pueblans were an interesting people. living in a desert, they somehow managed to live in it's harsh conditions for many years. Their place of stay was deserted, though, and no one quite knows why. They left no sign of why they left, so it is only in our nature to be curious as to what happened to them.   These civilizations are a good example for why empires and civilizations like these are so important. This is classified as history, and we need to know history so we know what things turned out well and things that did not turn out well. It is important to not repeat the mistakes we have made before, and history allows us to learn from them.

First, all the important civilizations have helped us discover how they lived. For example, they artifacts found give certain details about what they wore and what they made their houses out of. We have come to the detail that many of the civilizations explored are advanced in a way that their houses had a perfect structure.         Secondly, the way that many of the people knew what time of day it was and how they calculated their years is sort of impressing. For example, lunar calendars is how we have come up with a more developed form of the year. The phases of the moon is an incredible discovery made by the civilizations and everyone after them trying to adjust it and make the exact calculations correct, so we are not off by one-fourth of a day in the year.         Third, their every day routine explain if they accustomed their day to the same activities or did something new. With the knowledge of what they had, like textiles and clothing that doesn't get destroyed by dampness, heat , or other extreme temperature.         Apart from being intelligent and discovering certain things we don't fully understand, they were able to be advanced in certain things we don't know of yet. I think that what have discovered to this day, are incredible in the case that it helps better understand what concepts they did use and how they used certain tools we have not yet discovered to this day.

It is also important because if we don't know about history we'll repeat it like boy bands in the 80's and 90's...we are repeating them now. Not good! Plus if we were to repeat the past of the Inca we would be in the sticks and stones era once again which would be a total demotion of compared to the tecknology we have acheived today. In the end that is why knowing our history is important. No more sticks and stones!

Archeaologists are so interested in the history of ancient cultures that they travel the world locating civilizations and uncovering artifacts that may have been deemed unimportant to the people of the civilization.Those artifacts are what we use to learn about ancient societies and we treasure them like they are pure gold.              Many people who become archeaologists do not simply say they are fine with not knowing of the ancient worlds around them and look to further our education of those worlds. They do this not only because they love history, but also because they want other people to learn about these societies and become archeaologists themselves.             Archeaologists are not the only people with this interest, historians also learn about the ancient cities and gladly tell people all they can about early civilizations and their inventions.              Many ancient civilizations have created many things they need to survive in their environments, and the first ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde are a great example. They were known as basketmakers because of their skill with that particular craft. They also settled down from their nomadic period and started farming instead of hunting and gathering. They lived in pithouses in small villages mostly built on mesa tops and occasionaly in cliff recesses. They made pottery, bows and arrows and a spear thrower.             There are examples of evolution when the Puebloans started making houses above ground with a few pithouses. They then started to use stone to build their supplies and dwellings and progressed greatly until they moved back into the cliff alcoves their ancestors had lived in before them.              Many other civilizations evolved the same way the Puebloans had, including the lost city in Greece. This city had been submerged by water nearly 5,000 years ago and is the oldest submerged town in the world. Marine archeologists examined this city and were fascinated by it and its artifacts.              People should know about the past because things could happen again and they need to be prepared for it. They might also like to know about their ancestors and this is a good way to do that.

Discovering these civilizations helped us find more and more civilizations that we haven't heard of.     The finding of the lost city helped us discover how to find more things underwater. When they started to find artifacts underwater such as the potery that they made they new they were close to the soon to be found lost city of Greece.     The Inca civilization was another great finding in history. The Inca did not have a writing or a number system. They used quips which were knots in colored string to count their cattle. The Inca were very hard to get to because they lived in the Allps. It was hard for the archioligist to get their equiptment to the the top.     The Puebloans were nomads until they finally settled. They made their own weapons to hunt animals for food. They made their own houses. They were called pithouses. It had an air deflector, antechamber that stored bins or pits. Were later evolved into kivas. They advanced from pole-and-adobe construction and did skillfull stone masonry.     These discovories helped us do better at finding other actient cities. Discovering about the Inca helped us know what to do when we look for a city in high mountain regions. The finding of the lost city helped us find other things underwater. These ancient citys helped us in every day life.

The first civilization were the Incas. Historians and archaeologists who have studied this civilization have discovered anicent artifacts and objects from the Incas. Some historians have some ideas that before the fall of the Incas, the Spaniards murdered the last Inca king in 1532 and had taken over the empire. Archaeologists used techinques to discover more hidden artifacts and even hidden sites. The next civilization was the Mesa Verde Puebloans. From around 1,400 years ago,longer than the Europeans discovered America, a group chose Mesa Verde as their home. In the late A.D. 1200's, they had left their homes. the first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They began their way of living. They lived in villages in small clusters all over. They lived in houses, and in pithouses. As they began to grow, their population was grew too.The last civilization is The Lost City of Atlantis. This civilization is very unique because people didn't know if was a myth or it actually existed. This civilization was a perfect world. It straddles at 30,000 square meters of the ocean floor. An archaeologist belived that it was submerged by a war a long time ago. The shifting sands and the settlement's enclosure help discover a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures. There was also thousands of shards of pottery everywhere. Archaeologists found ceramics that were from the end the stone age. Investigations reveled 9,000 square meters of new incredible buildings.

The Ancient Incas settled in a part of the Andes Mountains located on the edge of South America. We have found a object with knotted strings called a quipus. We believe that the color of the strings and how many knots on each string can be used as a type of record keeping device used by Incan 'runners'. But on top of that scientists have found burials on the freezing Andes Mountain Ranges. Since the bodies are well preserved we can use the information to find out what type of burial they had and how they died.              Before they settled in Mesa Verde the Ancestral Puebloans were supposedly nomadic. but for some reason they started to farm more often and eventually settled in a cliff filled area. They lived in homes called pit houses that were clustered into small villages. They started to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow. This weapon was a great achievement because it was more efficient than the atlatl, a almost spear type weapon.                  of the coast of the lower part off Greece, divers and scientists have discovered and under water city. The city dates back to 1000 B.C. In the submerged city they have discovered courtyards, buildings, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. But on top of that the ocean bed was littered with thousands of shards of pottery. The ceramics had been dated back to the end of the stone age, about 5,00 years ago. Its has also been thought to the myth of the underwater city 'Atlantis'. But this also may not be the last underwater city we'll find, because so far only 1% of the worlds ocean has been explored.

First, the Incas were very helpful because of what they did like make a calendar called a quipus, and making their own language, religion, art,architectutre, agriculture, governmant, transportation, and the way of life.

Most societies have a written language even the inca, although we have yet to discover what it is. Can you imagin having to discover a whole language just in a civilization?           The civilations have alot of things different like gods, beleifs and activities. Also is the city of atlantis real? There were hundreds of different civilization all being monotheist or believing in many gods.

They have found many artifacts, pottery, buildings, writings, oral stories, and drawings. These tell archaeologists their way of life, religion, agriculture, political and social life, origin, and their fall.             The Incas, Puebloans, and the sunken city have many undiscovered mysteries. The Incas never created a writing system but left many other things that we can study to learn about them. They made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep count of livestock. Archaeologists cant uncover the meaning of these quipus. They ruled a South American empire from 1438 to 1532 using this system. The origin of the Incas is still a mystery. The Anasazi also called Puebloans flourished on Mesa Verde for more than 700 years. They lived in a place with rough terrain and bad climate for agriculture but still settled. They moved away from it for an unknown reason. They lived in the Four Corners region before they settled in Mesa Verde. An Anglo-Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists found a sunken ancient city near southern Greece. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC. This is the oldest sunken  city found. Also, these dates are near the time Atlantis is believed to have sunken. It has brought back the idea of Ancient Atlantis. Archaeologist do not know the reason why the city sank 5,000 years ago or who inhabited it. Archaeologists are finding artifacts, buildings, and writings to uncover these things.             These 3 ancient civilizations left many mysterious thing for archaeologists to uncover. The Incas left the quipus and how they first began. The Puebloans left their homeland for a reason unknown to us. The ancient city near southern Greece left us with the theory that Atlantis can be a real city that sank. There are many undiscovered mysteries that ancient civilizations leave us. These are just three.

The Inca civilization was controlled by the Aztecs and they had taken over and the Inca empire was gone like that. In southern Greece many people think that there had been a city that had sunk under water 5,000 years ago. This could be a myth but a lot of archaologists have enough evidence to prove it just might be true. Archaeologists have also discovered its not just that city in southern Greece. There are many other cities in the world that have been lost and have sunk into the ocean for a long time.

Some might say a time machine, magic, or Google. Well that is wrong! Today we discover things about the past because of archeologists. Archeologists discover ancient civilizations and study their artifacts to try to know and learn about the people that lived there.               Sometimes archeologists have a hard time putting the pieces of the past together. Its not easy to pick up a strange object and discover what it is. Archeologist have to study it and record what they found. But you can learn alot through the artifacts. You can learn about their religion, gouverment, daily lives, and more.            The ancient Inca was a civilization in Peru. Archeologist discovered that they lived in the Andes Mountains. They may have even worshiped some mountain tops. But there is a mystery about them. They used string and tie it in knots. They believe it might have been used as a calender or to keep track of livestock, but archeologists are still not sure. This find is importand because the Inca had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They could not have written down events or what the string was used for. So this find has left archeologists puzzled.            Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. Archeologists discovered that they were farmers and made good quality baskets. They lived in Pithouses which were underground. They eventually moved their homes ontop instead of underground and built them into skillfull stone masonry. But then they migrated and began building their homes in the sides of cliffs. Why would they suddenly move and build their homes in strange places? Archeologists say it could be because of drout, but they have survived many drouts before. Archeologists have studied, analyzed, and compaired them, but they still have little knowlage. This find is important because it is still a mystery.            Atlantis was once a great city in ancient Greece, but is now underwater. Archeologists discovered that the whole city is undwerwater. People used to live in Atlantis and may have been home to wealthy people. It is still unknown how the entire city made its way underwater. Before people in Greece thought Atlantis was a legend, but thanks to all the discoveries people are very exited about it. This discovery is so important because it is still a mystery how the city made it underwater. Some archeologists think its because of an earthquake or a tsunami. We may never find out.            These are few of many reasons why artifacts are so signifigant. When you find an artifact you may discover something new about a civilization's gouverment or agriculture. You might even discover an entirally new civilization. You could even find out some mysteries of the past. So never stop looking for answers.

They have brought many cultures and ideas from other locations and locations around them. Three ancient civilizations are the Incas, the Puebloans, and the Pavlovian. The discoveries of these three ancient civilizations are very important. They each have a role in our old and new society because some people still follow many of their cultural ideas.           The Incas would use colorful string to make knots and use them to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. In our time, historians have found these strings and are trying to find out the true meaning behind the knots. It's more like a mystery that hasn't been solved. Historians are still trying everything.                                                                 The Puebloans were significant because they chose Mesa Verde as their home. For more than seven hundred years, them and their descendants lived and flourished there, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered acloves of the canyon walls. In the late 1200s A.D., the Puebloans left their homes and moved away in a span of a generation or two.                                                                                                                   The Pavlovians were cliff dwellers. They used nature to their advantages. They used sandstone to create their buildings which they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread. They used a mixture of mud and water to stick the rectangular blocks together. Then they created rooms and other buildings with these materials. Rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, space enough for two or three persons. The Palvovians lived in cliff dwellings for less than 100 years. By about 1300 A.D., Mesa Verde was deserted.

We get to see how things were built and how they are different from ours today. We also can look at what they did wrong so that we people do not follow in those foot steps.        They are important because they all are very old in our history. Also these thing show how much our world has changed from that time till today. The Lost city of Greek was the largest myth in the world. Are archaeologists today love finding things like the Lost city of Greek, Acient Inca, Mesa Verde, and stuff because its really fun too get to explore those things.           The artifacts that are important for the ancient civilization to leave behind for the people from the future to study are buildings, artwork, tools, pottery, details, language, religious pieces, documents, and there lifestyle.

They now know more about how ancient people lived and what they were like, or secrets they had. Acheologists have been studying Inca territory, or grounds and have discovered many things. Such as how they wrote, learned, raised animals, and what/how they ate. Also what they wore and did for a living.   It took long and hard search effort to find these artifacts. But now we know more about the lost city. It was the oldest submerged city.

I'm just going to start off easy. The inca have alot of information about them. The spanish have left many stories behind talking about the inca. Even though most of it they didn't understand the incas. We are able to get information out of things like clothing and other artifacts.                   We can learn lots about the pueploans like they lived in Mesa Verde for about 700 years! WOW! They learned how to farm,hunt, they even learned how to have stronger homes made out of stone. They managed to have up to thousands of people liveing in Mesa Verde. they became very advanced they learned how to survive peacefully for all those years. (somebody should teach Obama that)                  Last off we have the 'Lost Greek city.' This is what may have inspired the 'lost city of atlantis' myth. We have been able to learn that this is the oldest submerged city in the whole world. What we can get out of this information is the kind of tools,pottery,language paintings,documents and even more. We can learn what kind of religions they had.

These are all very important discoveries, and I'll tell you why.         First, lets start off with The Ancient Inca's. This find was important because, we got a better understanding of the Incas. Like, archaeologists have found many ancient quipus, which were used to keep records, but today no one knows what the knots mean. Also, that their civilization is nearly a hundred years (1438-1532). I think this is so important overall because we learned things about the Incas we never could have just thinking about, we had to go and investigate what things were, who they were, and what they did, and thats why I think the Incas are so important.          Next, we have the Ancestral Puebloans and their world. This find was important because, we got a better understanding of this ancient culture. Like archaeologists have found that the Puebloans lived in Pithouses which featured a living room sunk a few feet in the ground, and four corner timbers supported the roof. They were also known as the Basket makers. Now this find was important because, it practically took us back into the ancient civilization. Thats why I think its important.            Finally, we have the Lost Greek city. This find was important because, the secrets of a lost city that may inspired one of the world's most enduring myths, Atlantis, this might be where those myths started. Also what archaeologists found surpassed all expectations. thats why I think this is an important find.              So, this is why I think that these finds are so important, and 'why do we keep searching?' people ask because its about history, and that we are so curious all the time, it's just like nature for humans. So, thats why I think this is so important.

They all have created things for our use in this time and age. The things that they created are very usefull to us now. They have left clues behind such as art for archaeologist to know which culture created it. But the Inca did not leave things for them to study.    The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. They did not leave archives for historians to study. The Inca made knots in colored string called quipus to record the calander to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Clues left behind by the Inca form a portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. when archaeologist study these clues they can piece together details of Inca life. As many ancient civilizations, Inca artifacts might be objects made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver. Some Inca sites have been distured by treasure hunters, or looters who will take anything that might be valuable. The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peeks, Some Inca were buried in caves or cliff faces.   The first ancestral Puebloans setteled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft. They were beginning to lead a more setteled way of life. Farming replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. They learned to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow a more efficient weapon for hunting and the atlatl which is a spear theower. These were fairly prosperous times for the basketmakers, and their population multiplied. About A.D. 750 they began building houses above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. They built the houses one against anotgher in long curving rows often with a pithouse or two in front. From here on these people are known as Puebloans a spanish word meaning village dwellers.   The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths the fable of Atlantis have been brought to light from beneath the wateres off southern Greece. Explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist and known as pavlopetri the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homers heroes and in terms of size and waelth of detail is inprecedented. There is now no doubt that this is the oldest submerged town in the world. What they found surpassed all expectations. Thanks to shifting sand and the settlements enclosure in a protected bay the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyeards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious stuctures. In addition the seabed was replete with thousand of shards of  pottery. It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken contient of Atlantis.

Things that were left behind from Inca were beautiful colections of art &amp; agriculture, A potriat of thier religon, goverment, &amp; transpotation most people would say. Many People Who Studied The civilization of Inca sometimes get it from oral history as in background knowledge , that many wise people who passed it down from generation, to generation. Pasing stories claim to be very important way to preserve a community's history. The stories came from Europeans that had written down when they arrived in the empire, in the year of 1532. The other knowledge of Inca came from Artifacts &amp; Tools (objects) They left behind. Most Inca artifacts are made from stone sometimes Pottery, gold, or silver. surprisenly Some textiles &amp; clothing are in great shape as well , but ancient materials like cloth are most likely distoyed.

Archaeologist like to find old things like these and it's because they are old and more than likely have some old and valuable things inside them.       Scientists are excited about this discovery because they have discovered that this city is by far the oldest city on the PLANET.       But some things people should probably leave behind for people to discover in the future are statues, jewelry, gold, and other animated stuff like that.       Archaeologists do not know how the Inca lived, but the Inca left behind some great clues that Archaeologists used to discover this lost place. If it weren't for the Inca, this place might not have been discovered!!

Archaeologists have worked very hard to find evidence of these ancient people.       The Inca people are located in Peru. Many stories of the Inca were passed down from generation to generation. These sources of innformation are not as trusted because many stories are considered to be legends and are not all true. Although, clues have been left behind of the ways of the people. Artifacts are found hundreds or even thousands of years later. Mostly buried in the ground, some artifacts were taken by looters. Anything that they could find that was valuable was taken. Many of the important things were taken therefore, we do not know as much about these sites. Archaelologists keep records of any artifacts that are found. Many artifacts were preserved from the high peaks of the Andes mountains. Looters often did not visit these sites because they were so well hidden. These artifacts are very important in reevaluting the great Incan empire.       The people of the Mesa Verde land built their homes from stone in the canyon walls. The Basketmakers were known for their skill at the craft. Farming became their way to get food. These people moved back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their family many generations before. We do not know why they moved away from their homes. There are many different possibilites for the change. No written records have been left for the cliff dwellers, so we may never know the story. The structures that archaeologists have discovered have left evidence of skills and traditions that these people once had. The overhang from the cliffs preserved the homes of the people. We now know the way the people made their homes. Archaeologists have discovered that there might have possibly been a drought which caused the people to leave. The land had been used very much and began to deplete the resources.       Near the city of Neapolis, an ancient city lies beneath the sea. Atlantis was perhaps the only planned city. Atlantis is the oldest sunken city in the world. Marine archaeologist have surveyed the area with the aid of digital technology. The city was preserved with the help of shifting sands and the areas protective bay. Artifacts were found from the end of the stone age. Marine archaeologists do not know why the city was sunk. The waters around the city are shallow which is very interesting. The land around contained many ancient people who knew what had happened but time has since stopped the information.       There are many other civilizations that archaeologists know nothing about. That will not keep them from exploring knew places and trying to find out the ways of the people.

There are many ways we can learn about the past like reading books and going to a museam. The past can teach us many things we don't know. It can even teach us how we have the technology we have now.                                                                                                     The discoveries of the Incas is important because archaeologists can learn how they lived and where they lived. The location that they found can tell how they got their food.  Some things found are material like cloth that survived well.  The artifacts found can tell how they lived everyday life.  The most important thing about the Incas is learning where they came from and what happened to them.  The Inca civilization still has mysteries.       The Puebloans made stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of canyon walls.  These people were known as basketmakers for their skill at the craft.  These people learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow for hunting.  The buildings rooms averaged six feet by eight feet, enough space for two or three people.                             The Pavlopetri people have a city that was submerged and lost.  Archaeologists are still finding artifacts of the ancient civilization. The artifacts found are ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age.  And this is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece and this makes archaeologists think that maybe there are more sunken cities. These are why the discoveries are so important.

The discoveries that the scientist have made over time with the Incas, are important   because all the people that are living in our society today, started to wonder what life was back in the like 13 hundrens-15 hundrends. So they began to search in caves, under water, and more, they finally started to discover a lot more then they thought. Its so important because nobody that lives now most likely didnt live in the 13 hundrens. Come to find out the Incas left alot of clues behind, They would leave books and stories and diaries. They found drawings and all kinds of stuff. The Europeans wrote down a lot of stories and thats how we know them.           Source two.   Back around a long tim ago people lived in pithouses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750. The firepit had an air deflector. Antechamber might contain storage bins or pits. Between A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had asvanced from pole-and-adobe concentrated.       Source three.   They had divers that would find all the clues under the waters. The secret of a lost city that may have inspired one of the worlds most enduring myths. This lost city is the first city that has been found underwater in Greece.

The submerged city that divers say they found was the eldest submerged town in the world no doubt.       30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese is believed to have been consumed by the sea in 1000 BC. Divers found artifacts dating back to the end of the stone age which proved that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago.          According to Anglo there are artifacts that date back almost 5,000 years.        Knowledge of underwater city's have improved and signified the more complicated technology we are using to find things.   buildings, tools and pottery help us figure out that things did exist back then. and that maybe Atlantis wasn't sunken for long.       Older generations knew something was there but we didnt know the extent of it.   Atlantis is a myth but its a myth that keeps people searching for more clues that it could be real.

They all have very important civilizations that show us several things like how they lived, archaeology, agraculuture, pottery, and so on. Lets break it up to talk more specifically about the civilizations.                 First lets talk about the Icans in the article they didn't have any formal system of writing. They kept strings with knots as a calender but since their is nobody left to read it it is still a mystery. Some of what we all know about the Incas is from stories passed down from generation to generation. Historians had to be careful interpreting these accounts because the spainereds didn't speak the Icans language well so their descriptions might no be accurate. The rest of our knowledgee comes from artifacts and their settlements, some were gold, silver, stone, or potery. they lived in the mountian tops of the Andes so their location also helped to preserve sites from looters that stole anything valuable. Bodies that are found in the Andes are in such good shape that experts use modern scanning technology to find out how they died to help them reveal info about how they lived.            Next is the Puebloians, they lived in what is now the Messa Verde National park. The 1st Puebloians were basket weavers. they also replaced farming with hunting and gathering food as a livilihood. They lived in pithouses which later led to kivas (houses above ground). They learned to make potery, bows and arrows.wide spred of potery led to the decline in basket quality. They used mostly sand stone to build with. they lived in cliffdwells for less than 100 years. They saw in the 1200s there was a drought and a failure of crops. so they moved on to New Mexico and Arizona.               Last is the povlopetrians, they most likely lived in the lost city of alantas(the only concidered planned town) which is now submurged underwater and dates back to 5,000 yearsto the time of homers heros.

Accordinng to Archaelogy unlocks secrets of the clues left behinde about the Inca  form an amazing portriat of their reliogion,art,and architecture, agiculture, goverment, transportation and way of life. Since these clues archaeologist and others are starting to piece together the Incas life.    Some thing we know about the Inca comes from oral history, stories passed down to new generations. The rest of are knowledge comes from artifacts , or objects that the Inca have left behinde. Some of the thing they have left behinde pottery, gold silver. Some of the Incas clothing have survived!    Thing we know about the Incas, They lived in the Andes  there is reason to beileve they worshiped the mountin peaks. Most of there sites are in high places. Some incas were barried in caves. Mountin climbers have found bodys, the ice act as a giant freezer. Most of the bodies are in good shape.       About 1,400 years ago Puebloans Lived on this earth. They lived in Mesa Verde, they built stone communities in canyon walls. these stone houses were two or 3 stories and were joined into units of 50 rooms or more They also changed pottery from a simple designe on a dull gray back ground to black drawings on a white back ground.     Then in late 1200s in the span of a generation or tqo, they left and moved away.  According to Mesa Verde National Park Ancetral Puebloans and their world they beileve they could of left because of a drought  or maybe therre recorses like soil, forest, and animal were ruined. Or perhaps there were social and political problems and they simply looked for new opportunties. No one will really no the reasons they left.

They are important because without them we would know very little about our own society and ancestory.That is why I think we should learn about all these things to know more about ourselves.                     To support my statement,the Inca one of the least advanced but most succesful civilizations of all time.We never would have known about them without the discoveries made. According to the article by Beth Gruber they had no writing or number systems.                      Then according to MesaVerde Ancesteral Puebloens they no written records because they were just farmers as their trade. Also they had no system of counting,but they were excellent weavers but as pottery became more prominent they began to slack in their weaving skills,and became great at pottery.                      Now that you know the facts you can make up your mind.I find it fascinating. 	NNP NNS NNP PRP VB DT DT DT NNS VBN VBP JJ .

And how long they lived archaeologists try to find out about civilizations and to tell people about history.       They try to recover artifact without damiging them so they could be displayed in a mucem. Archaeologists work hard to try to find artifacts that are interesting and have alot of meaning to them. Like the sunkon city that was found in Greece. They called it a very unique find they found       religious structures and thousands of shards of pottery Amounge other things. And th disifer different types of alphabet or system of writing. And the different way they used the calander if they lived in different parts if the country and in different climate there life style would be different.       Like how they hunted and what they hunted for and how they built there houses andf what they built there houses with.   Still today no one knows what the dots maen and the string.   They do know some old storys that where writen down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532.       When  sivilization leave things like objects made of stone or pottery , gold, or silver. Some ancient site have been diserbared by treasure hunters and whatever they take is sold. Many of the site have been in remate places. So now u know About ancient civilizations.

Well, thanks to scientist who research these ancient civilizations, now you can learn. Scientists, like the ones from National Geographic and different national parks, are working hard to uncover some of the worlds greatest, forgotten civilizations.        Now you may ask, 'What's so great about settlements that have nothing to do with me?' but in reality, these lost cities have all the world to do with you. These discoveries are extremely important because they teach us how people lived way back when. They tell us everything about that civilization, from what they are, to their religion, to what they did in their free time. We can use these discoveries to invent new things to make our  life easier.        For instance, scientists have located an invention from the Inca's called quipus that helped them keep count of their livestock. From this invention, we know that the Inca's were farmers. From this discovery, scientists have invented a new and more advanced tool for the present day.        From the Puebloans, scientists have located church like structures up in the sides of mountains. Theses churches, called kivas, tell us that these Puebloans were very religious. In these kivas. they have ventilators, air deflectors, fire pits and all of these things, we use right now. These kivas have been around for quite a while and have shown us inventions that we use daily.        Last, but not least, is the sunken city of Pavlopetri. This city from southern Greece has opened up a whole new world for marine scientists. Divers located this sunken city off the coast of southern Greece. Scientists have found underwater settlements before, but this particular one was put together just as it was on land. They found streets, tombs, buildings, religious structures and thousands of shards of pottery. These discoveries suggest that they did practice a religion and the women liked to make pottery in their free time. The discovery of Pavlopetri has made scientists realize that not all ancient settlements are found on land. Sometimes, you just have to look a little bit deeper.

I think its realy amazing that the inca did so many things that change the world and that they left behind things so that we can later study them and improve them.                              The people get inspired and fascinated to find a civilization that has been lost for many years and because theres always a history of the lost civilization. just like the lost city of greek was found. that lost city was important because it was one of the biggest lost civilization ever found and it was replete. many people were amazed because the lost civilization they found was a whole city that had a court yard, buildings, streets, grave yard, and a kingdom. The first Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. They are known as a Basketmakers for their skill at the craft. they lived in a pithouse clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in cliff recesses. later on about A.D. 750 they began to build houses above ground, with upright walls made of poles and mud.as time whent by the people started to add rooms in there homes and started makeing them better and bigge.                                Learning and studying things from the Ancient inca is important because thats how in the fute we can improve the world like now we have more advanced technoloy, science, and etc. by the things that have been found from the Ancient inca we kinda off have am idea of how the inca live and how they protected themselfs. the one thing we dont know is how they cured them selfs everytime they would get sick. but  today we know how to cure some disseases and that has saved many lifes of other people. the inca were really smart when they were alive they build citys and kingdoms. basicly they built every cit but today people fix them because the citys get old and damaged.                  The inca should of left a book of reciepe and what i mean is a book where it tells us how they lived how they survived and how they built stuffs.or what they ate. that would of been a good thing of them to leave something like that. maybe they did and we just cant find it but well never know untill there's prof. most of the ideas that the humans have comes from the inca's like the invention of the calanders.but the invention of light and etc was invinted by a human after the inca's were alive. the wierd things is how did the inca nd the mayas build the phyrimids and the rocks that are placed in the center of the sun when it goes down. i wonder how they did that because i dont think that the inca and the mayas were hug enough to build a pyrimid or maybe they were, we will never know maybe someday we will but theres have to be a sign of their existing.

In ancient Inca of Peru there was no alphabet or system of writing, so how would someone from today learn from them in like the 1400's. Luckily there were some ways to learn from them and even others or other things in the past. Clues left behind by the Inca develop amazing portraits of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life. Because archaeologists study these clues, they can gather information of Inca life. Somethings that people know about them come from stories passed from generation to generation, or books and such. The rest of the knowledge comes from artifacts/objects left behind from the past. every single piece of evidence they find, they use to put information together and create a story.            The Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde. They were known for their skill at the craft. They began to lead a more settled way of life. They had a huge population, it had multiplied. Houses were constructed and built from different, well obtained material. Pottery was changed from simple designs on dull gray backgrounds to black drawings on white background. farming accounted for more of their diet then before, much mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture. From 1100 to 1300 A.D. the population grew even larger. People began to move into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestor centuries. The structures are evidence of society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and were passed on from generation to generation.        The ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. Marine archaeologists aided by digital technology were able to properly survey the ruins. They found something that surpassed all expectations; ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that settlement was occupied some million years ago. They also descovered many buildings that were destroyed, and a town that had been used by an elite. For the first time a sunken city had been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis.

Many artifacts can tell many different things about a civilization how they lived, even who or what they worshiped. Also so structures of buildings may also help tell Archeologist how the advancements in their technology was. Like the Incas for example they used string call quipus to record and keep track of their livestock. Another example is where they lived, the Incas lived in very high and remote places, some may have even worship mountain peaks. For another example take the Pueblo-ans they first settled in Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. they are known as Basket-makers for their skills at crafting. They learned how to built their own houses call Pit-houses. Later they have advanced in such way to have made pole-and-adobe which was like stone masonry. One other example is the lost city of Atlantis it dates back long ago it is believed to be the oldest sunken city with many artifacts.              So the importance of an archeologist is to find out about the earths history so that we can have knowledge on how many ancient civilzations have lived and survive for  many years.

The Inca made knot in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records.           Archaeolgists have found many acnient quipus... but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings , understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.

The discoveries are important because it helps us know the history of the places, how they lived, and their way of life.       The ancient Inca of Peru has left behind some items that help us figure out how they live. For example, there were knots that were found and no one knows what the knots actually mean. Also there are clues about their religion, art, agriculture, government, transportation, and their way of life. Also stories have been passed down telling us about the history. Most of the knowledge comes from artifacts or objects left behind. Inca artifacts could be made from stone, pottery, gold, or silver and can last for a long time. Archaeologist can learn much about Inca from what all they have found.       Archaeologist have been able to discover that Puebloans would live in houses made out of mud and poles. Also they have learned that farming has replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. also they were able to find out that throughout the summer fires were used to cook and in the winter they were used throughout the villags.       Learning all of this information helps archaeologist know how people use to live in different places around the world. Also this helps us know what all we have in common and the difference between then and now.

There are lots of interesting things in the ocean that surround you. Some of the things you may not be aware of. The ocean has a plentiful amount of exotic animals. It also has ancient civilizations.       Archaeologist search the ocean each day for priceless artifacts. (Artifacts are objects that help you reveal things about the past.) Archaeologist have found three major civilizations underneath the ocean from the past. One of the civilizations was found beneath the waters off southern Greece. Another Civilization was found  in Mesa Verde. The last civilization was found in Inca.      The civilization that was found beneath the waters off southern Greece was believed to be the city that may have inspired one of the world's most  incredible myths - the fable of Atlantis. This civilization was explored by an Anglo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist.This settlement straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese.This site was discovered by a British oceanographer. However, what they found surpasses all their expectations.     The civilization in Mesa Verde started over 1,400 years ago, long before the Europeans explored North America. The descendants stayed in Mesa Verde until the late 1200s A.D. Archaeologist called these people Anasazi. Now, we call them Ancestral Puebloans. The first Ancestral Puebloans settled about 550  A.D. They are known for their skilled craftsmanship of baskets. Farming was their main livelihood. They lived in small pit houses clustered into very small villages. About 750 A.D, they began building their houses above ground. These houses were more moderns. From here on, these descendents were known as Puebloans. By 1000 A.D, the people of Mesa Verde  had advanced to stone masonry. Between 1100-1300 A.D, the population may have reached several thousand. About 1200 A.D, the population shifted back to the cliff alcoves that had sheltered their ancestors. Archaeologist have yet to find out why they moved back to the cliff  alcoves. They lived in the cliff dwellings for over 100 years. by about 1300 A.D, Mesa Verde was deserted. The cliff dwellers were reported in the 1880s. Archaeologist will never know the full story because they left no written records.     The civilization that was found in Inca has no system of writing. They did not leave any archives for historians to study. This civilization ruled a South American empire. Some of what we know about Inca comes from oral history (stories passed from generation to generation.) Oral history was an important way to preserve a community's history. Some of the stories were written down  by Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. Historians have to carefully interpret these accounts. The Spaniards may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descriptions may not be accurate. Inca left behind few artifacts. Unfortunately, some of the Incas sites have been disturbed by looters.  The Incas lived in the high Andes. Most of their sites were in high, remote places.This is a good thing because it's not easy for looters to  get to the artifacts.      These civilizations are important because they tell us about how people from the past lived. We can get useful ideas from our ancestors.  It is also important because it tells the scientist about how the climate has changed. We can learn many things from the ancient civilizations. 	NNP PRP RB VBD VBG IN DT JJ .

There is much more to be learned about all the  past civilizations of the past that the scientist have not discovered yet and may never discover.

For more than 700 years they and their descendants lived and flourished here. People will make there homes that was called pit-houses the living room sunk a few feet in the ground. People lived in pit-houses from about A.D. 550 to A.D. 750, then about A.D. 750 their population multiplied and they began building houses above ground. With upright walls made of poles and mud,they built the houses one against another.   The cliff Dwellers they livied in the cliff that's how they got their names then kivas were the name of the house the roof was made of mud they had a ventilator,bench,airdeflector,fire-pit,sipapu,pilaster. The Kivas were used for healing rites or to pray for rain,luck in hunting, or a good crop. Kiva is a hopi word for ceremonial room, the dwellers basic construction meterial was sandstone that was shaped into a block about the size of a loaf of bread. The rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, space enough for two or three people.Ancestral puebloans lived in the cliff dwellings for less than 100 years.When the cliff dwellers of mesa verda left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, setting among their kin who were already there.   The lost Greek city of Atlantis, The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.In terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented, experts say, it has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC, long before the glory days of classical Greece. The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC. It was discovered by a British oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologists, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. In the area of Neapolis in the seabed was replete with thousands of shards of pottery. This myth about Atlantis keeps underwater exploration going.

There is and it is not Atlantis. It's a submerged city found in southern Greece not that far from Neapolis. It is called Pavlopetri. They're lifestyle is unique and quite like no other ancient civilization. There are many reasons why their unique and I'll tell you how.            The people from the lost city were skilled and educated people. They made many structures and buildings with many detail. Dr. Jon Henderson, a professor at the University of Nottingham, states, 'There are older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as this, which is why its unique.' Also, they made religious structures. In the article, it states, '... the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs and religious structures.' I believe that they made the religious structures to be unified and meet about their religion. They also made rock- cut tombs. I don't believe that anyone made tombs like that, except the Egyptians.            The people also had unknown size and wealth. Experts state,' The sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented.' No one knows how much wealth they have, but its still yet to be discovered. The size of the city was enormous. The article states,' The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.' Also in the article, Henderson states,'Our investigations also revealed over 9,000 square meters of buildings.' All together, they had 39,000 square meters of land! Who knows maybe they discover more meters of land.             Here's a question? 'What happened to the lost city?' In the article, it states, 'Marine geologists have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, earthquakes, or a tsunami.' No one knows how the city sank, but its still trying to be discovered for its disappearance. The article also states, '... is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1000 BC.'  the marine geologists believe that it was by a tsunami, but its still a theory.         Many of the ancient civilizations that we know like the Mayans, Incas, etc. have been amazing, but  we want to know more. You never knew that there was a sunken city, right? Some information of the Pavlopetri is similar to other ancient civilizations and even to ours today, but there's never been a sunken, ancient civilization. That's what makes it unique and there's still more to be discovered of Pavlopetri. We just have to keep on looking. 	DT NNP NNP NNP PRP RB VBD IN DT NN VBG VBN .

Geologists and archaeologists have found a sunken settlement that is about 5,000 years old. An English-Greek team of archaeologists and geologists are exploring the new-found sunken settlement, the size and wealth of the city is very unique.            This settlement is one of the oldest submerged towns in the world. It is unique because it is considered to be a planned town. This means that the people who lived here were smart and civilized. These people were planning to make a civilization. It is believed that the city sunk at around 1000 BCE. The exploration revealed buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures that were preserved by shifting sands and a protected bay. It is believed that the main streets were used for travel and trade. The courtyards were most likely used for coming together or for social gatherings. The buildings must have been very sturdy in order to be able to withstand the impact of when the city was submerged. These people must have been so caught up in trying to create a utopia that they forgot about the possibilities of there being a natural disaster that could wipe them out.             If the city hadn't sunk, it would still be standing today. If you ever want to make a perfect utopian society, then you should not only think about the good things that could happen, but also think of the bad things that could happen. You should always expect the unexpected. 	DT NNP NNP NNP VBD NN VBZ VBN .

Instead they used colored strings called quipus to record the calender to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. They did not leave archives for historians to study. Clues left behaind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way or life. By  studying these clues, archaeologist and others can piece together details of Inca life. Historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language well. They may not have understood what the Inca told them, so their descripions might not be accurate. And some of the Inca stories were ledgends rather than history.           Mesa Verde National Park   Ancestral Puebloans And Their World      Illustrations by NPS/Roy Anderson       About 1,00 years ago, long before Europeans explored North America, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more than 700 years they and their decendants lived and flourished here, eventually builfing elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the can walls. In the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of generation or two, they left their homes and moved away. Mesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archeologist have called these pople Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as 'the ancient ones' or  'ancientenemies.' We now call them Ancestral Puebloans, reflecting their modern decendants.       Lost Greek city that may have inspired    Atlantist myth gives up secrets.        By: Helena Smith in Athens          The secrets of a lost cuty that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths-the fable of Atlantis-have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.   Explored by an Angelo-Greek team of archaeologist and marine geologist and known as Pavopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heros and in terms of size and wealth of detail od unprecedented, experts say.   The site, which straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor  off the southern Peloponnese, is believed to have been consumed by the sea around 1,000 BC. Although discovered by a oceanographer some 40 years ago, it was only this year that marine archaeologist, aided by digital technology, were able to properly survey the ruins. Marine geologist have yet to work out why the settlement sank. Theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of eatrthquakes, or a tsunami. It's the first tome a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent Atlantis.       'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration goin,' said Sakellariou. 'Less than 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is srill a lot more sown there that has to be found.'

The only Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empiree only using quipus to keep records.When the Europeans who did travel to the Incan empire. Most were spanish soldiers and the others  were priest who wrote about the incans in their letters and diaries.Most of the archaeologist knowledge comes from the artifacts they have found in these ancient ruins.Alot of these artifacts were made from stone.pottery,gold,or silver.Also, Incan textiles and clothing have also survived remarkbly well.The fall of the Incan empire took place in 1532 when the spaniards murdered the last Inca king and took over the empire. The Inca lived up high in the Andes, and worshipped high on mountain peaks.Some Incans were buried in caves in a cliff face.                                     Mesa Verde National park                    Ancestral Puebloans nad Their World             The Puebloans lived about 1400 years ago, way before any euorpeans came to North America. Later in the year  A.D. 1200 was when the span of generations left their homes and moved away. The first of the Ancestral Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde about A.D. 550. Farming soon replaced hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. These were some prosperous times for basketmakers, And the population had began to multiply. Also, about A.D. 750 they had begun to bulid houses above ground. In the year A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced to skillful stone masonary. From the year of A.D. 1100 to the year of A.D. 1300, the populatin had reached several thousand. Major population shift caused some people to move back into cliff alcoves. Ever since local cowboys first reported cliff dwellings, archeologists have sought to understand the lives of the Puebloans. In the classice period the Ancetral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization. About A.D. 1300&lt; Mesa Verde was deserted. Several theories as to why they migrated were talked about. Maybe because of the drought they experienced or the crop failures. Maybe the natural resources had depleted. Or maybe even they were looking for new oppurtunities.                    Lost Greek city that may have inspired                Atlantis myth gives up secretrs.           Secrets of a lost city may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths the fable of Atlantis.Explored by an Anglo-Greek  team ofc archaeologists and marine geologists claims that this establishment dates back to 5000  years to the time of Homer's heroes. It has remains dating from 2800 to 1200 BC long before Greece's glory days. This sites straddles 30,000 square meters of ocean floor. ' We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested thet the settlement was occupied some of 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier then originally thought,' said Henderson. The investigation revealed over 9,000 square meters of new buildsings. Some people believe this city sunk, because of sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of an earthquake, or a tsunami. Older generatons of  Neapolis always knew something wads there but never could pin point it exactly. This was the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his tale of Atlantis. Even though Atlantis is a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater expolration going. Less than `1% of the world's oceans floors have ever been surveyed. Even though this was an extraordinary find there is even more to be found.

The Inca never left records only colorful tired strings. They later learned they were used to keep record of livestock and record the calendar. It was more like figuring out a puzzle then doing normal everyday research.

There are many things you can learn from them.  Most people that will study the civilizations get caught up in facination, the importance, and most of all the artifacts!              The facination of the people now days is so strong.  It is so strong because of the knowlage of the people today compared to the people back then.  The ancient people seem like they knew so much compared to what we know now. We know more than them now but what they knew took them less time to learn than us.               The anceint civilations are so important. They are so important because what they mean to people today.  Most people like to learn about the ancient civilizations because what they did and what they belived affects us a lot. For example what religions there are and what holidays mean and represent and how they got their name.                Artifacts mean a lot to the world.  The reasion they mean so much is because we get to see what the people of the ancient world looked like, dressed like and what they celebrated. Throught artifacts we get to learn about their traditions. Art is a big artifact because it isn't just drawings it can be sculptings like the ones of the Greeks like of the gods.                There are many more things important about the ancient civilizations. Persionally I think the most important one is artifacts.  The facination drives me to learn more about the people and what they did and belived.  The importance of the people and what they chose to do and live are so important and they help people today decide major decissions!    	NNP NNS NNP DT JJ NNS IN DT JJ VBP RB VBG .

The Inca had no systems of writings, they didnt leave archives but they did make knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Archaeologist today doesn't know what knots is but they have found many ancient quipus. Some of the Inca stories were written by the Europeans, they destribed the Inca in letters or diaries. Inca stories were legends rather than history  . Understanding Inca is like finding a mystery , they say . The other information they got from the Inca came from artifacts or objects they keft behind and from sites . The first Puebloans setteled in Mesa Verde in A.D. 550. They were called Basketmakers because of their skill and craft. They lived in pithouses clusterd into small villages built on Mesa tops or sometimes in cliff recesses.

I'm going to be taking about these great discoveries studied by archaeologists as you read.            The Incas was one of the biggest empires in the Americas they took track of records off of colored string. Spaniards came to the Incas and wrote what they thought about them in letters and diaries.   Archaeologists who study these study these sights take pictures of artifacts they find and note exactly were they find it. Archaeologists   have to find things to study before any looters or treasure hunters get to them first who would just sell it had any value. If any thing is taken archaeologists can't be able to study them.Archaeologists would go through hell to find something to study like how they go into dangerous caves, cliff sides, or climb mountains just to get something. They Carrie all of their equipment up then down once their done. The Incas were at the Andes that mountain acted like a giant freezer and kept bodies found in the icy mountain were preserved fresh for archaeologists to study.            1,400 years ago a long time before any Europeans came to North AAmerica A small amount of people lived in the four Corners region chose  Mesa Verde as their home. The people who settled here were known as Puebloans, Pueploans settled around A.D.550 they were known as  Basket makers for their crafting skills. Farming then took over hunting and gathering as their main livelihood. They lived in small pit houses in villages. Eventually the Puebloans's population grew bigger and started building houses out above ground with upright walls made out of mud and poles by A.D. 750. The puebloans advanced even more by A.D. 1000 they advanced from. pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry. Walls of thick stone masonry three stories high and joined into units of 50 or more rooms. Their pottery also changed from a dull grey background to black drawings on a white background.           Atlantis is one of the biggest finds in the world, to find a city in one piece under the sea is a huge find. Its beloved to have been consumed by the sea 1000 B.C. archaeologists found streets, pottery, buildings, statues and much more. This was a quick essay about the remarkable things archeologist find if it wasn't for them we would know nothing of our past.

Were they religious, architectural, or living in an elite society? Without the discoveries made by archaeologists studying Pavlopetri, the Puebloans, and the Inca, these questions could not have been answered.

This allowed a broader scope of thew world and let them discover other civilizations. This allowed a richer Earth.          With the Incans, the discovery of them allowed them a glimpse of ancient South America. With their mummies, we could see how they looked and what they wore. They also had many other artifacts that let us look at there culture and their daily lives. And although we can't read there system of writing, the quipus allowed us to see there way of life. This allowed a good view of Incan life and how they lived.          The Puebloans and their way of life allowed a unique view of the South-West natives. When they discovered the bow, it allowed them to protect themselves. When they built pithouses, that allowed them to live in buildings. They were then able to build walls, which allowed more protection. The discovery of pottery allowed scientist to see that they were cultured, not just defensive. When they moved to the cliffs, this showed they faced a threat. They then upgraded their homes, building Kivas, ancient churches. All of this allowed a view of a modern civilization.          Pavlopetri was important because it allowed a glimpse of ancient Greece. Because it showed age, scientists discovered it was consumed by water in 1000 B.C. They also discovered tools dating 5,000 years ago. It was the oldest planned city, and had many relics. This allowed a vision of ancient Greece.

In the articles I have read, professionals go through many obstacles to unravel the ancient mysteries of the past. The discovery of the Inca empire, the Puebloans, and the myth of Atlantis, also known as Palvopetri. Each civilizations had their own obstacles to endure.            The Inca lived during 1438-1532 A.D. They ruled over the South African empire that rivaled the expanse of Rome. Some clues were left behind in their art and quipu. Archeologists had to be professional mountain climbers because the empire were in the peak of the Andes mountains.

As humans, our minds are wired to investigate and find out more. We kick into this gear even more when presented with a mystery. Three lost civilizations that have piked the interest are the Inca, the people of Mesa Verde, and a sunken city off of the Greek coast.       The Inca lived in Peru and the Andes mountains. From 1438 to 1532, they created a vast empire that rivalled the ancient Rome. Their religion, art, architecutre, governmenment, transportaion, and way of life, have been revealed by clues that they left behind.

A civilization was nearly a hundred years old from (1438-1532) ruled a South American empire. The people know some old stories because they are down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. They lived in the Andes and many even were worshiped some mountain peaks.       The Puebloans are important because they are know for the skill basketmakers. They tell of a people adept at building, of their crafts. The kiva roofs created open courtyards where they daily took place. Puebloans built their dwellings beneath the overhanging cliffs. They have lived there for less than 100 years.       Atlantis we explored by Angle-Greek team of archeaologists and marine geologist and known as Pavlopetri. Atlantis is the first sunken city in Greece. It was discovered by a British oceangrapher.

The Inca made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. Archaeologists have found many ancient quipus-but today no one knows what the knots mean. Without anyone who can read the stories tied into the colorful strings, understanding the Ancient Inca is a lot like solving a mystery.       The Inca lived high in the Andes and may even worshiped some mountain peaks. Many of their sites are in remote, high places. Some Inca were buried in caves in cliff aces, for example, or on mountain tops. This has helped to preserve the sites, because looters cannot easily get to them. But it also makes the job of the archaeologist more difficult. High-altitute archaeologists are expert mountaineers. They have to carry all their equipment up a mountain before they can start work. Anything they find has to be carried down the mountain for study. The cold mountains act like a giant freezer. Bodies found in the icy Andes are in such good shap that experts can use modern medical scanning equipment to learn about how the people died. The bodies also reveal information about how they lived.       About 1,400 years ago, long before Europeans explored North American, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. For more then 700 years they and their descendents lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. Then, in the late A.D. 1200s, in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away.       Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, during the Classic Period, the population may have reached several thousand. It was mostly concentrated in compact villages of many rooms, often with the kivas built inside the enclosing walls rather then out in the open. The stone walls of the large pueblos are regarded as the finest ever built in Mesa Verde, with their straight courses of carefully shaped stones. Baskets show evidence of decline in quality, possibly because widespread use of pottery meant less attention to the craft. About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people bein to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Why did they make this move? We don't know. Perhaps it was for defence; perhaps it was for religious or psychological reasons; perhaps alcoves offered better protection from the elements. Whatever the reason, or reasons, it gave a rise to the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is most famous.       Ever since local cowboys first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s, archeologists have sought to understand these people's lives. But despite decades of excavation, analysis, classifaction, and comparison, scientific knowledge remains sketchy. We will never know the whole story: they left no written records and much that was important in their lives has perished. Yet for all their silence, these structures speak with a certain eloquence. They tell of a people adept at building, artistic in their crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land.       When the cliff dwellers of Mesa Verde left, they traveled south into New Mexico and Arizona, settling among their kin who were already there. Whatever may have happened, some of today's Pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendents of the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde.       The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths - the fable of Atlantis - have been brought to light from beneath the waters of off southern Greece. Explored by an Anglo Greek team of archaeologists and marine geologists and known as Pavlopetri, the sunken settlement dates back some 5,000 years to the time of Homer's heroes and in terms of size and wealth of detail is unprecedented experts say.       It is the first time a sunken city has been found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale of the sunken continent of Atlantis. 'Atlantis was a myth but it is a myth that keeps underwater exploration going', said Sakellariou. 'Less then 1% of the world's ocean floors have ever been surveyed. This is an extraordinary find but there is still a lot more down there that has to be found'.

The first Europeans were amazed because they could run and huge there empire using strings to keep records. The historians had found a lot of stuff but they still wont know what knots means. Without have anyone to read the story Ancient Inca is like a mystery. The civilization is nearly a hundred years old from (1438 to 1532).                The civilization ruled a south American empire that rivaled the expanse of ancient Rome. The Clues left behind by the Inca from an amazing portrait of their religion, act. By studying these clues archeologists fine the way that the Inca had life together. Some of the ways that historians know about the the Inca comes from oral history or stories that the old Inca. They had so many stories from the past tats why they know more about the Ancient Inca history.                They know that some of the stories were old stories because they were written down by the Europeans who arrived in the empire in 1532. There were Spanish soldiers and Priests. They had describes the Inca letter and diaries. The historians had to be careful when they interpret these accounts. Many of the Spaniards didn't know how to speak the Inca language well.But they didn't care.                 Even if they couldn't understood what they said  their were still descriptions might not be accurate. Other stories were legend rather then history. The rest of the knowledge of the Inca comes from artifact or objects that they left behind. The stone,pottery,gold,or silver could last a long time even if there were buried for hundreds of years. Some of the artifacts turn up to be ruins or buildings. Other were found buried and graved so they couldn't use for the afterlife.                The Ancient materials like there cloth but were destroyed by a dampness but these have been preserved in the dry deserts on Peru's . So some of the Inca live high in the Andes and many even worshiped the mountain peaks. Some were buried and caves in the cliff faces. the mountain get so cold that boobies were found in the icy Andes are in such good shape.The boobies also reveal information about how they lived.

You may ask why these are important they but I will tell you in this five paragraph essay.      In Source one 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past' in paragraph two it says, 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art, and architecture'. Why this is important is because we can see what god or gods the Inca worshiped, what kind of art the Inca made like mosaics or portraits, and what kind of building materials that the Inca used for their major buildings and houses.      In Source two 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their world' in paragraphs five and six starting with paragraph five the passage says,'By A.D. 1000 the people of Mesa Verde had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to skillful stone masonry'. this means that the Puebloans started to modernize instead of living in pit houses they started to make houses made of skillful stone masonry. In paragraph six it says,'About A.D. 1200, another major population shift saw people begin to move back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before...Perhaps it was for defense; perhaps it was for religious or psychological reasons; perhaps alcoves offered better protection from the elements'. This means that the Puebloans think that their god or gods are going to punish them for their big move from pithouses to houses made from stone or the Pauebloans think that one of their enemies are going to come and attack them because of their skill at making stone, or perhaps it is because of the season and winter is coming soon so they want to be protected.      In Source three 'Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets'.   In this article it says,'We found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, which suggested that the settlement was occupied some 5,000 years ago, at least 1,200 years earlier than originally thought' (paragraph 6). This article is so important because, the archaeologists found ceramics dating back to the end of the stone age, and that was 1,200 years earlier than thought. So by coming upon these things we now know that the end of the stone age was 1,200 years earlier than thought. This article also says in paragraph six,'... that the town had been used by an elite, and automatically raised the status of the settlement'. This is important because now the archaeologists know that the town ad been used by an elite, and now they can try to find out who this elite is.      This is why the discoveries that had been made about the Inca,Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri are so important.

They did chores, had animals, they had problems, maybe their problems were a little harder then ours were to solve, like people attacking them at their house and killing everyone in town. The life was hard back then and we take what we have and what we do and are used to doing and put our live next to there's, we look like rich snobs pretty much.       If the people back then didn't build houses as great as they did, or make pottery, or write stuff down we would not know anything about their life and how far we have come. If the people never wrote anything down we would not ever know how the United States become united as one we probable would not of ever know it was not all one to began with. We would not of known about our history past the one that our family knew about.       The things we have found when we looked at old sites where people lived we have found pottery, parts of their houses, and even clothes that they have made. Then in really cold places on mountains and high up places like that we have found peoples body's prefect shape and we can use our medical technology to find out how they died and we have also found their stuff they carried with them close by or around them.       I feel really bad for the people that thought they could solve every thing by killing people back then. People would make armies and fight people for land and yeah in the end you might get that land but you have lost all these people you had fight for you people's dad's, brothers, and son's died all because either the leader made them or they were told they would not die and they would get new land. But they ended up dieing, really for NO reason what so ever.

The findings have taught our current culture that the things that are important to us now like our phones, computers, and teleivision have not always been so important. other things used to be way more important like religion. Also you wouldn't have time to use a phone or computer because back then everyone had a job, they had to it was the only way to survive as a clan. But, in many ways acioent tribes are just like modern day people.         What are some everyday things that you do now that other people used to do in years like 1438-1532 A.D.? We all write and talk right? Well to do all of that you have to have an alphabet, in current discoveries reaserchers have found an acient Inca alphabet recorded. So even in little tribal clans they used an alphabet everyday just like us. Inca people also went to war, which is something that happens everywhere.          As you can see acient tribes really arent that much different that modren day people you just have to dig a little deeper and find what you are looking for. So next time you are in History class and you are thinking ' This is so boring' don't spend all of your time thinking about how bad and boring it is think about how much you in current day have in common with the history.

Well i can tell you this you could talk to an archaeologist who has dug up and found ancient cities for all of there life.       Have you ever heard of the ancient Inca, well i can can tell you that for a fact the Inca civilization was a very smart and mysterious civilization for multiple facts such as, they used string and knots system to supposedly count livestock or people or even to do math, but who really knows all these things that we think we know about some of these ancient civilizations are just a scratch at the surface of the whole truth or even a partial truth.       As we look back in into into how we thought of ancient peoples we most likely think there dumb but if you know a little something something about these very well thought out and well designed plans such as plumbing, indoor fires, smooth walls, and baskets all of these thing help sculpt are creativity and intellect so that it could all lead up to where we are now with modern tech.     As i read this article that was very informational by the way i found out many of things that i all ready know about ancient civilizations but i also found out a lot of new interesting thing that i never knew before today and as you read this article and hopefully read this one that i have written and be amazed at what new things you will learn.

In the first example is with the Inca civilization was that they learned that history can be written in knots on string and the pottery change over time which mean trade got better. They also learned were the people worshiped which was high in the mountains.       The second example is the Puebloans civilization and they learned there that the house were called Pithouse and they had a different kinda shape to them and that they had holes in the top to let out the smoke from the fire.It also shows how talent they were by there baskets.        The final reason is with the Greek City at is know under water. They can see with this how weather and natural things can happen and put a whole city under the sea. Also it really cool to know that over thousands of years how the oceans expand.         Those are the reasons why the discoveries  of the Inca, Puebloans , and the Pavliptri are so imprortant.

Inside the box is where you got your product, and it is where the instructions came with it; so why not use what you have? Why make things more complicated than they need to be? In my opinion the archaeologists in these articles are just making things so much more difficult than needed, yes, you do need helpful hints here and there, but who says you can't figure out the story yourself?   In the article 'Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past' it states 'Archaeologist have found many ancient quipus- but today no one knows what the knots mean.' Would these archaeologist know what the knots mean if they would have just stayed in their box? There is so much information just right there in their box. (The box is an interpurtation of their findings and in their findings area). Maybe they went too far out of the box and just can't get back in, time is killer and with it on their hands wasting it looking elsewhere but in their box; well that will do nothing but cause them problems.   So next time you decide 'I am going to think outside the box' maybe you should rethink that decision. But that is only my theory, what is yours?

Have you ever wondered how your ancestors or even people lived in the past? Most Archaeologists do, they search the world for lost civilizations, artifacts, or even ruins to learn about the past. The Incas, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri were civilizations that would show people how remarkable the past was, also how these civiliations lived.               The Incas were a extraordinary civilization from having recorded time to having a large city. Incas had no formal writing or alphabet, they didn't leave behind written records or journals for Archaeologists to study. They did have a smart strategy to have colorful strings called quipus to record their calendar and keep count of their animals. Some Incas would bury their relatives and make them into mummies. Only royal families or wealthy families could mummsize their family member. Archaeologists find mummies an amazing artifact to discover, most tombs are hard to find and some are robbed from the expensive jewelry the mummy carries. Some artifacts from the Inca civilization are kept well preserved from the weather. Archaeologists hope to learn more about the Inca civilization from the years to come.                     Much like the Incas the Puebloans were an amazing civilization. They started their civilization in Mesa Verde in A.D 550. The Puebloans are know for their skill at crafting and art, they were nomads at first but they began to lead a more settled life. Farming was mostly their work than hunting or gathering. Puebloans would build pithouses that were clustered into small villages. Pithouses were mostly made on mesa tops but rarely on cliff recesses. They were artisans they would make their own pottery, tools, and weapons. In A.D 750  they began building houses one against each other in long, curving rows, sometimes with pithouses in the front. Between A.D 1110 and A.D 1300 they Puebloans buliding skills changed and so did their way of making pottery. They would make intriqute buildings and beautiful pottery that were made from their hands. But in about A.D 1200 the civilization's popularity decreased people began to move back to the cliff alcoves to where their ancestors sheltered before. By about A.D 1300 Mesa Verde was deserted, some people became cave dwellers like their ancestors but most of the population began to look somewhere else. Archaeologists still have questions to answer and solve about the amazing Puebloan civilization.                     The Palvopetri was a ancient civilization that lived in Ancient Greece. They had a remarkable city. That city became known as the 'Lost Greek City' because it became submerged underwater. Palvopetri people made exquisite designs with the buildings they made and the way the runned their city. They built main streets, made their own pottery and even made a megaron. A megaron is a monumental building that has a rectangular hall that was only used by royal or elite members. This civilization was enormous, it had more the 30,000 square meters. It is the oldest submerged city in the world and the first submerged city in Greece. This city inspired the myth of the submerged city 'Atlantis'.The Palvopetri people occupied this settlement 5,000 years ago. Archaeologists still don't know how this city became submerged, some suggested that it was cause by a earthquake or a tsunami, other say both. This is a very ancient civilization and is to yet to be discovered, the Palvopetri people were an astonishing civilization that brings questions to people's minds.                       Whether it was the Incas, Puebloans, or the Palvopetri people these civilizations have teached us how people lived in the past. With the artifacts that are left behind, most civilizations are yet to be discovered and understood. It shows that life was different before us.

The city dates back to 5,000 years ago, around the time of Homers Heroes.   The sunken city straddles 30,000 square meters on the ocean floor off the Southern Peloponnese.What they found surpassed all expectations, the exploration revealed a world of buildings, courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. No one knows for sure how the city sunk. theories include tsunamis,earthquakes, or rise in sea level. Atlantis was a myth but this myth keeps under water exploration continuous.

When we find sunken city that may have caused myths of Atlantis or finding a whole community in canyon walls or in a mountain top.We can figure out how society worked 5,000  years ago or longer.                                 What really shocks me (personally) is that a whole town sunk and we found it 40 years ago. They sunken city was 30,000 square feet on the ocean floor. this is amazing because we can still pull artifacts from it. These artifacts are huge on society like how we developed as humans in height ,size and mind . how towns , city's , country's have developed . this city is believed to have been sunken in 1000 BC . it has started myths of Atlantis, on how powerful a tsunami or earthquake can be to sink a whole town that big. how people lived in comparison to now. Some of  the most important tools we have today came be found in an old city ruins.                        the ancient Inca of Peru had no alphabet or system of writing but surprisingly we have learned a lot bout them. the Inca made knots in colored string to keep the calender also to keep track of live stock . archaeologists have found many strings that they use but no one has quite figured it out and the best theory we have is that they use it for the calender  and live stock. most ancient ruins are for the most part 'easy to understand ' but with the Inca 'understanding ' is a lot like soling a huge mystery.    the Inca have given us many clues about the portrait of how religion 'grew' , about art,farming , the goverment, and most importatly a way of life.   they most we reallybcan find out is from the oral history and stories passed thourgh generation to genertaion (to presever communitys history).

Have you ever thought about how important discoveries are? Probably not but they are very important. In this article I am going to be talking about why discoveries are important. I got my information from three other articles they are Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past by: Beth Gruber, Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Puebloans and Their World illustrations by NPS/Roy Anderson, and Lost Greek city that may have inspired Atlantis myth gives up secrets by Helena Smith in Athens.            In the first article Ancient Inca: Archaeology Unlocks the Secrets of the Past by Beth Gruber it talks about several discoveries. One discovery was the quipus, and the quipus was a way for Inca to keep track of livestock. It had colorful strings that formed into knots. But the bad news is today no one knows what the knots mean. We don't know if one knot means 10 cows or 20 chickens. But this discovery was imporant because know we know that they could keep records and run a huge empire all by themselves. But if the archaeologist can find someone that knows what these knots mean they will be able to learn a lot more about the Acient Inca people.  But not all of the discoveries have to be one item. In paragraph 2 it says 'Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and the way of life.' This sentence is saying that these were very smart people. They knew how to do so many things. We could learn from the Inca people. Also the Inca people made artifacts made of stone, pottery, gold, or silver. So these people could have influenced people now. Like pottery they could have influenced our pottery making.

Well archaeologists have been working on that and have found answers to most of our questions.  They have had struggles with treasure hunters, they have found artifacts. and even a lost Greek city.                Most people have heard of treasure hunters.  They go to archaeological sotes and steal artifacts that arent theirs.  Most valuable is what they are looking for.  hey want to pocket money.  But archaeologists have to deal with this.  Not always having the best find because someone else has already been there.  But they always seem to cope and get results.               Archaeologists have found many artifacts.  Big and small.  From bowls to clothing and everything in between.  In the Andies, they found knots in colored string called quipus that used to be a calender that kept a cound of livestock.  They have also found pithouses where people lived and Kivas which people gathered, like a ceremonial room.                They have also found a lost city.  This city was found underwater beneth the waters of Greece. They think it is the oldest submerged town in the world!  Some of the remains date back to 2800 B.C. to 1200 B.C. which was long before classical Greece.  Most of this settlement was occupied by people 5000 years ago which was way earlier then first thought.  The archaeologists founf a megaron-a monumental structure with a large rectangular hall- that suggests the town had been used by an elite.  This site is a magnificant find because everything there was 'frozen in the past'.              Archaeologists are working hard to find out a lot about our past.  They are dealing with treasure hunters, finding artifacts, and still discovering parts of our world that we never knew exisisted. 	NNP PRP RB VBN WP PRP$ JJ VBD IN .

The first of many reasons is that, these artifacts are like an ancient hiustory text book. They tell us there way of life. It provides of with information about their lifestyles and what they did.        Artifacts from these cultures are like an ancient textbook. They tell us how they lived. They tell us what they wore. Specuial events that happened in their lifetime. Who was there leader and so on.        These ancient artifacts tell us how they lived. It tells us because its kinda like art. They show special events or moments that happened in their lifetime. If certain people were elected to lead or if there culture decided to move. Or join a different group and unite and become a union.        They explain their style of life. They explain it just like how we express ourslef in art. That is basically what these artifacts are, art. They used these to either express theirsleves our note certain things that happened in their lkife. Or certain emotions.       Inca, Pueblons, and Pavlopetri's artifacts should be preserved. One of the three reasons is that they tell us how they lived. Their agriculture. Also because it is like an ancient history textbook.

We know about a civilization for nearly a hundred years ruled a south american empire that ricaled the expanse of ancient rome because of clues left behind. About 1,400 years ago, long before europeans explored north america, a group of people living in the four corners region chose mesa verde for their home. The secrets of a lost city that may have inspired one of the world's most enduring myths- the fable of atlantis- have been brought to light from beneath the waters off southern Greece.            Ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet ot system of writing. The Inca made knots in colored strings called 'quipus' to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. The first European to discover the Inca was amazed how they could keep record ny tying knots. Archaeologist have found many quipus that no one knows what the knots mean. Ancient Inca is a solving mystery.            For more than 700 years ancestral puebloans and their descendants lived and flourished in North America. They eventually started building stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of the canyon walls. In late A.D. 1200s they left their homes and moved away. Whatever may have happened, some of today's pueblo people, and maybe other tribes, are descendants of the ancestral puebloans of mesa verde.

To them it was just a myth and it only excisted in legends or in stories they'd tell. But with the founding of the it everything is just a little challanging. Why, because they don't know a way to interpect their way of writing. No body really knows what it says, how challanging is that?     They've found many things, a lot of things no one knew that excisted. They left a lot of clues, about their arts, their religions and many stuff about them. All of those things prove the others that they did excist once. Maybe a long time ago, but they did.       The people who looked down their, in the ocean. Didn't really find anything valueble. Most of the things that were valuble were taken aways, centeries ago, according to the article. They were disturbed by the 'treasure hunters' and had taken all the valueble things by their selfs. Many old things we're found really damp or dry from the dessert of Peru. Or even in the mountains of the Andes. Those valueble things meant alot.      They concluded that most of the things happen when the Incas's last king was murdered and it was taken over the Spaniards in 1532. It's kinda difficult to discover all of this because there was also many people that were living there after a long period of time. There is a lot of ancient lands and they had to be careful not to mistake one by the other one.       It's kinda of a struggle to find bones of the Incas because some where burried in diffefrent places. Such as; the top of mountains, caves, cliffs. But the ones that they had found has helped them out a lot.      Mesa Verde is also very important because it took place many years ago when it was created. They first Ancestral Puebloans that setteled in Mesa Verde was in A.D. 550. They were suppose 'basket makers' and they were known for their skills. It tells you in the article.   They only lived there for maybe 200 years.      They would build houses and have their own ways to find food and maintian living there and all. Their population kept growing and growing, then several thousands were living there.  After many things that happened they migrated to New Mexico or Arizona.        The Alantis Myth that was found years ago is very important because there is several things that they found. A lot of secrets and many things. But supposly the whole things was a myth, and they found it. But they just keep looking and searching to find new things. Some of the younger generation didn't know about the Alantis but their ansestors did. But just like anything else it's highly important. Because there is thousands and millions of things no body knew that excisted out there. But they found it.

Locals in th enearby town of Neapolis are very amazed.Older generations always knew something was there but they had no idea about the extent of it.The Suken city was found in Greece that predates the time that Plato wrote his allegorical tale about the suken continent of Atlantis.

This three magnifacient civilizations contain many secrets of ancient time that most of them haven't been discovered by archiologist yet. Maybe you might be thinking that ancient civilization might not be as interesting and important to our civilization of today since its from thousands years ago. However, they have so many information thathas influenced and effected our world of today.               The Ancient Inca of Peru was one of the earliest civilization that was build hundred years ago.  It was difficult for them to know how to start their culture since they didn't know about communication, transportation, technology, education, ect. However scientist had discovered how the Inca kept track of the time. The Inca used a quipus (knots in colorful strings) that keep records. With this invention they could run their empire very well and had learn how to govern it. Scientist had also found letters and documents from Europeans and Spinards that describe thier communication with them. They didn't know much of their language and sometimes the confused themself, but they did build up a way of communicating and trading routes with the Inca . Inca had showed scientist what their civilization religiuos view was, and what they worthship. The mountains of Andes have helped achealogist by keeping dead bodies in a freezing point preventing them from wasting. This helps them analyzed their bodies and detect any diseases that can be prevented from today.         The Ancestral Puebloans had affected our lifes of today. Puebloans were one of the few civilizations that created many materials that we use in our everyday lifes .They created pithouses, which were shelther back in their days. They taugh themselfs how to make a strong shelther that were in good conditions to live, and prevents dangers from around them. They had also made tools that are used to catch food such as bows, arrows, and spear throwers. Like the ancient Inca they had also had a religious view. In theire civilazation they build Kivas which were kind of chruches where they prayed for luck. But one of the most important fact about them is that for them in order to live, they took advantage of nature and used nature's materials to live and learn.         Last but not least, is the Lost City of Atlantis. It is one of the most magnificient civilization that ever existed and contains many secrets that hasnt been discovered yet. The fact of it been underwater makes it mysterious and interesting to the achiologist and scientist since it can let scientist know deeper background knowlege of the weather. In other words, its discovery of how it got underwater will help scientist determine what and how it causes this. Also it will help how to predict if it will happen farther in the future from today.        This civilizations had brough us so many background information and had helped us improve our societies, cultures, government, health and our needs.

The acncient Inca of Peru had no formal aphabet or system of writing. They did not leave or have archives for historians to study. I think why people are fasinated by Civilization from the past because, it reveals how intelligent people lived along with what they did and how. How are things diffrerent? Look at history so we don't repeat the mistakes that they have made in the past. And it also opens new windows of discoverys. Why is the lost city from the article such an improtant to find? Because it was one of the worlds largest myths. And it's the oldest submerged town (in th world). Had been looking for the city for a long time. I think the most important things for anchient civiliation to leave behind would be things like, Art work, tools, pottery, documents, religoues pieces, and things about their lifestyle.           From arcticle two, 'Mesa Verde National Park Ancestral Pueboans and Their World'.   Long before Europeans explored North America about 1,400 years ago, a group of people living in the Four Corners region chose Mesa Verde for their home. In the late A.D. 1200's, in Span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from Navajo word sometimes translated as 'The Ancient Ones' or 'Ancient Enemies'. We know call them Ansetral Puebloans, refelcting their modern descendants. I think people are fasinated by civilation from the past because, Eurpeans explored North America, a group of poeple living in Four Corners.       In the arcticale 'Losy Greek City That May Have Inpired Atlantis Myth Give Up Secrets'.   I think poeple are fasinated by civiliation from the past because, the secrets of a lost city that may have insipred one of the worlds most enduring myths the fable atlantis have rbought to light from beneath the waters off Southern Greece. And because it is one of the older sunken sites in the world but none can be considered to be planned towns such as, this wich is wy it is so unique. I think they should leave behind unde water rocks, and star fish and things that was under water at the time. Or still there.

The Inca would keep track of the livestock by making knots in colored string to record on the calender. When it came to the Spaniards they did not even speak the language the Inca did. The Ina's artifacts were made out of remarkable things such as pottery, stone, gold, and silver. Also some of their clothing survived all these years and are used for research now.  Plus some of the Inca sites have been disturbed by people known as 'Treasure Hunters' or 'looters'. The Inca Lived in the Andes and may have even worshiped the mountain peaks.Plus the most remarkable thing When Incas died they were buried in the mountains or caves, The people in the mountains and because the mountains act as a freezer the dead bodies have been in such great shape that experts can use medical scanning equipment to learn how they died.

These things could give us hints to natural disasters, and tell us could this happen again.               The ancient Inca of Peru used quipus instead of writing like us today. The only problem we face is we don't understand it. There are other ways to find out about them, but if we could understand could find out so much more about them. Archeologist use their clothing to find out maybe how big or tall the average person was or if they were the elites. They could use other things such as weapons to what they hunted or if they hunted, or if they fought in battles or wars. They could also use things to find out what they did for fun. Some use bodies to find when they died or even how far the Inca empire dated back.                 In the article it said the first Puebloans settled in Mesa Verde at about 550 A.D. They were skilled craftsmen.They made pottery and bow and arrow, which were more efficient than spearing throwing. The types homes they lived in were called pit-houses, which were in villages on mesa tops. Sometimes they would put them on cliff recesses,but very rarely will they do so. At about 750 A.D. they made houses above ground with upright walls made of poles and mud. 250 years later they took and poles and mud ,and used thick, double-coursed stone. Farming at this time was big to, as it made up half of their diet. They cleared lots of mesa- top land just for farming because it was such a big part of there lives.                  In conclusion the discoveries of these ancient civilizations helps us find out what life was like in the past. They show us what they ate, what they wore, and even how they had fun, and that's those discoveries are important.

We could use the old houses or hut that they lived in as a mueseum to show tourist and others. If we find money from back then we can try and see if it's caluable because their money may be so rare that its really valuable.We can learn about their different laguanges and maybe see if someone could interpret them, to see what they we're writing .We could even study their materials that they used for close because they today may be very rare and of valuable.

Some of them we know more about, and some still have many mysteries. Then Inca, the Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde, and the Lost Greek City are some of the most well known civilizations we have heard of.       The Inca are known for many things, where they lived is one. They lived in the Andes moutains and in the dry deserts of Peru's coast. Their language has not been able to be read because it was lost just like their people. Gone, but no one knows where. They both just disapered. The Inca did not leave with out a way to know that they were ever there though. They left behind many artifacts, some include clothing, and othere objects made out of pottery, stone, gold, and silver. They also left behind their bodies, their bodies were well preserved in the cold climates of the Andes mountains. So preserved that some reveal information about how they lived.       The Ancestral Puebloans in Mesa Verde, were know as the 'ancient ones' or 'ancient enemies' from the name that the archaeologists gave them, Anasazi. The first Ancestral Puebloans that settled in the Mesa Verde were also know as the Basketmakers for the skill in making baskets. They lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on the mesa tops with few in cliff recesses. They made pottery and used the bow and arrow for hunting. They eventually started to make pole-and-adobe cunstructions with walls of thick stone that rose two or three stories high. They then made buildings called cliff dwellings. Archaeologists have tried to understand these people's lives but we will never know the whole story they like the Inca left no record. They also just left. the Mesa Verde wa deserted with no sign as to where they had gone.       The Lost Greek City was thought to be the city Atlants. It dates back some 5,000 years to times of size and wealth. The site covers about 30,00 square meters of ocean floor off the coast of southern Peloponnese. It is believed that the site was consumed into the ocean around 1000 BC. They found a world of buildings,courtyards, main streets, rock-cut tombs, and religious structures. There was also thousands of shards of pottery on the seabed. More than any other site so far, the find offers potentail insights into the workings of Mycenaean society. Marine geologists still have to work out why the settlement sank. Some theories include sea level changes, ground subsidence as the result of earthquakes, or a tsunami.

Archaeologists use information from artifacts, such as clay pots, ancient calendars, or crumbling bodies. All of these artifacts contribute to the expansion of our knowledge, towards this subject.       Knowing about ancient times is important to present generations, because it tells us about our past, and may help us to predict our future. The ancient generations began modern civilization. They began technology, although simple, eminent. Without the help from the past, we would lack many of the things we have today. If the wheel had not been invented, we would not have cars, bicycles, or machines that build these items.       Discovering artifacts from the ancients decode messages and mysteries. Finding knots that people had made to keep track of time or to count for their livestock, have developed into a much more complicated way of life. Ancient stone calendars helped to keep track of the moon phases, and the seasons, so early astronomers could predict what type of weather would occur, and when it was the best time to grow crops.       Thanks to ancient peoples, we have the advanced technology that we have today. Their lives have been preserved in museums and exhibits to show us, that we have developed many of our ways from  our ancestors.

Although it may seem rather peculair, and unfamlilar there have been many studies and research work done to prove the myth as a if it were to be true.             There have been many ruins found under the sea, with evidence proving that some sort of civilization was once above the water. Some of these ruins have been dated back as far as 5,000 years old. The ruins of Atlantis, hyave always been looked upon as a myth, but now the ruins have been proven to be real.            Many people, continue to believe that it is just an old fish tale, but scientists, have contributed grusome amounts of hours to prove that the Lost City of Atlantis is a true facr and they are continuing to make many more discoverys as to what has become of the ruins.

The way life is for us now was way different than how it was back then in those civilizations. The Inca's way of life was different than how it is now. The Inca made knots into colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of livestock. Today, archaeologists have found many ancient quipus. The only thing is, no one really knows what the knots mean. Clues left behind by the Inca form an amazing portrait of their religion, art and architecture,  agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Whatever important facts we find out about the past becomes a part of history. The way life was back then is different now because history has changed it. Archaeologists have found artifacts from the past which might not even be used today. Or the artifacts they found could still be used today but only in a different way. Nothing can be the same. Over time, things change. Even old beliefs. They can sink to grief. Nothing is the same. Over time, things change.

Knowing from where they came from to how it ended is what is so crushal about know what may have been done that ended these civilizations.

They give us insight on how we changed since then. They allow us to compare older civilizations and fully understand our past. The discoveries also allow us to see previous mistakes so as to, hopefully, not repeat the past.        Discoveries of ancient civilization ,such as the incas, allow us to see how much we have changed. Some people in the past used to sacrifice war prisoners for the gods. If you were to ask modern day people, most would say thats crazy and the people that don't would be considered crazy.        Foundings made by archeaologists also allow us to understand the past. After all the information we have gathered thus far, we have our entire history/social studies class devoted to teaching people the things we have learned. We teach it because it really is important to learn about our past.        Another thing we get from studying ancient lands is the ability to block the past from repeating itself. After learning about the ways people lived in medival times, always in the dark, people know never again to stop learning and forget what was learned. It isn't easy starting over from scratch as people in the medival times have demonstrated.        All discoveries are important for alot of reasons. Even the simple reason of just knowing it is worth it. We all can learn from the past and use it for us.

Some of the most major discoveries are the Inca, the old submerged Greek city, and the Puebloans.They have shown early advances in planning, counting, materials used, religion, and many other things. These show us the past, and allow us a good idea of what life was like back then. From their geography to their artifacts, these are some very amazing finds.              The Inca were an ancient civilization within South America. They lived way up in the mountains and used bridges made from rope and wood to get to other places. They were very smart, and developed methods for recording, counting, and other types of math. They were a flourishing civilization until the Spanish came to the Americas. They killed off most of the Inca, but we know about them based on what the Spanish wrote in letters and diaries. Although we will never be able to see how they lived first-hand, they have left behind many artifacts and records to give us a pretty good idea. However, we still know about them through the discoveries we have made about them. All the information gathered was through digging and excavating, and these discoveries show us how people lived in ancient times, what they ate, hunted, grew, and without that we wouldn't know how we used to live back then.           There is an old city near Greece that very few people have seen. It is an ancient submerged city that dates back thousands of years. No one knows for sure how it ended up underwater, but what makes the city so special is the fact that it was a planned city made way before the first recorded planned city. It has roads, houses, and stores, which no one knew truly existed at the time of this city. It is a huge mystery that we can only try to solve through what they left behind. There are pots, pans, fireplaces, brickwork, and a numerous amount of other things left behind that can tell us how these people lived back then. This discovery shows that there were advanced people before recorded history. We need to know this, because if we don't, then we know even less of ancient people. If we never find these lost civilizations, then we lose much of the world's history.           The Puebloans, also known as cliff-dwellers, were an ancient race who left their homes for unknown reasons. They were very advanced and were able to let their population grow to several thousand. They were excellent house makers and their food mainly originated from farming. They used adobe bricks and sandstone bricks for their houses and used a mud cement. The Spanish discovered them, but they were never wiped out by them. They Left their homes for some reason that is unbeknownst to us. However, that leaves room for speculation. The discoveries of ancient civilizations don't always provide the answer to the questions that we have about it. So, we use speculation to determine what has happened to something. Without the use of speculation we would never be able to answer our questions, leaving us in the darkness of the unknown.

These people in the Four corners region had lived for a long time and long before Europeans explored North America. They made lots of cool things that we humans today can learn about. Like their cultures and house they buildt out of raw material they were called pithouses. But later on they made better houses called kivas, that were a ceremonial room that were compared to churches. They used kivas for lots of different things like praying for rain, to be lucky in hunting and good crops.Another anicent city was the lost city of Altantis, which people believed that the city was already underwater and some other people believe that it was on land but later it fell into the underwater realm. Off the coast of Greece this has been the first underwater city found near Greece. Scienctists are still learning on thoses who had lived in the past.

They all have one thing in common, they all had the same idea for their environment and culture. The Inca and the Puebloans had the same idea of their writings and their living situatioins. The Cliff Dwellers and the Puebloans had both used what they had to build their own homes from what they had in the environment around them.            All of the Inca writings and communication were made by hand. They didn't have their own language to talk from or hand signals. They used hand made calendars and made knots with colored strings for their calendar called quipus. People today still don't know what the string and the knots stand for, and there's nodbody still alive today to explain it to us. The only reason we know about the Inca civilization today is because they left behind some clues of their art and government which made us to piece togeher their city. Some of the information we know today comes form the anciet fabels and stories that were passed down from generation to generation. When the Spaniards had an incounter with the Inca's they didn't quite understand their language, so the information the Spaniards give us today might not be accurate. Also the Spaniards did kill the last Inca king, so they may be lying about some part of their culture. The rest of the information we have been given came from artifacts made from gold and silver. The Inca lived in the Andes and were believed to worshiped mountain peaks. Most Inca sites are hidden or remote or on mountain tops so its not easy to find their locations. When archaeologist's find Inca bones up in the mountains they study how they carried their equipment up these mountain tops alot and by studying ther bones they figure out how they died and how they lived.            Before Europeans explored America, there were a group of people living in Mesa Verde, they lived their for more than 700 years, enough time to build cities and communities. Eventually they moved away. Now there is Mesa Verde National Park dedicated to this ancient civilization to remind everyone of their culture. At first the people located on Mesa Verde were called Anasazi, translating to 'the ancient ones', but now we call them Ancestral Puebloans, from their modern decendents. They had a skill for basketmaking and replaced farming for hunting and gathering. They lived in small villages on mesa tops or in cliff recesses. They learned how to make pottery in their spare time, and started using bow and arrow for an easier an faster way to hunt. As the population grew, the basketmakers started building more houses above ground were they weren't so isolated. As they began to interacte with people outside their tribe, they ecame known as the Puebloans, a Spanish word meaning 'village dwellers'. The Puebloans started to build all of their newest buildings with pole-and-adobe construction. Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300, their population grew to several thousand. They also had the finest buildings and architecture built in Mesa Verde.              The Ancestral Puebloans, were skillful with their crafts and decorative with how they made them. They were an example of a very advanced tribe and had the most exsquisite expression of human culture. Their architecture was normal block shaped building made of sandstone. Soon after their arrival the Ancestral Puebloans, deserted their land from drought. Drought made a decrease in crops and then there was no way for them to have food. But it must have been a bad drought because history says, that they had suffered droughts before, but none like this. When they left their land they migrated into New Mexico and Arizona, settling with people that already had families there. Some of their desendants may still be living in New Mexico today.            The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Cliff Dwellers 'the ancient puebloans', all left their civilizations one way or another. Some from drought and others from weather and location. Their architecture was unique and culture was interesting. The one thing all these tribes had in common was how they all left behind their cultures for people today to study from and learn how people from the era of A.D.

To star out, each discovery is an important part of history. The Incas with their extraordinary way of communicating without a written language. The Puebloans with their unique construction skills. And lastly, the Pavlopetri with the discovery of a city which is sunk undewater. Some even have a legend or myth behind it. They all have a interesting background.           In addition, the Incas had a really durable clothing. Not long ago, archaeologists found Inca clothes in not a bad shape even though they hhad been left without care. And that is how they came to infere that the Incas clothing was durable. As I mentioned earlier, the Puebloans were really good at constructing homes. Archaeologists say that their skills were amazing. That is how they got the nicknames Puebloans which is village dwellers in Spanish. Now going to Greece, the underwater city discovery created many myths. One being 'The Lost City of Greece, Atlantis' which became known all over the world.           The Inca was one of the early civilization which means that a lot of its history couldn't be discover. But with the sources found by the archaeologists, they could connect the information together to figure out their lifestyle. With the Puebloans homeland being at the top of cliffs, research was difficult to be done. And last but not least, It was impressive to discover the underwater city in Greece. For that, I believe those discoveries were important.

One of those ancient civilizations were the Inca one of the more important, they achieved great invents for example pithouses, this pithouses were once located in South America in Mesa Verde but now its known as Peru a normal country, but in this country there is a great empire that it actually was from the Incas.       But the Incas weren't the only civilizations that once habited this world, there were more from example the Mayans, Aztecs, Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri, this civilizations habited different parts of the world, like Aztecs were located in America. Aztecs is a very difficult word this civilization was one of the greatest if you compare them with the Mayas they were almost the same, but this civilizations made history, they made great discoveries, like the calendar, and in math they discovered algebra, and all the achievements that were used on that time, they are actually used now a days, that is so interesting because everything we know and used today is based on the past, like math, and different languages, its weird if you think in this way.       In conclusion, Ancient civilizations did great discoveries, and this discoveries are used now a days, well like a set before this thesis I'm giving can be proven with the first paragraph of the Incas. And all the other information was given by me about the Aztecs and Mayans was an example of different societies all around the world.

We also learned how they lived, how they made knots in colored strings called quipus to record the calendar to keep a count of lives stock. Also is important because we need to know about the history that happened, not only the one in the U.S, but the one outside the world. Now the study of the Mesa Verde helped us because it told us the fist people that ever lived there, Ancestral Puebloans. The Ancestral Puebloans settled int Mesa Verde in about A.D. 550. We know they're best know for 'Basketmakers'. They also learned how to make pottery and acquired the bow and arrow, a weapon used to hunt. The Ancestral Puebloans lived in pithouses, as agriculture began. Over the years the people of Mesa Verde, advanced their way of living. By the Classic Period, Ancestral Puebloans were heirs of a vigorous civilization. Ancestral Puebloans livedin the cliff dwellings for less that 100 years. By A.D. 1300, Mesa Verde was deserted.

The Ancient Inca of Peru has no formula and no alphabet or any system writing. They dont archives so they wouldnt study at all. The first Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire using strings to keep records. The cisitors were spanish soldiers and priests. They describe the Inca in the letters and in the diaries. Some of the historians have to be careful when they interpret these accounts. The Spaniards did not speak the Inca language at all.  They did not have understood ehat the Inca told them so their descriptions might not be that accurate.Some of their stories they told were legnds rather than history. Some of the Inca textiles and colthing have also surived remarkably well.

Learning about our past is just as important as controlling the present, if not even more. The Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri all had quite advanced lifestyles compared to other empires. The knowledge we have gained from them can help with our current situations and in the future.          Looking into the past will allow for a better understanding of the present and contribute to the future. Having to sources to see what worked and did not in the past helps prevent the same mistakes from happening in the future. For example, Britain having control over the Tirteen Colonies did not succeed. This sets a precident for future countries and the land they control.          The world would not be what it was today if not for our past. As one travels back in time to the era of the Inca, Puebloans, and Pavlopetri, an overall better understanding for the world is endured. We can see how our ancestors lived and how we are who we are thanks to them.

I do not need the government to use my peers and I as the guinea pigs for taking this test, it is unnecessary and cruel. At the end of every school year I am trying to work hard to maintain my GPA and focusing on studying for finals, so I don't need an extra test thrown in there for an experiment.

Quipus were used for some sort of organization method, it could have been used for keeping track of livestock and othere various reasons. When the europeans first me the Incans they were astonished about how amazing they ran their empire and how much they had accomplished with so little tools to use.          Incans ruled the South American empire from 1438-1532 and revaled the expansion of Rome. We can tell how they lived and how their empire expanded. The archaeologists have found other signs about how they lived and how their empire has died.           The archaeologists have to be careful that they are digging in the right site so they dont dig up the wrong site and mix up the civilizations and create a huge mess.             They lived in the high Andes and probably lived and worshiped by the mountain peaks. Alot of the Incans sites were remote and in secret mostly in high mountain places like the tops or in crevases. The excavators have a more difficult job because of their civilizations.              The excavators have to climb high mountain peaks with all of their equipment but all of that weight could cause one of them to fall or injure themselves badly. Once they are at the top or the destination they were trying to reach they still have to excavate all of the reminents and clean them and pack them. Once the jobs done they still have to lug alll of the excavation tools and all of the reminents back down which can cause more injury or possible damage to the artifacts.               Incans were an amazing and interesting civilization to studdy and they have shown us how we have advanced and developed from helpless to completely independent creatures.

Helps us understand why they at first trusted the caucasian man. Also helps us understand the geography of our land better since they lived there a couple hundred years before us.    The Inca were a very intresting group of people. For one thing we do not know there origins or how they came to be. They lived in the Andes in high areas, such as mountains. This makes work alot more dificult for arcitucts because you would have to carry things up and down a mountain.    THe Puebloans lived in Mesa Verda for over several hundred years.  Unlike the Inca we do know the begging of the Puebloans; they started out in about five hundred A.D.. At first nomadic but then farming replaced hunting and gathering. they lived in pihouses, made pottery,acquired the bow and arrow, and other cool things like that.

We know some of the old stories because they were written down by the europeans in 1532. The rest of our knowledge of Inca comes from artifacts. Some Inca sites have been disturbed by treasure hunters or looters. Last, the Inca lived high in the Andes and may even have worshiped some mountain peaks.

The first ancestral puebloans settled in mesas verde. they are basketmakers and have a great skill in crafts. they replaced hunting and gathering with their job of basketmaking. A lot of people lived in pit houses of adobe until theyt changed it to stone instead.          Many cowboys became cliff dwellers in the 1880s. the structures prove evidence of a society that over centuries gained skills and passed on traditions. they used nature and it was an advantage because ancestral puebloans built their dwellings beneath the over hanging cliffs. most of the fires built in the summer were for cooking. in winter the fires were made to warm up rooms that were damp and uncomfortable.

Actually this was an empire that had no formal system of writing, yet left no clues for people to look for them, which made this a challenge to some people looking for them. This was like a lottery for some people that found this city.               What made big city like this disappear over time?                        Most of the city did disappear due to the spaniards arriving, which carried the smallpox and they also had advanced everything which wiped out the Inca, since this is not only one country it was many, many countries all over the inca empire. so the spaniards had to conquer much of the empire one by one which was not difficult to them, since they had advanced everything.

Which made the city advanced for doing just that because they were the first ones to do this.ok, but you know where im going with this right?

The answer to all of these questions lies in the history of ancient civilations. From the creation of languages and writing systems to advanced architecture, our lives today completely depend on the work of those from the past. The Incas, Ancestral Puebloans, and Atlantians all made pottery that is still used in many cultures. Buildings, religions, and much more has been influenced by these awesome societies!

The ancient Incan civilization, the Puebloans, and the Pavlopetri all provide an example of the importance of learning about people from long ago.        The Incans provide historians with the information of one of the earliest forms of record keeping, quipas. Quipas were knots in coloredstrings made to keep count of livestock and other things in everyday life.

For it is a way of life and a necessity to go on further towards the brighter future. The Inca, the Puebloans, and the Palopetri have done their part as helping the future.       Now that we know more about them we can relieve are self's of the burden of not knowing are hidden past.For example the way we know what the Inca did like knots and clothing helps us understand that no matter what, we are all have the same and similar mind.The Inca did not know about clothing from other people across the world but thought of it on their own. Just like the Europeans and others.       By looking back on history we can see the mistakes made and avoid them to prevent them from happening again.All we have to do is find out what went wrong the Inca were conquered and the people of Atlantis could not avoid theirr fate of a natural disaster.       The way that they lived showed that as a human being like all human beings and animals adapt to their surroundings. The Inca lived in mountains and had a ton of gold silver and wood so they made tools. The Puebloans lived closely together probably to have each others backs. They depended on one another and relied on each other. The communication with each other showed their survival as a group.       Even though Ancient Civilizations are in the past they still can help the present and future. They can also determine a humans characteristics and ideas. Without those Civilizations would we be as we are today? Would we know what the humans natural nature is?   Would we stay as it is and not move on? Who knows but the future has been and will be decided all he have to do is wait and rely on faith and the past.

Not only because their way of lifestyle and art were so fascinating, we also learned very much from these amazing tribes and their way of lifestyle and skills are still used today.       Inca's were very smart and skilled people. The ancient Inca of Peru had no formal alphabet or system of writing. Instead, the Inca made knots on colored strings call a quipus to record the calendar to keep count of things. For example; Livestock, crops, money, etc. Europeans to meet the Inca were amazed that they could run a huge empire, just using string to keep count. Archaeologists  have found many quipus, but not fully understanding them. Clues were left behind by Incas for Archaeologists to study, for example; architecture, agriculture, government, transportation, and way of life. Thanks to these clues archaeologists can put together details of Inca life.       Puebloans were also very helpful, they first settled in Mesa Verde. They were known for their basketmaking, skill and craft. Farming was used more than hunting and gathering as a livelihood. They lived in pithouses and there were so many of pithouses that they were clustered, built on mesa tops, and cliff recesses. They lewarned to make pottery, bows and arrows and were more efficient for hunting 	NNP POS , NNP POS , CC NNP POS NNS VBD RB NNP NNP RB IN PRP$ NN IN NN CC NN VBD RB VBG , PRP RB VBD RB RB IN DT VBG NNS CC PRP$ NN IN NN CC NNS VBP RB VBN NNP NNP POS VBD RB VBN CC VBN NNP NNP NN NNP IN NNP VBD DT JJ NN CC NN IN NNP NNP , DT NNP VBD NNS IN VBN NNS VBP DT NN TO VB DT NN TO VB NN IN NNP NNP NN : NNP , NNS , NN , FW NNS TO VB DT NNP VBD VBN IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN , RB VBG NN TO VB NNP NNP VBP VBN JJ NN , CC RB RB VBG NNP NNP VBD VBN IN IN NNP IN NNPS TO VB , IN NN : NN , NN , NN , NN , CC NN IN NNP NNP TO DT NNS NNS MD VB RP NNS IN NNP NNP NNP VBD RB RB JJ , PRP RB VBD IN NNP NNP NNP VBD VBN IN PRP$ NN , NN CC NNP NNP VBD VBN RBR IN VBG CC VBG IN DT NNP NNP VBD IN NNS CC EX VBD RB JJ IN NNS WDT PRP VBD VBN , VBN IN NN NNS , CC NN NNP NNP VBD TO VB NN , VBZ CC VBZ CC VBD RBR JJ IN NN	1		20131025091009	2365	1		20131025091010	2370	1		20131026101029	2338	2
