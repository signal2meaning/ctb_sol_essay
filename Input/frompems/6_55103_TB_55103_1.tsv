Some robots help in hospitals some do rescue missions, some gather information for scientists, some help out farmers, and robots even play around with kids. In hospitals, robots carry medicine to the patients for the nurses and doctors. these robots open doors, maneuver around obstacles, and much more. These robots might be small, but the can carry up to 500 lbs. These robots run on batteries, and they can be charged. If these robots charge for two hours, they can work for twelve hours working in the hospital.           Another robot does search and rescue missions on mines. This robots abilities are almost endless. It can carry water, food, and it can drag injured people to safety. This robot has four wheels that help it roll through tight spaces. It also has a radio transmitter that helps the person communicate with the rescue team. this robot might be small, but it play a huge roll in the world today.          This robot can walk up sides of mountains and volcanoes. It studies the volcanoes magma and its texture. This rrobot can withstand the heat of the volcanoes to get better information. It's spider like legs help it crawl steep sides and move quickly. It helps the scientists get a better understanding of volcanoes. This robot is charged and takes batteries. This robot is the newest break through for science.

Its time to take the dog for a walk.' I walked down stairs and picked up the leash, as soon as my dog heard it he dash over and i tied it around his collar. WE walked around the block when i realized i was going to be late for school. I ran inside my house and picked up my running shoes and dashed off. I could hear my mom in the backround screaming 'Jimmy, Jimmy you forgot your lunch!' But there was no time to go back. Today was the big race at school and you can't participate if your late.                       As i ran into school i heard the bell, i was just on time. As i walked into class and took my seat my tacher gave me a number i was #7. As soon as everyone got a number we walked out to the track. When we were out there we split in to groups. Then we took are places. 'Ready, Set, Go!' screamed Ms. Haynes. We were off i was almost there when Billy came up beside me and ten he beat me. I was so mad i ran to the other side of the school. As i was walking i saw something. I couldnt really tell what it was, 'No, Really' i said in a confused voice.

This robot is small and it carries food,water,and other supplies if a person gets hurt just for safety.And Dante 2 is a robot that has a job that is to climb into volcano and experiment inside the volcano.And it looks for vents or holes if its a fake volcano.Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals helping doctor and nurses and he brings medicine for the patients.           The Agribots are a robot that picks fruit it might pick watermelons or apple any fruit. There are farmers to and they can towed big trucks. And he a strawberry picking robot to and they are planters to the Agribots are really something.And one robot babysits baby sometime but not all the time and its called the hrp-4 robot it can sing and dance they got trash and gadgets to built hrp-4.               So all the robots that i said all have jobs to do there like humans but medal humans we are made out of skin and meat bones all that stuff. And robots don't have meat or bones or skin none of that stuff if i had a robot his job would to play video games and watch tv now thats a robot.

Space Adventures with Markie Marco Jr.       Lets start with the simple facts; My name is Makrie Marco Jr., I'm 10 feet tall and a robot. I'm an ordinary robot, like any other, I drink oil with my friends on Friday nights, and go into deep sleep modes on Saturday. A pretty typical robot if you as me. I got into my new mercadees space car with my best bud Leo, (He was programmed with laser eyes and a really annoying voice, gosh I hate that!) to take it for a spin. We crash landed on a planet called Earth. Leo didn't 'survive' the crash. I found some shrubs and went into sleep mode for the night. Next thing I knew i was in a strange house wearing a size 49 dress! There were some alien life forms on the floor sleeping in bags. I poked their cheeks. They opened their eyes and, wait for it.... 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,' they screamed.   'Ouch,' my ear.   'MOMMY!' They yelled in unision. Whats a mommy?   'What is that? Like some sort of toy?' how are these aliens so loud? I stood up and banged my head on the roof. The humans were too loud for me. So I left the house and entered my ship, and went back to Juberron.

He was a robot that brought medicine to kids that needed help and the doctors couldn't leave them. When there was someone in his way he would jump on over them. Also he could say many things such as: move it, open drawer, elevator and much more. So it was his 2nd year working at the hospital. On June 23 he met a patient that was very ill and Mr. Robbie McGower thought she needed to cheer  up so he started talking to her, and she just loved it! They ended up talking for a long 2 hours. Anyway the doctors gave the Bella the medicine that magical Robbie carried around, and soon enough about a week later the little girl was healed!!   Anyway that is why he is called magical Mr. Robbie McGowel.

They help doctors and save lives. They even explore volcanoes. Some robots are even on space like on the moon or other planets.  Most of the robots collect inormation for people. Some robots even play all by themselves. Some robots could drive too, they never get distracted. Robots could be really helpful. They don't text or drink or get tired. They could see things that no human can.           Other robots help people play with live animals. One company, I-pet companion, has made a robot that lets people plat with kittens, but from a distance. When you log on to the Internet, you can control the robot from far away. The robot is put in a room full of kittens. It drags a piece of string for the kittens to chase. When is your turn, you can control the robot to pull the string this way or that way. The kittens jump after the string as you push the controls.       College students in oregon have created robots that play hockey or shouffleboard in there own. All year, the students work hard to design the robots. The robots play the game without any instructions from the students. The robots grab the puck turn, twist and compete to score. In the final test, the robots must push the puck to the goal without being told what to do.

On a very peculiar day I walked into my room to grab a jacket and I saw the robot cut out of my favorite poster. I figured it was my brother messing with me so I stromed to his room to get my poster back. When I got there he wasn't in there. I wasn't sure where he was because he wasn't outside either. Then I got a good idea.       I looked in his room for my precious poster but I was unsuccesful. Then I got a brillant idea. I ran to my room thinking he hid it in there. When I got there disappoint burned inside of me like a fire. My robot poster was no where to be found. I checked everywhere I could think of. Then just as I was leaving I heard a beep.       I went back in and found robot eyes stairing back at me. This robot looked just like the one from my poster. I grabed what was left of the poster and put it around the robot. The poster looked just like it did before. Except for the fact that the robot wasn't paper. I then heard the robot say something like 'Hi! I'm Robbie. What's your name?' I told him with a shaky voice 'I'm Kiera. How did you get here?' Just as fast as I said that he was gone. I then had my whole robot poster back and with curiousity filling me up I hung it up and cherished it even more.

I said ' What in the world is this?'Then I got up and took a closer look.It was a robot, and it was so tiny I didnt know what it was at first.I imagined it as if it were a living robot!I would take it everywhere.After years and years, my dream came true!          My robot grew and grew and finally came alive.I was so amazed , I didnt know what to do.I couldnt believe it was actually alive! I could take it anywhere! For example, I could go shopping with my robot. I could take it to parties. I was so glad and I said, 'I cant believe it . Its a robot !' Then I said,' I wonder who gave it to me or who put this in my room?'Finally i decided to take it to my science club. 	CD NN , IN DT NN , PRP VBP RP CC VBD DT NN NNP PRP VBD DT NN WP PRP VBD .

One would think that if you had just been given the world's largest robotics company, TechCorp, you would just feel on top of the world. But it tends to damper your being given a company if that company just happened to be the worlds smallest robotics company, was going out of business, and several of the robots produced for your company did not work. This was exactly the situation of Sebastian Fet, and he honestly didn't want anything to do with the company. He did however, take the company due to the fact his father, Harold Fet, had given it to him. What he did not know, was that being given TechCorp would be the start of quite a grand adventure.               For the first few months of his owning his company, things felt pretty easy because he simply sat at his desk most of the day. A week ago, some guy on the assembly line suggested a new part, and he just said yes to get him to leave. Just normal boss stuff. If he had known what the part was, he may have fired that worker of his, and things at TechCorp would have gone the way things should. But, he didn't, and he'll soon bee wishing for his job he did.               'Hello?' Sebastian said to his phone.           'Ah, so you've finally answered,' an employee replied.           'What could it possibly be, I have ever so many things not to do today,' Sebastian said, with a smile that wasn't seen over the phone.           'It's one of the robots, there is an issue. Please come as soon as possible.' The worker said, and hung up. Sebastian was not happy with this conversation, for he had just been hung up on, and he now had to leave his chair, right when he was getting comfy too.           When Sebastian had arrived, he saw what once may have been his testing room, Before a robot had destroyed it. It was a robot meant to rescue climbers, but it was playing, not rescuing. It was playing very roughly. There was a ball wedged in the roof, and several frisbees that had much to many things broken to list, and what looked like a yo-yo stuck in the roof that the robot itself was dangling from. This robot was obviously needing to be destroyed. But he had an idea, one that could save the rest of his building from goin down in flames.              Sebastian labeled the robot DEFECTIVE-01 so they new which bot was the broken one. He Brought it to a construction company, and had Oferred them the robot as a replacement for a wrecking ball. They accepted, and the wrecking ball man was not in any way happy to lose his job.          The robot, when prompted to destroy the building, had left for some nearby mountains, later to have saved a climber. The robot was not how it used to act, for it almost seemed alive. But of course it wasn't, a silly thing to talk about. When Sebasstian had got to his chair, he found a robot had beat him to it. It was watching tv, and was sipping on some juice! Sebastian felt foolish, but he had tried asking him to get off. 10 seconds had past, before the robot had asked him what he had said, for apparently he didn't hear. Sebastian thought it may be time to take a vacation, but he repeated himself and the robot actually got off. He looked at the machine, and remembered when he thought about when he thought it acted alive. He pulled a chair up for the robot, and started talking to it. They were having quite a conversation, something about cats, but an intern had walked in on the conversation, and droppend everything in her hands on the floor and her jaw had nealy touched the floor.           The intern, who was named juan, had asked who was controlling the robot, but laughed when told nobody. He knew that there was not a robot with opinions about which cat had the softest fur. Robots can't even feel things.           'Well then, if that robot actually talks...' Juan started.           'Which it can,' Sebastian interupted.           'Then how much are you selling it for?' Juan finished, ignoring Sebastian.           'I don't plan on selling it. It feels so alive it sounds wrong to do so. Besides, he does indeed give a gret conversation,' Sebastian answered.           'But sir, TechCorp may actually make some money for once, If you just keep it for your personal plaything, none of us will get any good money,' Juan argued, quite upset with his boss's desision of that robots fate. 'Good conversation. Ridiculous.' Juan thought.           'Oh just leave, I run his company, and I have grown to be very fond of this here bot.' Sebastian said, very annoyed. Juan had left, but he did not want to let that money go down the drain. He was getting minimum wage paychecks as it is. No, he was already thinking up a plan to get that thing sold. In fact, he new a guy that may like a robot with such capabilities as that. He didn't plan on giving Sebastian a slice, however. He had his chance, and he blew it.           Sebastian renamed his robot Gordon, because DEFECTIVE-01 wasn' what Sebastian would think to be a good name. He wondered how Gordon got the way he is, however, and he remembered that part that they included. He decided to go to the factory and see what was happening down there. Things appeared to be normal, and it turned out everything was. He asked if they had a new part, and the workers asked said that one robot had a new part, but since it was acting up they stopped producing them. When he was told the new part, he couldn't believe his ears. It turned out that a scientist named Ronald had succesfully been able to include a partially functioning brain. 'Wait a second, partially functioning?' Sebastian asked, confused, 'What doesn't work?'           'Well... the robot, Gordon, as you named it, has some hearing problems in his left... microphone,' Ronald answered, grinning, 'He has some other problems like he can't control his streangth too well, and he's pretty stupid.'           'Okay, so he's got hearing problems,' Sebastian began, 'and he's stupid? How is he stupid?'           'Well, umm... He's just not too bright.' Gordon answered.           'I didn't know a robot can be stupid. But if you say so. Well I gotta go. Bye'   Sebastian said, feeling dumb because he, the owner of a robotics company, didn't know a thing about robots other than what he'd seen in cartoons as a child           Juan had decided to sell Gordon to a robotics dealer in Taiwan, and thought it to be rather funny to think he was working at TechCorp, and selling parts to their rivalling companies. He just needed a way to get the robot away from Sebastian. Sebastian wouldn't fall for 'Oh hey can I just see your robot for just a second and take it too Taiwan for no apparent reason?', so he needed a plan, and sadly he wasn't good at plan-makery.           Sebastian and Gordon were shopping for vegetables at a store, when Sebastian had realised robots usually don't eat food, so  he asked 	NN VBD RB DT JJS NN IN NNP NNP CD MD VB IN IN PRP VBD RB VBN VBN DT NN POS JJS NNS NN , NNP , PRP MD RB VB IN JJ IN DT NNP CC PRP VBZ TO JJR PRP$ VBG VBN DT NN IN DT NN RB VBD TO VB DT NNS JJS NNS NN , VBD VBG RP IN NN , CC JJ IN DT NNS VBN IN PRP$ NN VBD RB NNP NNP VBD RB DT NN IN NNP NNP , CC PRP RB VBD RB VB NN TO VB IN DT NNP NNP VBD RB , VB DT NN JJ TO DT NN PRP$ NN , NNP NNP , VBD VBN PRP TO NNP NNP PRP VBD RB VB , VBD IN VBG VBN NNP MD VB DT NN IN RB DT NN NNP NNP DT JJ JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN PRP$ NN , NNS VBD RB JJ IN PRP RB VB IN PRP$ NN JJS IN DT NNP DT NN IN , DT NN IN DT NN NN VBD DT JJ NN , CC PRP RB VBD NNS TO VB PRP TO NNP NNP JJ NN NNP NNP PRP VBD VBN WP DT NN VBD , PRP MD VB VBN IN NN IN PRP$ , CC NNS IN NNP MD VB VBN DT NN NNS NNP CC , PRP VBD RB , CC PRP MD RB VB VBG IN PRP$ NN PRP NNP NNP .

You would think no one would ever wasn't to go there, but this was the perfect place for Dr.Vanbot. He was a scientist that needed a deserted place to build his super bot.            Dr.Vanbot and his mini robots, Bob, Tob, Lob, Kabob, Katob, and Susie, all worked together to build the super bot named Sbtcde, standing for super bot that can do everything. When they finally finished making Sbtcde, taking four years to do, they pluged him in. She had a soothing voice,was suprisingly small,and looked like a bunny, but even though she did not look tough she was very mighty, so they changed her name to Adison.             Adison could do many things but when Dr.Vanbot tried to show her to the government, they rejected her. Dr.Vanbot was disappointed and lost all of his self confidence never paying attention to Adison. Without the doctors support the mini bots made fun of Adison.One day the doctor came out with Adison waiting for him, but he went over to the wall not even looking at Adison and grabbed her plug and gave it a yank. All Adison's lights went of as she slowly was turned off.                  You may think robots have no emotion but Adison was a SBTCDE. After a day of being off Adisons lights turned on in the middle of the night. Every bot was asleep so Adison ran away thinking no one loved her. She drove to the city turning into a car in search of someone to love and appreciate her. She traveled all over until she finally stumbled onto a race track. Not knowing what to do Adison turned into a car and raced using her radar detecting when racers are near and speeding up she won the race.                         The racer in last place had to give up his car because it broke down. Running over to Adison to congratulate the driver discovered that no one was in the car. So he took Adison home. T he man named Jeffery, was a doctor, and o part time miner, racing was just a hobby. When he found out about all the amazing things Adison could do he promised never to un-plug her.                     Adison cold work at the hospital, mine, racing track, and was the perfect friend for Jeffry's daughter, Anabell, because Adison's origanal shape was a bunny. Adison and Anabell played all day and was a great help for Jeffery and Abbly. They lived happily together and had a great future, the end.

But instead her parents her a robot dog        for her birthday. Lily's birthday was in two days so her parents made a surprise        birthday party. Lily's dad say lets take Lily o her grandma's house for two days         during doing her surprise birthday party. Lily's mom sure let go take her right         now ! Ten minutes later ...... were at your grandma's house Lily's parents said.        When they got home there grandma was there Lily was so happy to see her       grandma. Then her parents went back home to plan the surprise birthday party.       They thought about what did Lily like they thought then they thought that lily liked dogs. So they made a surprise birthday party about all kinds of dogs. Two       days later ....... they finished Lily's surprise birthday party then they called lily's       grandma to bring her over to there house to surprise her with the birthday      surprise. When Lily and her grandma got home they surprised lily with the party      with all her friends there. Lily started to cry of happiness because they remembered that it was her birthday. Then when they ate cake she opened her     presents she opened hers parents present first and she got a robot dog. Then she      open the other presents. That night when she was going to bed she said she wanted       her robot dog to come to live. The next day she heard  a dog barking she woke up     and saw the robot dog alive first she was scared the she was happy that she had a      real robot dog :) . Then she told her parents that her robot dog came to life her       parents thought she was crazy then they saw the robot dog alive then they got  scared. Lily said can i please keep it pleeeaasssee the her parents said sure why not.   Then Lily got happy :) And kept the dog in her room and took care of it and she loved her dog a lot &lt;3 	DT NN IN VBD TO VB NNP DT NN VBN NNP VBD DT NN NNP CC RB PRP$ NNS PRP$ DT NN NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP POS NN VBD IN CD NNS IN PRP$ NNS VBN DT NN NN NNP NNP POS NN VBP NNS VBP NNP NN PRP NN POS NN IN CD NNS IN VBG PRP$ NN NN NNP NNP POS NN NN NN VB NN PRP RB RB .

I try to recall of any earlier events, but I can only remember me working my usual shift with Mr. Gower, the robot.  He was helping me deliver the medicine to the doctors and other nurses.  It did seem unusual though... Do I remember him acting like... a human?     I lay up to see nothing but rubble scattered around.  A wave of pain hits me in the head.  I lay back down and turn to my side.  My eyes search the room for something to kill the pain.  There has to be something in here, I am in a hospital.      My hand wonders to the spot on my skull.  Blood.  Great.      I continue my search for the medicine.  I find a bottle of pain killers.  Just two and I'm done.  I lay down and wait for the pain to dwell.      After what feels like an hour the pain is gone.  I reluctantly sit up, still in a daze.  I exit the door into the hallway.  There are heart monitors and medicine bottles distributed up and down the hall.      I see a man laying on the floor.  I rush to help him.  'Frank, What happened?' I search his eyes.  My co-worker stares blankly into my soul. 'Frank please answer.'  When he doesn't reply I shake him.  This does it.  'Frank.'  He only has enough energy to point to the control room that holds the security cameras for the floor.  I gently let him down and tell him if he sleeps he will feel better.  I dash to the room and open it to find the computers nice and neat.  I pull up the footage of the day and fast forward to approximately 4:00 P.M.      I rub my eyes.  Am i going crazy?  Are my eyes deceiving me?  I see Mr. Gower damaging everything in sight!  I panic.  My body starts to tremble.  I feel as if I might break down.  My hand reach for support.  They flail around for a second and I reach what feels like a tracker.  I look at my hands.  It is a tracker.  A tracker for Mr. Gower.     Mr. Gower was made differently from the other robots in the other hospitals.  He has a tracker built into him.  The inventor did this in case he gets stuck in a storage closet and we can't find him.  He is also low on battery level too, so this should help me find him and save the other places he is planning to attack.  He has about two hours left until he breaks down.  Although it's pretty clear Mr. Gower is a bad robot, why would he want to do this?                                                          I exit the hospital with the tracker in my hand. He is on 17th street.  That is two blocks away.  I speed my pace to match the little red dot.  How fast is he going?  I begin sprinting. I turn a corner, then another, then another.  Finally I see a tiny robotic cabinet rolling across the street.  I run towards him and his reaction goes from mad to furious.  I pause in the middle of the street.  I don't realize I'm holding my breath until he stops and waves to me.      What? Wasn't he just racing towards me his beady little eyes glaring at me?  I step closer to him.  He seems to be smiling.  I cautiously continue walking.  He says, 'Your delivery is here.'  I give him a puzzled look.  I search him with my eyes.  His cabinets seem to be ajar.  I step closer.  I realize that was a big mistake.  He has fooled me into a circle loaded with bombs ready to go off.  This may be my last moments in life.  I know if I try to move the bombs will explode.  The bombs count down: 5... 4... 3...     Suddenly, I remember What happened in the hospital:   Mr. Gower and I were making our usual runs up and down the halls. Then making our way to the elevators to go up to the floors above us.  Since we are on the first floor, there are long lines for the elevators.  I decided to take the stairs.  I left Mr. Gower with Frank and descended up the stairs.  On my way down from the 13th floor I fell.  I tumbled all the way down.  I remember people picking me up, taking me to a bed.             I try to open my eyes and I hear voices in the background.  I see light and my whole body cringes.  'You were in a comma,' a doctor says.     'For how long?' I reply confused.     'Two years.'                                                         	PRP NNP NNP NN IN DT NN NN VBZ VBG NNP NNP VBD . .

The robots wont just help people because in every robot movie, robots want to take over the world. So I will make robots to have their free time, I would even try to make a planet of robots. It may take several years, but at least I will try.                               The first robot I will make is my butler. Sometimes at home, I get lazy and my mother tells me to do my chores. But instead I will tell my robot butler and he will do my chores.It will be awesome that one day, my friends will want a butler robot and I have to make one for them.                               Sometimes robots could could cause pollution and I think I can solve that solution. I would make everybody use the robots 'only' for emergency so the robots wont cause pollution. Like in every movie for example: The Lorax. In the movie it the Once-ler chops every tree down and he causes pollution. In the beginning, the Once-ler promises that he wont chop any trees down, but he cuts every tree down and puts smog in the air. I don't want that to happen with a my robots.                               I think I'm done with my robot stuff for now. Well I really want to say that 'Robots could take over your mind!'

Mr. Jones the science teacher was watching when Jeff got the wedgie. So at lunch Mr. Jones told Jeff to meet him in his classroom after school today. Then after school Jeff meet Mr. Jones in his classroom. He told Jeff that he saw Jeff get that wedgie and wanted to tell Jeff something. Mr. Jones walked to the closet in his room and open it. Jeff was amazed by what he saw in the closet.            Mr. Jones said that 'it can't do anything yet until I find a battery that is strong enough to program it'. 'I'll tell you what, if you come after school again tomorrow I'll tell you more about the robot'. 'Okay' said Mr. Jones.            'Okay' said Jeff. 'Bye' said Jeff.            The next day after school Jeff rushed to Mr. Jones classroom.            Mr. Jones brought the robot out of the closet and said 'I have great news Jeff'. 'I found a battery that is strong enough to program the robot'.            Jeff asked 'why did you build this robot in the first place'.            'I wanted something that can actually cook food in this school' said Mr. Jones. 'I was going to test it at my house this weekend'. 'Want to come over'said Mr. Jones.             'Sure' said Jeff. 'What time should I come over on Saturday' Jeff asked.               'Come over at 11:00 a.m.' Mr. Jones reply.            'See you tomorrow' Jeff said to Mr. Jones.             Saturday came and it was 10:30 when Jeff started to walk to Mr. Jones house. Jeff got there at 10:50 and knocked on Mr. Jones door. Mr. Jones answered the door and said 'welcome'. Jeff walked into the house and asked 'where is the robot' and Mr. Jones said answered 'it's in the kitchen'.Jeff and Mr. Jones walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table to think about what the robot was going to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     When Jeff said 'I know hamburgers', they both heard a noise.                                                                                                                                                           So they both went to search around house and when they came back to the kitchen the robot was gone. Then they searched the house again and when they both came back to the kitchen, they both saw the robot by the front door. Mr. Jones went up to the robot and took the battery out and said 'I better find a different battery for the robot, so it doesn't start up again by itself.                                                                                                                                                         The next day after Jeff's science class, he went up to Mr. Jones and said 'Good luck finding another battery,'  and then he left.  Jeff was glad Mr. Jones was there for him.

My head is aching, my feet are hurting, I'm covered in sweat, and I don't have my blanket to calm me down. I stomp over to the window and plop myself down in a beanbag chair. I stare outside the window into the Harvard school yard with a flustered face. Everyone in the school was doing something they were good at. What was I good at? Nothing, exept for building robots that don't work and playing with my cat, Zeba.        I heard the doorknob turn, and then open. It was my dormmate, Kevin. He was in a fancy suit, with a briefcase and everything. He walked over to me. He gave me a look as he squished my cheeks and asked, 'What's wrong, Mr. Gumpy Pants? Why are you so sad?' I swatted his hand off my cheeks. He lifted his hands up then went to his bedroom to change.        'So, have you gotten the robot to work?' Kevin questioned. I got off the beanbag chair and siad, 'No. It just wants to not work today.' I paced back and forth for a while until Kevin came out with a clean white T-shirt and shorts. He flopped down on the couch and inspected my robot.        'Well, what's wrong with it?' he asked, surveying my robot carefully. He lifted an arm up. Then the other. He dropped them both. Then he lifted the legs up. I shook my head.        'I don't know. but for some reason, it just wants to be a jerk.' I shook my head. I went back to the beanbag chair. Hot tears were streaming down my cheek. This was my chance to become famous for building a robot that can pull five tons and be able to have the playfulness to play with my cat. Kevin inspected it some more. He stood up and gave it a slight kick. Everything was quiet for a second. then, I could heard motors starting up. I slowly turned my head around. There it was, sitting crissed-crossed-applesause. It's bright eyes were looking at me. I was looking back at it. I cautiously walked toward the robot. My head was pounding with awe. I couldn't believe it. Kevin looked at me with a smile. 'Fixed it!' he cried out, polishing his nails. 'Your welcome.' I still couldn't believe it. It works. It works! I knelt down at the robot so him and I were looking face to face. It was amazing! Kevin bent down next to me.        'So... you going to teach it anything or what?' he asked then turned to my robot and said, 'Shake!' I watched the robot lift it's hand and shake Kevin's outstreched arm. I stood back in amazement. 'Let's see if it can pull you truck.'        'Alright!' exclaimed Kevin.         I placed Betsy in front of Kevin's truck. I placed straps on the pencil shoulders then connected the other side of the straps to Kevin's truck.        'Pull!' I hollered. Betsy did as she was told and started to pull. I saw Kevin's truck move a little, then a little bit more, then a little bit more. It was actully moving a truck! I laughed and looked at the little two pound robot, made by pencils and pieces of wood that I was able to create. I looked at Kevin while picking up the robot as soon as it stopped.        'Let's go try it on something that weighs ten tons!' I exclaimed. Kevin groaned.        'On who, Bigfoot?'  	NN VBP PRP$ NN .

At first I thought it was just the cat but, it was to loud to be the cat. I started shaking thinking to myself, ' What if it is a person stealing all my stuff.' I cautionily headed down the steps. I made sure to be as quiet as possible checking all around me every step of the way. CRASH. I headed for the noise that came from the kitchen. When I reached the kitchen I almost had a heart attack. It was The robot I have been working on for the last month. I finnaly finished it today but, it wouldn't work no matter what I tried. 'Hello,' the friendly robot said. As I cleaned up the mess he made, I spent an hour observing him very carefully. I could barely keep my eyes open, so I made him a spot in the basement and locked him down there. I made sure he couldn't get out before I went to bed.            The next day I let him out of the basement. While fixing breakfast, I tried to have a conversion with him. 'Hello what is your name?' He replied, 'You haven't given me a name yet, master.' ' Fine I will name you Dexter,' I said giving him a name. As the next few days countinued I tried to see how well he interacted with my animals. I commanded 'Will you go keep my animals entertained?' He replied ' Yes, I will get on it right away ,sir.' He went in where my animals lay. As I silently watched, I noticed that he had no problem interacting with the animals.            The Next few days counitned working with him. I decided to take him outside on a leash of course. I called for him,'Dexter, will you come here please.' Dexter came into the the living room where I was sitting. I asked,' Will you put this leash on?' 'We are going outside.' As he put the leash on I walked him outside. I didn't go to far the first few times. I also tried keeping him away from animals and people. As we walked down the street I started a conversion,' How do you like it out here?' Dexter replied, 'It is very nice out here.' 'Do you like it?' 'Yes I do,' I answered. 'What do you like to do?' I asked. He answered, ' Well, I haven't experinced much in the few weeks I have been living but, I enjoy walking out here with.' I was suprised that he could speak that well with barely any training or even picking up the words I used.            As the last few days came I started to let Dexter be without the leash this time and let him roam free under my supervision of course. So, as we walked down the street we made small talk and he asked me questions like what his the world like. One question stood out the most. He asked me if there any robots like me out there. I answered with, ' There most likely is robots out there just like you but, I don't know where I could look for them at. As from then on he started feeling sad.  He never told me but I could tell. I didn't think robots could have emotion ethier. I started to feel sorry for the little guy so, I tried to copy some of him into a new robot. As I secretly worked on many different robots none succed until I oticed something. The night Dexter came alive my cat was down here. There were some certain chemicals that were down that I never experimente with before. I some chemicals in them and nothing. Then after thinking and thinking I came up with the solution. The chemicals mixed with the cat hair and made fuel.            After one week with experiment I made a few pals for Dexter. He enjoyed them and I tried the same experiment that I had with Dexter and they turned out like Dexter with few changes in looks and personalty. Dexter was the smartest with words but, the other were pretty good with speech also. Dexter was so happy that he could have cried if he was able to. I tried creating robut animals and so forth. They had conversions and even acted a little bad sometimes. They also did work and helped around the house and got along good with each other. They were just like mechanical humans.

The robot will help a lot of commuities all around the world. The robot will help out peoples at homes, hostbital, and many other places.There will be a evil character in the story.   The robot helps people in different places everywhere. A   inventor name Mike shlefer makes more of robots to help other places to have thier own  robot. Mike names the robots shawn.There are different types of robots to have different allbilites. there is even a fighting robot to destory bad robots.   There is a evil robot name Megatrops on plant zarding.   Megatrops wants to destory plant Earth. A messenger from zarding warned Earth to be Megatrops to work for them. If they refuse there plant will be destoryed. A few weekes later Megatrops have not got a answer from Earth. During those few weeks the fighting robots came up with a plan. Their plan was when Megatrops aravive to destroy them is the will attach them off gaurd. Then a fleet of fighting robots will sneek out and go to Zarding to destroy thier world.           The messenger of zarding came to Earth and ask if they have made a chioce yet. They said to give them a couple more weeks   to decide, but the messenger said '' that is to long''. The messenger gave them a couple more days. During those days they were getting ready to fight.The first robot that was created was the leader. As soon they arivvied the battle was on.Then Megatrops and his fleet was destroyed.            That was a essay about a science fiction story. Earth lived peachfully for the rest of there live. The robot leader had survived the battle.Megatrops was throw into another universe to never attach a plant again.

After the robot show we get to go back-stage and see the actual characters. We also get to go to see them in the morning.       We are here! Finally, I have been waiting for this all morning. We got in and checked in to the back stage because we got to hang out with the members before the show started and after the show ended. One of the members asked all of us as a class if we wanted a tour with the robots and I screamed YES!!!!!.  Their was different people to talk about robots there and different kinds of robots there. The type of robots that were there was Gemini-Scout a Dante 2 a Mr.Gower and a Agribot.          My teacher was Mr.Gower he talked about robots a lot. That is why they named a robot Mr.Gower. Mr.Gower said that a robot can work at a hospital, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to the patients.                                                     Agribots pick fruit from trees. It can pick berries, oranges, grapes, or even apples. Agribots are not used that often on farms. The reason for that is farmers are very interested in  the robots but they don't have as much money as other farmers.                                                      The Dante 2 was made to work for interesting jobs. Dante 2 goes into volcanoes and looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. The robot has eight legs.           There is A LOT more other facts, so lets get back to my day. After we went  on tour we went out where our seats was and then sat down and the show started to begin. I said to the girl beside me 'this is going to be good'.  The first part they were talking about there trips around the world. Then they had a little play we went to. The play was called (Fantastic Robots Coming to Town).  When the day ended we all went back to school and our parents picked us up I guess what I learned to day is that robots can have a lot of fun but they have to have so time to work.  Robots have a lot of interesting jobs. We all had a great day and we hope we can go back again.                     	VBP VBN NNP NNP NNP .

This robot is like a nurse,pharmacist, and a doctor. He can steer himself, carry up to 500 pounds! He runs on battires. if you charge him for only two hours he can deliver medicince up to 12 hours! This robot can also talk. he has been programed to say hundrands of phrases such as ''Calling elevator '' and ''Your delivery is here ''.

The reason why i chose Mr. Gower is because he is a really helpful, hard working robot.       Setting:        The places i think Mr. Gower would be is in hospitals.I think he would be in hospitals because Mr. Gower helps out nurses by bringing them medicine for patients. He can  also go places in the hospital for example:elevators, and he can also steer through hallways, and move things around.       Plot:      The plot in this story is that Mr. Gower is a helpful robot. he is also a hardworking robot helping people with what they need. I think he's helpful in these ways:carries 500 pounds, works for 12 hours, and holds medicine.       Dialogue:         Mr. Gower can speak a little bit of words for example he can say, 'Calling Elevator'or 'Your delivery is here.' Those were some of the things Mr. Gower can say.       Robots: How Mr. Gower comes alive is because hes charged by batteries so when he works for 12 hours a day he gets tired out and aventually his batteries will die so when someone charges him the next day he will be charged and ready to go.       Sources: Some sources that i thought would've been good to look at information on Mr.Gower is sorce # 1:www. economist.com,and www.ri. cmu. edu research project detail. I think it would be helpful because those were some things about Mr. Gower and the other robots. That was my story about Mr.Gower.

We were all enjoying our icecream cones when we heard a noise coming from the sky. We looked up and saw a space ship coming down into our atmosphere. As soon as my mom noticed that it was coming down straight over us, we ran away in panic. And that's when it all started.        'Crash!' We all ducked down and covered our faces. When everything cleared up we walked slowly to where the space ship had crashed and found a robot sitting in the drivers seat. The robot's leg had been blown off in the explosion, I carefully placed it wear it normally should be. My mom used some glue to paste the leg back onto the robot. Then we all backed up and my dad called 911.        When the police and ambulance got to the park we were picnicing at, they said that 'NASA had called and was wondering if there were any signs of a missing robot in a space ship. And the robot was supposed to go to the International Space Station but hit a meteorite and came flying down. It was meant to be a handy helper to astronauts that came to the ISS.'     When the robot whos name was actually Clevlis was resting in the hospital my family and I visited him and we became really good friends.       A couple of years later we ware watching the news and apparently Clevlis tried again to make it to the ISS, and it turns out he did!!! I guess a robot can due more things than people think they can.

Lucy and Willy both screamed 'Yea!' and hopped up to the table.                   'This is good food,'said Dad.          'Yes, it is,' agreed Mom.          Suddenly, Lucy Screamed, 'What is that?!'          Lucy's dad turned around as quickly as he could and saw his robot standing right there.          He screamed,'He's alive!'          'Who is?'asked Lucy.          'My robot! It works!' replied Dad.                         'I get to play with him first,'said Willy.          'What did you name him,' asked Mom.          'I haven't named him yet,'replied Dad.          'You should name him Roger or something,'said Lucy.          'Yea!'said Willy.          	PRP VBZ JJ .

Two boys named Dan and Jack entered the high school science fair.They were two smart boys that had the exact same idea.They were going to build a robot for the science fair.They wanted it to be a defence weapon but also be very smart.The boys started on it two weeks before the science fair.Dan and Jack finished the day before the fair.They made it have two modes they asked it questions while it was in brain mode.After that they put it in defence mode and tryed to attack it but couldn't put a finger on it.That night it powered down and they kept it in Dans garage.The only thing is they didn't turn it off or take it out of attack mode.              The morning of the science fair Dan went to his garage got the robot and walked to scool with Jack.All of a sudden it just starts talking and doing what it wants.They tried to shut it down but it was in attack mode still.Everyome at the fair tryed to help it was so smart it knew what we were going to do.We went to get help from everyone we knew but it couldnt be stopped.One of the kds says its electronic so water will shut it down.We tried to throw water on it but it was to fast until we all cornered it and got it.Every one was so happy they forgot about the fair they left the room.When they weren't looking the robot stood up.

So i took him home not knowing what it was or what he did. My dad was eyeballing it and suddenly! yellow light sprung from the metal jumping right into my eyes.My dad then said............. it`s a robot looking terrified. I guess my dad didnt really like the idea that a robot would be in our house.                                                                                                                                                                                                           But I begged him please dad we can show him how to..................then the robot spoke I already know everything i am not a dog am I. My dad looked at me then the robot and then he said were is he going to sleep.I jumped up with excitement.The robot then extended something from his butt a bed rolled out into the the hallway. He then said I think we got it covered pops.                                                                                                    We were best friends I would take him to the movie theaters, amusement parks,and more. Anywhere he went i went luckily it was summer because he couldn`t enroll in school. One day we went to the icecream parlor and he wanted icecream so igot him an ice cream and he opened a latch in his stomach and put it in a freezer that was built in. I awed in amazement.He then put it in a holder he then said its for you he pulled it out with sprinkles and toppings i said how do you do thaty he then goes, secret of the pros.                                                                                                                                                          I asked him where he got his name he then said japanese inventors. I then said it must take a real genius to invent you. He then chuckled and said just what I thought he would. Do you know why you found me in the dumpster all messed up. Because i fell out of a cargo plane.                                                                                                                             Without my indestructable metal I would have been killed like any other robot would. I then asked him why would you be made like that and no other robots are. he then said because I am made to have fun. And I said you sure are Robby, you sure are. We then laughed and smiled and said your my best friend I ever had, like we purposely jinksed eachother.

The key had a golden, brassy color to it. Jack was a very curious boy, so he wondered what the key opened. Jack quickly ran inside to show his father Thomas his newly found treasure. Thomas identified the key as his great grandfather's.   His great grandfather was a phsycopath obbsessed with robots and space.At his time mechanical objects were almost unimagenable to the general population but he was no general population.       Thomas's great grandfather Gerald Taylor was born in 1856 in the small town of Roseburg, Oregon. As a child his family migrated from Ohio on the Oregon Trail.   From a young age he was facsinated by unworldly objects. Legend has it that in 1871 at the tender age of fifteen he built the world's first robot and it was deigned to fix railroads without pay or supervision. His machine was a sucsess and people from all over the country wanted to own one of his mahines       Jack Taylors key was a key to the factory that mass produced his machines  and Jack was delighted to own a piece of family history 	DT NN VBN NNP NNP VBD VBG PRP$ NN JJ NN IN PRP$ NN WRB PRP VBD IN DT NNP NNP NN VBD DT JJ , JJ NN TO NNP NNP VBD DT RB JJ NN , RB PRP VBD WP DT JJ NNP NNP RB VBD NN TO VB PRP$ NN NNP PRP$ RB VBN NNP NNP VBD DT JJ IN PRP$ JJ NNP NNP NN NN VBD DT NN VBN IN NNS CC JJ PRP$ NN JJ NNS VBD RB JJ TO DT JJ NN CC PRP VBD DT JJ NNP NNP POS JJ NN NNP NNP VBD VBN IN CD IN DT JJ NN IN NNP , NNP NNP DT NN PRP$ NN VBD IN NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNP DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBN IN RB NNP NNP VBZ PRP IN IN CD IN DT NN NN IN CD PRP VBD DT NN POS JJ NN CC PRP VBD VBN TO VB NNS IN NN CC NNP NNP NN VBD DT NN CC NNS IN DT IN DT NN VBD TO VB CD IN PRP$ NNS NNP NNP JJ VBD DT JJ TO DT NN IN NN VBN PRP$ NNS CC NNP VBD VBN TO VB DT NN IN NN NN	1		20131022131037	2350	2		20131022131049	2348	1		20131024171039	2402	1

It was a sunny day in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This young girl had a dog robot named Fluffy. Fluffy and Angelina were best friends. It was summer when the amazement happened. Little Angelina, only 9-years-old, playing with Fluffy in her backyard. After using all their energy, they went inside the house for lunch. They ate a lot, so they had to take a short nap.        After an hour, Angelina and her dog woke up. She exclaimed, 'Fluffy, you look so real. What did you do to make it look like you have real fur?' Then, Fluffy barked. All of a sudden, the confused girl said, 'Are you sick? Your bark isn't the same.' A few seconds later, she realized what had happened. Her robot dog became real. She thought to herself, 'This must be a dream!', so she pinched herself. She then said (realizing that something very exciting happened), 'Ouch! Fluffy! You became a real dog!'        When her parents heard her screaming joyfully, they asked, 'What happened?' Angelina told her parents the whole story. At first her parents thought that she just was imaging everything, but Angelina's parents saw the evidence (Fluffy as a real life dog). After this coincidence, the 2 of them lived happily ever after.

It also used th tell the captian what to don if there was any action going on. Those are some of the things this robot does for the army.               To begin with,one night it was raining and there was lighting one struck hit the robot then the robot insantly came alive. The next morning the robot was better than all the soilders there was. The robot took the captians spot and was giving special orders to everyone.This robot was really boss to the soilders. The robot Didn't want to carry the weapons he just sat around damanding orders to the soilders.                 Secondly, The captian made the veterans,rookies,and the generals to go into devastating war. He made the americans fight in Vietnam,the robot also got civilians and put them in war. Many of the soilders died in vietnam. The captian said he didn't care about those lousy pathetic fools. The robot captian was selfish cared about nobody!!!                Furthermore, the robot was planing to take over the world. The amrican soilders worked together trying to stop the captian. The captian was building 100,000,000,000 robots for his salvation. The robots were about to destroy the white house but then the american soilders came with brutal force,&amp; desroyed all the robots they saved the captian for last. They destroyed the captian &amp; lived a better life.                  To conclude, The army has numerous of  tools to use in the action. The army didn't name any of their tools but their was this one that was special.This everything about the army. This tool got used in mostliy all the action there was in vietnam. This tool was very useful for the soilders in the army.

That was not there before I went to sleep. Im positive because, its at the place i always stare at when im trying to sleep. The robot is proped in the corner. It is about 5.5 feet tall. The robot is a beautiful sparkling silver. Has two feet like a human except the about a foot long. Some robot has really long feet. I think the rovot is designed to look like a human, because it has bright fire engine red hair. The har is back in two Long braids. Tied at the end with ocean blue ribbions. The robot has eyes that are shut. Obviously the robot needs a mirrior becouse it has just a lot to much eyeshadow.  The robot has a dress on. The dress is a light pink. like the pink in the sky when the sun is setting. The dress is long sleeves. The dress is covered with white polka dots. Each polka dot is about the size of a quarter. The dress on the robot isnt like human dresses nor is her hair, its metal along with the rest of its body. I decide i want a closer look at the robot. So i stretch out of bed. BRRRR!!!! My feet touch the freezing cold floor. It feels like stepping on ice barefoot. So i quiky run over to slippers and slip my feet in. It warms my whole body quikly like sitting next to fire on a cold winter day. As the warmth of my feet spread to body i quitly tip toe over to the robot. When I reacht the robot i crouch down. While i look into the robots face i suddenly realize the robots eyes are open. I scream bloody murder as i spring out of the room. Down the brightly painted hall. Down the wooden stairs. Threw the messy living room. Into the drak kitchen. I flip on the lights. Where is everyone i wonder. At the grochery store, out- No i dont have time for this i interupt my thoughts. Where can i hide? I wonder as is spot the door to the basement. I run to it open the door and grabe a flashlight from the near by shelf. I quikly flash it on run down the squeeky,  old wooden stairs. Farther i go into creep darkness. .           I quikly flip on the light. Countinue running. I open up the door to the gym. I run threw the huge gym. Into the library i go. Library! Since when did i have a library. Wait since when did i have a basement. Sice when was my bedroom upsataris. Since when did i have a gym! I figured it out this isnt my house! I have to get out. I see a door in the back of the room. I run to it. I put my hand on the freezing cold brass door Knod and open the door. It leads to stairs. Up the stairs i run. I opne another door at then end of the stairs and am outside. I need a break im breathless. So i run the to neighboors back yard and take a break. Sit down and rest. Then i hear the gate slowly creek open and see the robot heading my way. I cant move im in so much shock i cant move. The robot reaches me. One hand move towards me and grabs me. Then it pukks me up. Drags me into the shed and says. This is my secret play house. Wanna play dollies? Suddnedy i realize its a nice robot.

She was a lonely girl in a less ordinary world. But one day that all changed....        Her parents decided to take a trip to the Bahamas.She did not want to go but her parents made her. On the way their, the plane hit minor turbulence witch turned  into intense turbulence.That day the plane had crashed, their was only her and a boy named,Regan.He was 13 years old also, and had big super blue eyes and a really blond hair color hair   Jamie helped Regan because when they hit the ground, Regan hurt his ankle.                            (TWO DAYS LATER)   Now that Jamie had gotten to now Regan, she kind of had a crush on him.But she had no idea.Regan was an alien.He was from planet R, he came down to earth because he had a mission to uphold. It was to capture someone and to bring the human back to planet R and run tests. But Jamie is falling for the wrong person.                              (THE NEXT DAY)   Regan called in for backup to capture Jamie.   But now Regan does not feel right about this, he is starting to like Jamie to, so he went to go get some coconuts, and set up a little dinner for Jamie and him.   At the end of their cocoanuts Regan moved in to kiss Jamie but then, His back up comes.Their were spaceships everywhere and their was nothing he could do.Just then the mother spaceship dropped a net on Jamie and captured her and Regan flew up to release her but it was to late.Jamie was gone.

Well there are many different types of robots here are a couple names of some robots just so you guys know a few types there is the Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, Agribots those are some major kinds. Some robots can drive and they also like to play with pets and humans. Google says its been years ago since robots could drive.               If you could would you have a robot with you in your house? People say that robots can drive, and they are very friendly. They also say they are very playful and that robots like to play with your pets and kids. Robots also help you around your house and they are kind of like a pet. That does not need to be taken outside or even feed so that would say you alot of time and money.            Lets say if robots could drive do you think that they would get distracted while driving? Do you think they would text or call while on the road? Or even get drunk while driving? Me personally I dont think so, but thats my opion!              I think if robots were alive they really could help the world and people in need. Plus no more dishes, laundry, making dinner nothing like that.So if robots were alive would you want one to live with you? Just remember they could be a big help!                                                    By: Olivia Woodward,   	NNS VBP PRP VB IN NNS . NNP PRP VBP NNS VBP JJ .

He is a battery runed robot, i never actually wanted to make one but it some how turned to a robot .I was thinking about making  a new device that could help us in our daily life.Thats when  i was like whoa! i can make a robot.it was hard so i called in a few buddies of mine.When they got here they were like do you really think you can make one.'I said not without your help'. so it took us at least 3 months but it was done. The day i was making the adjustments i turned it on to see if it would work,and when it started moving i called the guys and they just couldent believe it. we saw it runing around the place like crazy.afther that i had to call the sceince guys so they could show them and they were offering 200,000,000 dollars it told him yes.then i was famose on .i was on t.v.,newspapers.Ijust didnt know what to say afther that .i got into the internt. well thats the story for now later.

As  time went by the family was getting disappointed.  they were mad because the toaster was burning there food.  the family gave it one more chance to let it toast their food right but instead it froze there food.  the were so disappointed that they just threw it out.  the toaster was sad.  it didn't mean to disappoint the family it just got sick.  Then all of a sudden he got angry at them and decided to plan a attack in a few days.  he searched all across the globe to find all of the robots that could help him show the family that he is just not a toaster.  once Stefano had his meeting and every one agreed to the plan they were off to get revenge on the family.  the first robot to attempt the house was a cash register.  it rapidly shot coins at their windows which caused them to shatter.  all the commotion causes the family to wake up.  the flam thrower burned the house down but the family escaped.  they were running for their life.  the RC car dove up to them causing them to trip and then all the robots gathered around the groveling family.   the robots were goring crazy .             secondly Crete of the robots heard about the horrible accident and rushed over to the family on his hover craft.  when he arrived the family had lost a member thanks to the blender.  the scientist talked to the robots about the planet earth rules and they agreed to never harm humans ever again.  still to this day robots have been helpful not harmful to humans.  without robots we wouldn't have cars and many of the electronics we have today.  if a device doesn't work just be patient AND GIVE IT A FEW MINUTES.

Their names were Ashley Ann Walker and Sander William Walker. Their dad's name is John Haiden Walker. Ashley and Sander new that their dad worked for the mining, but he hadn't been home for days. So one day they were walking to the park and they past a garbage can and they seen two wheels sticking up, so they got the thing out and they seen that it was a Gemini-Scout robot. They seen that it was broke but they had a grandpa who fixes cars, robots, etc. So they called up their grandpa and he answered and they asked,' Can you please help us fix this thing that we got, because it broke.' So their grandpa came over and he saw that it was damaged pretty bad but he didn't want to say anything. So the next day he had fixed it, and then the kids said thank you and looked up the name of Gemini-Scout and it said that the Gemini-Scout was a robot that helped the mines fined the lost minors orlet them know that there was terrible gas or something. Ashley and Sander gasped with releif. They knew that they could find there dad with it, but they noticed that it was only 2 feet tall and they wondered how it would carry their dad out. But they kept reading and it said,' They might not look strong but they are.' So Ashley and Sander started to go down to the mines and they got to the cave and looked in and it was pitch black. So they yelled for their dad and there was no response. So Ashley but the robot down and gave the remote control to Sander, because the remote control looked like a Xbox controler and she knew that Sander loved to play Xbox. So they seen the camera and turned it on so now they can see where the little robot was going. And so they say yellow, orange, and red on the camera and they new it was their dad. So the little robot pulled him back all the way where Ashley and Sander were. They seen they he wasn't in good condition so they called 911 and they came as fast as they could. So they got him to the hospital and told Ashley and Sander to stay outside. And then Ashley and Sander seen a robot kinda like theirs. They did also see that the robot could talk so they looked it up and it was named Mr. Gower. They seen that Mr. Gower helps the doctors, they bring them medicene most of the time. So they seen it go into their dads room and they heard him talk! They jumped for joy to the boice of their father and they went in to give them a great big hug and kiss!       So ten years later Ashley got married to Stue Wisley and they had 8 kids. Four girls and four boys! Their names were Brooke, Sophie, Scarlett, Jamie, Bill, Charlie, Sam, Joe. And Sander got married to a beautiful young girl named Samantha and they had 2 kids there were 1 girl and one boy and their names were Claire Marie and Justin william. The End!!!

Gemini-Scout is a robot the is ment to scout areas where people can't reach you get to. Dante 2 is a robot that is like a spider that gathers infomation about its findinds in a volcano. Mr. Grower is like a medicine cabinet on wheels and came say hundreds of phrases. Agribots ar bots that pick fruits. HR-4C is a robot that is a robot that is like a friend to children. Google car is a car that is self driving car that you use a laptop to tell it what to do.

It does a lot of things like cleans,plays music,and plays sports.But when Robbie plays sports, Robbie is the best at hockey!Robbie made the puck in the goal!Everyone was happy! They say 'There never be a robot like Robbie since i,robot was a made up story.Still robots can have fun.                        Some people have a mom and a dad.But Robbie did not have a mom and a dad.He was a robot when he came in this world.he could do a lot of things like play music,sing,and dance.Robbie did not have parents because he was build by a character in the book. But he did not know that he did not have a mom or a dad.Then one day,when he woke up he was a human.He was so happy!he could not believe it! He thought he was going to be robot for the rest of his life!But he didn't think that he was going to be a human for forever.but now he is a human.Now he could play sports,play music,sing,and dance.Now he has endless fun!                                     There is another robot that named Agribots.Agribots pick fruit.it might pick berries,oranges,grapes,or apples.Some farmers want to have this robot to see what it does.Agribots come in all shapes and sizes.There is this one in japan that can sense the color of the fruit.Scientists are working on growing a cherry tomatoes with out human help at all! They want to see if the robot can do it by its self.Every plant has sensors that tell the robot what the plant needs.'If the plant is too dry,a robot will water it'.Thats what it says in the sencond paraigraph of agribots.

'Alex, I'm not going to tell you again, your robot is not alive.'          'Yes mama it is alive it just talked a second ago.'             'Whatever,' I said                   From that day forward I knew that nothing would ever be the same again. I din't know who or what to believe and I didn't know who or what not to believe. My brother's robot is named Bob, I felt that he was my parent. Bob fed me, kept me company, and so much more beyond that. Bob was a role model for my brother and I. Now get this, he even cleans our rooms!                    Bob eventually was taken away from us and was given to  a scientist. We knew he was better off there, but we missed him desperatley and wanted him back. While Bob was away he was trained to to climb into the ground and retrieve hurt people and climb into volcanoes and pick up information. The scientists decided that he wanted to take Bob away on an expidition across America. Thats when my brother and I knew we had to go get our little Bob                      Later that night Alex and I packed out bags and took a long bus ride to the scientists house where we saw Bob on the fornt porch. The house was an old faded yellow with ugly white shutters. Bob had changed tremendously,  he wasn't gray anymore he was bright red and was wearing something that a scientists would wear. My brother and I looked at eachother,'BOB,' we yelled and ran over to him. All of a sudden this nasty scientists walked outside. He had a moles all over his face and reminded me of a witch. 'This is ours, I believe,' we said and took off laughing faster than we've ever ran before. Bob started to say something, but was cut off by the rumbling of the bus. When we got on he said that the scientists didn't even know that he was actually alive and could talk and care for people, he was just using me. 'I'm so happy you guys found me!' 'Awwwww,' we said,We are happy we found you too.'

Robots are used in factorys, movie sets, laboratories, and many other places. The robot named Gemini-Scout goes on search and rescue missions, the robot Agribot comes in many shapes and sizes because it picks fruit and vegetables.            There have been storys about robots taking over the world and the robots taking people lives. I have read about robots before and some robots help people and some can be fake pets. People have made robots to help us with life.People have been saved by robots before.                                                                                                                                I think people would have life easier with robots. I think if we had personal robots like in the movies people would be selfish and not respect others. I also think if we had robot fighting istead of our troops they could come back safer. Do you think robots would be good in life?                                                                                                               	NNS VBP VBN TO VB IN DT NN RB .

Flynn said 'Is there anything in particular we have to do?'Yes actually you have to use your imagination!' Ms.Flowers has always has been Flynns favorite teacher.Suddenly an idea popped into Flynns head. He told his best friend danny what he was going to do for his project.Danny thought it was a great idea to make a robot for the assignment.Danny said'Wow how are you going to pull that off?'Flynn hasn't put a lot of thought into it so he said 'I have to look up ideas on the internet.'' 'Can i come over to your house today?'asked Danny.'Sure why not I'll help you come up with ideas.'Sounds great my mom will drop me off at 3:00.'                         When Danny came over to Flynns house they got started right away. Danny's idea for his science project is putting a needle through the a balloon without it popping.When Flynn got on the computer he went straight on to Google. he typed in'How to build a robot?'Answes popped up everywhere but Flynn only stuck with one.Once he got all the materials he built the robot of his dreams. He was so professional he made a switch to turn it on and off. When he turned it on it didnt work so he tried it again still nothing one last time and nothing happened.'Whats going on?'asked Danny. 'I dont know somethings wrong.'they aked Flynns mom and she said nothing but,then she said 'we'll fix it later once we come back from dinner.''                   When they got out of the car they went into a chinese restraunt called Lucky duckling. When they got in they ordered the mom gave Flynn and Danny a dime so they can go to the wishing well.When they got over there Danny wished for a new skateboard.   Then Flynn wished for his robot to work.When everybody was done eating they got their fortune cookies and ate then read the fotune and   both Danny and Flynn got the same fortune saying 'your wishes will come true'.                     When they dropped off Danny Flynn and his mom and dad went home.When Flynn went into his room his robot was working and walking around and talking. Flynn went rushing to his robot and talked to him.The robot said ''Hello Flynn how are you doing today?'   'Good now that your alive!'Robot said get some sleep if your going to show me off tommorrow in class.''ok'                    When Danny was done showing his trick Flynn went on the podium he showed everybody his robot.Everyone loved it and asked him to make him talk and ms Flowers gave him an A and he went off happy with his robot forever.

Then you test out your dante2 to see if it works or not if it burns or if it goes fine or if it blows up  because how hot it is and if it goes fine the poeple who sent it out now know when its going to erupt then they'll evacuwait poelpe out of the area. And going on to Mr. Gower he is the robot that goes on the elivator and he's like a capnit with wheel's it talk's and its super strong it can move 500 pounds. he all so runs on battereys  and the robot is up for twelve hours. And it charges for two hours. The agibots are realy useful for farmer because the robots pick the fruit for them some of them have long arms to pick the fruit and the robots have a program to scan the fruits color so it knows what its picking. I-PET is very useful if you have a cat but for me i would never get a cat but if i had a I-PET and put it out side with ally cats  i would try to scare the cats by hiting stuff  and makeing a lot of noise.

So, the person turned Robert on and the person said''hello'' and Robert said,''hello to you to sir''.Then the person got Robert on his robot feet.Then the person said,''what is your name?''Then Robert said,''my name is Robert the robot'' ''my name is Robert nice to       you'' said the person.Robert's boss shouted,''ROBERT HAVE YOU FOUND MY ROBOT!''Robert shouted back,''NO!''Robert boss was always yelling so it was ok to yell back.Robert whispered to Robert the robot,''I'm not gonna let my boss take you because if he does your gonna have to cleans up his messes.'' Robert the robot said back '' thank you I don't want to clean up his messes.''Robert's boss's name was Mr.flowers.Mr.flowers said,''I HEAR A ROBOT I'M COMING DOWN THERE!''       Robert whispered to Robert the robot,''hide he's coming!''Robert the robot responded,''put me somewhere!''So, Robert put Robert the robot in a small cabne under a sink.When Mr.flowers came down the stairs Robert said,''theres nothing down here sir''Then mr.flowers said ''OK'' and went back up the srairs.       Then robert said,'' let's make a break for it!''then Robert the robot said,''ok lets go.''Mr.flowers caught them running and said,'' GUARDS GET THEM!''the gaurds got them.Then Robert the robot pushed everybody out the way and they ran far away from that place and they started their own company.

Potions bubbled, gases hissed, and electricity surged through wires and circuits. Dry ice was sitting in a corner, and clouds were rolling out of the bucket. The laboratory was littered with screws and broken glass and crumpled blueprints were scattered all over the dusty tiled floor. In the middle of the pigsty sat Dr. Jykell, who was a rather cranky old scientist, mumbling to himself how annoying it was to construct the same thing seven times, without any success. He was tired, and he sleepily took his wrench and fixed up some loose bolts on the chunky piece of metal lying before him. The machine looked complex though, as it had a series of buttons and gadgets and whatnot attached to it. Dr. Jykell's piggish eyes looked smaller than ever as he squinted, attaching a wire which was connected to a battery to his machine. He looked expectantly at his invention. Nothing happened. He grunted, then yawned widely. He told himself that he truly needed some sleep.                                                                     Suddenly, as he was turning away, a series of beeps erupted from that machine. Dr. Jykell spun around and was greeted by his machine, his robot standing up with his multicolored lights flashing and beeps filling the room. Dr. Jykell's eyes widened. He jumped up and down, as high as his stout little body could go, shouting out of joy. He did a little dance and sang in his gravelly voice! He finally skipped over to the robot and said, 'Your name will be....Marvin! Yes, yes, it will be Marvin-make it Marvin the Seventh, for you're my seventh yet successful try! Yipeeee!!'                                                                                                                            As it happened, Dr. Jykell was not just a scientist, but also a very honored manager of a coal mining industry. He installed a camera, a thermal camera, an air detecting device, and a first aid kit in his beloved Marvin VII. Marvin VII helped Dr. Jykell very well, in ways that not even a human could! He detected and saved many of  the doctor's miners and found new places where coal could be found.                  Marvin VII was like family to Dr. Jykell. The doctor felt like his invention could understand him. 'You know,' Dr. Jykell was saying to Marvin, 'You did well today. You saved Brady, Tony, Jackson, and Ryan- my best miners! You dragged them out of certain death and led them to safety. I have to say, I'm very proud!'                 Marvin VII swiveled his neck around and looked at Brady, Tony, Jackson, and Ryan. They had only a few cuts and bruises, rather than broken limbs and death. Marvin was satisfied with is work. 'Beep boop bopitty pop click zzzzip!' he replied. He loved Dr. Jykell as much as Dr, Jykell loved him.

Once there was a huge school,an this particular school was almost always busy. up until the newspaper went out all around the school. The papers headline was 'classroom 86-d6 has created a mechanical menace.' Shocked at it my freinds Erik, Jonathan, Erick, and I rushed through the hallways into the newsteam room, but all around us there was nothing but the news printer and darkness.' who do you think wrote this editoin?' I said. 'Come on lets go look around in there.' Erick asked. so we all investigated the whole news room'okay lets lea-'Wait! what about the escape hatch to the roof? maybe there 'investigating' up there, yeah it sounds about right.' 'we'll open it on three. one, two...       Three!' i said as we opened the hatch to find the news team.' oh look, boring useless dumb and-' save it tweedle-dee and tweedle dumb. hold on what you got there?'-umm nothing, just our camaras.' they said nervouly.'well i'll guess we'll just leave, and oh yeah don't forget we have Bop already.' i said as jonathan, Erik, and Erick took bop in there hands.       'Hold on, this isn't Bop' i said.'Yep thats not B.o.p all right' they said as we saw them push bop of the roof. 'Noooooo, bBop!' as the whole class came out to see Bop smashed on the ground. thats not all that happened though some thing weird happened the next day Bops parts were in there normal shape and Bop was alive. 'hey look Bop actually works.' some kids said. 'Bop must leave. Bop no live on earth Bop live on planet Bop.'

Robots exist now and they can do many tasks. If you and your husband are going out for a romantic date together and you can't find anyone to babysit, a robot can be your child's babysitter. Robots can feed your kids, put them to bed, and even play with them. Robots can also play with your pets or even play like them. Some robots even know how to save lives. Robots have helped doctors perform surgereys and they take medicine to the patients who need it.                       One day everyone will have a robot and they will do things for you or your family members that they can't do. For example, if you have a sick relative and they are too weak to do anything for themselves a robot can help them. Like mentioned above, the robot can help you get medicine, put you or anyone else to bed, and can help you take care of kids. One day everyone's lives will be much easier.

I was not in tirerly sure about it because I was scared something would go wrong, and it did...       We were in the science lab making a room cleaning robot when all of a sudden Liz came running done the hall screaming ,'Robots every where run!' Jill and I exlammed at the same time,'What!'       Then Jill said,' Yes it worked I made a robot.'. A whole fleet of what looked like robot maids came  rushing done the hall cleaning every thing in sight. They were headed right for us...       I reacted insently grabing both of them and throughing them in the lockers I quick jumped in the lockers as well and waited. Soon they were gone.       Liz said,'Is there someway to reverse the palarity?' Jill being the nerd she is says,'Yes you have to pull out the mother board of one.'       So we were off to get the mother board.  We came arcoss one and quickly riped out the mother board there was this wierd sound and then the robots stopped.

Then she said loud and clear ' Our class assignment is to... build a robot and make a poster board to go with it!' Everyone stared shocked and surprised. Some of them didn't even know what a robot was. Amy (one of the students) raised hand and Mrs.Janice asked what Amy needed and Amy said 'What kind of robot? And how are we supposed to build one?' Mrs.Janice ignored her for a second and then replied 'Well, you buy the parts and design your own.' Amy stared at her and said 'That sounds to difficult!' Mrs.Janice started to wonder what was so hard about it. Next she said ' I will give you each a sheet of paper that gives you a list of some resources so you can get an idea of how to make your robot.' Then she held up a paper that read: 'Good resources for making or researching a robot; http://WWW.umm.edu/news/releases,/robot.htm;http://WWW.economist.com/node/15048711...' And it went on. After everyone finish reading the paper the bell rang and the students went home.                As Amy walked home she thought about how difficult it would be to make a robot. Amy thought about what supplies she would use and how. She thought about how she would design her poster board. She realized it would just be easier if she didn't complain. When she got home she was still alone knowing this she tried to remember why. Then she remembered that her mom and dad were at work. She was a loner anyway and did not like help. She got to work on her poster board. Threw a dash of glitter, smeared a little paint and pasted pictures. When she was done she started on her robot(which was the longest and hardest part.) She didn't know where any wires were except for the computer so she raced towards it knowing it would be a piece of cake to yank just a few wires from her dad's new computer. After she had the wires she looked up how to connect the wires in order to make the robot move. The website said to design the machine first. So Amy took some metal and bent it into the shape of a sphere and added eight legs just like the Dante 2. Next she made a crane at the top so it could grab and carry stuff. And right behind the crane she added a seat and steering wheel. The reason Amy added the seat and steering wheel is so she could ride her robot. After all of the designing was done Amy threaded the wires into the right spots and put the correct programming into the correct areas. It wasn't quite done yet though because Amy had to decorate the big robot. So she ran to her room and dug through her draws and found hot pink glitter paint, purple glitter, blue glitter, puppy stickers and a baby blue seat cushion. Next she ran back to the living room and got to work. First Amy painted the robot, not missing a single spot. Second Amy put sparkly polka-dots all over using a pattern of blue and purple. Third she put the cute little puppy stickers inside of each colorful little polka-dot. Lastly she tied the seat cushion onto the raised seat. Amy's robot was going to be the best robot ever.            Amy kept trying to get control over her robot but it was very difficult and confusing. Amy could move just not steer it. it worried her because the assignment was due tomorrow and each student was supposed to demonstrate how their robots worked. Amy decided that maybe her robot just needed some fresh air so she rode him to the park. Eventually she started to gain control over the tall robot. After awhile Amy decided her robot wasn't good enough; she wanted a waterproof robot that can go into heats as high as two thousand degrees Fahrenheit. So she rode her robot to the store and bought insulation and waterproof spray. When she got to the check out she paid the cashier and walked outside to where she sprayed her robot with the waterproof spray and put the insulation on her robot. Now her robot was the best. She had control and it was waterproof.             Today was the day of the presentation. Amy felt nervous but relieved. But she knew she could do it. She got dressed in her spotted polka-dot dress with her hot pink flats. She felt a knot in her throat as she hopped onto her robot. She sat, her back laying on top of her poster board. And they started walking, keeping an eye on the road. She felt so tall and strong as a cool breeze blew through her hair. As Amy and her robot approached her school she felt scared. Her robot step into school, all of the younger kids staring in awe at the sight of a real robot. Amy just ignored them as she walked down the sixth grade hall towards her class. She commanded her robot to open the door with his crane and he did. Amy dropped her stuff off and went outside for morning recess. She walked outside wondering what the presentation will be like.              After recess all of Mrs.Janice's students rushed inside like a stampede. Amy felt clueless as she walked through the doors of the school. Amy sat at her desk wondering who will present first. Then she heard her teacher talking she was about to announce who was presenting first. Then she heard '...The presenter will be... Amy!' Amy was so shocked she almost threw up. Amy slowly walked up to the podium and recited her speech. Next she showed the class how it worked and walked back to her seat. Then she heard her teacher say 'Wow, give Amy a round of applause!' And everyone clapped for her. She blushed at the thought of everyone liking her robot. All there was left to do was watch the other classmates' presentations. First Carl's, then Bob's, third Sally's and so on. Amy didn't really have a favorite because she loved them all. And Mrs.Janice loved them all to.

Also there are robots that have jobs can talk and all kinds of stough. what i learned about was robots and what they can do. like i said they can talk and they also have jobs.            I learned a lot about this and i didnt know that some could clime and have jobs. Also for a job there are exercieses like running and playing. this story is for if some people dont know a lot about robotes they could read this story and understand.

The way I found him and where he wanted to go.       One day I was going through the attic to find old things to play with because i was bored. I came upon a big box. So I opened it up and guess what was in it? A robot it was kind of medium sized.       I turned the robot on and it worked. I asked him what name was. He said it was Mr. Gower. He said 'hello' and asked me whatmy name was. I said my name was james.       I followed him around a bit to see what he could do. He could talk, steer himself around,l and collect information. It was so cool.       Mr. Gower asked if I would take him to the nearest hospital. I said ok sure. So we started walking about there I asked him why he wanted tio go to the hospital? He didn't answer me. When we got there he started helping the doctors. He was carrying there supplies and brining medicines to the paitents.       The doctors asked me if they could keep him. I didn't know what to say so i went and asked Gower. He said he yes I  want to stay. So I let him stay to help the doctors. The doctors said I could come and visit him any time I want.       So a few weeks later i went and seen him. He was doing good. So we talked said hi and bye. So thats my crazy story of how a met Mr. Gower the robot.

When I figured out it was him I was ganna make him pay for wath hes do trying to sneak out. When we got to the mall I went beh ind bushes and fake trees. once he was heading out his one of his friends said ' Hey, what the heck is THAT' but it turns out it was just a random little 5 year- old girl that was being a princess! When I got home Tom was about 5 min. to getting through the door so I slamed the door open and yelled out 'Tommy snuk out of the HOUSE' and when Tommy walked through the door mom and dad was waiting right there!

Part 1                 One day there was 3 girls named Future, Isabella and Ashley. They went outside to the park, then,  they saw a space ship thing come down. They were scared. Ashley and Future ran in the house. Isabella was all alone. Then the space ship came down and got her and to her up to space. Ashley and Future were crying and hugging each other they did not know what to do. So they build a space ship and flew up to save Isabella. They saw the ship. Isabella jumped out of the alien space ship and jumped on Ashley and Future's ship. Then the helped Isabella get in. They got all ready and then flew back down to the home. Isabella said ' WOW! What a day.' Ashley and Future said ' I know right I thought you were going to die Isabella.' ' Well I'm happy that I'm not.' Said Isabella. Then they all went carefully to the park and then had a great time. The End?                                                                  Part 2                   They girls were at the park when all of a second the aliens come back down and said ' I'm sorry girls that I took Isabella I just go alone up in space all there is up there is me, my mom, my dad and black holes and plants.' Isabella says ' Well why did you not say so silly?' ' I felt embarrassed.' Said the alien. All of the girls said well that's OK now. Okay well see you later.' The alien said ' Okay bye.' All girls say 'Bye'. The End. 	RB VBD PRP VB .

The next day we went for a ride around town. After that we got back home and looked at the motorcycle then it started up by itself. we werent sure what to do. so we took it back to the shop and they took it apart and put it back together but they still didnt know what was wrong. then we took it back home and left it in the basement for awhile.       A few weeks later we went to check on it and it was gone. we thaught someone took it but no, it was rolling around in the front yard! we thaught we were seeing things but we werent. we took it to the robotics teacher at the school and he said 'how did you do it?' i had no clue what he was talking about. so we told him the whole story and he said that our motorcycle has turned into a robot! i was amazed at what that man just said. we took it home and ever since then we have treated it like family.

One day when my friends and I went to a toy shop we found a secret door with a whole bunch of robots. We thought they were just toys, but when we went up to one and touched it...... it said 'Hello what is your name?' My friends and I were all amazed! We all wanted to take one home and show our families, but instead we just stayed in the secret room in the shop and played with them. We soon started talking with the robot and it was actually really fun. The robot also remebered are names and everything we talked about. In the secret room we found like a testing area with a basketaball hoop. We started playing with it and we were all so amazed with this amazing robot. This robot could Dunk!!!!! He wasn't that tall either, only about three foot three inches. He really didnt miss a shot either. This was probably one of the coolest thing me and my friends have ever seen. Sadly at the end I realized that not only was this robot was not real it was all a DREAM. =( 	IN RB PRP VBD DT NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN PRP MD VB PRP IN DT NN CC IN DT NNP CD NN WRB PRP$ NNS CC PRP VBD TO DT NN NN PRP VBD DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP VBD PRP VBD RB VBZ , CC WRB PRP VBD RP TO CD CC VBD PRP : : PRP VBD -NONE- WP VBZ PRP$ NN .

If robots can do well with people than in the near future I wish robots will be made. Whats cool about robots is that they could be used for war, scientist , weather. There is lots of things that robots can do. I Think in 2016 we should build robots for the ones that need them like the government the war , and the body guards for the president. robots should be very helpful to people and vary clean because they don't eat or drink. So there wont be no worry for loitering. or crimes , murders , or stealing.

There are robots for rescue work, medicine deliveries, and for driving your car. Let's see which robots do these jobs.               You know how there are robots that do rescue work. One special robot for that is called the Gemini-Scout. Not only does the Gemini-Scout do rescue work, it also searches for items in the mines. It also collects information inside the mines. Not only that but it can also test the air to see if it is healthy or not. Then, the scientists on the mines can tell whether to enter or not. Also, if the Gemini-Scout finds a lost or injured person, there is a two-way radio to find them. Doesn't the Gemini-Scout sound like a vital need? I think so.                       Medicine is vital to an ill person. Why not have a robot to deliver it faster? That is why we have Mr. Gower. His job is to deliver medicine in gigantic hospitals. The doctors and nurses already do too much work doing surgery and all. We need to help those people! Mr. Gower is an important part of being in a hospital. Did you know that the Mr. Gower robot is so strong that it can lift up to 500 pounds? Just think, that can be full of vital medicine for to save peoples' lives. Isn't that fascinating?                          Finally, there are robots that drive a car for you! There is a car called the Google Car. This was introduced in Nevada and it is literally changing the world. Plus, the Google Car can control its own speed. That way, there won't be as many speeding tickets. Since this robot was full on changing the world, the state of Nevada wanted to send a law to the state Legislature to allow the Google Car to be used on the road. It is soon to be passed but if we try, the law might be passed.           Now do you see why robots are so indispensable to our lives. What would we do without robots? I have no clue.

'What is it.',they asked at the same time.Close your eyes and you will see.       They closed their eyes.'Suprise!'It's a pet dog.Well sort of.It's a robot pet dog.        'You can play with it but you don't have to feed it or take it outside.'But this robo dog is very special and they don't even know it yet.'I love it' cried out Jack.'Me too.' 'I'm so glad' said their mom.           'Hello Jack and John'said a radom voice.they looked around in curiosity.'Down here'said the voice.They looked down in amazment.'Who are you'asked the family.'I do not know,you have not given me a name yet.' 'I say lets call him Sparky'said Jack.'That's a good name said their parents.              'What else can you do Sparky'asked John?'I can do a lot of stuff' said Sparky.'Ican help tou with work,I can play with you if you are boerd,I can also act like any normal house dog or even an outside one as well.' 'Can you do tricks?'Asked their dad.'I said I can act like a normal dog cant I?'              'Let's see it then shall we.' Roll over,play dead, and shake. 'Wow, I guess I was wrong.'said dad.'We need to show him too the world he's a really big achivement in science history.'                 'But it is to much of a chance for scientists to take him away and study how he came to life.'Said the to brothers.Okay.'Yes!' Later that day they got to know Sparky a little bit better.'Mom!Dad!' Yelled the brothers.'We learned a lot about Sparky and where he is from.'                  'What?'asked their mom.'Sparky was originaly supposed to be a Dante 2 robot which is the kind of job where he is supposed to go into volcanos and explore it. 'Wow!' 'I know and that was a year ago but he got mixed up for a play robot and still to this day researchers are still looking for him.' 'But before mom could answer there was a knock on the door, we peeked through the window there was researchers outside.                    ''We need the robot please.' 'Can we help you?' 'Yes you can that robot is to advanced for human kind,we need him to go into volcanos and help us gather information,he is also Gemini-Scout he must help us get some miners out of the mine not so far from the volcano before the volcano erupts and kills all of the miners inside.' 'Please he is our only hope of getting them out alive.' 'Take him he has been good help to us so he will be goos help to you to.'                    ''Can we go see him in action mom.' 'I guess.' Once they saw him in action he succefully reterieved the miners and thank the lord the volcano went off thank to Sparky because he gave the researchers whst they needed in order to stop the volcano.

I was curious to find out how , how could it possibly come to life? I went to a scientist to see if he could tell me how this is possible. 'There is no explanation',he said.'I am sorry I couldn't be of assistance.' I could tell he would be working on the subject for a while.              At home I thought for a moment. What could this robot do? I pushed a button. This made the robot talk,cool! I told him my commands and he did them. I told him to make dinner and then do the dishes afterward. He did exactly what I told him. One day something happened ,and he wouldn't do what I told him to do. He said he wanted to leave. He wants to go to another house and help them. He had a great time but he has to go. I say goodbye and walk to my bedroom. I never saw him again. 	PRP VBD VBG IN PRP$ NN CD NN , PRP VBD RB VBN IN DT JJ NN IN WRB NN JJ NN VBD TO VB .

One day a young boy goes to the store with his mom and buys a toy robot. When the boy and his mom gets home he opens his toy. He plays with the robot for hours the goes to bed. The next morning he wakes up and can't find his robot he looks everywhere but still can't find. He goes downstairs and he sees his toy walkingaround and cooking breakfest.           He asked his mom if she made breakfest but she said no. So he goes into the kitchen and takes his toy upstairs to his bedroom.when he goes to his bedroom the robot starts to talk to him and he finds out that his toy had came to life.            He goes outside and finds out that the robot can do alot of stuff. For example it can run throw a baseball and even climb trees! He tries to tell his mom that his toy came to life but she don't believe him.             The next day when he wakes up his toy was doing the exact same thing as last time. He takes it outside and he plays with it all day. When he goes in he goes to bed wakes up and does the exact same thing the next day.              That is my story about a robot that comes to life.

She bumped into a nurse and the nurse's coffee spilled on Ms. Melon. Sparks started to come out of her and she and then she opened her eye's and started moving around but not like she used to it was like a human. The nurse she Knocked over was scared how about how she was more like a human than a robot she still looked the same but that was it.       She still continued her job but everybody treated her like a human they even gave her primisson to take care of the sick people. She was moved up to a nurse but she still got to deliver medican like she always did. She was not told what to do no more but she did have times when she would think she was still a robot.       She mostly only worked with the kids because she loved them she thought it was  fun taking care of them and talking to them. After she worked she got off and went walking around people looked at her like they was scared but she didn't let that bother her she liked living like a human. She met a lot of people and she liked that now she had friends she even stayed with one until she could afford her own home. She used to stay at the hospital when she was a regular robot.       A few days pasted and she was taking care of children and she got called and said they wanted her delivering medican so she went and did that job and she remeberd what it was like being a robot. She would always think of that she missed it but she had to realize she had to a human.

She named her toy robot Fia. Sally loved Fia more than anything. Sally took Fia to Target at 6:00 P.M and left her at Target. Sally noticed when she got home and her parents did not take her back to Target. Then something happened!        Sally woke up in the morning and went to eat breakfast and saw Fia. She did not know how Fia got back to her house because robots cannot walk! Then. Sally relized Fia was a huge robot who could walk, serve you breakfast, lunch and dinner, and drive. Fia was Sally's personal assistant!        Sally's parents were still sleeping so Sally wakes up her parents. She walks her parents to Fia and shows them how Fia is her personal assistant, but when Sally shows her parents, Fia she strinks down back into a toy. Sally tells her parents that she is a life size robot but they do not believe her so they go back to bed. But right when Sally's parents leave Fia turns back into a life size robot. Sally talks to Fia and asks why she does not want her parents to see. Fia says, 'I want this secret between me and you. Ok Sally?' Sally says,'Yes, I understand.' Sally and Fia promised to keep it between them until Fia gets more comfortable around Sally's parents.        As time goes on, Sally's parents find out about Fia and like Fia. Fia helps them cook dinner, clean the dishes, and clean the house. Fia got a car so she takes Sally everywhere like to soccer practice, mall, Target, and much more. Fia is the best thing that as happened to Sally and her parents.        That is what happened to Sally the six year old and her favorite robot turned into a life size robot. Sally's, and her parents life are much better with a robot who helps around the house for free!

He was getting his master his coffee without a thought in his head. R2D3 was a very rare robot. No other robots in the world had some the of the qualities he had! He had two eyes one was a thermal camera and another was a normal camera. He had a jet pack and unlimited fuel. He was made of the most rare metals in all of the world. His head was made out of Platinum. His body was made out of Titanium. Each of his legs were normal iron but every wire inside him was made out of gold! His data base could only recall a little bit about his master. He was the most famous robot creator in the world. His name was Liam Rosten of England. His creator made him have everything for every situation. He was a very unique robot, a very unique robot indeed.                 One morning he awoke cold and shivering. He was huddled in a corner where he was usually charging. 'What is this. Wait how am i talking to myself!' He looked down at his hands and saw what looked like his owners hands. His stomach growled and he wondered 'what is that?' He was scared his heart was racing it was getting hard for him to breathe 'what is happening to me!' He screamed a loud scream not a high pitched one. He heard someone coming down the stairs it was his owner. ' By gods boy what are you doing in my house? Sir it is me R2D3. Your not my robot he is, wait where is my robot!' R2D3 was scared his heart was racing again it was getting hard for him to breathe 'Help Me' His owner rushed to the kitchen and got him a cold rag and put it over his head and then he asked, 'Who are you.' This time he asked it in a calm voice. R2D3 replied 'R2D3 your robot.'                 R2D3 stayed at the house for several more days while his owner kept asking who are you. Then one day R2D3 had thought of a way to show him that he was his owner! he said, 'Mr. Owner could you please come here with all of R2D3's information?' 'Sure why not.' Then R2D3 started to say his serial number and everything about him. His owner watched in awe. He had never shared any of R2D3's information with anyone so he must be him! His owner hugged him and said, 'Welcome back.'

There were all types of robots that I didn't need. There were Gemini-scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, and Agribot. I knew I didn't need a Gemini-scout because I'm not a mine, and I definitely didn't need a Dante 2 because I'm not a scientist. The rest were useless to me. So i searched on another website and found a robot, HRP-4c, that i thought was interesting and the cost wasn't that much, too. I ordered it. now all I had to do was wait.            A week later, I got a package in the mail and surprisingly, it was the robot. I was so happy when I got it . now i could have a friend to watch over the house. I turned only the security on and left the house. As I was leaving I grabbed the keys. I called my friend and let her know I was free to hang out with her. I drove to her house and  to be honest I had a fun time. We watched a movie and ate ice cream. We even played truth or dare. it was the best time i had in a while  and I was happy to enjoy the moment. but all the fun was gone when I had to go home. I got in the car and drove home. it was 11:00 pm and I hadn't realized how tiered I was. I went to bed. The next morning was for me to get down to business with the robot and figure out how to use it. It was morning and as tired as i was i got up and started looking online on how to control the robot. I found that there was a button on the back that you could switch to Manuel and it would do normal things like house chores. I also found that there was another button and it was used for  a type of playing mode for kids or adult. I soon figured out that it could dance and sing! I loved the robot now.               That's when it all started. I left again to hang out with her. I came back again at the same time. Suddenly, I heard a noise and a crash. It was coming from the kitchen I grabbed a bat and headed down stairs. THE ROBOT! Some how it was on by itself it started swinging at me and breaking stuff. I was so shocked I didn't have time react that it knocked me out and I was conics. Later my friend went to drop off my jacket and saw me hurt. She called the cops. '' Is she going to be okay?'',she asked the cops. she's fine just an accident she must of left the robot on, that all '', he said. '' no I didn't I came down the stairs and it was on by itself it's haunted'', I said. But they didn't believe me. they left and cleaned the mess up. '' Maybe their right I probably didn't shut it off''', I said to my friend. She agreed to live with me until I was safe.                  She moved in the next day. We went to sleep early that night. Then I heard it. She heard it. We both went down stairs the robot was on once again. But this time the robot had red laser eyes and was staring right at me. I this time I reacted and so did Amanda,(my friend) we hit the robot with the bat. That didn't work. so instead we hit it even harder. After we hit it 20 times, and almost got hit by the lasers it was defeated. We had done it. It was over and done with. Amanda ripped the batteries out and I through the robot in the garbage to have it at the dump tomorrow. She was right, she had stood with me until I was safe and I am safe now with her.Later that day I moved to her house to live with her, forever.

He was partnered up with a straight A student, Ryan Trace, in the science fair.  Their assighnment was to build a robot with multiple functons.  Matt knew he had to build something that would astonish the judges. He didn't know what it should do or how he could do it.  He had the idea of making a remote controlled robot untill he saw all of the compotitions robots, all remote controled.  He decided he would build an A.I, an artaficial intelegance robot, one who could make decisions speak and even help people in need.  He and his partner did it.  It was a human like robot with super human strength and it looked like a human but it was a pale white metel. but there were multiple problems. One of the other smart cotestants Mark Gilvouski found the blue prints and tried to make one himself.  He had changed a lot of things about the robot, he gave it more emotions such as anger and hate.  Soon this new robot had figured out it was more advanced than humans and begun making more exactly like him but without leadership skills so they would listen to him.  The day of the science fair came and when Matt and Ryan Presented his robot Marks robot saw and had became furious.  Matt suggested that the name the robot and Ryan named him Raziel.             Meanwhile Mark had named his too, he named him Crowly.  he had soon launched a full out attack on the town, it seemed all hope had been lost.  Raziel had known this and started to make robots exactly like him, but by the time he had finished Crowly had already controlled the state and somehow without the militarys knowladge had gained controll of the U.S nuclear and automated weapons.  Raziel had finnaly decided to fight back.  There was an enourmous batle and most of the robots defeated eachother, but Raziels side was winning do to the fact that he built them eaquil to him unlike Crowly.  Soon Crowly had became worried and launched his automated defenses but they were no match for Raziel.  He had soon came to the room where his rival was hiding and controlling them.  Raziel had a huge tavantage though because he knew their only weekness elctricity.   after battling for a long time he got him into a large body of water and used an upgrade he made to himself, an electric pulsar. they were both destroyed and the world rebuilt itself and the creators of the robots destroyed the blueprints forever.           Twenty seven years later, Matts kid, jeremy, found the early blueprints to Crowly.  He made a remote controlled replica and put the core in that so he wouldn't repeat history.  But what he didn't account for was that it was an A.I core so it gained a counsious over time.  Soon it was aware of it's surroundings, then it was aware it was being controlled.  It started trying to fight the commands it's owner gave it.  Sometimes it could, sometimes not, but soon it was so strong there were only a few commands it would follow.  It had gotten so bad that Jeremy shut it off completely, but it turned itself back on and ripped out it's own circutboard for the remote controll setting.  the robot went on a killing spree trying to get rid of the humans.  he had to rebuild an almost exact model of Raziel with an electric pulsar and destroy the robot wich he did.  He died by the rebound of the pulsar which he had built wrong.  The building he was in caught fire destroying the blueprints and the early ones forever.

My mom didnt want to bring it to me and i did not want to get up because i was to lazy. So i like to play with science fiction stuff and i can up with the most smartest idea ever to build a robot that  can do evry thimg for me.It took me months to finsh the robot but i did all rhe things you have to put in a robot are lights ,voice control,and many other things.The first time i tried out the robot it didnt work so i had to mess with it and fix it again the next time i tried it it did work.I worked on it day and night with my dad we did have a hard time fixing it but we figured it out we did not use any instructions or any thing.           The only reson i use the robot is to do my homework, clean up , and to get anything i want. Having a robt around is fun becuase it does anything for you . If a robot was to ever mess up you will have to pull the cords having it around is dangrous becuase if you have a small child it will fall on it and it my hurt them. A robot will only listen to your voice so if your brother or sister tells it do something it will not listen to them. The robot that i  build is able to lazer tag you so if your soop was cold it would warm it for you . Since this is my robot i am going to call it Super Satar i called it that becuase it does evry thing fast as if a star was falling.

One was Mr. Gower, he helps out at hospitals to bring things. For example he brings medicine to the patients. He can also talk, ride on elavators, and runs on batteries.            Another, robot that they talked about was Dante 2. It climbs in volcanoes, and tells the scientist if it is safe to go in. It figures out if there are dangerous gases in the volcanoes. With Dante 2 scientist can now explore a volcanoe from their labortories.            They also talked abput a Geemini Scout which rescues and searches mines that are under ground. Its remote control is like the one that you would use to play a video game. This robot has a two-way radio to talk with others. It also uses a thermal camera which uses heat sensors to find other people.          The Agribot is a farming robot. It picks fruit when it senses that it is ready. For example there is one in Japan that does that. In Massachusetts scientist are growing cherry tomatoes with robots. They have even created a green house for that! There may not be as much robots today, but maybe in the future there will!

After it gathered all the information, it came back to the science lab to be recharged. The day after, the scientist went to the robot where it was supposed to be charging but it wasn't there. The charger was back in its place and the scientist heard something strange, something that sounded like spider legs but louder and heavier. 'Hello,' said the robot. The scientists were shocked that the robot spoke to them.       ' How did the robot talk? We only created this robot to gather information from a volcano!' Exclaimed a scientist.       ' I'm alive, so now my brain knows what humans know. I have emotions too and I don't need to recharge anymore,' the robot told.       Days after, the scientists were having lots of fun with the robot because that now it's smarter with emotions, they don't always have to be alone too. When they need to research a volcano, the robot can talk through a bluetooth that the scientists created for the robot incase it gets lost. Everything became more easier that day when the robot became alive.

It was not an Android as you would imagine, But a small, 2.5 ft tall, 3 ft long robot shaped like a football with legs, the legs being 1.5 ft tall while the football-shaped 'head' itself is only 1 ft tall. The first leg was not like a human leg, but like two shiny metal poles about 1 inch thick attached by a small, steel hinge, and was attached to the head at the end of one pole, and attached to a claw-like foot at the end of the other. The other leg was exactly the same. Inside his head was a mechanical brain made to work like a human brain.          Small AWSM-17x had one big problem -- he never could do anything he wanted to because he had no arms. He couldn't turn pages to read, couldn't write, couldn't use a controler for a video game, or even turn on his shiny steel television that was in his cave-like house.          That wasn't his only problem, however. There was also RBO-13z and BLLY-6u. RBO-13z was a titanium android that looked like a shiny, gold skinned person approxamently 7ft and 3 inches with dirty blonde metal 'hair' and was extremely skinny. BLLY-6u was 5ft 7 inches, had silver, iron 'skin' and dark-brown strands of metal for hair. He was an android, but had four arms and was extremely strong, with metal, interior armor that made him look bulk. Every day RBO-13z and BLLY-6u bullied AWSM-17x.          One day, RBO-13z and BLLY-6u ribbed the metal skin off of AWSM-17x's sides, reveiling two folded in arms that he used to protect him self and was never bullied again.

In hospitals robots go around and give patients their medicine when the doctors call for it. Those robots can operate elevators and can talk.

He starts roming around the hole and then he feels something bumpy.He preses it and a secret door opens.He is scared because he sees two huge red eyes.A giant robot comes out and tels him ''What is your name.''The kid responde.''My name is Sebastion.What is yours?''The kid asked. The robot sid he didnt have one.The kid thought of one.He said ''I will call you Arturo.''The robot liked the name.The kid asked if he knew how to get out of there.The robot said ''Hop on my back.I can take you somewhere cool and excided.'' The kid said ''I need to go to my house they might be looking for me.'' The robot had a sad look on his fase.The kid said. ''We can go, but only for a little wile.'' The kid climed to the robots back and the robot went flying into the air.the robot said ''Hold on tightly.'' The robot wooshed into the air.When he took him home he told them that there was a giant robot out side there house. They didnt belive him.He told the robot he would visit him every day.He did so and then the kid died and the robot felt lonly and pawerd down.

There are many robots and every single one of them has a different and special job. I researched four different robots and all three robots have something in common, they all help the world by adding more things to what we already know about this world.     The first robot I was able to research was Gemini-Scout. This robot helps miners to know when it is safe to go in a cave.If a miner gets lost in a cave, Gemini-Scout has thermal vision which is a sensor that tracks hot things, in this case the miners.     The second robot I researched was Dante 2. This robot can climb the walls of a volcano. It is made to resist hot temperatures so it can go collect information when it is to hot for a scientist is to hot for them to go.      The third and last robot I researched was Mr.Gower. Mr.Gower is a medical robot that helps doctors and nurses with medicine. Mr. Gower can drive around anywhere and can get on the elevator to transport special medicine to a patient.     I hope you all learned a little bit about how robots are helping society and in special jobs like a doctor or a miner.

He helped osama binladen bomb the twin towers. Then he was captured by the u.s. army. he had a vial of acid to brake out of his cuffs with. After that he got away. Then he desided to stop being bad because he wanted to get married. So he did his time and when he got out of prison he met someone got married got a job and had 2 kids.

This is one of the robots it is the Gemini-Scoute it helps miners see if its safe to mine . It also helps the miners that bare traped under ground.This robot is strong smart and helpful in jobs.if u whant to be a miner it is a great idea to bring one of them along they can help u or save you from death.       This robot is called Danet 2 its job is to go in to volcanos and tell them if its going to erupt. It gose in the valcano only if its danger for the scientist to go in and an alize it.It is helpful fo over danger het that can kill you it is made out of meatal thet can handel the heat.If ur willing to be a scientist you are going to be working with one of these guyes and it will help you do your job.       Mr.Gower is one of the most important robots in the world.It saves lives and helps save lives and bring the supplyes .It might have saved one of your familiy members. i like this robot because it saves lives and    i like to se every body safe and sound.If ur trying to be a doctor or a nurse well study heard to get there and u mite see one of Mr.Gower and well you will save lotts of lifes.       Agibots are one of the last robots i read about i think its the lest use and not all farmers use.I think these robots can be useful most of the time but not all the time.I think we can use the to pick our vegtables and these robots pick vegtibals and dont messup.These were all the robots i read about i told u what they do and wich one i liked .I think this was interesting to read about.

Frist of all, their a robot named Gemini- scout, Gemini helps doctors to biring out supplies like food, water and other stuff.Gemini can even drag people when their hurt she can also get info to help people when they are hurt.Gemini can also talk and she also goes up stairs and down and she can be strong too.               Second of all, their a robot named Dante 2 he can get info about volcanoes and even go in one to because when you go in volcanoes it very hot to go in.He have eight legs like a spider Dante 2 looks for vents, holes in the crater.               Third of all, their a robot named Mr.Gower he is so strong he a lift 500 pounds! He helps doctors to he brings medicince to the doctors for the people that are hurt.He can go anywhere in the hospital he can even ride an elevators!Mr.Gower only runs by batteries Mr.Gower talks to also he focus on important tasks.

When we got to my house I unlocked the door and a note fell down. I guess my mom left a note saying she was at work. They said it was okay if we stayed alone. My friends and I all walked in and sat down. I got our materials out and set them on the table. 'This is what we need to build our robot' I say. 'Lets get started' Diane says. Everyone digs in the table and starts getting everything they need.                                'Ill work on the legs' Selah says.                                                         'Ill do the arms' Diane says.    'I will start doing the head' Anthony says.   'Then I guess ill do the stomach' I say.               It took hours but we finally finished our masterpiece. Our amazing robot stood right in front of our eyes. We were so concentrated on building the robot we lost track of time. It was 8:30 and they forgot to call their parents. Diane called and her parents said she can sleepover. Selah and Anthony called and they said the same thing. We were already getting our sleeping bags ready when we forgot to put the robot away. We put the robot in the closet and turned out the lights. 'Goodnight' Anthony says. Everybody repeats the same thing and drifts to sleep. BEEP BEEP I AM A ROBOT. I jump up quickly and wake up everyone. They hear the sound and jumped.   'What is that noise' Selah says.   'I don't know but it was creepy' Diane says.   'We will have to see for ourselves' I say and grab a flashlight.               We crept downstairs slowly and quietly with the light shining in the dark. 'I want my mommabear' Anthony says. 'Stop being such a baby' Selah says. 'Okay were about to find something creepy and you guys think its the perfect time to argue'? Diane says. Selah and Anthony stayed silent until we got to the bottom of the stairs. 'Stop shaking Anthony' I say. 'Well sorry' he says. Selah and Diane let out a giggle. I nuged them in the stomach. 'Look there's a light' I say. They all gasped when they saw it. 'Is that our ROBOT' Anthony yells. 'I think it is' Diane says. I hear clicks. 'What is that sound' I say. Diane and Selah shrug their shoulders. I turn around and see Anthony taking pictures with his iphone. 'Stop it' I tell him. He stops taking pictures. We need to get a closer look.                 I AM A ROBOT. WHAT IS MY NAME. We stare at the robot. We look at the table and theres cups of coffee everywhere, but not in a mug. It looked like it had the logo of starbucks on it. 'Your name is Starbucks' Anthony says. We all nod. I AM STARBUCKS. We laugh wow our robot is alive I thought. 'Guess whos getting an A on our project, WE ARE'! Selah says. ''How about we celabrate with starbucks' Diane says. ''Okay good I love starbucks'' Anthony says. ''WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE'' Starbucks asks Anthony. 'We will all have a Javachip. ''HERE YOU GO HAHA'' Starbucks says. We all drink our starbucks. This was an interesting night.

There are mine carts moving everywhere and there are diamonds in the roof top crashing down onto the Gemini-Scout and the carts. As the Gemini-Scout was just about to rescue the young Girl Scout down in the mines he hears another Girl Scout and another and another. This poor old Gemini-Robot was so sad because he new he did not have a chance to rescue all Girl Scouts. Yet out of his metal tool box from his body come little bay Gemini Scouts. They told the big Gemini Scout that they will will help him rescue the little Girl Scouts. And so they did. Once they pulled all Girl Scouts out of the ground everyone was cheering. When the baby Gemini -Scouts turned around. They noticed that the big age mini -Scout had rusted out. They understood that they could not fix anything. They left them there to rust.       As time went by everyone that had visited the mines and seen the the big Gemini-Scout. Gemini-Scouts had been the newest big thing and the became happily ever after.

But I never got the chance, because I didn't have gas in my car. I finally got gas in my car with help from a friend.           After one more week I went to the store for groceries and a charger . When I got back my house was broken into. I ran to  the basement....... my robot was gone. I ran upstairs to the phone in the kitchen . when I saw my robot he caught the thief and had came to life . It was a miracle. The police showed up 20 min later and took the thief away. 	CD NN PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN NN .

Robots hhelp the world today , they  work in mines  annnd on farms and many other places. They have saved lives, thay  even explore volcanoes for scientist here are some of the robots that work hard  today.       #1 Robot: Gemini-scout is a remote controlled robot that does the search and rescue for the miners under ground. This robot is less than 24 inches and has wheels . It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns left and right , it can even roll  through water. It also bring people that are hurt to saftey.       whenever it goes , Gemini-scout collects information it tests for gases  for the miners and tells them its safe , there is a thermal camera uses heat      sensers to find any living things.       when the robot finds the trapped miners, the miners can use its two way   radio to talk to the rescue team .       This robot was built easy to use it is controlled by a control  just like video games if you ever played a video game you will know .       thank you for reading about a robot that might save your life one day .

I will give you one reason, to hide from a robot caring a disease. Now I  am not talking about the cold, i mean the black plague. Here is what happened.      It started when i finished my disease control robot. Now I was also studying the black plague at the time, so i decided see if my robot could handle it. Before I could get the robot ready it went crazy. The robot ran in to my test jar, and the wall.       After I found out what happen, I locked my lab up and called disease control. And that is why I'm hiding.

Luke's robot had shut down during the night and he could not get it to turn on! Luke was on the verge of tears until he remembered his friend Pat-ko worked at the robot hospital with his robot Mr. Gower. Luke rushed over there as fast as he could but forgot to leave a note on his door so when john got there he was positive something was wrong! Maybe his friend and his robot got kidnapped! john went to the neighbors as fast as he could and asked if they had seen Luke but they said they hadn't seen him sense yesterday. he asked old man Rinkey too he had seen him 20 minute's ago ''where was he going which way did he go'' asked john frantically ''he went towards the hospital with his robot'' ''thank you'' said john and ran towards the robot hospital. Meanwhile Luke was worried sick for his robot. the docter wouldnt tell him anything! Finaly when the docter came out he said that he only needed to be charged overnight. john came in and saw luke and asked if he was okay luke said yes but he couldnt play today.

They had just missed out on going to the park with their friends because their mom wanted them to do their chores.   'I wish we had somebody else to do our chores.' Kelly sighed washing a bowl that looked like it had chili in it.   'Like a robot or something.' Denise agreed.   'Yeah EXACTLY!'   'The robot would clean our room, do all our work, and be our servent.'   'Ooh I think they have those now.' Kelly said.   'Yeah probably for trillions of dollars.' Denise sighed.   'You know who might have trillions of dollars laying around?'   'Who in this world has that kind of money just laying around?' Denise asked.   'Aunt Trudy.'   'Oh yeah!' Denise remembered. 'But she wouldn't just give us a robot that cost that much.'   'My 16th birthday is coming up!' Kelly said with a grin from ear to ear.        After their chores they started sending letters to their Aunt dropping subtle hints about a robot. Like 'I would come visit you auntie but we have so much work!' and 'For my birthday I want a way to do my chores really fast and go visit you!' Eventually Kelly got frustrated when Aunt Trudy wasn't getting it. 'Can I get a robot for my birthday? I hope it's not too much to ask.'       A week later, It was Kelly's birthday. No robot. A week later, No robot. 2 weeks later, No robot.   'I'm starting to think Aunt Trudy just won't get us that robot.' Denise said.   'Yeah but it's okay,' Kelly explained, 'We didn't necessarily need one.'   Right after Kelly said that the doorbell rang. Kelly went to go answer it. It was the delivery guy.   'Sign here for your package.' he sighed dryly.   Kelly signed the paper and he wheeled a crate into their living room.   When he left, the girls started jumping up and down screaming of excitement. Denise went over to the crate and looked at it.   'How do you open it?' She asked.   'With a crow bar dummy.'   'Well do we own any crow bars? Dummy.' Denise shot back.   they both ran around the house turning everything upside down looking for one. Then their mom came home. 'What happened in here!?!' she yelled.   'Oh umm I got a package from aunt trudy and we need a crow bar.' Kelly smiled.   'Why would I have a crow bar in the house?' their mom asked.   Both girls shrugged their shoulders. 'Any person with a brain, Has them in the garage.'   the girls ran down the hall to the garage. 'Clean this mess up when you finish!' their mom yelled down the hall.       When they got to the garage, they looked around. 'What does a crow bar look like?' Denise asked.   'I dunno.'   'wow,' Denise sighed. 'We're looking for something but, we don't know what it looks like.'   'It's over there.' Their mom said from the doorway. Both girls jumped.   'How'd you get over there?' Kelly asked.   'I flew a jet.' She said sarcastically. kelly got the crow bar and ran into the living room. they were in there for 2 hours trying to open the crate.   'I have to do everything?' Their mom asked. She opened the crate with the crow bar and there stood befoe them, A ROBOT!!!   They put in one huge battery , as tall as a toddler that they found in the crate, into the robot. He turned on as Kelly was reading the instructions.   'I think he's  a Gemini Scout,' Kelly said.   'Woah, Kelly look it came with an xbox remote!' Denise exclaimed.   'No that's the remote for the robot.' she said. she moved him around and from then on they had a robot.

A scientist goes up to him and gives him the progress report.            'Everything is fine here sir,'said the scientist.            'Good. As soon as thy are done making them, I would like to test them,'said Oliver.            'Yes sir,'said the scientist.           Finally, the robots were ready. The robots were put in a training session to test their skills when in the army. The presentation was being given to General Ross To see if they were fit and ready for action in the field. Then out of nowhere lightning struck one of the NS-5s and fell to the ground. The robot somehow became alive and started to run away. The robot ran out into the desert far from the base.               'Where am I,'said the robot.              'Who am I,'said the robot.                 'HEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLP!'screamed the robot.               The robot runs through the desert not knowing what to do. Finally, the robot sees a city. The NS-5 sprints to the city. The robot find out that it was the city if Las Vegas. The robot observes the whole city and collects data from what it sees. Then the robot looks around the city and is bewildered by everything he sees.                 'WOW,' the robot said. 'This is amazing. I wonder if I could stay here.'             And the robot did stay there for the rest of his life. The robot named himself Clark Kent and he just learned from what he saw and experienced and just lived there for the rest of his life.

A few days earlier, I wanted to do something because I was bored, so I went to this place called the TOYS R US. I thought it would be a fun place but it was some kids store. Still I went in there and I saw this toy robot for sale. It was as tall as me and called the 'I-BUTLER'. So I got it and brought it home. As soon as that happened, my friend, Jon called me and asked,'Are you free today?'.'Yeah.' I replied. 'REALLY!' he said barging in my door. I did need  some help controlling so I asked him to help me. 'Sure.' he replied. So we started to fix the robot and when it was done. It didn't work. 'What!We did for nothing!'. 'But it was for a bargain!'. I thought we had to wait so we went to get pizza and played in the arcade. 4 hours later, 'It still didn't work!' So we started kicking it. 'I'm going to return this tomorrow.' I said. The day after, I saw a whole through the door. 'JEFF JEFF JEFF JEFF JEFF!' Jon said while running through the door. 'The robot is al...'. 'I know.' I said  'It's alive.' So I dressed up and followed the robot. 'THE ROBOT IS OUT OF CONTROL!!!' Jon said. We saw these laser guns on the ground. 'It's COD all over again.' Jon said. When we got to the robot in the town square. we quickly started to shoot it. 'SHOOT THE KILL SWITCH!' Jon to me. So I started to shoot it and it fell and made a huge hole. 'Finally I could return it.'     	JJ NN NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP . . . '' .

So he went downstairs to Gooby and he was in a different spot than he was when bob left! Bob was weirded out, so he went up to Gooby and said   'Gooby, you moved!'   Gooby's reply was him standing still, so Bob the builder thought that maybe he just got blowed by the wind.   When Bob the builder went to sleep that night he felt really good for some random reason he couldnt think about.                                                                                               'YAHHHHHHHHHHNNN', Bob yawned                                                     Bob walked downstairs from his bedroom to the kitchen.Sniff Sniff Sniff BACON! Bob smelt someone making breakfast, but he was confused because it was just him and Gooby that lived in his house. He turned the corner and saw Gooby standing by the counter weith a piece of raw bacon in his hand.                                                                'How do you cook this?', said Gooby.                                                                                 'Wha Wha What?!,said Bob   'HE'S ALIVE!' screamed Bob.   'How did you come alive Gooby? I thought you didnt work?', said Bob   'I came alive in the night. You were alseep. I went with my instincts and cooked this bacon.',said Gooby   'Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh GOOBY! I am so glad you are alive!', yelled Bob.

They might not always agree with you or other people like we do. What if they mess up it would be on the creators shoulder. WE MAKE MISTAKES!!!!!!!!! Its true and every one does it.          Some people think robots are great and I respect that. They do help a lot. They really do. We never now if they might take over the world, or even be banned no one knows the future.

At first all went well he made a robot that acts like a middle age man. He was able to play sports with him, watch TV with him, and even ride on him as a car with the click of a few buttons. That all changed when one day Danny was driving home from Starbucks and accidentally spilled his coffee on the manual controls causing the robot to go haywire. Then the robot transformed into an eight foot giant with armor and fully equipped weapons.             Danny then fainted and as he woke up he thought to himself  'hmm how much damage can he do in one hour' he sighed 'wait one hour!?!?!' with that he rushed inside to turn on the news. the TV blared to life stood up and ran off along with all of his electrical units including his I phone. All he could see was a part of the news saying 'breaking news an army of electrical units are attacking the state leaving us trapped here on Rhode island. Someone please help us!' as it ran off.             Five minutes later his friends came pounding on the door yelling'please let us in were all gonna die'. 'No where not were going to destroy those machines' Danny said with a bit of doubt while letting them in. How are going to defeat those giant monsters he thought. then he realized something. 'Follow me' he said while leading them to his basement. 'Here you guys are going to need armor and blasters to take these creeps down.             A while later the were fighting the machines taking them down one by one. 'There are too many' Danny yelled over the sound of the blasters. 'Wait a minute the source of the machines is my HRP-4c robot.' he realized ' we have to destroy him so the rest will power down' with that they were off to search for his robot in his backup car. Once they got to it his friends distracted the robot while Danny went to the robot's power panel and dismantled it. The town was saved and all of the machines were gone. So then later the state was rebuilt and back to normal.             With that Danny decided to never make his own machine ever again. With only few people with severe injuries and less than fifty with minor injuries Danny paid up for most of the damage made and went back to living his normal life without any robots in his life and at the age of eighty-one he died a peaceful life.

So i tried that about five times about to give up when i heard hello i turned. I was surprised my first invention that work i called him Timmy and i shouted ITS ALIVE!!! about 2 times he was a strong robot he could lift up a lot of weight about 900 pounds even 1000 pounds when it fully charged. It can do any job it could work at the hospital miners farms police it could do any thing. It could even transform in to any transportation.                     5 moths later, Timmy and i went on a dangerous adventure also he had made new robot friends that i created with a robot wife with robot sons so Timmy wouldn't be alone. he would be happy with his robot family after making his last daughter i decided to be a adventurist with Timmy. we went on a lot of adventure we meet a lot of  other robots.                   Then, came the day they had to be destroyed because they all had virus that turned them evil so i programmed  them and the destroyed them just like the law said i had to to do i will always remember Timmy he was the best robot  and always will be remembered.

You probaly think I'm crazy or it was just a dream, but I'm not kidding. Her name was Rosie. She was my best friend, but something horrible happened. Then, something extraordinary happened a year after. Let me explain how all of this started.            My dad works at a robot factory. At the factory, they make robots for every purpose. I had always wanted one, so on my birthday he got me a robot. I remembered every word he said.            'This is Rosie. She's going to be your new friend.'            I couldn't believe my ears! All these years he had said I was too young to have one and that it would be a big responsiblity to oil it and blah, blah, blah. Now, look at it! I turned on Rosie and smiled at her. ( Yes, I know, she's not a person, but she was like one to me. ) Rosie waved to me. At that moment, I knew we were going to be best friends. I played with her all day.            A year had passed. We had so much fun together! We went to carnivals, Disneyland, and so much more. Rosie was amazing. She helped me with my homework, helped me study for all my tests, praised me about my projects, and comforted me when I was sad or upset. She was worth way more than a million dollars to me.            This is a pretty happy story so far, right? Well, that's going change. One day, Rosie and I were hiking together. The mountain was steep and Rosie helped me up. When we got to the top, there was a beautiful waterfall there. I knew Rosie would short-circuit in the water and I made sure she wasn't too close to it. We spent about two hours up there, enjoying the sunshine and the scenery. I collected shiny pebbles while Rosie took pictures of the birds. It was almost lunchtime, so Rosie and I headed down the mountain. While hiking down, there was a small pile of rocks that we slipped on. Down we fell. SPLASH! We hit the lake at the bottom of the mountain. I had cut myself on some sharp rocks at the bottom. I got out quickly, knowing that the water would get electrified with Rosie being in there. Then, something flashed through my brain. Rosie! I ran toward the water and found a piece of metal glinting in the sun. I called my dad and he came as quickly as possible. ( He dropped us off at the parking lot. ) He helped me move Rosie into the car. A while later told me that Rosie was dead.            'WHAT?!' I cried.               I ran into my room and cried while my parents put Rosie into the shed. Every single night I began to cry myself to sleep. I had wonderful memories of her, but it wasn't enough.            A year passed since the death of Rosie. I decided to visit her. I went to the shed and cleaned her and oiled her. I sighed and said, 'Why Rosie? Why?' I turned around was about to leave when I heard a sound. It had sounded like metal clanking. Then, I heard her voice. My eyes widened when I turned around. She was back! I screamed with happiness and hugged her. Rosie hugged me back.

All was going great. When he tried to turn it on though it didn't work. After ten minutes of trying to turn it on it finally came on. It was all fine at first just a human and a robot talking. Then Dylan Criticize The robot. Most robots do not have feelings but this robot had such a complex wiring system that it got emotionally mad. The robot was very mad in fact that he wanted to take over the human race. So, Dylan did the only thing he could think of he turned of the switch. The robot sat there motionless. Dylan went to bed after that.          Dylan woke up with a bang! He looked at the time, it was 3:30A.M. He went into his living room and saw a huge hole in the wall. He looked outside and saw the robot hands in the air yelling, 'HAHAHA!' It came alive. The robot that I invented came alive! Dylan thought in his head. I will deal with it in the morning. With that he went back to bed.           As Dylan woke up he remembered what the robot did last night. Maybe it was a dream? He thought. He stepped back into his living room and saw the huge gap. So, it was real. He went to grab the controller but found it on the ground crushed into tiny peaces. Oh no, he thought. Then he got into his car and left for the laboratory.          The robot now named, ring leader, started to get other robots to stand up and help him on his path of destruction to get the human race taken over. now all of the robots he tried to get were either with him or destroyed.          As he got to the laboratory he told the other scientist what happened and how he probably got many other robots to join him. After many arguments they figured out that there is going to be a war. But they had a plan they thought that the robots he could get were not going to be water proof. So they got many fire hoses and went off.          Somehow the robots new about this war going on so they were already in a defensive line while the trucks were looking for them. the finally found them and the war began.          Water was spraying out everywhere and the robots had bubbles? The bubbles were useless compared to the water cannons. So they made their way through all of the bubbles from all of the robots. Then they found the captain of the infantry. He was water proof! Then a solider came to the front of the truck and said, ' I thought this was going to happen,' He got out a RPG and shot him into million of tiny peaces. He got back in and they were face to face with the ring leader. Cannons sprayed and RPG shot the ring leader was now into billions and billions of peaces. That is what ended, what is now called The Robot Disaster.

They don't talk, or do real things. But that all changed on one special morning.       I woke up. I look at the clock. It 7:00 a.m. and it's my birthday! I jump out of bed and run downstairs. My mom is making me breakfast of eggs and toast, and my dad is reading the paper. My baby sister is eating her cheerio's. 'Happy Birthday honey!' said mom. 'Happy Birthday squirt.' said dad. And baby Jane tried to muster out a 'Haffy Birfday!' I was so happy!       That day at school everyone wished me happy birthday! I couldn't wait to get home and open my presents! Maybe this year I would get a real robot! When I got home, my told me we had to eat dinner first. So after dad got home we ate. Then she said it was time to open my presents! I got a marble track, some new toy cars, some very needed new socks, and the new model toy robot! I loved it, but I was still a little dissapointed. Then we ate my cake. It had a picture of a robot on it. That made me even more sad, knowing my robot would never be real. But it was my birthday! I had to be happy with the other things I got.And tomorrow all my friends were coming over! So I made a wish and blew out my candles. Then I told my parents I needed a good nights rest and went to bed.       The next morning I felt groggy and tired, even though I had went to bed early. I felt something poking me. It wasn't mom, because I use my alarm clock to wake myself up. And we don't have a pet. I rolled over and to my great surprise there was a robot sitting in the middle of my room drawing with my paper and markers. I said, 'Hello', a little hesitantly. He replied, 'Hello! My name  is Risto-Bot. I'm your new friend!' I was shocked, and didn't know what to say! All I could muster up was, 'Where did you come from?' He said, 'I am your birthday wish come true!' Then I said, 'But we have to hide you from mom and dad!' And just as I said it he was out my door heading for the steps. He was too fast, I couldn't catch him. Mom and dad were as surprised as I was! I told them the whole story. They listened intently, and tried to understand my explanations. And when I was finished, they said I could keep Risto-Bot! 'Yaaaaa!' Shouted Risto-Bot.       At my birthday party, all my friends loved Risto-Bot! We played with him, and he danced and sang, and played party games with us too! Then Henry asked me, 'Where did you get him?'. And I smiled to myself and replied, 'Somewhere very special, Henry. Somewhere very, very special.'

In the story I read I learned about how robots are useful and not just a piece of junk robots are used to help people and all types of different stuff.                Silly-Sally           Silly-Sally is a robot that has a good occupation her occupation is a police officer. Her part of her job is helping find out who commented the crime, issuing out tickets, and arresting people. She is average height and kinda thick. She is a type of robot that talks and she says stuff like'Your under arrest you have the right to remain silent''.              Funny Fred              Funny Fred is a robot that has awsome occupation he is a lawyer. The part of his job that he has to do is go to court with person and help them so they won't go to jail. He can not talk he has to do sign lauge. Its hard for him because sometimes they cant understand what he is trying to do.                Goofy Gal         Goofy Gal is a robot that works on cars and stuff. His part of his job is for him to work on the cars.He can not talk all he do is beep like cartoon robots.People arwe always asking him what did he say he say beeppppppp.   That is what I think of robots now and then.

He had always wanted a pet penguin as a best friend but couldn't get one because they would need a special living condition and need other irregular things like fish everyday. His dad thought about it and decided to make an official robot penguin. The robot he created had rubber for skin, a plastic beak and 150 different voice controls. The best thing was it didn't need to eat and did not worry about the temperature. Jeremy was going to be so proud!                The dad decided to give it to him on his birthday which was two days away. He put a party hat on it, put in a box and wrapped it up. On Jeremy's birthday, he saw the box and wondered what was in it. He then opened it and his jaw fell to the ground. He screamed with joy and ran to the bedroom. The penguin followed him still with the hat on. Then for the next three hours, they sat in his room, figuring out the penguins commands. His favorites were dance and back-flip. Jeremy decided to name the penguin Pip. Pip followed Jeremy everywhere he went. Everybody was jealous and Jeremy had found the best friend he had been looking for.                Eventually, Pip had his own pool and home in the backyard. They played and played and as Jeremy got older and older, he did less stuff with Pip but still cared about him. Then when Jeremy got married, Pip was the best penguin to his wedding. But, when Jeremy had children, he gave Pip to them to play with even though Pip was still loyal to Jeremy. Jeremy eventually got so old that when he died, Pip almost exploded from the sadness. He then made a huge decision. Pip decided to make Jeremy's children just as happy as he had made Jeremy.

For example Mr.Gower .  This robot saved hundreds lives .  It works in the hospital .  It carries medicine to doctors.   Another robot is the Gemini-scout .  It works in mines .  It tells if the mine is okay to enter by checking the gases.  It has a thremal camera to see if anyone is trapped in the mine.  So robots are more than toys there life savers.

My friends and I went to see what was going on. When we arived saw a large robot emerge from a crater in the ground. its eyes glew in ar dark blue and its body shone in a bright red that blinded us. A thick billow of smoke steamed of its metalic covering... We all ran in terror.       As we ran throgh the streets of l.a. the monster robot chased us. After a while of running and ducking we ran into an abandoned factory. As we entered the factory we turned on flash lights that we had stashed in our pockets. I heard gun fire and a scream from my left. we turned off our flash lights and said 'Whoever you are please don't hurt us we're scared and have no where to go'. Then a light turned on and we saw our foes were not foes, but allies.       We told the men about the giant red machine that had six legs and climbed over buildings crushing people all the while. The men then slowl;y opened the door to take a look at what we described. they had a look of horror on their faces and when we asked why they said they finaly caught up. We then asked them what in the world were they talking about. They replied telling us that they were a form of spys. 'when we were in work we foun an island that we have never seen before' the first man said. 'Then we saw it nothing we had could penatrate it so we went home' said the second man.       They then told us they developed a wepon that should work but they needed help. We offered our assistance and they told us what to do. when we went outside the robot saw us and caught on. There was a flash of blinding light and a thud that shook us up. We got the materials we needed after getting up and ran towards it. We threw the magnetic device we were given and it started making a noise, we then realized it was a bomb. When it detonated it blew a hole in  the robot and we saw inside. The me we met told us to get inside og it and we did as told.       when we got inside we saw that it could be controlled and there was a button. From there it got a little bumpy. We hit the button and it started a count down so we jumped out but a little late. It exploded as soon as we got out and we flung from the robot barely alive, but we did it we saved whatever it was after.       But then i woke up and realized it was all a dream and i was safe all along. I then told my gardian about this dream. I explained every detail and they said it was normal and for a second i thought her eyes flashed blue like the robots...

The scientists took it to their lab and ran tests and things on it. after a while the scientist got really tired of trying. the only information that was found was that it was sent down to earth to destroy the earth. when the scientists went home they left the Well Being at the lab. They thought it was OK, but it wasn't!!       When they returned the Well being was gone. they were panicking trying to figure out where just where it went. after a while Dr.Wilson found out it only needed to be charged for the planning of destruction. he told Dr. drew that the Well Being was alive the whole time but he just needed to be charged.       after a while the news came on and half of the world was destroyed. the scientists said that they needed to make a plan for them to kill the Well Being before they got to their state. the scientists were tired of making plans finally the last plan  they mayor was irresistible. there was no way the Well Being was going to live ever again.           finally the big day came when the Well Being came that was it. The scientists fired up there plan and the Well Being died. everybody was so happy the mayor congratulated the scientists and there was no more WELL BEING ever again.

Fr an example, your computer is acting up with a virus, Fix-it is the robot to call. He is good with computers and technology problems.          Many call for this certain robot for his help, only computers, lap tops, I pods, or any devise that seems to be not working are the only things this robot can fix.          He comes in handy for those things particular problems for technical difficulties. Other things like, broken stuff and things that don't have to do with technology or Internet he can't fix, as I said before, he can only fix things between technical groups.

I can remember the warm, salty breeze sweeping over me. I could also remember the ocean waving in the distance, calling my name, beckoning me to jump into the watery depths of the unforgiving sea. But I waited, and I resisted the urge to do so. When I left the beach, I remember how relieved I was to be able to get out of the heat. And of course, I was also sad that I had left the ocean.       'Brooke, it's time for school!' I woke up from my slumber with a shake. I couldn't believe that I had another dream about the ocean. I thought that I would never have another dream about the sea, but I guess I was wrong. I  got out of my bed, and my feet softly hit the floor. I forced myself to move myself over to my dresser, which was located by my door. I threw on some clothes, eat break feast, and then I ran off to the bus stop.       When I arrived at school, I walked to my homeroom class, which belongs to Mrs. Hartman. My teacher is very nice, but she always seems to give me and my class a lot of homework every night. I then sat at my desk, and I straightened my books up, only so they would look good on my desk. I was the only person in the classroom for ten minutes, but then later on more and more of my classmates started to fill the classroom. When the class was settled, Mrs.Hartman entered the room, and she looked even more classier than before. 'Class,' She spoke with a loud, booming voice, 'We are going to do a class project. You all must take part in it, and there will be no exceptions for late work!' Then, after Mrs.Hartman had finished her first sentence, someone sneezed. Everyone in the classroom started to laugh, and Mrs.Hartman started to turn a dark shade of red. Oh no, this isn't good! Every time the teacher turned red in any of my classes, that meant that they were really mad. But I could tell that Mrs. Hartman was very mad, because I could see the red veins popping out of her neck.        After Mrs. Hartman had given the class a huge speech about how bad we were being, she finished the rest of her sentence that she had been saying. She had told us that we had to make a robot, and it had to work. My first thoughts on the project were terrible, because I had never been good at making gadgets. But then I thought positive things, because I knew that it was going to be fun for me to do, and I would learn new things.       That night, I rode the bus home. When I first stepped into my house, I ran into my room and started to make my robot. I just wanted to get the assignment done with, only because I wanted some free time for myself. A good nap is just what I needed, so I figured that when I was done making my robot, I would take a nice nap.       It took me five hours, but I finally completed the task of making a working robot. The robot I had made was small, and it was small enough to fit into my locker. It's purpose was to give you a massage that would knock your socks off, and it seemed to work perfectly fine. I decided to name it Paul, because that was one of my friend's names. My old friend used to come over to my house about every day, but then he moved to a different state. I placed Paul next to me, and I started to rub the mechanical hands that I had placed on him so he could give a massage. Then, I started to drink some soda. It was a bad idea, because one moment later, I had spit the soda all over Paul! The creepy thing was, Paul started to shake wildly, and then I heard a voice. The robot was speaking!       I started to panic, because I had never heard a robot speak to me before. But then I realized that the robot was friendly, so I sat next to Paul again. 'Do you think I am a good robot' Paul asked carefully. I replied with a yes, and then I took my nap. Me and Paul have the best of friends ever since.

Yeah you write a story about a robot coming to life. Really? Can you read it to me? Sure! Once upon a time there was a young kid named Eddy Robertson. Well Eddy was a intelligent young man that had a dream to one day to construct and have its own personal robot. Well one day Eddie got his 9th grade exam about robots this was very important to him.Eddy tried his hardest then Boom! The teacher slamed the paper harder then lighting strikes the ground. I got a F!! Oh my goodness. I curse this day and this world forever! Eddy skipped school since then and stayed home working on a recent project. He was making a 9 foot human like robot that could destroy. Well two years later Eddy was ready to start the robot he laughed and said haha with a evil crow less then a minute history will be made! 3-2-1 Start! What happen? Come on you dag on thing! Kick! Kick! Kick! Boom! That robot knock him in the air faster then a torpedo! Master are you okay said the robot? I did it I did it! I am the smartest scientist in the world. Robot im going to call you Dingle Head. Haha Dingle Head! Master what do u want me to provide for you said the robot? I want you to destroy St. Moutain High School! Okay with a deep voice from the robot. 5 min later the whole school is running in fear help! Then all of a sudden. Dingle Head stopped terrorizing the school. He stared acrost the road and seemed to be staring at a dumpster. That robot ran so fast it looked faster then road runner! It went over there and hugged that dumpster so tight! Then Eddy got so upset it threw a tantrum! Then that robot kicked Eddy all the way to China. Eventually Dingle Head married the trash can. Then lived Happily Ever After. The End!     Thats a great story honey said mom. Yeah two bad it cant happen in real life. Wait whats that noise outside Boom! Boom! Boom! A 9 foot ticked off robot is outside. Oh Lord!                               The End 	NN PRP VBD DT JJ IN PRP$ NN NN NN . '' NNS JJ NN WP VBD DT NN IN . NNS CC JJR NNP POS NNP . '' NNP PRP VBP DT NN IN DT NN VBG TO NNP NNP .

For instence he can play football or videogames and he can even make food for you. This robot was created by a scientest that was mad.           DV-456 is for a family that has two parents that are always working. This robot is like another member of the family and we will be realesing it in 2099 and the price will be at $20.000 so it can be affordable. DV-456 will also clean your house for you so that when your children make a mess you wont have to clean it up. This is the greatest robot that ever lived.

But before he could test it out he was executed by his village since everyone thought he was an alien. The robot was put into hypersleep until 2025 when there was a violent thunder storm. It slowy climbed out of the pit he was put in and looked around. Before he was put to sleep he was ordered to cause mass choas and he planned to do just that. he went from house to house breaking windows and picking up trees and hitting the ground of people's backyards to wake them up. The people soon got sick of it and called the government to end this. The government tried and tried but everytime they failed the robot destroyed them. When the government gave up, the robot shut itself down. He had decided that he caused enough chaos. In conclusion, robots do what they are made for, even if it takes millions of years.

Mike created small wheels with a remote control for his robot and gave his robot a mouth so it could talk.Then he made it's fuel out of mountain dew.

While he was sleeping the robot left the house and went to howling beach.The robot shutted down at the beach.When mike woke up the next morning he didn't no where his robot was.He asked his dad and he didn't know.So when he got to school he asked his friend sam and sam said I do.Mike asked where? Sam said 'I tracked him down to howling beach.'  When they got their mike's robot was there and mike said thank you sam and sam said you're welcome mike.'

He took the remains of the robot to the recycling plant and he left .A few years later he saw an ad in the paper for a robot and he ordered it and when he got sold it to his 5 year old son .But mike threw it away.

Tom was a ten year old boy who had noticed an old broken down robot in a small scrap pile near his house. He quickly picked the robot up and ran to show his friends. 'Look at this robot I found!' he exclaimed as he approached his friends. One of his friends looked at the the robot and said, 'It doesn't even work.' Tom quickly turned back to his house and walked away. 'You're just jealous.' he said. On arrival to his house he set the robot down. 'I'm sure I could fix you.' he said. Then, the robot's eyes began to glow.              'I'm alive!' the robot shrieked. Tom fell back surprised. 'Cool now I have a robot to go on adventures with, hooray!' Tom shouted joyfully. 'Hooray!' the robot replied. Tom quickly ran out side to tell his friends. When he came back the robot was making bacon. 'I'm Bacon-bot!' the robot said. 'Cool he makes bacon!' Tom exclaimed. Tom quickly sat down to eat.              'That is the best bacon I've ever had!' Tom said happily. 'Bacon is good!' the Bacon-bot said. Tom loved his new bacon making robot so much that when he was older he made a whole type of food making robots. Now there is is no more hunger thanks to food-bots. 'The end.' Tom said after finishing his story. 'That is a great story.' his teacher said. 'Who knows maybe I'll create the first food-bot!' Tom said. 'Maybe someday.' 	JJ VBZ DT NN VBG NN .

Nate woke up to the sounds of his dads feet on the stairs, 'ugh! my alarm didn't  go off again!', nate complained. he quickly got dressed, rushed down stairs gabbed some cereal, put it in a bag, and ran out the door. he already missed the bus, his mom was at work, and his dad was working on his 'special prodgect' , so nate had to run to school. he missed math and reading, but he didnt really care, he was the smartest math kid and Reading wasnt really his favorite.       he ran into the classroom, unpacked his things, and was just in time for second recess. 'where have you been?!', asked his friend Danny.       'my alarm didn't go off', nate answer grumpily.       'right, because it wasn't you sleeping through it or anything...', Danny said sarcastically.       Nate rolled his eyes at that comment.       'happy birthday by the way.' danny said, and went onto the field to play soccer with everybody else.       when Nate got home that afternoon his dad was waiting for him on the couch.'why so surprised?' his dad asked. 'am i not allowed to sit on the couch or something?'       'well, normally your in your lab working.'       'that's what i wanted to talk with you about.'       'great'nate thought, 'were gonna move again' nate said out loud,'aren't we?'.       'good heavens no!not again!' his dad exclaimed.'since today's your birthday im going to give you your present', he pulled out a large cart with a figure on it.       'you got me a statue?' nate said.       'no, its a robot'       'cool!'nate said excitedly.'does it work?'       'it plays music, if that's what you mean.'       it was time for nate to go to bed so his dad helped him bring it to his room.   nate woke up in the middle of the night and went downstairs to get a glass of milk. he walked downstairs and did a double take when he saw the robot sitting on the couch. he was even more surprised when the rv was on. his robot was alive. 'hey...robot..guy.' nate said awkwardly.'watcha doin?'the robot turned to nate and took his hand. he walked him out the door, and flew away. just took him and flew. nate was wierded out, after all this was kinda sudden. nate could tell this was going to be a long night.

I went to the shed to go and try to finish up my robot. When I was finished I tried to turn my robot, Aero 101 on but it shut down. So I went to my room and played  video games with my friend Joey. Then we heard, ' Clang Clang Clang!' Coming out from my shed. My friend Joey said, 'What is that sound Erick?' I said, ' I don't know.' So we both went to go check it out. When we were there we heard another noise but louder. ' BOOM CLANG BOOM CLANG!' When I opened the door there was the robot I created, Aero 101.      I said, 'It actually works, my creation works!' When I told Joey that I  had created a robot. He siad that it was extremely cool. So the rest of the evening we played with Aero 101. On Monday morning I went to the shed to check if Aero 101 was there, but he wasn't so I called Joey and asked if he had him but he said no.

My brother let me play it because he's older than me and it was call ' Make The Hoop' it was sort of a basketball game you get 5 turn's too make 3 shot's. I got three in a roll and there was a robot I wanted it was blue with green eyes. It was aslo a stuffed robot so I choiced that one. It was like it was on the spotlight it was like magic. There was something about but I loved that toy so we took it home.            We got home aroung 8:30 pm it was getting late so I took my robot too my room and tuck it in too bed with me I couldn't go too sleep for some reason I looked at the time it was 11:59 almost 12:00 then the time was ticking I had a feeling something was going too happen the out of nowhere glitter was raining from the ceiling the glitter was gold and sparkly. I didn't no what was happening intill all of the sudden my robot came too life.            I was freaking out so I hide under my blankets all of the sudden I little glare of white little pop from out of my blankets. It was the robot I screamed then he said 'Are you okay' I said yeah but what happened too you he said ever night at 12:00am he comes too life but at 12:00 pm he turns back too stuffed robot. So I said 'This Is So Cool' he said want to play something I said sure what do you like too play he BasketBall. I said okay and seek him out of my window.            He got the ball for me it was cool because he could just reach for the ball without moving , and now I realized he could talk too. Now I'm so glad that I got a toy robot too play with. So we'd played basketball for about 30 minutes then we went back inside through my window and we got something too drink I got us some gatorade I didn't know he could drink I thought he would be in shock or something. But then after we got a drink I said what do you want too play he said basketball but I said we already played basketball he said I want to play 'BASKETBALL' so I screamed and ran too my room he kept saying BASKETBALL , BASKETBALL , BASKETBALL so I knew what I had too do.            I took my gatorade because I brung it into my room with me and poured it on him I was sad but I had too do what was right. He starting shaking and little yellow and white sparks was shooting out of him. Then all the sudden he shut down and turned back into a stuffed robot I liked him the way he was and kept him that way but then I gave him too a yard sale so people would half too dealwhat I went through. So that night I went too bed it was calm and quiet like it should be. So that's me story and I hope you enjoy it.

She is a HRP-4c. She can dance and sing so I call her Harper.        Harper has been my friend for a long time she always listens to me and she knows how to make me smile. She and I love to dance together and party. She sometimes comes to school  with me, but the teachers don't like her as much as my classmates and I do. The only reason they don't like her is becuase she always starts to dance and play a really catchy song so we can't help but to dance. I think my classmates enjoy her a lot, but probably not as much as me.       Harper and I like to go to school together and do fun things, but we also like to relax and have some down time. What we usually do is watch a robot movie (which Harper loves) or we just read a book with eachother. One of Harper's favorite movies is Walle. It's about two robots named Walle and Eva and Harper could watch that al day if she had all that time. We don't hang out for long becuase we have other fun things to do with my other friends. We usually like to go to the beach and swim in the water (which I hate because Harper can't get wet or she will shut down) or build sand castles.      Wether it's hanging out or going to school Herper and I are the best of friends. We are always there for eachother and always will be. No matter where we are the other follows. I love Harper like a sister and I hope you do too. 	EX VBP JJ JJ NNS IN NNS WDT VBP JJ JJ NNS , CC PRP$ JJS NN VBZ DT NN CC PRP VBZ DT JJS .

'What have you done,' shouted Justin's father.Later that evening the both of them felt frustrated, yet cheerful too.                  That was a month ago when everything turned into a disaster, but before that, everything was peaceful until one day when Justin came home from school amd  his Dad came home with a box that said 'Robot' on it.Justin was so amazed, he thought it would be fun having a robot to take care of,so everyday from that time on Justin would feed it,play with it, and talk to it.The robot was later named 'CT' being an acronym for the word caretaker, but they just made it seem like it was two words.                   A few days later,the moment when Justin was playing with 'CT',at the time when his Dad was at work, it  through something at him and it wasn't just something harmless, it was scissors.Luckily 'CT' had missed but what he had done wasn't necessary.Something had to have been going wrong with it,but what could it be?Well, when Justin's Dad came home from work, he saw that the door to the house was open,he entered the house and then Justin just came running out the door crying,'Don't let him get away'! His father looked at him with astonishment and noticed that 'CT' was on the porch pacing.His Dad shouted,'What have you done '? Justin told him that 'CT' had thrown scissors at him. He also answered that he had been the one who was getting him angry by abusing him.                                  That day had been tragic, but Justin's Dad had taken 'CT' back to the company he had came from.Days past and they just went on with their normal lives, up until they both received a letter in the mail, it had been from nobody that they know or that's what they thought.But it was really a letter asking that a dangerous robot has been held in a company. Justin and his Dad panicked.

The night he finished he left his robot in his lab but the robot all of a sudden came alive. It broke the doors and is terminating the city. Cops are trying to shoot him down but its no hope Khalid made him with a bulletproof body.   When Khalid got the call he imedietly rushed to his robot. It took him forever to find him until he saw fire. He knew he had to do something so he tried everything. Right away Khalid remembered that he installed a large battery that powers him. Khalid saw his robot turned around so he rushed to him and took out the battery. Khalid was named a hero after he destroyed his robot. After that he vowed never to build a robot again.

It's name will be 'When your feeling lazy!'       This robot is very handy when you dont feel like doing anything. Such as your homework and chores. All you have to do is tell it to do something then it does it.                                                                 It has a special ability to do anything you hand to it. It sesnses when you are coming to it, so it knows you are about to tell it something.       Its shape is similar to a humans. It can see and talk. It also has hands and feet just like ours, so it can walk and write just like us.      You can adjust its handwriting so it looks like yours. You can also change the way the print is. Such as from print to cursive writing.      It only costs $200 and dosnt get in your way. Unless you have a really small house!!

That's right, people like us lived there. There were alot of robots. Alot of them forgotten. One day a man named Micah who still lived in Tatooine Loved exploring things and finding robots that have been forgotten. One day Micah found a robot way deep into the ground from the great sandstorm many years ago. He was in shock what robot he found. THe rarest robot ever made in Tatooine. It has been extinct for 50 to 70 years. It was called G5-4BA. It is kind of like C-3PO from star wars but a little different. He was about 5'10 feet tall, blue, has legs and arms. Also from what he read they said the robot can talk. He picked it up and walked away.                                                             Moments Later.....       He got and and he fixed up the robot. It was not easy. He worked for about three days for it to be finished. Then it was done. He flipped the switch to turn it on then all of a sudden the robot moved. Micah was happy. he screamed 'It's alive It's alive.' G5-4BA was helping him find more robots and helped him around the house. But one day something changed. G5-4BA was different. He wasn't helping or anything. most likely he was making it worse for Micah. Then at the end of the day he went rogue. Micah ran away and he read a manual about that kind of robot. It said on page 6 'Beware sometimes the robot might go rogue. It was programed to kill the ones who were hurting the people and who were stealing money from people.' Micah quickley looked up and there was G5-4BA standing right in front of him. He had red eyes and he was ready for strike. Then Micah asked 'why do you want to kill me i did nothing wrong.' Then G5-4BA said 'I've been working so long for wou and when i looked up my history you originally got rid of my species. I heard you talking in your room planing to get rid of me to. So now i'm gonna show you how it feels like to be stuck in a sand pit for about 70 years!' Then he grabbed Micah and he stuck him into the hard sand about 12 feet into the ground and he couldn't get out. Years later G5-4BA rebuilt Tatooine and it was a robot planet. They lived happy for thier rest of their lives.

Robots Narrative Performance Task                The story is about how robots help people with their lives. They help by getting information about Canyons and other big things. They also talk to people about what their doing or how their doing. They also work in hospital and carry stuff for the nurses and they can carry about 500 pounds. Most of them can talk to people so that helps out a lot. Some robot help farmers pick fruits like berries, oranges,strawberries,grapes,or apples. They can harvest crops for the farmer. The robot also knows when the berry is ripe so then they can pick it in times for food or cash. The robots can play with dogs or cats. Robots can also help with driving so that people don't get hurt or get in a really bad crash. They have robot cars that drive by theirself and that they can talk to you and you can tell them where to go. You could let the robot do all of the driving for you but you might want to still keep your eyes on the road just in case the robot messes up. That is what robot are good for but I bet there is a lot more things that a robot could do that would help me or you. 	. . .

He walks in and \dad just made a life-size bull that acts like a bull to be used at a rodeo instead of using real bulls.   3. The bull attacks Timmy with such rage at his red shirt.   4. Timmy takes down the bull and finds a new skill in bull handler.   First draft:   One day, just like any other day, Timmy was walking home from school and his mind was running again.  He was scrawny and short, but loved sports of any kind.  The problem was Timmy wasn't good at any.  Not even racing little tiny race cars.  Timmy wished that his dad, who seemed to be a insane scientist, would create an invention that would make him good at sports.  Any sport.   As Timmy walked up his driveway, the garage door opened and Timmy's dad rolled out on his back.  He was in his work clothes, which was a white jacket, big safety glasses, and torn old loafers.  His face was estatic with excitement as he rose to meet Timmy.   'Hey Little Tim Tim!' he said as he picked up his 9 year old son and held him up in the air.  'I just finished a masterpiece invention!'  He set little Timmy down and led him to a large mass covered by a white sheet.  'One, two, three!'  The sheet shot off of the massive object as Timmy stared at it.   It was a bull, a robotic bull.  It had regular bull legs and face, but was made of metal.  Timmy's dad flipped a switch and it roared to life.  It looked straight at Timmy.   'RUN TIMMY!  YOU HAVE A RED SHIRT!' Timmy's dad yelled, but Timmy didn't run.  He was determined to find the one sport he was good at, even if it wasn't really a sport.  He danced right to left with the bull, who's eyes lit up red.  He eventually raced to the wall of the garage and stopped.  The bull turned on it's shoulder and charged!  Timmy lept away at the last second as the bull crashed into the wall and shattered to pieces.  Timmy was an excellent bull handler.   Revised version:   It was like any other regular day for Timmy.  Walking home after school with his head down and mind running like a marathon.  Timmy was a scrawny and short little kid, but he still loved any sport he laid eyes on.  There was only one problem with this, Timmy was good at none.  From being quarterback in football or even racing miniature Hot Wheels as if they were racing cars, Timmy was hopeless.  He dreamed that one day, his father would find an invention that would make Timmy good at one single sport.   Timmy walked up his driveway and opened his garage door to see his dad sitting on the ground like a small child waiting for him.  'Hey Tim!' he said.  'Not gonna waste a second here showing you this new machine!'  He didn't give Timmy he usual after school hug, but stood up and jogged over to a massive object covered by a white sheet.  He whipped the sheet off of the object and a dark brown animal stood there.   It was a bull robot designed for rodeos, so that real bulls weren't ever hurt.  Timmy's dad flipped a switch in it's behind and it's eyes lit up red and glared straight at Timmy.  The looks were deadly.  Timmy looked down at his red shirt and realized he was in deep trouble.   'RUN TIMMY!  NOW!' his dad screamed sprinting as fast as possible out of the garage.  That was one thing that Timmy was bad at, running.  Timmy stood his ground as the bull sprinted at him.  He lept to the side leaving the bull to run into the garage wall at full speed.  It hit the wall with a large bang and fell apart.  Timmy had one strength for sure now, handling bulls.

I was to scared to touch it or get to close to it . After a few minutes , I got the courage to pick it up and examine it . I kept turning it and turning it to see if it was safe enough to take it home . Then , I saw red button on its back . I pressed it and the robot fell out of my hands .              Even though it wasn't safe to take it home , I just took it . I sat it down on my desk and waited for a long time to see if it would do anything . I waited so long that I fell asleep . While i was waking up , I saw a figure that looked like something standing up . I opened my eyes wide and saw the robot just standing on my desk observing my room . I got up from my bed and walked over to it . 'Hi,' I said . 'Hello,' said the robot . I was in shock and passed out .               I woke up the next morning not knowing what happened . Then I looked to my left and saw the robot playing catch by himself with one of my rubber balls . I really didn't know what to do but stare at the robot . I was amazed and shocked . Finally , I got the guts to walk up to him and play with him . After minutes or so , he didn't want to play anymore and frowned . ' Whats the matter,' I said . ' I'm lost and I miss my parents,'the robot said . 'Don't worry , we will go look for them tomorrow, I promise,'I said .                   Then , my mom barged into my room and asked 'Who are you talking to?' ' No one,' I said . 'Oh okay,' she said. She gave me the evil eye like if she I was hiding something from her .' We need to find you a special place for you to hide so no one will know you are here with me because if someone knew , they would freak out, ' I said. 'Sounds good to me,' the robot said .               The next morning I got dressed and left the house with the robot in my hand . I was on a mission to find a robot's parents . We, the robot and I, we walking down the street when all of a sudden , two other robots came out of a corner yelling ' James , where are you!' No one seemed to notice the two robots walking down the street .'Are those your parents?' I asked James . 'Yes!' he yelled out . James crawled out of my hands and ran to his parents . He turned back and said, ' Thanks for everything. ' 'No problem,' I said . I will never forget the day I met James . 	CD NN , PRP VBD VBG IN DT NN CC PRP VBD NN IN JJ IN DT NN .

So i tried to get him in my house but then it ran into the back yard so I followed it.When i found it was saying introder alert so I look inside and saw a man in a black mask.I screamed that was my first mistake second was triping on the robot. the cops came an hour later and caught the robber the robot called the police!Then the robot fell and said your welcome. I said what? Your welcome it repeted. Then it was legally mine after the situation.This was the story of the robot that turned on.

But whatever he did seemed like a failure. He was trying to make the ER99, one of his robots to come alive and work as if he were a human. He tried everything in the book, but nothing seemed to work.         One Sunday morning the paper boy dropped the news paper off in the driveway. Max walked out in his pj's to fetch the morning paper.He was reading the front article. It said 'Science Fair Friday, June 9'. Max knew this was his time for him to shine. So he started thinking of ways he could make the ER99 alive. Again, he tried everything he could possibly do.He worked day and night.        Finally, he got mad at his failure. So mad that he punched the robot in the heart. but after he felt very shamed of himself. He turned and looked at the robot, he seen something was glowing in his eyes like a light kinda. the eyes started blinking! Max ran over there and looked at it. The robot began to speak. 'Hello human', RE99 had said.   Max stared at him in disbeliefe. Sudddenly a huge smile on his face came. RE99 Also smiled.       Max talked to the robot and learned it could do so much more than he wished for. It was like a human. Max knew him and his robot could win thee science fair this Friday.

When the scientists put the last part in the robot it was ready to work.                       The robot was sent to Hawaii to get samples from an active Valcono. It had to climb up the tall valcano and into it to start collecting samples. It collected alot of information in it to give back to the scientists.                Now the robot is collecting information about the gases. It was sending the information back to the lab so it can be studied.                The robot was now back in the lab after searching the valcano. It was another work day for the robot after giving the information back. The robot now had been to volcanos all over the earth. It was being shipped all over the place.                It was now at the tallest valcano it had ever seen. It wasn't sure how it was going to climb all the way up. It knew that it had to go into the volcano though so it started climbing. When it reached the top he started slowly going in to collect the samples.                The robot had been shipped back to the lab where he was created by a scientist and gave back the informaton that it had been sent out to collect.                      While climbing the volcano he wondered why he had eight legs like a spider instead of two like a human. He guessed that it was just so he could climb better and faster to get the information.               He had seen other robots at the same lab and wondered why they looked different than him. He heard the scientist talk about how they all have different jobs that they do for the scientists. He still thought his job was the coolest.

It had a funny looking robot! He takes it to his room. He notices it has many wierd writings on it and one night he woke up and examined it again. He sees a button on the back and he presses it all of the sudden his robot goes bazerk! He calms it down and talks to him , it turns out the robots from another planet and one day he crash landed in a back yard and someone put him in that box.             The next day him and the robot do something thje robot grabs the telescope and grabs one of alberts flares the robot said ,'i'll send a message' . He grabs the flares that were Albert's dads and that night they set them off in a pattern .Not much later a ship comes to his backyard and take the robot back to his planet.               Albert goes back to his house and relaxes the rest of the day with that wierd thought... theres life on other planets.

The sounds of traffic boomed through the night and the air was surrounded by smoke and gas. A dump located at the end of town was filled with disgusting smells and the sound of rats. Along with it was an abandoned, unpowered, robot. It was supposed to be the 'greatest machine in existence' but the scientists had no luck, so they just threw it away.What they didn't know was that they just threw away the best invention that could set foot on Earth.             The storm was getting worst as thunder started, and suddenly, a lighting bolt struck the broken robot's body. The robot was starting up after the lighting bolt struck. It was a miracle! The robot was awake! As the robot stood up he didn't know where or who he was. He was a bright red robot with wheels as legs and his arms were long and skinny. After he was trying to understand what happened, he walked out of the dump and started heading towards the city.             As he was walking a little poor kid was walking near the street and saw him. The robot wasn't alarmed because he knew the kid wouldn't hurt him. The kid was however alarmed at the robot. But the robot said, 'I come in peace!' The kid glared at him and said, 'Who even says that. Anyways what is your name machine?' The robot did not reply because he didn't know if he had a name. But as he was thinking he saw a billboard nearby. 'K-Martin, yes, K-Martin is my name.' He said. 'What is yours child?' 'Julio' he replied, 'Julio is my name.'            After that the robot vanished. 'What!' cried Julio, 'Where are you!' But K-Martin was nowhere to be found. 'Geez, I must be going crazy.' Julio said. Then he went home.   Next morning, Julio went outside to get the newspaper. Then suddenly, as he looked at the front cover, it said, 'Living robot found.The next world sensation is here!' As Julio stares at the newspaper in amazement, he looks down in the reading and one word sends a smile to his face: K-Martin.

Later on that evening while Mark was inspecting Toby all of a sudden a screechy voice alerked.'Hello'.....Marks eyes widened with fear but with amazed at the same time.Mark decided to tell his parents what he had witnessed Marks mother was worried something was wrong with mark but when she too and her husband heard   for them self they too were amazed.The next day they he showed his science club and they were amazed.

Tony Jack was in his lab working on a special project.  'What is it your making Bruce?' said Dr. Rick Stolinger.        'I am making the perfect compainion for anyones desires.' Tony replied.   'What it is ment to do?' asked Dr. Stolinger.   'It is ment to keep company for any one who needs it. It will be able to talk in many different accents to make it more comfortable around the owner. It also will be able to do simple chores like wash dishes, work in the garden or bring you a snack or drink.'   'Wouldn't that make it a servant?'   'Not quite because it will be limited to the amount of service it can do.'   'That is very smart, do you mind if I join and help creat this masterpice.'   'That would be great.'       As the day went on the two men collected parts and technology for their robot. The robot was about five and a half feet tall so that it dosn't overwelm the owner with its hight. The robot also has extendable arms to grab objects that would typiclly be out of reach.In addition it a large storage capacity to remember events that happened or had to be done. But there was one problem, the robot wouldn't start.       Tony and Rick were up all morning trying to figure out how turn on the power. The stayed up wondering why the robot wouldn't work. The two men decided to take a lunch break in the cafeteria where they discussed what to call the robot. They soon came up with the name Richtophen. As they said the name they started to hear metal clanking.       Then right before there eyes Richtophen was standing right in the door way. 'Hello sirs.' said the robot in an Austrain accent. The two men starded to laugh and hug each other in the amazment that they had just biult what they were looking for.       Exept when Richtophen walked through the door the power went out. The men were frightened by this event. As that happend a demon like laugh came out of nowhere and the lights went back on. Richtophen was gone. They went to check outside and say that he had grew and was terrorizing the town. Luckly Dr. Rick had a instument that emeted waves that shut down the robot and the down was saved.

The Huckleberry Family is a special family, because they have a robot that can speak, talk, walk, and do actions. Joe Huckleberry, the dad of 1 child, he is a scientist, he likes to do wacky inventions and likes to watch the show, Berrybusters. Freda Huckleberry, the wife of Joe, and the mother of Billy, she is the freak of the family, and does not like germs in the house. And the last of the Huckleberrys', Billy. Billy loves to have fun and likes to get in trouble with his neighborhood friends. They live in a small town in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Huckletown.       One sunny, shiny day to come outside, Joe is in his basement, again. Billy is playing outside and ding-dong ditching their neighbors. He always has lots of fun. This time, Billy always visits dad in the basement. Billy discovers that his dad is making a robot. Billy watches and asks questions to dad all day long. not long before Billy's bedtime, dad finishes up his workshop. He closes the door to the basement and starts watching the TV show, 'Berrybusters'. Billy goes up stairs, brushes his teeth, and heads up into his room. He says goodnight to his mom and dad as they come upstairs. As they start to get distracted, Billy starts heading down the flights of stairs to the Basement, luckily, he knows the combination to go downstairs, as he opens the door to the basement.       Billy closes the door very silently, and turns on the light. He found vast assortions of machines, to Ray-Guns, to even the rare Automatic-Snowmaker-9000. As he looks around, he found the robot he saw eariler that day, he takes a look at it, observing each piece, without making a sound. He saw that the arm was disessembled, so he found a small hammer and started pounding a nail and the two machinery in together. He saw a light gleam in the center of his one eye, and the sound from the robot started running. Billy could hear a 'What was that?' from upstairs and heard walking around. Billy hid behind a large crate as he heard a walking noise from the upstairs.       He looked up, and he saw his mom holding a broom stick head-up. He ducked away as he heard a voice saying 'Hello there, Freda!' she started yelling and screaming as she is whacking her broom stick at the robot. Joe came down and observed the incedent. He looked around the room and was asking himself 'how could this happen?' Mom calmed down and looked at dad and said 'Whats this?' In return, dad said 'Its my newest invention, but i never but on the arm, who did it?' mom shrugged and walked back and forth. Dad also said 'It doesnt talk, either. The mouth is just for decoration.' The robot starts walking around. 'It doesnt walk, too!' He is very surprised now. From the other side of the room, the robot started talking. 'My friend billy stapled my arm together, Joe!' He was very surprised, and he asked the robot 'Where is Billy?' The robot replied 'Behind the large crate, sir!' He looked behind the large crate and there was no sign of Billy.       Billy had traveled upstairs, the back way, and hopped in bed like lightning. The next day Billy asked Dad 'what was all the ruckus last night?' he replied 'You know the robot i was building last night?' 'Yeah.' 'Well, last night, it turned came to life.' Billy was shocked, also, he had smelled a delightful smell of Pancakes with syrup. He had beckoned Billy into the kitchen until he had seen the Robot cooking breakfast for the whole family. Billy had many questions that evening, but he had solved them himself. He became great friends with the robot and named him Hubert. He was a great companion and he loved Hubert.

Its fur glistened in the bright light, and it's dog ears were almost real looking.  Its tail wiggled in jerky, robot-like motions, but I didn't care. Ever since I was little, I have wanted a pet dog, but I have allergies which makes it so I can't get a real one. Today, my dreams were finally coming true.       It had taken me two years to save up for the dog, due to its generous price tag, but it was so worth it. I handed the woman at the counter my money, and she handed me the robot dog. I have had a name picked out for it since I was two; Chick. He looked like a real dog, and from what I've heard, he acted like one too, except for the fact that he didn't shed, need to go outside, or eat. He was the perfect dog for me.       As soon as we arrived home, I put the batteries in him, and watched him come to life. He was cuter than in the pictures, and best of all, he was mine. I threw the ball to him to see what would happen. He bolted over to the spot that the ball landed, and picked it up in his mouth. Using the remote, I made him come. He was absolutely perfect for me and my lifestyle.       Two months later, I was still obsessed with my new companion. I had taught my little sister how to use him, and she fell in love with him too. Every day after school, I got him out and he was always happy to see us. We never got tired of our perfect puppy. He was all that I have ever wanted, plus more.       'Come, Spot!' I shouted at my dog. He came, with the click of my remote. 'Sit!' I said. Then, I clicked my remote, and he listened. He had solved so many of my dreams and I was so proud to have him. He was the ideal pet, and extremely low maintenence. I loved him, and he filled my life with joy. I couldn't imagine life without him.

He would hide at random peoples door steps and scare the crap out of little kids. One Halloween there was this kid that was alone walking down a dark spooky alley and the kid got ate by the beast. He stands at 3 foot 2 inches an he hinds pretty good. Once on one Halloween year he scared this kid but it didn't scare him. SO after Halloween he went to his house and scared him this time. In fact it scared him so bad that he had the cops at his house at 12:00 A.M. The police had to look for the robot and tell him to stop.

After that weird day she went to school but that time her mom took her to school and would have to walk home and she did she pasted the robot again and it was just standing there and she went up to it and touch it and its eyes were red.The robot was looking at something in the field and she looked and nothing was there and she went home she heard something behind her and when she looked back the robot was gone and she got scared and when she looked in front of her the robot was there.That night she took the robot home and her mom wasn't there and that meant she was steal at work and then Maddie took the robot up stairs to her room and was just looking at it and the robot was just looking back at her.       Maddie's mom got home and she called for her and she ran down the stairs to see what she needed and Maddie forgot to close her door and the robot went down the stairs and Maddie saw it before her mom did and she went back up stairs and locked the door she had the key an dafter the Maddie took her shower and went to her bed room and named the robot Dante 2 and she heard her mom coming and she put Dante 2 under the bed and her mom asked' Who are u talking to?' ' Oh nothing just my stuffed animals.'           'Today i will bring something really cool that i got from the store to school.' said Maddie and her mom said 'OK but what are u going to bring?'

It had a gold antenna, diamond eyes, and a silver body that reflected in the sun like a glowing, yellow halo. 'What are you gonna call it.' said Miranda. 'Hmmm, maybe ROBO-BLING-100.' replied Joshua. With the small wrist controller Joshua wrote in 'Jump.' Automatically the 6 foot robot did a jump that would've left the Easter Bunny speechless. 'Wow, I did not Just see that.' said Miranda who was staring in awe. 'Pretty cool, huh,' said Joshua, 'I found it in that old abandond army base. Who would leave this type of technology just to turn into a rustpile. That thing looks like something out of Star Wars.' 'Cool, hey what does this button do.' Miranda was refering to a small green button on the bottom of the wrist controller. 'I don't know, might be the off button.' Joshua pressed it and BOOM! Miranda was the first one to come to. 'Josh, Josh were are you!' Miranda screamed. 'Huh, where am I. Josh said. Wheres Robo-Bling.' Robo-Bling was never found, but the next day half the country newspapers reported an unknown flying object with one distinct figure,diamond eyes.

In a summer day scientists were gathered in their lab trying to figure out a mysterious robot. They spent days trying to figure out what the robot could do. Until one day they gave up and they went home. They were still wondering what the robot could do so they went back to the lab. The scientist searched and searched and they finally found a mysterious button. 'Its about time to know what this robot could do' said Mr. Camacho one of the scientist.                           The next day Mr.Reyes said he will be the brave one and he would press the button. Once he pressed the button the robot was alive. The robot dashed through the big glass window in the lab. Mr.Allen tried to run after the robot but the robot was to fast. Nobody could had ever reached the robot. Until Mr.Camacho ran like lightning after the robot with no fear. Mr. Camacho jumped onto him and he pressed the button.                            Everybody in the neighborhood ran out to see what was happening. They all saw Mr. Camacho with no fear dragging the robot back to the lab. Mr.Camacho became the new hero of the neighborhood. For then he was named The Macho. The robot was destroyed and never again will the neighborhood see it again. 'We did a good job on destroying that robot' said the three scientist. They all lived happily ever after!

It was a alien spacecraft made of gold and diamonds twice as big as my house.           As I got closer to the spacecraft the door it just spring open.  I wonder what riches and horrors these ship contain.  Then a huge water like creature came out talking some language that was extremely new  foreign or not.  I was scared out of my mind as he got closer and closer until I was staring  at him dead in the face.  I was just about to wet my pants just before he try to shake my hand I did not know if this was a alien trick but I trusted him.          Well if your in my shoes you would no choice to shake his hand when your under some much pressure.  On the other he may actual be friendly and give you a crazy gift or he may just kidnap you and be on his way back.  Well it was the worst for  me as as quick as lighting after we shake hands I was out ice cold and when I woke up I was speeding across the solar system to his home planet. As we landed I tried to hid as best  as I could it was no use against him.          He found me but I did not give up just yet I ran through the ship like it was a maze.  Next I found  a potential weapon to beat this water creature and get home it  was some kind of a hybrid vacuum cleaner.  Last he ran right at me then I suck him dry now I on my way back no is going this happen .   I will remember this experience  for the rest of my life.

'He'll be able to play catch with me and be as strong as the hulk and as fast as a cheetah.' Everyone thought the idea of a boy building a robot with these attributes was crazy. 'He'll never be able to do it.' Said his brothers and sister. he didn't care he was determined to build it no matter what.      Later that night Tommy gathered all the materials he would need to build his new friend. Four arms so the robot could multi task, two legs with springs for feet so it could jump extra high, camouflage paint so the robot would look cool and blend in, a torso with the strength of five men combined, and finally a head with a crown so the robot would be like a king.       Tommy spent day and night figuring out ways to put his new robot together. He tried everything from glue and tape to nuts and bolts. Finally once he finally was able to put him together with some screws he was finally completed. The robot stood Six feet tall and was as strong as 10 grown men put together. Everyone was amazed  that such a young boy was able to put together such an amazing invention. Now the only thing left was to give him a name. Tommy looked through his journal for a good name when finally he came across the name Roboto he thought this name was perfect.      Everyone continued to congratulate him on his invention, but his greedy siblings just wanted him to make more so they could sell them for money. 'Just make more so we can make some money.' 'NO Roboto is special just for me.' They continued to argue until the siblings realized there was no way Tommy would change his mind. Tommy continued to enjoy his new friend everyday. One day they would spend the day outside playing catch and the next learning to play an instrument. There was an unless amount of things they could do together. Tommy enjoyed every monent at his friend's side and so did the robot.      The robot also helped around the house by doing chores like cleaning dishes, taking out the trash, and doing laundry. Tommy's invention was so helpful with everything that one day he eventualy decided to share it with the world. He made tons of these so that people everywhere could have a new family member to help around the house and to play with.       Tommy's invention would soon change people's lives in terms of chores and having a new person to hang out with. And could one day change the world.         	NN VBP VBG TO VB DT NN .

Robots can be used for fun and excitement, like the new robot 'Fred.'  'Fred isn't just your average robot.  He can dance, sing, play musical instruments, and play different sports, but this is only the start.   Let me tell you a little about Fred's life and what he is capable of doing.              Fred was walking around town when he saw a flyer with the words, 'Help needed!  Job opening for amusement park designer.  Fred, being programed with the skills to build and design an amusement park, decided to try out for this job.  When he interviewed for the job,the manager said, 'Why are you, a robot, interviewing for a human job?'  Fred just shrugged and built a roller coaster right next to the building in less than a minute. The manager starred in amazement at the quickly built structure and announced, 'You've got the job!'  Fred nodded as he rode the roller coaster back to the ground.              The next day, Fred was working on the new amusement park when he spotted another opening for a pet-sitter at Pet's Delight. He quickly ran over to the pet store, faster than anyone has ever ran before. Fred, once again, interviewed for the job where the manager questioned him.  'Why are you here? ROBOT ALERT!!!'  Fred responded, 'I am here to interview for a pet-sitter.' The manager said in a shakey voice, ' S-show m-m-me what y-you g-got.'  Fred played with the kittens and dragged around a piece of string for them to chase.  The manager of Pet's Delight was suprised that the robot got along so well with the kittens and gave him the job.                    When Fred came back to the science lab where he was made, he was covered in oil from the roller coaster and string an cat fur from the pet shop.  'I'm not even going to ask,' said one of the scientists.  'Looks like you've had quite a day,' said another.  'That was a really crazy and fun day!' Fred said.  'Can I go back to town tomorrow?'  'Of course!' responded another scientist.  There was no response, because Fred had fallen asleep.

We sat at the corner of First Street and Bubblegum Lane in awe, because what we saw you could never imagine. The robot was alive. Lets go back to the beginning when it all started.       'Are you done yet?'       'Can I see? Ugh! Move Steve!'       'Is it possible for you two to shut-up for at least two minutes!'       'Fine, but Joe took my fake nickel!'       'N-uh!'       'Uh-uh!'       'Guys! Come here!'       I had just finished B-572, a robot we had been working on for the past year. He was going to be a new part of the group to hang out with.      'Whoa, this guy looks epic!' said Steven.      'Totally! But where's Carl?' asked Joe.      'Right here fellas!'      'Come check this out!' We shouted.      'Well, ain't she a beaut!' Carl said       'Thanks. Should we start her up?' I asked.      'Yes!' They said enthusiastically.      I flipped the switch. Light shined through the smooth metal exterior. It shook, made some noises, then suddenly stopped. And smoke started to rise from B-572.      'No!'      'This can't happen!'      'Dang-it!'   We all complained in frustration. This whole year in our garage seemed like an entire waste. I didn't get it. We spent every single precious moment we had on this robot, making sure every detail was   precise and accurate.       'I'm not letting this happen.' I said.       'What more can we do?' Carl questioned.       'We can figure out what's wrong with it. We made B-572, we can fix B-572.' I said.        So a couple more days went by, and we did everything we could.        'This is becoming a waste of time.' Joe said.        ' I know,' I sighed, 'let's just head over to the dump.'        'Ok.' they agreed.      That's when something amazing happened. We heard a voice.        ' HE-LLO. MY NAME IS B-572. WHAT IS YOURS?'        'Oh my gosh!'        ' No way!'        ' This can't be happening!'         But it was. When everyone turned around, we saw the sleek robotic eyes of B-572.        'Yes! We did it!' I shouted.        We headed home as quickly as we could.        'HOW ARE YOU TODAY? DO YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME?'        'Yes! B-572, we do want to play a game!' Steven shouted.        So the two of them played fuse-ball for the rest of the night. It was such a success, that we got into Time Magazine! We knew that B-572 would forever be one of our greatest friends.                         	-NONE- EX VBD CD IN PRP : NNP , NNP , NNP , CC PRP , NNP NNP NN IN DT NN IN NNP NNP CC NNP NNP IN NN , IN WP PRP VBD PRP MD RB NNP NNP NN VBD NNP NNPS VBP RB TO DT NN WRB PRP DT NNP JJ PRP VBP RB .

Well, i enjoyed playing it untill it happened. It all started with me playing pokemon, on friday. i was trying to catch a nincada, seeing if the shedinja rumor was true. I caught it, and leveled it up. I nicknamed him M&Iuml;ka. I started to wonder when M&Iuml;ka would evolve. I battled another nincada and it started to evolve. I got the ninjask and shedinja, but somthing was wrong. Shedinja wasn't its usual texture. It had red eyes and had a bloody tear in its right eye. its body was black. Suddenly, i han an urge to use it. I fought a Pikachu, but pikachu's face had a sad expression on it. Pikachu's ears were drooped and his face was in a frown. The pikachu made my Shedinja faint, but instead of it saying:Shedinja has fainted, it said:Shedinja has DIED!  I looked in my party slots and it wasnt there. The battle ended, and i started to freak out. I thought 'What the heck was that?'. Then the screen turned white and all that was on it was a grey jiggily puff with red eyes. The room started to darken even though it was daytime. The screen was still white and the only light was coming from the screen. I was scared. I tryied to run but the door wouldn't budge. Scared to death i chucked the gameboy at the wall. it broke. It was a terrible decision. The gameboy screen parts were still white and the jiggly puff was on the floor still animated. It seemed to be getting bigger/closer. I prayed it was only getting bigger. I was wrong. The jiggly puff came out of the screen and only said one word. 'Jigglypuff'. It started to chase me, and i ran into the door trying to escape. it opened and i ran out of my house trying to get away. It caught up to me. It turned back into a gameboy and i saw a note that read:Play it or die. With no choice i played it. I battled jigglypuff. Then i realized somthing. I didnt walk through my door and i didnt touch it. Was i dead? No it cant be. i tried to walk throught a wall, and it didnt work. so what was going on? I kept playing, and defeated jiggly puff. In the game my character was transported to a room with all the gymleaders on the floor looking dead. The color red was all around them. I saw graves with their names on it. Suddenly, the jigglypuff was there, and a textbox came up and it read:Jiggly puff wants you to join the game. Jigglypuff wants you tp play with you. The screen turned white again and i screamed. then every thing went black. and i was dead.

But did you know that their are robots that can work in mines and on farms help doctors and save lives. Some even explore volcanoes. Trust me we are not the only ones that work hard.                        One robot that is very important is the Gemimi-scout. He is a remote controlled robot that does search-and-rescue in mines under the ground. He is less that two feet has wheels and very strong. He can carry food water and other supplies. He can even drag injured people to safety. Wherever he goes he collects information of the area around him to make sure it is safe for people. To see he has a thermal camera that uses heat sensors to find living things. He may be small but he can do big things.                         This second robot can go to a place we can't go. He is called a Dante 2. He climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. He has eight legs that help him with climbing steep volcano walls. He is built to survive very high heat temperatures. Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. He then collects information about the gases. He is a very important robot for scientist.                         The last robot i would like to talk about is Mr.Gower. He is a robot that works in hospital,he helps doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. He looks like a small medicene cabnet with wheels.  He can go anywhere in the hospital.  He is strong enough to pull 500 pounds. He runs on batteries that charge for two hours and delivers medicine for twelve hours. Mr.Gower can also talk hundreds of phrases. Mr.Gower is a very important contribute to the medical society.

Robots would be helpful for kids because if kids didnt have anyone to play with robots would play with the kids.               First, Gemimi-Scout is a remote controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under the ground.The robot is not taller than two feet and has wheels.The robot is water proof and it is strong.The robot can help people or drag them to safety.It carries food water and alot of other different things.        Second,Mr. Grower is a robot that helps around with things like working at hospitals its like a small cabinet on wheels. The robot is really strong it can hold at least 500 pounds. The robot runs on batteries.       Third, an Agribot is a robot that picks up fruit. Any kind of friut it wants to pick up.This helps the robot know if the friut if it is ripe and the robot picks up as much as it can.Agribots come in all shapes and sizes. In Japan their is a strawberry-picking robot.       Finally, Robots are friendly and nice and alot of people have them because they eather need them for their kids or need them to help around the house. Robots can do all kinds of things like work and dance and play music and even sing.

There are many robots incluiding Agribots, Mr. Gower, Dante 2, and Gemini-Scout.  Each of these robots have a different purpose. Some robots can even do things that humans cannot.              An agribot is a robot that picks fruit.  It might pick berries, grapes, or apples.  Agribots are not yet wildly used, but farmer are very interested in what these robots can do.  Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in different shapes and sizes.  Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks.  Others are able to move around on their own.  In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries.  This helps the robot knopw when each berry in ripe.             Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hostipals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine.  The body of the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine.  Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed.  Mr. Gover can go anywhere in the hospital.  It can ride elevators, steer through hallways,  and move things that get in its way.  The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds.  Mr. Gower runs on batteries.  After charging for two hours,  the robot can deliever medicine for twelve hours without stopping.  Not only does it work long days, but Mr. Gower can talk.  It has been programed to say hundreds of phrases.  For example, it can say, 'Calling elevator' or 'Your delivery is here.' 'Mr. Gower does work that doctors, pharmacisits, and nurses used to do.  This allows them to focus on other important tasks.             Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job--- it climbs into volcanos to gather information for scientists.  like a spioder, this robot has eight legs.  This helps i9t climb the steep walls of the volcan.  It is also built to survive very high heat.  when a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter, Dante goes instead.  Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater.  Then the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the vents.  In the past, scientists could not learn as much about volcanoes, but Dante 2 is changing that.  Now scientists can study a volcano up close while they remain safe in their laboratories.            Gemini-Scout is a remote controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under ground.  The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels.  It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it can even roll through water.  The robot is smaill, but is strong.  Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies.  It can even drag hurt people to safety.  Whereever it goes, Gemini-Scout collects information.  For example, it tests the air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe.  The robot also has a thermal camera to help it find mkiners.  A thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.  When the robot finds the trapped miners, the miners can use its two-way radio to talk with the rescue team.  This robot was built to be easy to use.  Its remote control is the same one that is used for some video games.  If you've ever played a video game, you may know how to use Gemini-Scout. 	NNS VBP NNP NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP VBZ VB NNS .

I would make it so that you would'nt  have to do anything.It could transform into diffrent shape's like a unbralla instead of bringing one.The robot would have wheels to move around.It will have GPS,MAPS,internet it would have a computer mind.My robot could draw pictures or any design.The name of my robot would be E-5 or Sharpo 88.The name of would be cool.It wouldnt weight that much at all.The height of it would probably be 2 feet tall.You could make the Sharpo 88 by scraps of metal couple of wires put them together have screws and a screwdriver and drill holes in the corners screw the screw in it and you would be done.Thats my way of makeing  a   Sharpo 88.

I thought it was really strange to hear those noises especially coming from in there.The noises started to get louder so I started to run it got even louder so I ran even-faster at this point. I got worried .Once i hit my laboratory I opened it up as fast as I could.I was so relieved to see that my robot Crash had just fell onto my new project and messed it up and I was upset that I had to start all    over.       My robots name is Crash I made about two months ago. One day I went out to grab lunch and when I returned my robot came to life. It was on top of my desk playing with my computer. I was really freaked out by this but after a while I got used to it.I had a robot and I had to accept it because I didn't want to throw him out.When I walked into my lab I found out that Crash could talk and I was really surprised so I took him to talk to my friends to show him off.       My friends were Natalie,Vanessa,and Bernice .When I showed them my invention they said I was crazy because Crash didn't want to talk because of his shyness.On the way back to my lab Crash was talking as much as he could I was really disappointed that crash didn't want to talk in front of my friends.I just got back to my lab and found out that Crash knows how to do lots and lots of tricks.I went back to my friends and tried to show them what Crash could do but he was to shy and to nervous to do any tricks.Crash made me get a little upset again because he didn't want to do any tricks .       When I walked into the lab Crash was not talking or moving or even doing any of his tricks.I tried to figure out what was wrong.I told Crash that he was my best friend but he didn't even move. I felt as if Crash because I wanted to show him off to my friends . He was pretty upset with me and didn't want to talk to me.I still feel really bad for trying to show of Crash to my friends.       When I woke up this morning I ran to my lab in my blue pajamas.I was worried to find Crash still upset with me.I unlocked the lab doors and couldn't find him any were.I was so worried what kind of trouble he would be in.I went back to my house and was relieved to find Crash on my kitchen floor.I asked Crash what he was doing on my kitchen floor and he answered he was making breakfast I told him that robots don't eat food but he said that robots were the same as humans and they eat breakfast to and he was taking apart my microwave and I had to get a new one but Crash was forbid to touch it.       I was on the internet trying to find out what kind of robot he was called Mr.Gower. Mr. Gower was Crashes real name but I still wanted to call him Crash.The only reason I still call him Crash is because he is always crashing into problems.Today I took Crash to show my friends that he talks and he does tricks.My friends said they were really sorry for telling me that I was really crazy.I forgave them.I went to the store and bot a newspaper and Crash was in the front page of the newspaper.I was walking towards my lab today and heard lots of noises like the one I heard when I found out Crash could talk.

Many scientist have made Dante 2 to discover and explore new places in volcanoes. But the problem is that something strange and incredible happened.               Dante 2 has changed and has been converted to human. He could run, walk, play, and do almost anything a human can do. But one day Dante 2 was just walking around until he saw a big beautiful house. Dante 2 was tempted to see what was inside so he walked in. The was filled with luxury items. It had sheets of gold covering the clock and the cabinets, the chandelirs were made out of pure gold and dimond. and the base of two lamps were made of lapis lazulli. Dante 2 started seeing a stranger walking toward him and didn't know what to do. He reconized the scientist who had planned and created Dante 2.               The scientist appeared to be flabbergasted to see someone in his house. He got scared and didn't know what to do. So he said,'Get out of my house you dumb old thief! GET OUT!' Dante 2 had finally had the chance to speak and said,' Don't you reconize me. Im Dante 2, the robot you created. Something wierd happened and got me turened into....this.' 'Ok I have know idea if to believe you or something if its true im just going to try my best to help you.'               After a while the Dante 2 got tuned back into his self agian. Dante 2 started working well and helped a lot to discover new places inside the volcanoes. He gathered enough information for scientist so that they can test them. Dante 2 was a great help for scientist.

What the kid did not now was that the robot came alive when you put the batteris in. So the kid when and bought his friend some batteries. After he when to go and buy the batteries he went to his friends birthday.The little boy gave his friend the robot.                Then, the played party games, ate cake, and had fun. Then it was time to open the presents so every one gather around taylor to see what he got. Taylor open his presents and saw the little robot. Taylor asked his mom to help him put the batteries in the robot. Taylors mom help him with the robot.                    Taylor had fun playing around with his robot, but he didin't realise that the robot was alive. So strange things began to start. For example, Taylor was missing his toys, food, and his favorite stuff animal.Taylor was scared at first that he had to sleep with his mom. But Taylors mom wanted to find out what was goin on.                Taylors mom found out that it was the robot so taylors mom told taylor that it was the robot so taylor was't that scared enymore. So taylor desided to train the robot to be nice and bery helpful. Taylor was proud of him self. Taylor took the robot everywere. Taylor told everyone in school but some people didn't beleve him.                   Taylor didin't care about what people said about him and his BIG lie. So he desided to keep it to him self. So the both played, had fun, and enjoyed there time together.SO They Both Lived Happely ever after.

The first robot I will be talking about is the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout is a remote controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under ground. The robot is les than two feet tall and has wheels It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it can even roll through water. The robot is small, but is strong. Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies. It can even drag hurt people to safety. wherever it goes, Gemini-Scout collects information. The robot also has a thermal camera to help it find miners. A thermal camer uses heat sensors to find living things.             Another robot I would like to talk about is Dante 2. The Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientist. Like a spider, this robot has eight legs. This helps it climb the hight heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for scientist to enter, Dante goes instead. Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. Then the robot collects information about the gases that come out of the vents. In the past, scientist could not learn as much about volcanoes, but Dante 2 is changing that. Now scientist can study a volcano up close while they remain safe in their laboratories.               Mr. Gower is another good robot I would like to talk about. Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The bodyof the robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Nurses and doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed. Mr. Gower can go any where in the hospital. It can ride elevators, steer through hallways, and move things that get in the way. The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds. Mr Gower runs on batteries. After charging for two hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping. Not only does it workd long days, but Mr. Gower can talk. It has been programed to say hundereds of phrases.               Last but not least, AGRIBOTS. Agribots are a robot that picks fruit. It might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. Agribots are not yet widley used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different than picking and apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed beheind trucks. Others are able to move around on their own. In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries. This helps the robot kniw when  each berry is ripe.

I am beet red from the hours of sun I have gotten over the last couple of days. There can only be one thing I'm doing, VACATIONING IN HAWAII!!!! Back to the point I was walking through the forest and saw what looked like a shooting star appear across the night sky. The only thing was, it was the middle of the day. All of the sudden it hit the ground with a hard explosion. I walked over to where i thought it landed. Right there in a large crater was a rusty robot obviously broken. But all of the sudden its eyes open and it said one not-so-simple word. 'Wall-e'.       I was so suprised I just passed out on the spot.       When I woke up I had the robot bent over me hitting my head with a rock. I sat up and looked around, I was in the crater I fell in but it was the middle of the night. I wondered greatly why this robot was here, so I asked it. It replied in this realy annoying robot voice,' I have been sent here from the future to warn you about an oil leak right off of the coast of Maui that will be met with a wildfire that will appear right when the oil spill happens.' ' The oil will then catch on fire and set fire to all of the underground oil resevours that surrond the world.' ' This fire will alight every single inch of land on earth.' 'The only people that will live will be on a boat or on an airplane.' 'Everyone will die'. 'Wow, so how do I stop it' I said.' You have to go down to pier 21 and put out a fire.'       I left Wall-e in the crater and hiked back down the mountainside. I stole a motor cycle to get to Harbor 21 faster. I hoped on. The problem was I didnt know a thing about motorcycles. I tried to remember what Jonothan DeHart taught me years and years ago about riding a dirt bike. The issue was this wan't a little 80cc dirt bike but a 650cc Kawasaki Ap racer that can go 200 mph. I started it and heard the huge engine roar. I let off the clutch only an inch and I took off. I was almost ripped off the bike. I zoomed down the streets of Maui going 90 mph. It seemed that in no time I was passing all of the docks. 26,225,24,23,22, than finally 21.       I hopped of the bike and burned myself on the exhaust. I ran to the dock and saw a boat that said 'J and M oil co.' I went on the boat and headed to the oil drill. On the boat ride I saw a boat with people holding flamethrowers. I automaticly knew they would be the cause of the fire. I pushed my boat to full throtle and ramed right into them. There boat blew up and the threat was eliminated. I wanted more credit for saving the world but it all just ended with me going back ome to America.

He was just about to grab it when a little boy jumped on his back. Mr. Gower swirled around trying to lose the kid, but his grip was too tight. Then they buped into a big medicine drawer labeled DANGER KEEP AWAY. All of the liquids fell on to Mr. Gower and he started to glow.        He started transform into a big huge fighting robot. He flicked the boy off and started to walk back down to the doctor. When the doctor saw he was amazed and asked what had happened to him. The robot could now talk. He told his story and showed Dr. Gor how now he armed with big weapons of destruction. The doctor called the government to see what they could do with Mr. Gower.        The government came lightning fast. They examined the robot with great curiosity. They realized they could use this robot for military purposes. They carried him away in a huge crate and from that moment on he wasn't Mr. Gower, he was Mr. Destructive.

The robot is a real friend , it helps peoople and animals when they need help on something or they are in danger. He collects information , reads , learns different languages and can even carry or push 500 pounds! To be more spacific he mostly has a brain like a computer, well in other words he is very smart and kind.              Once he went to help out a person in need and took her to the hospital. The docters suggested that the robot should try to get a job as a police or a fire fighter or as a docter.

Since the day he learned about science, Bill wanted to build his very own robot.       Bill was a great scientist and loved everything about robots. Today was the day he was going to make his own robot. First, he started to plan everything out. Furthermore, Bill was going to make his robot out of metal and plastic. He told his parents about this wonderful idea, but they disagreed. Bill was sad for the rest of the day. Then the rest of the week, then the month. One day, something magical happened. On Bill's 12th birthday, his parents gave him permisson to build his very own robot.       To start his project, Bill hurried to the hardware store, and bought some metal, spray paint, wood, and plastic. Bill built it quickly and it turned out really nice. For the final touch, he spray painted his robot red and yellow. In addition, his masterpiece was completed, and named Iron Man M8. Bill was extremely proud of his accomplishment, but he had to go to bed since he had school tomorrow.       The next day, Bill woke up, and...his project had disappeared! Bill rushed out of the house and his robot was flying. The robot had come ot life! Bill was surprised, and his robot flew him to school. Today was the day that Bill would show his creation as his science project. Everyone was amazed. Iron Man M8 could help people when they are injured, store medicine, can talk, and can be used as Bill's armor. When Bill went to lunch everyone wanted to use it as their armor, and Bill was annoyed. Someone was hurt from playing a basketball game, and Iron Man M8 gave him medicine and healed him. Bill always wanted to build a robot that could do things like his favorite robots, Gemini-Scout, and Mr. Gower.       Bill was so proud of his accomplishment, but one day he was really sad. He used Iron Man M8 to fly home at the speed of life. His parents told him some really bad news. They got a call from the local hospital asking if they could keep his robot as a helper. Bill was a sad as ever, and he would have to leave his best friend. Bill just bonded his him and now he would have to be taken away. On the other hand, Bill realized it was for the best and that Iron Man M8 would be taken away.       One year later...       When Bill was the age of 13, his parents got another call from the hospital. His parents rold him that the hospital was very thankful and that Iron Man M8 saved 100's of people. Also, they told him that he could have his robot back. Bill was as as happy as a bird who found its nest. He got his robot back and made a few changes. Iron Man M8 was now made of unflamable metal and plastic. So that would mean that he could now be used to gather information from volcanoes. Ever since the day that Bill decided to build a robot, his creation made the lives of other people as happy as can be, but most importantly he had made a new best friend.

When she opened it nobody was there, only a small envelope, she took it and went back inside. How odd, she wondered that somebody would just leave an envelope on my door step and not explain. She opened the envelope to find a light grey colored paper inside with a robot drawing in the middle. The robot was white and had blue eyes, it floated and had arms that grafted into its body. All of a sudden the paper started glowing, Artemis dropped the paper and started to back up. The glowing was so bright she had to close her eyes and turn around. When it stopped, she turned to look and in the place of the paper was the robot.       'My name is Elsie the Multi-bot. How may I be of service?'       'What is a Multi-bot?'       'It is a robot that can do anything.'       'Sweetness.'       Some time has passed and since then Artemis and Elsie became best friends. Until one day the S.A.P.R.M came.       'What are the S.A.P.R.M?' asked Artemis.           'They are the Space Authority Patrol Robot Men, and they are here for me.' said Elsie.       'Elsie let me tell you a secret. I am a superhero.'       'Do you have a partner or team?'       'Yes I have a team.'       'Call them.'       An hour later Whisper partner to Speedy who has super speed, Miss Martian partner to Martian man who has martian powers, Super the partner to Extremist who have the powers of super strength laser vision etc. were all at the home.       'Where are Red and Robin?' asked Whisper.       'Right here.' said a voice.       Out from the shadows walked a boy and a girl, Little Red Riding Hood and Robin. Red was the Partner to Kitty who both have no powers and Robin was the partner to Shadow who also had no powers.           'It has been so long you guys, now lets beat those aliens.'       About two hours, a destroyed town and a bunch of under age superheros later and you get a successful battle. Elsie got to stay wit Artemis and all the super-kids stayed in touch. All was peaceful until Red disappeared, but that's another story.

Everyone is dead . now everyone has lived happily ever after in heaven except the people that didnt tear the house down after the family died in it and before the little girl with the stuffed robot , her family is dead to in happily heanven after.

My robot would do my chores for me.These robots are not like this, these robots are up to two feet in height              There are all different kinds of robots. Robots that climb into volcanoes,work in hospitals that can carry 500LBS.The other two are, farmers and rescues that help injured people.             So again if i choose one of these options i would pick the farmer,because it would pick berries for me. 	IN PRP VBD DT NN WP MD PRP VB IN .

Bot wanted to be famous and a great leader,so he study to be a president.He study for thousands of years until he was ready.By then he it was year 5013,everything was advance,robot serverants,robot chefs,robot soilders,everything you can imagine.But he was the only robot civilian in the world.          He quited his job because he need time for his speeches,for 5 months he was traveling to get votes for him.Then in 5013 election the announcer say 'The new president is.......... Bot the Robot!' Bot was very happy,he turn Russia back to  superpower.

I went outside and looked there was a huge hole and a robot inside of it. Then I heard a roaring sound and the robot came to life. ' Hello Master'. Is the first thing it said to me. Then it climbed out of the hole and came up to me.'What would you like me to do master'. I stared at it then said'can you dance' the robot then played music and danced and singed.   I thought this was a dream, but then it all changed. The robot said'are you a human I hate humans if i see them i instently destroy them'. Right then and there I ran away the robot at my heels.'Master where are we going', it asked me.'Stay here' I said then I took off runing home.             When I got home I turned on the tv it was on the news then all the sudden there it showed the robot that I had found and it showed it exploding building.I quickly went straight to my bedroom where I kept my copper bb-gun then I ran after the robot. When I got there the robot asked why humans were on planet then I took out my BB-gun and shot the robot it hit him but all it left was a dent then the robot came after me shooting lasers and rockets I ran into my home where I knew he couldnt get me and started to think how I could beat the robot. I thought and I thought then I suddenly gob an idea I remembered the self destruct button on the back of it. I had to distract it some how so I could hit the button.             When I got to the center of the city there the robot was about to eat the mayor. I then ran up behind it quickly hitting the self destruct button and moving the mayor out of the way. Then the robot exploded leaving nothing but a note. It said 'thank you so much for deafting this robot it has been going from planet to planet destroying them all'. Then   I went and watched tv then another explosion came from our back yard. I went outside and looked there was a huge hole and a robot inside it.'Not again I said' then I ran up and searched for a self destruct button and hit it. Then it was gone again thats when I asked my mom if we could move to a different town. She said yes then we packed up and moved.

I loved robots. I got ready and we were on our way. When we got there there were robots everywhere. Some were small, some were big, some were gold, and some were red. As I admired the huge museum I saw a big empty room with something laying in the middle of it. I told my dad, and he said I could go take a closer look at it. As I approched the unknown figure I wondered what it could be.       I finally reached the creature. It was a robot. At first I was not so amazed or surprised, because there were robots everywhere. I stood there, in that big empty room wondering why it was laying there alone. Later on an assistant who worked there walked up to me. He said ' What are you doing?' I replied 'I was just wondering why this robot was laying here all alone?' He told me that when the creaters of the robot made it, it never worked or came to life. They researched, got robot specialist to come and look at it and much more, but nothing worked. So after a while they got tired and decided to through it in this big empty room that know one ever went into. Then I was interested.       The assistant asked me if I had any more questions, and I did. I asked him if I could try and make the robot come to life. He said I could but it probrobly won't work. Then he left. My heart did kartweels. I was so excited. I had always wanted to work on a robot.   There was only one problem, I did't know how to! I looked around for supplies, but all I found was a door. I went inside. It was where the  the creaters of the robot woked on the robot. I took some tools and then went back into the room with robot in it. Then I got to work.       I tried everything, but nothing worked. 'I guess the guy was right,  I can't make the robot work just like no one else could' I said to my self. I walked away in sham with my head hanging down ready to go find my dad. All of the sudden I heard a noise. I turned around and to my surprise the robot was alive. I screamed! 'I did it' I shouted. The assistant came running in. WHen he saw that the robot was alive he started screaming too. He asked me how I did it. I told him that I just clicked a couple buttons, walked away and then when I tured back around it was alive! Neither of us could believe it.       I asked him if it ever got named. He said it didn't, but since I got it to come alive he said that I could name it. After thinkig for a while I decided to name it Miricale Bob. I chose that name because he was a miricale and because I like the name Bob. I got my dad and told him the whole story. He was so proud of me. I thought to myself 'I can fix a robot and make it come to life but a robot specilist can't!' I must have been a pro.       Long after that when my dad was puttig me to bed he told me I would make a great scientist. That made me really happy. Thats my adventure story of how I made a robot name Miricale Bob come to life. It was the best day ever!

My robot, Carlos, was doing my homework while I was watching TV. 'So Carlos,' I said, 'how is my homework coming along.'   'Great,' said Carlos, 'almost done.'   'So you don't mind if I go down to my friend Kyle's house,' I said.   'Well,' said Carlos, 'I kinda want to spend some time with youuuuuuuuu.'   'Are you OK Carlos,' I said, 'what happened to your voice.'   All of sudden Carlos fell out of his chair and fell on to the tile floor. 'Carlos,' I yelled, 'are you OK.' I picked him up and set him down on the couch. 'Carlos, Carlos,' I said, 'are you OK.' Then it happened, Carlos got up off the couch and said, 'Must destroy Cameron.'   'Carlos!' I yelled. I got up and started to run for my life. 'BING! BANG! BOOM!, ' I kept hearing behind me. I turned around and saw Carlos shooting lasers at me. 'Ahaaaaaaa,' I screamed. I ran upstairs into my room and locked myself in my closet. 'I think I lost him,' I whispered. All of a sudden, BANG!, Carlos smashed the door open. I ducked under his humungous  metal legs and ran downstairs out the door. 'What to do, what to do, Yes,' I said. I ran over to the bushes in my front yard and hid behind them. BOOOOOOOM! I saw the front door fly into the street. THUMP, THUMP. I heard him walking right in front of me. 'Yes,' I said. Then Carlos turned around and saw me hiding in the bushes. 'Not again,' I said. I got out of the bushes and ran toward my friend Kyle's house. 'Yes,' I said, 'I finally got away.' When I turned around to see how far away Carlos was, he wasn't there. 'What the heck,' I said, 'where did he go.' Right when I turned around he was in front of me.   'Oh come on,' I said. He flew right in front of me. 'See you later, CAMERON,' said Carlos. Then Carlos picked me up and threw me on the ground. My stomach dropped and a chill went down my spine. I looked up at the horrible beast and saw a self destruct button on his chest. 'Yes,' I said in my head, 'all I have to do is jump up and press the self destruct button.' I jumped and pressed the button and all of a sudden, BOOOOOOOOM! my robot Carlos was gone. Now I have learned my lesson to never, ever have a Robot.

There is many robots that can help us on of them is a Gemini-Scout it's very cool it has many diffrent things and there is some things that other robots dont have. The Gemini-Scout moves with a remote-controlle. It can do research amd work in mines under ground! The hight is smaller then 2ft,and it walks on weels. If you want it goes down the starirs, and up the stairs turn to the right,turn to the left it can. It can carry many things like food, water, or it can drag the people that are in or that a safe. This robot has many interestiong things and it can safe lives that tells you that this robot is safe and wont take over the world.            Dont think that was the only robot they have there is another wonderful robot it's called...Dante 2. Dante can also do many things like in can go into the volcano and gather information, this robot would be very handy for scientists. This robot's has eight legs! This robot can take any heat there is on earth. It can do very helpful things for scientist then just going in a volcano it can also go in vents, and holes. This robot cant get any time of information like collecting information about gases that come out of the vents. These scientest are happy that this new robot came because they could of never got in more information in life without Dante 2            Mr.Gower is a hero he works in a hospital,helping doctors and nureses bring the supplies they need for the patient. Mr.Gower looks very small like a cabinet on weels. The nurses and doctors that work in the hospital can just unlock the drawers when the supplies they need for the patients they can just get it right out of Mr.Gower. He can go on a elevator,through hallways,and many other things. This robot is so amazing he cant pull 500 pounds,now that is amazing! But remeber to buy he batteris because this robot runs with batteris. When you feel lonley talk to Mr.Gower it can speak to you. This is a robot i would like in the future when im a doctor.            Agribots is the last robot in this story. These robots are all great but they all have there diffrences but what they do have in common is that all of them are very helpful lets see what this one helps with and what is his/her diffrence from all the wondeful robots there is. Well the great thing is if you are a person that likes to go out and pick out fruits the robot here can carry it for you. Thats says that this robot can just be helpful for people going to pick out fruits but to farmers there a big help to all farmers have been amazed in this robots work. The technology scientist are working to grow many vegtebles and fruits but no humans wants to help out with this job so guess what there comes in the robot...Agribotos they can do they same job we can maybe even better, it's just like a robot farmer. The robot has all the stuff they need they can just tell the robot what to do if the plants are to dry the robot can water it. I told you they are all helpful just as much as this one but it all helps in diffrents things like for farmers, doctors, scientist. They all help but in diffrent things.            There is also robots that can play with you it's called robbie he is the best robot to play with when you feel lonley he always has time to play with you. This robbie robot is the kids favortie it's like there new best robot friend i wish i had one of thoose!

My dad usually brought home some of the most extraordinary expirements that had come from his lab. ' Go ahead, open it!' my dad encouraged. I was a little bit nervous about opening the box, for I knew nothing about what was inside. ' This better not be one of those singing robots again! I barely got sleep the night that you brought that mess home!' my mom said angerly. I tore open the box slowly and carefully to find a little furry robot puppy jumping around . ' There you go! A puppy!' my dad said.  'Dad, that was very thoughtful of you, but you know that I am highly allergic to dogs.' I said sadly. ' Not to worry! This dog is not made of real dog fur. Instead, we made it out of fake fur so that you could enjoy all of the wonders of having a dog!' my dad said. I have never been able to have a dog due to my severe allergies of them, so this was definitely exciting to know that I could finally have a pet dog. ' Thank you Dad!' I said happily. ' Well, at least it isn't one of those singing robots again.' mom said.            It was Saturday that my robot dog started actually acting like a real dog. I was awaken by all of the barking that it was making. I opened up the door to my bedroom to let the little guy in. He burst through the door with excitement in his robot mechanical eyes. He started to jump up and down around me. I knew that he probably wanted me to pick him up. I knew this because of all of the dog books that I have read in my life. I reached down to pick him up when suddenly, he jumped right into my arms. ' Hi there little guy!' I said. He started to bark and curl up in my arms. 'Aww!' my mom said. ' Mom! Why are you in here!' I said. I was a little bit shocked to see her up so early in the morning. She normally woke up at 7:30, and right now it was only 6:30.'Why are you up so early mom?' I said in confusion. 'Well, Sparky here woke me up because of all of the barking that he was doing.' she said. 'You gave him a name already?' I said in dissapointment. I wanted to name him something more exciting, like Elvis or Gizmo. 'Well I'm sorry! I did not know that you already named the little guy.' she said. Sparky then looked up at me and licked my face with a little rubber tounge.            I brought Sparky outside to see what he could really do. 'Ok, Sparky! Can you do any tricks? Roll over!' I said. Sparky looked at me, then got onto his back and rolled over. I couldn't believe it! I thought that I would have to make a fool out of myself and try to teach him how to roll over. 'Good boy, Sparky!' I said. 'Ok, here is a tough one, but I bet you can do it. Play dead!' I said. Sparky then acted as if he was dizzy, then fell onto the ground. 'Good job!' I said. Sparky was probably the best dog that anyone could ever have. ' Malory! Breakfast is ready!' my mom yelled. 'Coming!' I said. I scooped up Sparky and brought him into the house.            'Hey dad! Can Sparky eat dog treats like other dogs?' I said. 'Well, not exactly. We made him some special treats that help boost his energy level, or re-charge his battery. If you want, you can give him one after breakfast. I keep them in my tool box.' dad said. After I finished my breakfast, I went down into the basement where my dad kept his tool box. I first looked on the first shelf, then to the second shelf, where I found a bag with a dozen cookie-like treats. 'Sparky!' I screamed. I heard tiny footsteps coming down the stairs, through the movie theater room, then into dad's workroom. 'Who wants a treat!' I said. Sparky started jumping around and circling me. 'Sit!' I commanded. Sparky sat onto the floor with one tiny thump. 'Good boy!' I said. I held the treat up then handed it to him. He gulped it down like it had nothing to it. 'You are the best dog any girl could ever have!' I said. I picked up Sparky and gave him a hug. He then brought out that little rubber tounge of his and licked my face.

I was born deaf and people tell me that at first sight you would think that I am normal. The thing is though, I'm not normal, nothing about me is. I attend my town's public school which has regular kids, with regular lives. All of the other kids can see, feel, hear, smeel, and taste. I  can only do four of those. When I turned 7 my parents got me a small robot that can hear and speak. It translats to me what I need to know when people try to talk to me.           This robot turned into my best friend soon, because none of the   other kids at school would even say 'hi', before they had a reason to ignore me because I couldn't hear either way, but now I can. I gave my robot a name a few weeks after I got her, I named her Crissy. Crissy basically looked like a little doll that could be dressed up and played with. I didn't play with Crissy though, I spoke to her. I was learning what words ment and how to say them even if I couldn't hear. Sometimes when I got frustrated I gave up and we just used sign language.           One night I was asleep in bed when I had this wierd dream that   Crissy came to life and tried to take over the world. I woke up crying because I never wanted her to do that, I wanted her to always be my best friend. I got up and looked around for her, she wasn't in her case (I like to call it a bed) and wasn't on my night stand were she sometimes is. I started to panick, 'Had I left her at school?' I thought to myself. I started walking around the house calling her name. Finally I cameto the kitchen. She was on a chair sitting on a pile of books that were stacked as though she had done it herself.  I slowly, trying to get the correct words out of my mouth asked 'What are you doing down here?'. Crissy turned her  head swiftly in my direction and stared straight into my soul.           It is now a few months after the night that Crissy came to life   and I realized that she does it often. I have lost track of the times I have seen her move without me controlling or telling her what to do. She seems more real this way, not evil, more human and more like a friend. I have begun to learn more complitcated words that I can speak and I have made it through the school year without feeling so bad about hearing. I am taking an english class over the summer to learn complete sentences and advanced words. I wonder if there will be any one like me there?

She opened the door and came face to face with a robot.  The old widow then went to bed hoping that she would never again see the robot.                                      But later that night  there was a flash of light.  When the old widow looked outside she thought she saw something lurkinging in the shadows.Then she finally got some sleep.  Until the old widow heard the door creak open and heavy foot steps came in.  Now she was terifed.  The door to her bedroom slowly opened and before her stood a robot.                                                      No one knows what happened to the old widow or the robot.

So being the smartest kid has some perks like you having to do the older and bigger kids homework. Tim really didn't have any friends exept for a boy named Joey. Joey was the wierdest kid in school.            When Tim and Joey were walking home from school they got thier usual bullying. Then went to Tim's house. 'Well, they where nice today.'said Tim.'Yea,' said Joey 'they didn't give me a weggie this time but they did take my DS'. 'We should start doing our homework, Bill's homework, Jake's homework, and Eric's homework.' said Tim.'Ok' Joey said as they headed towrds the basment, thier spot to hang out.'What's that?' Joey asked in a really surprised vioce.' It's a robot I'm working on. It's name is 'The Bully Defeter' also known as TBD.' Tim said as proud as he could be.'It's still not done yet but when it is the bullies better watch out.' Tim was standing next to a large object that was mostly silver with purple painted like a shirt, blue painted for the pants and black painted for the shoes. The robot looked like a human.         The boys started to do thier  homework at the dinner table. Tim's mother when to the mall to buy Tim new clothes and Tim's dad was at work so Tim and Joey were home alone. ' Hey Tim, what is the answer to number ten?' Tim answered ' Twenty-six.' At that moment the boys heard a loud crash form basement.' What was that?'asked Joey. Tim shuruged his shulders. The boys ran downstairs. There was more loud crashes  as the ran and to thier surprise the TBD was trying to hurt Tim's fish! 'It's alive.' Tm said in shock. 'This is so cool!'Joey said            When Tim realized what was happening he yelled 'Stop!' and the TBD stoped and said 'Yes masters, Tim and Joey.' Joey was jumping around like a made crazy person. 'It's alive!' he repeated over and over agian.Tim walked over to theTBD and touched it. ' TBD, don't hurt the fish they are friends.'' 'Yes master' When Joey was done jumping around he said ' So is it programed to hurt things?' 'Unless we tell him not to' Tim said. ' It will do any thing we want it to.' Every thing was silent for a few minuets.'TBD, please do our homework.' said Joey. 'Yes, Joey' and TBD left to do the boy's work.           TBD did all of the boy's work and cleaned the house. Then a car pulled into the driveway. 'My dad is home!' said Tim.' Oh no! TBD go downstairs and shutdown' said Tim 'Yes master.' TBD walked down stairs. 'Hello?' 'Hi Dad'said Tim 'Hi Tim, hi Joey. Did you guys clean the house?' 'Yes' said the boys at the same time.But down stairs TBD did not shutdown, instead he killed Tim's fish And more TBD's so he could keep his masters safe and kill everyone.

I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom window.  I only saw a bright blue sky and puffy clouds that looked like cotton balls nothing that could make a sound.  I heard the noise again coming   from downstairs.  I dashed down the stairs into my kitchen.                       It was a robot!  It had come alive!  It had a square head with red glittering eyes, pink lips,and a hard metal body.  It looked like the robot that picked berries on our farm.

'How are you alive I just thought  you picked our berries on  the farm.'I asked.                                                                                     'I do many other things than just pick berries and make breakfast.  I don't know how I came alive I don't remember anything.  Everything was so foggy.'the robot said.     'Let's get you upstairs into my room before my parents wake up and see you.'I said.         We ran upstairs and slammed the door shut.  'I want to have this dream to have a party!How about tonight?   'said Lucy.     'Are you crazy we can't have my parents find out about you.'I said.     'Oh, come on it is a week end.  We can do anything we want.'she said.        'Well okay, but I have to have my parents permission and you have to behave.  I'll go ask my parents be right back.'         'Mom dad I had a great idea that I could have a party tonight and plus it is a weekend and-'     'Sure you can it is a little short notice but you have been keeping up your grades.'my dad said.     'Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!'I excitedly said.     'Here is $25.00 for the party supplies'my mom said.         'I'm back Lucy!  Guess what they said!  Yes!'I said.   'Yes!  My first party!  I have heard you humans talk about what is called a party.  So what is a party?   'A party is when you invite your friends over and you can do any sort of fun stuff and eat lots of  pizza!  There is a cool party place down the street that we can get the supplies!'   'Let's go!'          'Here we are Lucy!  The Party Palace!'I said.   'Wow this is so exciting but this place looks a little burnt down and old! This is going to be the best party ever!'she said.   'It is on the outside but not on the inside.Lucy the party will be a costume party.   'Great idea but what are you going to be?   'I'll  wear my which Halloween costume from last year.  I think we got everything we need.'         'Let's start setting up.  We will have the party in the grauge.'I said.       'I'll start calling your friends from your phone book.'she said     'Okay but only the circled ones.'I said       'I have been on the phone for one whole hour calling all of your friends but none of them can come.'   'I'm so sorry!  I just got the best idea!  We can have a party by ourselfs!  I'll go get dressed in my costume.'I said.         'Okay the first thing you do at a party is you can dance.'Give it a try!'I said.   'The only dance I know is the robot.'Lucy said.   'Next we eat!'I said.   'Yum this pizza stuff is really good.  And now what do we do?'She asked.   'We have to go to bed!'I said sadly.   'Well I guess this is good by.'she said depressed.   ' I will take good care of you on the farm and keep you company in the fields.'I said.   'One more thing, tell your dad I need an oil change.'she said.   'I will'.I said as I squeezed her tightly.   'See you in the fields!I said.

Ally asked if she can build her own robot .her mom said yes. Ally and her mom went to the store to get the robot parts. When they wre finished getting what they needed they went home and started to work on it. Everyday when Ally got home they kept on working on it. The next day when Ally got home the robot was finished. Everyday they were teaching it to talk and walk and help with things. Three days later the robot could walk talk and do anthing else. They were tring to think for a name for the robot. Then they finaly thougt of it they named it  Little Helper Robot. After Ally got home from school Ally and Little Helper were setting up for dinner. After they set up for dinner Little helper would cook dinner. After dinner Little Helper would clean up the mess.           In the moring Little Helper would wake up Ally and her mother. After she woke up Ally and her mother she made breakfast. After Little Helper made breakfast she helped Ally get ready for school. After Ally was at school Little Helper would Mop the floors and clean Ally's bedroom. Once Ally got home from school they all went for icecream. After they went out for icecream they went back home. That night they made there own pizzas for dinner. Ally's pizza was peporoni and sausage. Ally's mom's pizza was plain old cheese. Little Helper's pizza was Hawain. After that they all watched a movie in the livingroom. After the movie was done they all went to bed. Little Helper tucked Ally into her bed.               The next day Ally and Little Helper herd a big boom. They both jumped out of bed to see what happend. When they went into the kitchen all they saw was glass everywhere.   Ally was crying because all she saw was her mother lying on the floor. Ally's mom told her to get the phone and dial 911. The ambulance was there as fast as possible. The ambulance took little helper and Ally with there mother. Once they were in the hospital room the doctor told Ally and Little Helper they can't stay in the hospital beacause there mother is seriously injured. Ally's mom told Little Helper to take good care of Ally because she was going to be the hospital for a long time.               The next few days were upsetting for Ally because she didn't get to tell her mom about her day. Later in the day she was much happier because her and Little helper would go to the store and get something to eat. After they got back they would play out side untill it got dark. When they got back inside they would make some popcorn and watch a movie     	CD NN RB VBD DT RB NN VBD NNP , WRB PRP VBD NN PRP VBD VBG PRP$ NN IN WP PRP VBD IN JJ VBD JJ NN WP PRP VBD IN NN '' RB PRP$ NN VBD JJ NN PRP VB IN NN '' NNP VBD JJ JJ IN NNP NNP VBD IN PRP MD VB PRP VB NN -NONE- NN VBD NNP NNP CC PRP$ NN NN TO DT NN TO VB DT NN NNP NNP PRP VBP VBN VBG WP PRP VBD PRP VBD NN CC VBD TO VB IN NNP NNP WRB NNP VBD NN PRP VBD IN VBG IN NNP NNP JJ NN WRB NNP VBD NN DT NN VBD NNP NNP PRP VBD VBG PRP TO VB CC NN CC VB IN NNP NNP NNS JJ DT NN MD VB NN CC VBP VBG NNP NNP VBD VBG TO VB IN DT NN IN DT NNP NNP PRP RB VBP IN PRP PRP VBD PRP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD NN IN NN RB CC NNP NNP VBD VBG RP IN NNP NNP PRP VBD RP IN NN NNP NN MD VB NNP NNP NN NNP NNP MD VB RP DT NNP NNP DT NN NNP NNP MD VB RP NNP CC PRP$ NNP NNP PRP VBD RP RB CC PRP$ NN PRP VBD NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD JJ PRP VBD RB VB JJ IN NNP NNP NNP VBD IN NN NNP NNP MD VB DT NNS CC JJ NNP POS NNP NNP NNP VBD NN IN NN PRP DT NN IN NNP NNP PRP VBD IN IN NN PRP VBD RB NNP NNP NN PRP VBD RB JJ NNS IN NNP NNP POS NN VBD NN CC NNP NNP POS NN POS NN VBD NN JJ NNP NNP NNP POS NN VBD NNP NNP IN PRP VBP VBN DT NN IN DT NNP NNP DT NN VBD VBN PRP VBP VBD TO NNP NNP NNP VBD NNP IN PRP$ NNP NNP JJ NN RB CC NNP NNP NN DT JJ NNP NNP DT VBD RP IN VBN TO VB WP NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT JJ DT PRP VBD VBD NN NNP NNP VBD VBG IN DT PRP VBD VBD PRP$ NN VBG IN DT NNP NNP POS NN VBD PRP TO VB DT NN CC JJ CD DT NN VBD RB IN JJ IN NNP NNP NN VBD JJ NN CC NNP IN EX NNP NNP PRP VBD IN DT NN NN DT NN VBD NNP CC NNP NNP PRP MD RB VB IN DT NN NN EX NN VBZ RB NNP NNP POS NN VBD NNP NNP TO VB JJ NN IN NNP IN PRP VBD VBG TO VB DT JJ IN DT JJ NNP NNP JJ JJ NNS VBD VBG IN NNP IN PRP VBD RB VB TO VB PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP IN DT NN PRP VBD RB JJR IN PRP$ CC NNP NN MD VB TO DT NN CC VB NN TO NNP NNP PRP VBD RP PRP MD VB IN NN NN PRP VBD NNP NNP PRP VBD RP JJ PRP MD VB DT NN CC NN DT NN	2		20131023111012	2362	1		20131023111051	2350	2		20131025131042	2402	2

One day he saw his wife tired from cleaning she fell asleep on the couch Mark was also tired of this so he went to the basement were he was building Festus a robot that would help his wife and their children.       He stayed their all night trying to perfect Festus but when he was almost close the robot broke down.Mark was so mad he threw his wrench against the wall,''I was so close to finishing it, but it always breaks down!''He gathered all of Festus' pieces and put them all on the table.then he realized what the problem was,''The problem is the core I'm using to power him up, it's to weak his body breacks down.''So Mark kept using different cores rubies, wave stone, crystals, and quasi magic stones.Until he found a diamond and used it.Finally he had done it he created the first working robot ever.He was so excited he ran outside and started yelling,''I did it, I did it!''       Everyone just thought he was crazy until he brought out the robot and showed everyone.They just said,''oooooo,aaaaaaaaa,It's impossible.''Mark even showed them what Festus could do and how he was powered .The people were all impressed by Festus they all started yelling out prices Mark had to make Festus yell out so they would stop.''It's not for sale so put away your money I just made it so my wife won't have to work so hard at the house.''       They all started to protest until a huge limousine pulled up and a tall man in a black  suit walked out.''So your the one everyone is talking about, Mark Robinson is tour name right.''Everyone was quiet until Mark spoke''Yes that is my name, who are you.''''I am Mr. Million and I am here because I heard that someone managed to make a robot and I also came here so that person could be hired.''Everyone was shocked to here the news, but Mark just stayed normal and calm''Well I'm the one who made it so you're looking for me.''''well I'm giving you an opportunity to join my company.''Nobody moved'' I'm sorry but I'd prefer to work by myself in my study to make more robots.'' Silence filled the air and everyone held their breath''If that is what you wish alright , but this offer has closed.''        Everyone left after the limousine vanished nobody asked again for Festus ,but Mark did keep making robots and soon he made a huge factory of working robots all over the world that he became a millionare for selling robots.He kept some robots for his wife and some for the children. The world and the city became a better place for everyone everywhere.

Anyways, four friends and i decided to make a fake robot just for fun. When we were all done the robot looked like it was a real human because it had arms and legs just like a human. We all thought it was a good idea to name the robot Norm. One of my friends, Jenny, wanted to see if it could actually work, but we told her it would never work, but she tried it anyways.          The next day we went back to the place where we left the robot, but it was gone! We thought someone must have stole it.We all checked everywhere we could then we heard a loud thud. It was so loud New Jersey could've herd it. we all went to check what it was. When we got there Norm was running around breaking things.            We were all shocked that it could really move and run, but we were also scared because he broke a car in half! Then we went towards it and told Norm that we weren't gonna hurt him, but the real problem was what is he hurt us. we took him to the park and told him that breaking things and harming people was bad. So since we created him he listened to us,but he was still destroying things a little bit. So we took him to a training school for people,but no one notice he was a robot.            So now Norm, the robot, is helping everyone who needs it, and it got destroyed because he was going to save a kid out of a lake, but he was a robot. we can make another one we all thought.

Some parts of the story are not real.          Robots have many jobs. They can save lives, dance, sing, climb and rescue people, and work.They will be more things they can do in the future but, now let's think about robots in the present time.If I had a robot it will be named M123-M26M and it will be a karaoke machine/toaster. It will have purple eyes, a red body, and blue feet. With stripes on it.It will be a girl and it will be my buddy.But unfortunately, I don't think there is a robot that can do that ,instead I would have one of these.Theses are the robots I dreamt of coming alive and all of them are real! I thought it would be perfect for writing an essay.           They are lots of robots in the world that are designed to save lives. One of them is a robot named Mr. Gower can do many things like carry important things, talk, and can pull five thousand pounds. Mr.Gower's main job is saving people's lives .Mr.Gower saves lives by bring the right medicine to them. Mr.Gower's job is hard for people like us because you might bring the wrong medicine and kill the person who needs it.You also need to know what the person is allergic to because if they are highly allergic to peanuts and the medicine to give has peanuts in it. That would be a big problem. Mr.Gower is still saving lives and let's respect him for that even if he is a robot!            Another robot that is helpful is Dante 2. Dante 2 has an interesting job. His job is to climb into volcanoes to gather information to give to scientists.Dante 2 has eight legs that are helpful for climbing.Dante 2 is built to survive in high heat. Dante 2 looks for vents and holes, in a crater. Dante 2 then collects the information about what kind of gases come out of them.       Who can forget about the fruit picking Agribots! Agribots are robots that pick fruit. They pick berries, oranges, apples, and grapes.Lot's of people don't use Agribots because they are not world wide use yet.On the other hand, farmers are very interested on the skills that they have. If a plant is too dry a Agribot will water it. Agribots are a good farming robots.             Some robots play with others.There is one robot called Robbie. Robbie is a babysitter who takes care children whose parents don't have time to play. Robbie always has time to play.Robbie is an endless fun machinery.               There are also dancing and singing robots too! They can move and groove to the rhythm. The finest  move and groove is HRP-4c who can sing and dance! If there is any birthday party around the block HRP-4c is the right robot. HRP-4c might also like performing on stages without having to worry about getting nervous because he is a robot and robots are special!            Gemimi -Scout is a robot that is remote-controlled and does a search and rescue work in mines under the ground. It can go up and down the stairs.Wherever it goes. it collects information.Gemimi-Scout is an easy built robot. It is small but,very strong.It can carry food, water , and other supplies.              Robots always help and always will help people no matter what. I have showed you couple of example of real robots around the world. Those are just a couple there thousands of robots helping today! Even if their definition of helping is fruit picking, saving lives, researching , or even dancing and singing! I wonder which one I should choose .                       Mr.Gower : Life saving robot. Agribots: Fruit picking robot. HRP-4c:Dancing and singing robot. Gemimi-Scout: Collecting information and carry supplies. Robbie:Babysitting robot.   Dante 2:Collects information and goes into volcanoes for scientists.                 That's easy all of them!       By:Mahima                   'Did you like it Mrs.Marine'said Mahima           'Wonderful A plus that's what you get for writing an awesome story' said Mrs.Marine        'Thank you' said Mahima           19 YEARS LATER: Mahima became an award winning author about science fiction. she wrote many books.What made Mahima write books? That's easy when she was in 6th grade her teacher,Mrs.Marine told her to write an essay about robots. Mahima did so good she decided to become an author.

It all started in first period at Northwood Middle School. I was just talking to my friends when all of a sudden, we heard a big crash. Then I heard my principal, Mr. Griffin on the speaker saying, 'get down something strange is happening to all of our technology and sparks are flying everywhere.' Thats when we saw it, the computer sprouted legs and started walking around like it was just a regular sunny day. Then a strange voice came out of him saying, 'hello, my name is Brother Of Blame. You can call me B.O.B or Bob for short.'  I heard the voice of my friend Linda in the back of the room. She was a nice, smart and short girl with a lot of bravery. She said, ' why have you come alive all of a sudden.' Bob answered, ' I am here to serve as a friend to all and help the people in need. I have found out about all the bad things goung on in the world and something in the air changed that made me alive.' Now i was starting to get a little more curious and I could tell I wasn't the only one because my friend Brooklyn asked the next question and the most wierd one of all. ' Will you ever grow hair, or will you always be bald?' Bob was so stunned by the question that it felt like a million years had gone by before he finally answered. ' I will never grow hair because I am a piece of tecnology and can not grow hair.' Then we spent the rest of the class asking questions to the extremly weird creature.                That afternoon everyone had heard about Bob, although most of the things they said were just rumors that weren't actually true. During lunch he was all everyone wanted to talk about or be with so I was a little surprised when he sat down next to me.

Some are for dangorus missions and others are to just entertain but all this is a great advancement in science knowlage.              Some robots are made to go into volcanos or rescue people. These robots are made with special quailities to perform their task. One of the amazing robots is Gemini-Scout. He rescues people and can carry them to safety. He also carries food, water and other supplies to help as well. Other robots collect information in places human can not do to. Dante 2 goes in volcanoes to collect information that we would not know about if it wasn't for these robots.       Other robots help with jobs. Agribots can pick fruit and Mr. Gower can deliver medicine. They both are equiped with things needed to perform their tasks. Talking, steering, and long arms are some of them.       Robots are wonderful things they can help us in many ways and soon thwy will be a much bigger part of our everyday lives.

While Joanna was informing us about her trip to the beach, Riley pointed off to the distance with his mouth wide-open. 'W-w-what is t-t-that?!' Joanna was silent and turned to look. Instantly her mouth dropped wide-open, too. Wondering what this was about, I decided to look, too. The thing we saw, whatever it was, had definitely not roamed Sunny Park before.        The three of us ran over to the slide, where a giant toaster oven was sliding down. Anna was right beside the slide pacing back and forth, worried. 'Anna, what happened?' I asked. She shook her head. 'I was at home, and I was hungry. My mom said that I needed to make my own breakfast. So I did. I put two Pop-tarts in the toaster oven.. and that's where things went wrong.'        'I accidentally put the two in the same slot. My mom left to go to the grocery store and my dad was in bed. Right when the toaster oven make its noise, the toaster oven came to life! It clanked down onto the tile in the kitchen and waltzed right out the door. I was scared to tell my dad so I chased after it. You know, it can go extremely fast.' 'What are we going to do to stop it?' Riley asked. Joanna's face sparked with excitement. 'I think I know,' she exclaimed.        Joanna climbed up the ladder to the top, where the robot toaster oven was. 'Come here,' she softly whispered. 'It's gonna be okay.' The toaster oven screeched and slid down the slide, all the way to the bottom.. where it's owner just happened to be. 'I WANT MY POP-TART BACK!!!' yelled Anna. 'Quick!' I yelled. 'Hurry!' She quickly yanked the two Pop-tarts out of the toaster oven. It malfunctioned for a minute and then shut down.        'Thanks, guys. I was really scared. How was I supposed to explain to my dad why my toaster oven ran out of the house?!' Anna returned to her house, and in the future, was cautionary not to put the Pop-tarts in the same slot ever again.

By:Brent Webb              Have you ever wondered what woul happen if you had a robot that came to life well probably not me until I came upon it one day.              It was a warm summer day when we went to the old antique shop to buy us  very nice trash can. When we went in we saw a very shiney looking trash can,but we got a good look at it and noticed that it wasn't even a trash can it was a robot! Tom,Jammie, and me Brady all had the same idea that we now have a awesome trash can-bot.            Next we went home to test out what this old peice of junk so I threw a peice of trash at it and it grabed it and trew it in the garbage bag. I said,'WOW! that is amazing.!' Tom said ,'BIG DEAL,' so he threw a baseball at it and before I could stop him it deflected the ball and hit it back at Tom giving him a black-eye. Tom said,'OWWWWWWW!' and ran to the kitchen for an ice-pack.                              	NNP NNP . . .

He had been in the St. Louis hospital for five hours now because of an incident in which he broke his leg. He had to stay for a whole night in the hospital, and he couldn't even get out of bed. The doctors were very busy, and he would have to wait a while to get a cast. After an hour, a nurse came in to give him pain killers for his leg. At her side was a small robot. 'Who's this?', John said, indicating the robot. Instead of the nurse replying, the robot said, 'I am Mr. Gower, I help in the hospital.' The nurse then opened the drawers on Mr. Gower's body and took out some medicine. Once he had got it, the doctor came in and got ready to put on the cast. 'Just relax, this won't hurt much at all.' the nurse said. The doctor got scissors from Mr. Gower and began. after a half hour, he was done and John was feeling better. Then, Mr. Gower came up and said, 'We are done now, are you better?'.'Yes, thanks for asking.' John replied. The next day, after a restless sleep, John left the hospital. Before he left, Mr. Gower said'Goodbye I'll miss you.'

The boss ordered us to make a robot that we could send to space to learn more about our atmosphere. I has always been fascinated wit the robot and one day while I was taking some samples to another room I accidentally jostled the machine. When I turned around to check on it it started to vibrate. I put my hands on it to see if it was warm and it shot into the air through the skylight taking me with it! As we shot through the air I remembered that we had built a small compartment inside the robot for the boss to go up to space in. I quickly scrambled to open the door and get inside. It was a lot more relaxing inside the capsule (if you could say that) and pretty soon I fell asleep.   When I woke up i was in a strange hut. it looked like it was made of reddish mud and had a domed roof. Just as I was about to get up the door opened and in stepped the robot! ''Your refreshments are here Sir,'' he said in a metallic voice. He handed me a bottle of some fizzy stuff that when I drank tasted like soda pop. Then, right before my eyes he changed into a sort of spaceman! He had turned into a human! As I sat there in awe I decided that I ought to say something. 'What is your name?, I questioned. ''Kubli'', he answered. Did you make this hut? Yes. ''I will show you what I've made'', he said. As I followed him outside I recognized that we were on Mars. We went a little ways and I saw that Kubli had cleared away a landing pad and on it was a spaceship!   Later that day we were soaring in Kubli's spaceship toward home. I can't wait to see the look on my bosses face when we tell him our adventures!

Me and my sister were sitting on the couch and we herd a loud nose coming from the attic the robot was a zombie robot. So I went up stairs to check it out. I think that was the worst idea I'd ever had.I opened the attic door and went up.                  At first i did not see anything but then i saw the red glowing eyes. They looked liked the devils eyes. Then it started to get up I thought to myself that thing has been of of battery for ever and it never had glowing eyes that were red. I shut the door and thought what i was going to do. I did not want to tell my sister because she would flip.But that did not last long a axe came flying through the door. This thing was dangerous very dangerous.                   I had to think of something fast really fast. I was thinking of something when it poped in to my head. Of cores he is plastic i will use fire to burn him so I ran into the kitchen were my mom keeps all of the matches. When i ran around the corner there were the eyes the red devil eyes. I lit the mach and watch him burn to the ground.

As he was slowly being packed to go to a scientist in Hollywood, California he thought his life had been perfect, he didn't want to go he wanted to fight but he couldn't move. He thought about the beautiful answering machine always giving him compliments. 'There goes ronald.' A security gaurd yelled to the other scientists. Ronald was getting shook like wild and couldn't stand it, finally though he was put in the airplane. As ronald listened to the rumble of the engine he knew it was gonna be a long, very long trip.           When the plane finally landed Ronald was worried if the the scientist would be nice, for all the people at the other lab would spoil him. 'CRACK!' Ronald was face to face with the new scientist, his box wasn't there only underneath his plastic feet was the wood from the box. Ronald knew he fell asleep and the box woke him up but he slept through the whole car ride. As Dr. Theorat (or so his nametag said) picked Ronald up and brought him into his lab,ronald was fighting, or he wanted to. Ronald got put on his desk so he could watch Dr.Theorat while he was mixing alixers, potions, and foods into a big bowl. When Dr. Theorat was done mixing the stuff he sucked some into a turkey baster then went to Ronald and said 'Hello my friend are you ready for something exiting?' just as he said that he dumped the turkey baster liquid on Ronalds head. Ronald felt a tingle then in the flash of an eye Ronald could.           Ronald shook his arms, did he? He shook his head, he was soaked, did he? Dr. Theorat chuckled then said 'He He, silly robot now that potion made you able to do any thing a human can do, I have been working on it for 13 years and now it works!' Ronald ran then yelled 'YAHOO! I've been wanting some independance!' Ronald and Dr. Theorat were now the best of friends and lived the rest of their lives that way         	NNP DT NNP VBD DT JJ NN NN CC PRP VBD RB VB IN NN MD VB NN NNP NNP PRP VBD RB VBG VBN TO VB TO DT NN IN NNP , NNP PRP VBD PRP$ NN VBD VBN JJ , PRP VBD RB VB TO VB PRP VBD TO NN CC PRP MD RB NNP NNP VBD IN DT JJ NN NN RB VBG PRP NNP JJ NNS NNP POS DT NN NN VBD TO DT JJ NNP NNP VBD VBG NN IN NN CC MD RB VB PRP , RB IN PRP VBD VBN RP DT NNP NNP NN VBD TO DT JJ IN DT NN PRP VBD PRP VBD JJ NN VB DT JJ , RB RB NNP NNP DT NN RB VBD NNP VBD VBN IN DT DT NN MD VB JJ , IN PDT DT NNS IN DT JJ NN MD VB NNP NNP .

On top of the hill there was a tall dark brown oak tree, that had somrthing under it, something that you cannot imagine. Behind this one tree, there is a horizon, in the front there was a silutee of the tree. Nobody ever knew why it was so scary.                     There was two sisters Stephannie and Alyssa who lived in the country, to the far right of this hill. One sunday morning, they discided to go to find artifacts, for a project, so they went to the hill. They came across the tree at about 2:00 pm, they noticed a tree, Stephannie thought just by looking there was a story told in the history of this tree. 'Should we dig here.' Shephannie asked. Alyssa who was only 13, looked nervously at the tree like she saw a vision. 'We should go somwhere else.' 'No, we have to do this project, I dont want to get held back, for not doing this project.' 'B-B-B-ut I-I dont want to!' Alyssa stuttered. 'Well this a dicision you're gonna have to make.                    The sisters have already started digging, Alyssa starts sweating from all of the hard work, and she is really nervous what she will dig up. 'Stephannie all I am finding is roots, when can we go home.' 'In ten minutes we will have a break, okay.' 'Okay.' 'Wait a second I see somthing!' 'Really what is it!' 'I dont know its big, shaped like a square, and its silver!' Suddenly Stephannie grabs it out of the ground it was exactly hoe she didcribed it.'What is it.' 'Well by looking at its shape I would say its a robot.' 'A robot!' Alyssa suddenly feels this erge to faint, as her face is as white as the snow. Then, the book that Alyssa brought with her turns to a certain page, 537. Stephannie looks at her watch it is 5:37pm the same number as the page in the book. 'Oh my God!' The robot starts making noises, and it was speaking perfect Engilsh to the girls.'Hello. I am 360-456' Oh my god, it spoke to me!' 'Wow! We have got to tae this to school.' 'But mom and dad will freak out!' 'Mom and dad are at a bussiness trip in Flordia. They wont know.'                  The girls brought the robot home, because the robot was old, and small they called it short circut. Alyssa could not go to sleep all night, with the robot staring at her. The robot got the girls an A. Alyssa got to the habit of the robot, but culd not get over it at night still, she the robot do some stuff while she was at school. Stephannie on the other hand, used the robot to take care of her, to feed them, because they're parents were gone. A few days later, Alyssa got a call from they're mom and dad saying that theywould be back the next day. 'Stephannie! Stephannie! That was mom and dad they're gonna be home tomarrow! We have got to get rid of that robot.''I guess so. But how they're gonna be here in 13 hours. We cant bury this robot now, we daont have much time.'The girls got out to the hill to bury it, they had to rush it was almost time for they're parents to get   there.                  Finally, the girls burried the strange robot, they suddenly realized that they were not gonna do anything like that when they're parents.'We could've told my parents and kept it until, they told us to.' ' Yeah, but just dont do that again.'

There once was a mad scientist,it was the year or 1823 and the sky's were gray and gloomy. The scientist did not speak English,he was German. Since he could not communicate with anyone,he was lonely.As the day went by he was often found looking out of his window for a friend to talk to.But no one showed up. To be honest, the real reason that he was lonely was that everybody in town was afraid of him. The mad scientist had a lot of experiments that he was working on in his basement. There was talk in the town about witchcraft. He truly had enough of it! The mad scientist decided he was going to make a friend who would be able to talk with him, to laugh, and to share memories with him.       The mad scientist went about his house looking for things that he wanted to do with this robot and for characteristics that he enjoyed. He first searched in the kitchen. There was a deck of cards laying on the wooden table that he brought with him from Germany. He absolutely loved cards. The scientist searched in the cupboard he found a wooden stirring spoon. He also loved to cook. He then went to the living room he found his favorite TV show, Myth Busters. The scientist traveled up the tall stairway,up to his bedroom. He gathered a pile of pictures of him and his family.       The mad scientist picked up the pictures and began walking downstairs. He traveled from room to room gathering his items up.After he got everything he went into his basement. He layed everything on the table,and began working. Twisting,bolting,screwing,tightening up every little piece of his friend so he would be perfect.Time past the night grew darker and the scientist fell asleep.       In the morning the scientist awoke from the sound of card deck being shuffled. He looked up and there his friend was! The scientist sprung out of his old chair and said ''hello.'' The robot looked up with the brightest smile on his face and said ''hi want to play cards with me?'' To the scientists surprise the robot knew how to speak German!       They were both so excited that they finally had some one they could call a friend! For the rest of the day they played cards and watched Myth Busters. 	DT NNP .

He had owners who loved him very much (just because he was cool and was worth A LOT of money). He had Jetpack legs and feet, he was yellow, he could eat the kids' food secretly so they would not get in trouble, he did all of the chores, he put the babies to sleep in a matter of seconds, and he could run to the grocery store and buy anything that you needed in 1 minute. But one day he ' Broke Down' His owners were so mad, they broght him to a real hospital without thinking. The doctor laughed and said: 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME? He is a robot, not a human.' 'We know, said the owners, But he is very sick and we need him for- the doctor cut the owner off. 'I think i know what the problem is. Come with me.' 'Thank you.' said the owners together. The doctor then said, 'All he needs is a little oil, I can fix him in no time.' 'A little bit of oil a little?' 'Yes, just a little, said the doctor, But it will be quite a price, for him being a robot.' 'We will pay anything to get him fixxed for the- ' What was that?' 'Nevermind.' 'Hmmmm.' said the doctor. 'what! said the owner, is he OK?' 'Yes, but I don't think he needs oil at all.' 'What does he need then.'   'Oh, well umm, I am not really sure how to put htis but um, we, I mean, I don't think he is going to make it.'   'What do you mean?!'  'Well, how old is he?'  '21, why? Is he going to be ok? Why do you need to know how old he is?!!' The owner started to cry. ' If he is 21 years old, his life is complete. I'm sorry.' The doctor then left the room. ' how are we going to make money for the family if he is gone?' ' I don't know.'  'Well, think of something!'  'Stop it, we can always get another robot.'  'No, it just won't be the same.' That owner walked away. Nobody knows where she went, she was gone forever.

Chris said to himself. He plugged the plugs together and.........nothing happen. 'I spent all this time making a robot that doesn't WORK!!!' Chris yelled. He went downstairs to go tell his mom and dad. 'IT DOESN'T WORK I TELL YOU!! I tried millions of times!' Chris cried. 'Its OK Chris your Father can help you.'OK, dad, it has a brownish grayish color to it! It also has a old looking shelf in its tummy.'Chris explained in a hurry. 'OK Chris!' Chris's father said.                They went upstairs and it wasn't there. 'My Robot!' Chris said ' My Window!' his dad said. They looked for it non stop then the heard a knock on the door. 'Hello can I help......Aw!!!! You are so cute!! Chris! Is this your robot?!' his mom yelled. ' What! That's my robot! Thanks mom it works now.' Chris happily said. Then once he got older he used his new robot for helping in hospitals. It was a happy ending for everyone!                                                                   The End!

Very big with jets, wheels, legs, wings, slime, or hovering? Well, your little robot will come out of your dreams and come to life. You just need to imagine it coming and being curious about robots and technology for instance:             If I were to have a robot come to life it would be like this: It will have four wheels with jets, a camera, mini radio, lots of strength, takes energy from the sun, is red and black striped.             I had this dream, until it happened... I got a letter in the mail saying that they needed a design for a robot so they can mail in a blue print to build it, That gave me an idea. So I got to it, I wrote my dream robot design and mailed it to the company.       (1 month later)             I had forgotten all about me mailing the design to the company until I checked the mail box and saw a big envelope, I said, 'what's this?!' it had said, 'thank you for your help, here is $1,000 for making the blueprint a big hit!!!' Then inside was the 1,000 dollars and a free blueprint of how to build the robot, then I remembered, I sent the design to this company 1 month ago!       So I had gotten to work at building my robot. First, I had to get the materials, Second, was to follow every step, 1-103. Once I was done, I took a picture of it and I and I sent it to the whole city!       So remember me and then you can make a robot of your dreams and stick to it don't just throw away the idea.

He was 17, had his drivers license and he was a good driver. He drove smart and safe. Also though he bought a Google robot just in case he had to take a nap he would let the Google robot built in the car take over. Today the Google robot saved his life.                 One day James was on his normal day driving back home from school. Today it was a very early rush hour so there were a lot of drivers driving at the time James was trying to get home. James lived with his parents about 30 minutes away from his school.                 James was very tired that day when it was a Monday, but James was a stubborn person and kept on driving. 'Ugh I am so tired,' James said as he drove down the road. Soon he dozed off.                 Then the Google robot sensed that James was sleeping as it was a green light and his hands wasn't on the wheels and his feet weren't on the pedals. The Google robot took over the car seeing that James had his navigating system set to take him home the Google robot did exactly that. The Google robot stopped at red lights, went at the right speeds, and drove how a good driver would.                When the Google robot got home and stopped the car, James woke up. 'Whoa! What! Where am I?' James shouted in a puzzled way. After James got his hold of his senses he figured out that he was in his garage, the engine was off, the car was in the condition it was before he took the car out. He wasn't aware that the Google robot saved his life, but he was thankful that he was in the garage after he dozed to sleep on the road.                 When the week ended James took a look at his car trying to think of anything that could've gotten him home at that day when he dozed off. Thats when he finally remembered when he bought the car he also bought a Google Robot also. 'Well!' James said 'I finally figured that out and I am thankful that I am home right now!'

She was to make a mini version of a robot that would be in every house to take care of people that she thinks will look like in the future. Well, that very night when she put this red cord to this blue cord a little shock happened and the robot started to say 'Hello my name is Bob whats yours?'. Meg freaked out and called her mom to come see. Her mom said' Meggie that is such an adorable robot you got there.' Meg answers 'don't call me that and look my robot can talk! ' Oh that's wonderful you will  get an A on your assignment!'                  The next day Meg went to the library to read about robots and how they could be made. She found that some robots can climb volcanoes to gather information for scientist that cant stand the hot arid heat. This robot is called Dante 2. Meg knew her robot would not fit with that information,  Because her robot almost set on fire by the stove that was on. Meg went to a different book she found a robot that can work in hospitals by helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. This robot looked like a small cabinet on wheels its name is Mr.Gower. Then Meg saw it her robot was a Mr.Grower robot.Because on time she wanted milk and her little robot dragged a gallon of milk by her. Meg was surprised but ignored it till now.                   When Meg got home from the library she told her mom that she was going to change her robot a little and, not to come up stairs while she doing it. Meg made the robot a little bigger so it can carry stuff and not to drag it and then she put a voice control box in it so someone can give it demands. Later that day Meg to her mom to come up stairs. When her mom got to her room her mouth dropped and said 'what the heck did you do to your robot!' 'Its beautiful!' she continued. Meg told the robot to go get a cup of coffee for her mom and coke for her the robot quickly but gently and went and completed her tasked.                       The  next few weeks she had her robot do her chores and clean her room. But one day when meg told the robot to go and get her mom some chips then the robot started to yell out '123567492309757566 bye' and flew out the window and exploded in the sky. She yelled that her robot exploded her mom said it was the time anyway. Meg is trying to make a new one but every time she fails.

The radio kept turning on and off on it's own.The car kept leaking whenever I filled up the gas.It got scary one night while I was sleeping the robot car made a bunch of noises so I went to the garage to see what was happening it was alive i screamed!'Wwwwhattt iss haaapppening' I stuttered. 'ahhhh!'the car screamed.'You can talk!' I said while freaking out.'I'm alive!!!!!!!!!!!' I thought i was dreaming but when I woke up I heard the robot say,'good moring .' So just pretended to think the car was a person but unfortunetly it did not work.           Later  the robot approached me and when I was going to the store and he said 'want a ride ' and I replied 'sure??' After coming back from the store i went to bed and when i woke upo it was my bitrhday and my parents got me a car and i said to the car 'oh not again!!!!'

We kept hearing banging noises from the closet. So our instructor decided we should cheak out whats in there. When we went in there we found the robot we made as a group five months ago.               'wow!' we exclamied our robot was dancing and jumping just like we designed it to do! We thought it would never do what we wanted so we gave up. I guess that wasn't such a good idea to keep it in the closet and give up.                So we decided to make a new robot and the one we had already had would work together with the new one. So as we worked on the new one we were starting to build we used websites to help us. But then i thought 'Hey guys we need a name for it!' We all decided on a name for the new robot to be named Fish. It would be able to fly and swiim. It would be able to fly 80 mph. and swim a 500 free style in  one minute and fivty six seconds it will be extrodanary!                 Once it was made we couldnt believe how cool and different it was to any other robot. It could do everything we wanted it to do, it was amazing. Our class had a good time learning about it and creating it we hope we could do it again.

He was used to play games such as dance and play catch much like the robot HRP-4c which was a robot of 2013 nearly 200 years ago, but technology has come a long way since then.                                Mega tron also has a special power when the city needs him he goes from a normal robot to a giant machine and helps protect his people from the recent invaders from mars, but there was something that not even Mega tron could enticipate.                        'CRACK'  the normal blue sky opend up and turned a redish black and a giant space ship appered opening the sky and then closing it back up so the people of New York City could not escape. Their only hope was to have the 18 mega trons defend the 13,000 marshens the numbers were looking bad but the mega trons all formed into one  Mega tron which was twice the size of the empire state building! One by one the Mega trons were taking the marshons apart they felt it was to easy after there was only 1,000 left.                  The suprise came 100,000 more marshons droped from the sky. All the Mega Trons were super tired and couldn't fight much more but they could just her the terriours cries from their children so they all seperated back to 18 diffrent units and split into groups again each one taking each marshon just demolishing them but then almost a quarter of the way there they lost 10 units in the battle which got them really angry and they started to keep it going half way through they didnt loose another unit, but it didnt matter how much they didnt want to give up they just were to fatiuged, so they called in their main stash of Mega trons from D.C and were almost unbeatable they saved New York City and the dead robots were repaird and as good as new!!!!!!!!!!

It took about three weeks to finish making the robot.I equipped him to help people who need things to be carried and he collects information for scientists.Jeff can talk too.He can transform into a car.I am really proud what I just made.           For the next month my robot and I have been having alot of fun together.He's helped me with getting through tough times and he's my friend.We go to watch sports together.       He serves me like he goes to me a can of soda,he takes the blame for something I did.He helps me with my homework and cleans my room for me.He even cleans the house. I hope I can keep him forever.           When I woke up one sunny morning I went to check on him when I saw he was gone.Later I went to look for the robot in the town.I found him,but he was doing some strange things like riding on roller coasters,working as an employee,and dressing up like a real person.       I was speechless.I asked him why did you run away and he said 'I want to be robot who can do what he wants to do'.           'I want to play sports and go watch sports with my robot friends.''I want to feel the thrill of being treated like a real person and I don't want to be kinda like a servant for you.'                     I understoood that he needs to be a person and live free instead of being controlled by me.So,I said'You can be leave and be a free robot'.       The robot felt a thrill in him so he said 'goodbye' and left to a place with other robots to make friends with and potentially find a wife.The robot was really famous in robot land he was a proffesinal basketball player.       This place he was going to was called robot land.They kept in touch sometimes he came over to my house.We will always be best friends.

It was cleaning my room and doing my homework and all types of stuff! At first I thought I was dreaming but then it hit me, really it hit me and it hurt. It was so cool it looked just like a normal person but with metal plates on it, it was red and blue and it was wearing some of my clothes.           I did not want to tell anyone because they'd think I'm CRAZY! I kept him in my closet for a day. At night it beeps like crazy it wont let me go to sleep, so  shut him off with a switch he had on his back. The next morning he woke me up at 6:00 am and he tied me on a wagon and it went for a walk which for normal people it's a sprint! he was going 80 miles a minute! it almost blew my hair away! When we got home I had some bruises from falling off so much. We had great times together he was my BEST FRIEND!  But a couple of weeks later I heard a BOOM from my room when I walked in, he was blown up. 	NN `` '' PRP VBP DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBD RP RB TO VB WP NNP PRP VBD PRP$ NN NN NNP .

So later that night they went to go open the box and there was a small little robot the robot had came with a note and it had said that its name was MEGATRON it was a cute robot but it had to stay outside.so when her parent had fallen asleep so april went outside.april was looking at the tiny robot and saw a power button so she pressed it i mean like of course who would not turn on a robot, but any ways it turned on and and it had the most tiny sounding voice EVERso when it started to talk april lost it she suddenly started screaming and she was screaming very loud .soon her parents came outside and was like OMG and they started running around screaming also  so finally they gottired and said what are you and it said to them in the tiniest voice ever hi i'm MEGATRON:).             They brung it into the house and cleaned it ,why because it was dirty duh .so in the moring they went to the store and bought some paint and told april she could decorate the robot. so she did she painted her robot hot pink with purole and blue flowers , and hearts on her robot. soon she finished and let her parents look at it and they said it is a boy oh it is ooooooooppppppsss:).

Even though they seemed like an impossible story, today they are helping us in many ways. Two ways that robots help us today are they carry matierials such as medicine, water, and food at many different places. They also help with geography by studying volcanoes, planets, etc. As you can see robots are a major item in our world now and forever until they find something else.        An example for a robot that can transport matierials to many places would be Mr.Gowser, a shelf-like robot that travels through hospitals giving doctors, nurses, surgeons, etc. medicine and tools. Some robots can do this and more. Like the Gemini-Scout, who travels through mines with food and water, and also can check the air for gasses and tells the miners if its safe to go into somewhere.        There are also robots that help with geography and science: i.e., a robot named Dante 2 can climb up volcanoes and go into them withstanding the heat. Before scientists couldn't study volcanoes, but now if they can't go in, then they send Dante 2 or any other robot.        There are many robots that help in the world today, but these are just a few. There are many others that do many other jobs. And some are yet to come. 	NNS VBP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

On Saturday March 17,2012 there was a girl named Jessica.Jessica joined a science fair at her school.She wasn't ver shure what to do for the science fair.Then she came up with a smart idea.Jessica dicited to build a robot.She was up day and night trying to make a robot.Jessica was going to take a brake from building a robot till she saw the date.Jessica said to herself today is March 21 and the science fair is in March 23.Jessica rushed to the garage. till she finally finished,Jessica made the robot so it can walk,talk,and tought it to be helpful.Jessica made it talk by putting a speaker inside of the robot.She said all the words she can think of,then she said hopefully it talks back in a correct sentence.So Jessica said ''hello robot''.Jessica thought it wasn't going to work until the robot said hello whats your name,Jessica smiled and said im going to name you Junior.She said by the way my name is Jessica.Then ever scince that day Jessica and Junio have been best friends.Then the science fair came.Jessica and Junior left.They went to the fair and Junior and Jessica won the science fair.                                            Ever scince the day Jessica build Junior shes been thinking what can i do for Junior to make him helpful.Till she talks to Junior very nice and he nows how to react with other people they have been thinking he has a brain like us humans so they Jessica said you should come with me to school so you can help teachers and students.                                                               Jessica said you are so smart and i think you need to get a job.Junior said i could but I dont think they would acsept someone like me.Jessica said no trust me your just like one of us humans.they went to go looking for a job untill Junior found one.He went to go ask for a aplication in the beach as a lifegard. The next week they called him and said you got the job.He said i got a job but i have no car. so him and Jessica walked to get a car so Junior can go and cone back from work. Then that means they will no longer walk anywhere because they bought a car.

So I got a text from Samantha saying have you figured out of what your going to do for the science fair that is coming up. I said yes, I do im going to make three robots. Samantha texted me back what are you going to name the three robots I said i would name the first one Wiz Khalifa, the second Drake, the third Arturo.                                      So I started to work on my three robots . the first one that i finished was   Wiz Khalifa . Then the second Drake it was kind of alot of hard work to do each one took and hour and a half. So for the last one Samantha had came over to bulid it, like they all say that team work is faster. It actually was true. So anyways after that I rested for the rest of the day Because the next day was school and the day after is the science fair.                        Its 6:00 in the morning I wake up, get ready and go to school. During school I was thinking about the robots I created the day before. I was also thinking about the next day after that which was the science fair. So it was time to get off school and i came back to my house I had heard my phone ringing it was Samantha i answered and she said was I done with the robots i replied yes. she said im going come and check them out OK, I said for sure yeah. So as I waited for here to get there i hear a very loud noise in the kitchen i thought it was my dog.                                        I went into the kitchen and said Princess my dogs name. No one answered all off a sudden............ one of the robots which was Drake started singing 'started from the bottom'. And the other one which was Wiz Khalifa started singing 'black and yellow'. Those were the funny ones the one the creeped me out the most was Arturo. And that one just was saying a bunch of random things that creeped me out. So I decided to record the robots and post it on Youtube and it turned out to be a hit on the robots. So I took the robots to the Science fair and they got first place for the most talented robots just for them singing.........................I LOVE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;3                         	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP CD NNP NN PRP VBD VBN , RB PRP VBD IN WP NN IN NN TO VB IN DT NN NN WDT -NONE- RB PRP VBD DT NN IN NNP VBG VBP PRP VBN RP IN WP PRP$ VBG TO VB IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ VBG NNP NNP VBD NNS , PRP VBP PRP VBG TO VB CD NNP NNP VBD PRP RB WP VBP PRP VBG TO VB DT CD NNS PRP VBD PRP MD VB DT JJ CD NNP NNP , DT JJ NNP , DT JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD TO VB IN PRP$ CD NNS .

Wend I got there, I saw a robot but it did not move so I went to touch it. Before I got there the robot turn on. I was scare but it did not do anything so I stay there.                 I did not knew what to do because I was scare so I just watch him. Then out of nowhere he started talking. So I started to talk to him and I told him to show me some tricks or to just show me what could he do.Then he started to do cool things and then he told me that he could turn to anything he want but only in emergency. So I told him if he could turn to a car, plane, and boat, and if he wanted to safe people's life like a superhero. He said ''Yes'' to both questions.

He was working on a broken down Mr. Grover (a robot used in hospitals). When he came apon a peice if rusting metal on the head of the robot. Dr. Newton took out the peice of metal and noticed that Mr. Grover was moving without a command or anything. He was grabbing stuff Dr. Newton needed. The Dr. happened to have a dog in the the lab and Mr. Grover started to play with Dr. Newton's dog!       'Wow!' the Old Docter Mr. Grover had, exclamed, ' I can't believe you got him to work I thought he was forsure a gonner!' Dr. Newton said ' He not only is fixed but more improved than ever! He can go fetch stuf without a command. Also he will play with pets or people if they need company!' The Old Docter said ' How about we sell these new kind of robots to the public. They'll  love it!'       The next year both the Dr.'s had 200 robots made new and improved. They were in the market the next month. The people of the world loved the new robots, the Dr.'s were becoming rich. After a while the robots started developing a mind of their own. They were taking over the house that they lived in and the people were scared.       The Dr.'s, to fed up with their own glory, didn't even know this was happening. Then the robot that they had for 3 years now, developed a mind.       The Dr.'s found a way to reset the program so the robot will die. Then they told the public to do the same. It worked, but both Dr.'s got thrown in jail for it. 	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD IN PRP$ NN IN NNP NNP NNP VBD VBG IN DT NN RP NNP NNP NNP DT NN VBN IN NNS : .

I look back at the closet and it starts turning green all over on the outside. I am to afraid to touch the closet. I just thought it was a dream so i flicked myself in the head. I land on my bed in my room. But nothing changes......... I yell 'it's a alien'. But no one hears me. All of the sudden 'boom' this metal, thick, rough, kind of like are hits through the closet and behind the huge arm is a enormous robot. I had no clue how it fit in my closet. When i went a little close i saw that it had a little camera for the mines he goes and and tries to find the miners. And it also could be a dante 2 because it looks like it is strong enough to go up volcanoes. 'Help'!!!!!! i hear my brother scream i think in my head uh oh.             I quick run to his room and there is 2 robots surrounding him and he is standing on his bed yelling 'help' 'help'. Right then i knew the robots were Mr. Gower robots because they looked like a small cabinet on wheels. I quick tell my brother josh stop panicking and be calm and once he did that all the robots left even the ones in my room so we could all go back to sleep.              When i wake up i quick run to my brothers room and we just look at each other in awe because of what happended last night. Even though we were scared we learned some pretty cool stuff about robots.

The most high-tech robot on the face of the Earth. I could fly, swim, run, lift up thousands of pounds, talk like a normal human, never destroy Mr. Owner, and be obedient. Then my life changed because of one little girl. This is how I, The Billy Bob Joe Bot 3000, got my own brain.             On May 2, 2058, Mr. Owner brought his daughter, Angela, to work. School had bin cancelled for little Angela and since Mrs. Owner was ill ( no cure to asgriopreteous yet, sadly) Mr. Owner had to bring her.             At lunch, I was told to go to the charging room to, well..., charge.   But the little rascal Angela must have followed me. As I got set to charge, Angela said,' Biwwy Bob! Biwwy Bob! Wook at me!' Being used to her childish talk, looked over and saw was terrible. If I had had a heart and mind back then I would have had a heart attack. Angela was touching the Forbidden Box. It was a box I programed never to go near or touch. And here, a little four year old girl was yet to open a box, forbidden to a incredibly powerful robot?             Since I was programed not to go near it I said,' Dear Angela, please put the box down.' In reply she yanked the top of the box and threw it. Her toss was terrible, but I ran anyway. Right into the path of the box.             The box hit my side. Out of it slithered a black goo. It was spreading all over me and when I tried to take it off, it just stuck to my hands.             When it finally over took over I felt.... different. Like I could control myself. And  most of all I had a sensation to protect Angela. Be her friend. I knew Mr. Ex-Owner would be super mad at me. But now I had a new owner. I had my own mind and could disobey, but I had to do what was best for her. That was my knew prograning.My knew owner is .............................. ANGELA.

Ealrer that week Wills toy robot BU-ford had come a live. Even though it is ''state of the art'' it was rather clumsy. BU-ford could hardly walk without tripping, muchless run.          BU-ford was trying to be more helpful ,but that really didn't happen.He was trying to make a sandwich for himself (because he had come alive) he needed food.          Will came walking briskly in from the dining room where he had been doing homework. he saw on of his mothers favorite piece of china on the floor, smashed to pieces.          ''BU-ford, don't use the fine china to make a sandwich.'' will said in a complantiant voice.the robots ''face'' became downish and gluum.          '' Yes master Will''.          Will relised he had become mean and shnubish to the robot friend,''Its fine I'll clean it up.'' Will said.thats when he locked on the counter... jam,  strawberrys, peanutbuter and chocolate litered it. will gave a sigh   .      God this robot couldn't be more of a buredin, Will thought. Will ceaned the kitchen the beast he could. then huried off to bed          Early that morning BU-ford was awake trying to ponder what had happnd the night before. What shall I do. I can't do much. He thought   then he ha an idea. a light bulb literly turned on in his head. he did a maniachal laugh and rubbed his hands saying ''MUWUHHAHMUWUHA!''           Will came down stairs sying dased '' What was that racket?''           ''Nothing'' came the repliy.           Will was off to school the one place he thought he could get away from the robot of clumsyness. boy was he wrong.          The first hour was mathmatics he walke in and there in the middle of the room was it the robot. Will was supprised how well he had made friends then he rellised what he was talking about, this is what he heard...            ''I was walking up a active valcano, (too dangerous for humans) to studie it'' he paused for emphasis,'' Boom! It blw up in me face. I got out of there. Next i worked in a hospitale in Guato  takin medicen to pacients an doctors. But my favorite job was being a shofure. I got to drive so many cars. Hey, Will, get over here'' he gestured.             Will picked him self up, and strolled over. I am happy that he  made friends. And it was true he was happy.                     	JJ NN .

It can be used to get information because it is so small and extremely hard to see. Most robots are used to help people with work or just to make things easier and some are made for bad purposes, but the Bug-Assassin can be used for any thing anybody wants whether good or bad.            All you would have to do is pay the robot $1000 but he only accepts gold. And then you give him a task and no matter what it will get done. Another good reason why he is helpful is because he is only 1 inch long so he can squeeze in anywhere you want to, and he is smarter than any other robot ever made. He mainly is used to get codes or to copy work from opponents, but in any way the Bug-Assassin is a huge help!

He unwrapped the paper and was amazed at what he saw. It was a toy robot! He was filled with joy and ran up to his room to play with it. That night Billy went to bed and fell asleep. A few hours later, Billy started to hear noises and got a little scared. He hid under the covers and soon fell asleep again. A little while later, Billy heard the noise again and found out it was in his room. He looked down and saw his robot moving and talking to him. Billy was amazed and scared at the same time. So he decided to see if he could communicate with it and he could! he found out it could do a lot of things like do homework and cook food. Billy had never been more suprised and amazed in his life!                    Ever since Billy knew that the robot could do all this stuff, he has been best friends with it. As soon as his parents found out what the robot could do, they were fritened! So they threw him away in the garbage. When Billy go home from school and found out what had happened, was devistated. The robot missed his new friend so he went back to Billy's house without the parents knowing and hid in Billy's room. Billy was so happy to see the robot. He was still in trouble for not telling his parents what had happened so he made sure he hid the robot really well. His parents found out not long after and saw how much he loved the robot so they let him stay. So from there on the robot and Billy were best friends.

So the next morning i told my mom that I wantet to make a robot that can do all my chores for me, thats when i thought about how i would make this robot. The next morning when my mom got off work we went to the store and bought some materials when we were done we went home and decided on what to make the robot look like so i got some paper and started drawing what i wanted the robot to look like  when  i was done I and my mom began on the robot.In about 2 1/2 weeks we were done the robot that we had made could do almost everything in the house it could sweep, mop, take out the trash, wipe the counters, it just couldn't wash the dishes so I made some water proof gloves, the robot was called ''The Cleaner.'' It was the best robot ever made but one day it dropped the gloves and died. That was the end of my robot and the end of my story.

The volcano is dangerous for the scientist to go so instead of the scientist going the robot goes in the Volcano.                   Some of the robots gather information for the scientists, There's a robot that's named Mr.Gower hes a robot hes the one that helps nurses, doctors to do the medicine for the patients Mr.Grower is a small cabinet on wheels. The nurses and the doctors can unlock the drawers when the medicine is needed. Mr.Gower can go anywhere in the hospital Mr.Gower can ride the elevators and he can steer through the hallway .             This robot is so strong that he can pull 500 pounds. Mr.Gower runs on batteries the robot can deliver medicine for about twelve hours without stopping the robot can talk , it has been programed to say hundreds of phrases Mr.Gower does work that doctors pharmacists and nurses used to do. The agribot is a robot that picks fruit the fruit that he will pick up are berries, oranges, grapes, or apples.This type of robots are not widely used but all farmers are interested in what they can do like picking up a strawberry is different by picking up an apple.Those robots come in all different shapes and sizes.                    In Japan , there is a strawberry picking robot that can sense the color of the berries. This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.

When I open the door and they you are the second winner you win a robot. Then I open the box I to took it out my robot I screamed with joy.Then I turned it on and I said clean my room. The robot said rite away sir.                        Then this terrible thing happen the robots the robots turned evil.The robots had a evil spell on them.They started to give us commands.Then i went to my room an climes out of my window an went to the school and saw the person that was controlling the robots. I defited the man and got the control of the robots an put them to sleep.                      The people were cheering for me.Then we made a little party.The party ended and all went to there house.That's how every thing ended.

It was only 12 pm but it felt like 2 for Rodney Revell. He was up in theese late hours of the night to finish his science project. He had to build a robot then turn it in on the following day. Rodney had been trying to build this robobot for hours but he couldnt get it to work. Finally as the clock struck 4 am Rodney decided to give up. Angered, he headed to his room down the hall from the workshop he had been working in. His robot would fail him and he would fail the project.               On the day the project was due he got up before he could get on the bus to go to school. When he went to the work bench where the robot that he called the nepzar1 was being built he found the robot was missing. He looked all around but nepzar1 was no where to be found. Suddenly he heard a crash in the kitchen and his mother scream.               Swiftly, Rodney ran out of the workshop and into the kitchen. His mother was up against the couch in the family room with a knife in her hand yelling intruder in the kitchen. Rodney grabbed the knife out of his mothers hand to arm himself as he approached the kitchen. When he entered the kitchen he met face to face with the intruder. It was nepzar1! He was alive. His eyes were made out of soda cans and were illuminating a pale blue. His mobility was working as well he had little treads that rolled with him where he wanted to go. His main body, was an old microwave Rodney had found so he could store things in himself. and his arm was a simple grabber that nepzar1 could use to pick things up. Rodney let out a cry of delight as he saw his completed project working as programmed. In a squeaky voice nepzar1s first word was master. His mother came in madder than bee in a vacum cleaner. Not funny Rodney she said.                  Rodney glanced out the window and saw his bus. Got to go mom he said as he flew out the door. Rodney grabbed nepzar and got on the bus. His first class was science so he could drop nepzar off and present him to the class. Rodney saw big bots and small bots but none were as special as nepzar1. When it was rodneys turn nepzar and him walked side by side up to the whiteboard. He told the class everything he could do. his teacher, Miss Ignaranus, gave rodney an A plus          	NNP DT NN VBD RB VBG JJ NNP NNP VBD RB CD NN CC PRP VBD IN CD IN NNP NNP NNP VBD IN IN JJ JJ NNS IN DT NN TO VB PRP$ NN NNP NNP VBD TO VB DT NN RB VB PRP IN IN DT JJ NNP NNP VBD VBN VBG TO VB DT NN IN NNS CC PRP VBD VB PRP TO NNP NNP IN DT NN NN CD NN NNP VBD TO VB NNP NNP , PRP VBD TO PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBD VBN VBG NNP NNP NN MD VB PRP CC PRP MD VB DT NNP NNP DT NN DT NN VBD JJ PRP VBD RP IN PRP MD VB IN DT NN TO VB TO NNP NNP PRP VBD TO DT NN NN WRB DT NN IN PRP VBD DT NNP VBD VBG VBN PRP VBD DT NN VBD NNP NNP VBD DT IN CC NNP VBD DT WRB TO VB NNP NNP PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN CC PRP$ NN NNP NNP , NNP VBD RP IN DT NN CC IN DT NNP NNP NN VBD RB IN DT JJ IN DT NN NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN VBG NN IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN IN PRP$ NNS VBP TO VB PRP IN PRP VBD DT NNP NNP PRP VBD DT NN PRP VBD NN TO VB IN DT NNP NNP VBD NNP .

But that wasn't the way it was, no nothing worked for him.             He finally gave up and and sadly climbed into his bed. He hoped that one day that something amazing would happen upon him. 'Amazing things only happen in fairy tales.' Rickie thought to himself before he glanced at a photo on his nightstand. it was of him and his father a month before he passed away.               Within a minute, Rickie dozed off.            'Rickie! Rickie!, time to catch the bus!! Quick, before Your oatmeal gets cold!.' This was the usual wake-up call he got on a school morning from his mom. He knew that if he stalled, he wouldn't be in a good position, so he threw on his uniform and hustled downstairs. In those few minuets, he had no time to notice something peculiar on his desk.             At school, Rickie trudged through the noisy hallway. There were lockers slamming, girls giggling and sneakers squeaking on the tile floor. He would much rather be at home where it is quiet, constructing a robot and enjoying some rich hot coco.             Then, something snapped him out of daydreaming. 'Hey, Rickie! ' It was the voice of Mark, the one who appeared to not have a heart. Rickie didn't want to turn around but he did anyway. 'What do you want Mark?' Rickie replied with an impatient tone. ' Still into playing  with your little robot toys?' 'You know Mark I'm sick and tired of you always bugging me. If you do it again you'll be sorry.' 'And what can you do to me?' That was the last straw. Rickie was going to strike a blow...              At that moment, Mrs. Clancy the principal scolded Rickie and Mark. ' To my office now!' The boys talked with her and both were sent home early. Rickie's mom was working so he walked the treacherous walk to has house.              At his house Rickey was relieved to be at has desk once more. Sometimes Rickie wished he could fly away. Then he noticed a glowing gadget on his desk. He studied it for a minute and realized. it could fit in his robot and maybe make it whole. So he put it in but nothing happened.... until it started to levitate and slowly fly around his room. He had no idea where that piece came from but all he knew was that his robots had a chance and if he needed to fly away from at all, in a way he could.

Also robots can do other things like the gemini scout for instance, the gemini can go underground, make tight turns, and even go underwater.the gemini can also hold food, water and other things, it  even carries hurt people to safety.           Also there's a robotic car that drives itself. Google recently made a car that drives all on it's own. The car has an $80,000 cone-shaped laser mounted on its roof. Google's fleet of robotic cars have driven over 20,000 miles over highways and city streets in California and Nevada.       I think that someday robots will help people everywhere in the world. But for now lets just keep them where they are.

After two months it was finshed and it kind of looked like a person. Right away I grabed the remote and started moving him all around and started cleaning my room. After a while I found out that I was kind of do my choirs still but it was more like a game than a choir.              After a weak went by it wasnt as fun playing with him because I had to control it. The next morning I woke up and the robot was gone Iwent down stairs and it was making me breakfast. I was so amazed I coulded speak then I said is this a dream.After breakfast we went outside and played cetch. But he forgot to turn off the stove and and the house cot on fire right away robot ponted his hand to the house and it skwerted out water.Then the fire men came and put the rest out.              When my mom came home from her work she say all the fire man in the yard. She walked rite up to me and said the robots got to go. He poped out his rocket boasters and I never saw him again. But some times I would go the park and meet him there to talk and have a game of cetch.

Tomorrow it will be seven years since they've started this project and they only need two more pieces until the robot is up and active. Two days from now, their shipment for the pieces will come. Finally they add the last two pieces to the robot. They turn on the power switch and bam it came to life, but all of the it started going wacked and sparking. They had to shut it down.            All except for one scientist gave up. That one scientist found the problem after three months of hard work. It took him another two months to get the supplies and fix the problem. He started up the robot and it worked! The robot controled through a video game controller. Then, he got the idea of giving it a mind of its own. It took him two months to complete this task, but it was worth it. The other scientists were amazed when they heard the news. They decided to let himpic the name of the robot.

I was trying to make my own robot and make it seem like a real human. My mouth was parched from staying up so late working and my stomach was grumbaling. So, I got up and got myself some fresh lemonade and a turkey and cheese sandwich. When I had finished with my belly full I went back to work on my robot. The only problem was is that it wasn't there. I was wondering, 'Is it alive? Did someone take it?'. Thoughts were going through my head and I was worring. I had worked so hard and it just disapered. Then I just went searching I look high and low. I finally just gave up.      After a will I heard a strange voice coming from outside. So, I jumed out of my seat and ran outside. It was my robot Rob!! I ran over and hugged his round body. I relized I had made an actual robot thats alive!! Then I told Rob to follow me to my room. He was a little slow with following me but I was still really exited.      Once we got to my room I was asking Rob many questions. The things was he didn't really answer. He actually didn't know much. Every time I taught him how to play a game he did it and it was fun but he didn't answer any of my questions. But I still thought he was pretty cool. Robs my own little buddy.      A few hours later Rob stopped playing and talking to me. I was wondering why he didn't talk to me. Then I took a look at him and realized he needed to be charged. Luckily he was still ok. Rob was my favorite and fun invention. I plane on making him a buddy for when im a school.      I think robots were really cool inventions and it was fun to make. One day you should buy or try to make one. It was really fun!!

One day for a science project he wanted to build a robot, so he went to his basment and got the miterials and started to make it. Jermy was putting wiers in when all os a sudden he herd a noise. He said ''what was that' Jermy was alittle scared . But then he looked at his robot.                               Was that you'Jermy said with a scared voice. The robot replied with a calm vocie'yes master, I will surve you a you wish master''. The next day was the day that Jermy had to hand in his project. As he walked into class he was a lttle scared to see what the other kids would say. He was thinking to him self that the kids would say it is cool but he did not know what the teacher would say. He walked into the class room with the robot right by his side and one kid  looked at him and said ''wow that is a cool project, i bet it is going to be an A+''. for a second he thought'' wow i think i did a pritty good job.                      Jermy step right up to the teacher felling confadent aand said '' here you go Mrs, Right''. She just looked at him and said '' put it on the ground with the others''  Jermy looked at her with a mad face and said '' this is a robot that can talk i dont think it sould be on the ground'' for a second Mrs, Right `just looked at Jermy with a mad grin. 'go sit down'' Mrs Right yelled.Jermy went to go sit. Mrs,Right started to call up people for there project. Jermy was next he was so exited. Mrs,Right called ''Jermy your up''.                                             Jermy said to him self  '' here we go, i can do this,everyone will think you are so cool''.

I hadent wrighten more than 'once upon a time a robot' and then the robot came. I wasent shore what it wanted so I stood back thats when I saw my friend walk by and I walked up to the robot and it wasent even on so when I walked away its eyes gloow green it was almost night and I was in the park so I started to run home and then I couldn't see then robot came and its eyes made a light alowing me to see.            Then when I got home my friend was there the robot went in a sleeping bag and said good night. there were two sleeping bags on the floor so my mother got anther one that nihgt I woke up at   12:00 am and I saw the robot in the basment working on a ray gun and its eyes were red  so I thout that green is good and red is evil and it made anther robot the robots came up I hid in the trash can which luckly was empty excempt for me, of course. Then I went back down stairs and stoll the ray gun. I hid it in my room in the closet.            The next day there was THREE ROBOTS I didn't know if I should get the ray gun or not at 12:00 pm then the robots ate pizza with my I don't know how. Then the robots burped so loud my house shook for 30 secends the robots then tride to kill me so I ran to my room then blasted the robots and it just bounced off of them and hit a gem that was red and then fell apart and then came back togethere but this time it was green and then the robots be came good and went around the world helping people and the robots made me, my mom, dad, Mason my friend, my sister and them selves jet packs and evry thing went back to normal.

It was plouted. im just a robot named ollie, looking for life on earth. IM old an rusty. this place is destored. Because we have found no life yet, sadly. Ive been hear for so long, and found no life. All the people are living in this enourmos spaceship roming in space. They tried to make all the natral things like earth had. Wait........ i... i .think i .. see .ahhh AHHH WAIT ITS A SPACESHIP. I HOPE THERE COMING TO GET. OH I HOPE I HOPE.                Then i started following it. then it landed. i snuch behinde it and found a door and got in. But just me for i did, i found this most colorfull thing there. it was little and green. and ITS A PLANT! I FOUND LIFE.NIW I CAN BRING IT BAKC AND SHOW EVERYONE! so then i took it and got on the back of the ship. A few minutes later it blased off. Then we ened uo in this big whit garage. i jumed out. And there where robost everywhere. And finally at the and i found a door that said exit. so i went though it. and it was the captians room. He said who are you? i said im ollie. 'oh well what do you want.' ' ifound something on earth.' And what did you find? he asked. i said 'life.' he said 'no way.' i said 'look.' he gasped. and he said, OH.... MY.......GOD. And announed it to the whole ship. And everyone cheered. HE sais to me good job, thanks. I smiled, and fely joy.                five tears pased and everything was normal. And there where robots helping everywhere. And earth was clean no trash no mess. everything was back to normal.

'I have a surprise for you.' He said. 'Wait here.' He walked into another room, and when he came back he was holding a large box. 'Whats in there?' I said. 'You have to wait and find out' I tore the box open like a child on Christmas. When I saw what was inside, I gasped. 'Wait, a real robot?' I said in awe as I set it down on the counter. 'Yes, and its all yours. You know how you said you wanted a dog? Well, here it is. It acts like a dog, except you don't have to let it out to go to the bathroom or feed it.' I thought to myself wow, this is amazing. it has fur and everything! 'You made this? That why you were gone so much!' I said. 'Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you! I said while giving him a huge hug. 'What are you going to name it?' my dad said. 'I think I'm going to name it sparky! That seems like a perfect name for him!' It was true, it was a perfect name for him. He was a black and white puppy almost up to my knees. 'Well, why don't we start to head home. Your mom doesn't know about this yet, so I think we should go home and tell her.'             When we got home, mom was so surprised to see a robotic dog walking into her home, she was jumping up and down like a little girl. 'Henry! You made this? It's amazing!' She said. 'Honey, you are so lucky to have a dad like this. He's going to be the next Eienstien, I'm sure of it!' My dad and I just looked at each other and started laughing. 'His name is Sparky. Isn't he cute?' I said while bending down to pet him. 'I'm hungry. Can I have something to eat?' I said at the same time my stomach started growling. 'Sure, what would you like. Pizza? I just made some, it's still warm.' 'Sure. That sounds really good. Thanks mom.'             'So this is the living room, Sparky.' I said when we walked into the living room. I was giving sparky a tour of the house. Whenever I led him into a different room, he started wagging his tail. 'Oh! I almost forgot the best room in the house, my room!' As I led him into my room, he started barking and wagging his tail so much, it looked like he was going to fall over! 'Well, it looks like it's time for me to go to bed. After I brushed my teeth, washed my face, and did everthing I jumped in bed with Sparky, not even noticing the glowing red eyes staring at me through the window.

His mom realized he was very lonely, so she bought him a remote-controlled robot. Although it was very expensive, it was all worth it. The robot and Noah became best friends.           Noah wondered for a whole week of what to name his new robot, and on the last day, he named his robot Taylor. Taylor could do anything, she would supply herself full of many different types of food, she could play music, she could talk, and also was water-proof.           One day, Noah was walking home from the Thrift Store, he got a boat-load of toys, clothes, and he even got a chair. Taylor was so excited for when he came home, but suddenly saw his friend, Lauren. Taylor was not happy seeing him with another girl. She got feruste and rolled down stairs and stopped right in front of her.'What is this big pile of metal junk?' asked Lauren. Taylor got so mad that she tripped Lauren right as she was walking a way. Lauren got up and ran as fast as she could down the street. Taylor was pretty happy for her success, but Noah wasn't happy at all.             Noah relized Taylor was getting a little too protective over Noah. Noah told his mom and she said 'well we can't do anything, unless we return her.' Noah wasn't happy, he loved Taylor and didn't want to, but she was creeping Noah out. So, the next day, Noah and his mom went to the store and tryed to return her, but they wouldn't take her back. Noah and his mom went home still with Taylor. He went straight up to bed and fell a sleep.            The next day, he woke up and saw she was GONE!!! 'Oh no, where is she?' Noah spoke. He walked down stairs and noticed a oil trail. He followed it to the basement. He walked into the basement and saw she had busted. He was shoked and sad. He wondered how but knew it was for her own good.                                                                The End.

I made a robot that could do anything! My robot is called KATRAT3000. It could , explore things, make sure unsafe places were ok so that humans could go there and it out, turn into many different things, and lots more! Today, I proved my friends wrong, and i felt happy about it because i made a robot just like a human being! What it does for me is, go to school, do all of my homework, make money, clean my room, do all my chores for me, fly , go under water, plays with me, plays music, and turns into a submarine! Right now I even astound my self with what I did to this robot. Later on in the future i plan to do more with my life and everything that matters to me and to the world!

This amazing robot is used at hospitals. 'People always dreamed about living forever, now its coming true!' says Clay Miller.

The Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, and the Angribots are very helpful robots.       One type of a helping robot is the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout is a remote controlled robot that does research and rescue work in mines underground. This robot may be small but it is extremely strong, it could carry food, water, and other sorts of supplies. The Gemini-Scout robot gathers information from any place it goes.                Another sort of robot is the Dante 2. The Dante 2 has a very interesting job. It climbs into active volcanoes to gather information for a scientist to study. This robot has eight legs, which help it climb the steep walls of the volcanoes. Dante 2 searches for vents, or holes, in the crater to collect any information about the gases that come out of it.                The next robot would be Mr. Gower. This robot is very helpful in hospitals, it helps doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower can go anywhere in the hospital, it can ride elevators, steer through hallways, and move around things that get in its way. Mr. Gower is alsoable to speak, and it does work that doctors and nurses used to do.                The last robot is the Angribot. The Agribot is a fruit picker, it might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. Picking strawberries is a difficult job so, farmers have the Angribot to pick the strawberries. In Japan there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of a strawberry, and this helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.                 All these four robots have a different special job that is helpful to us. The Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr.Gower, and last of all the Angribot.

Like Dante 2 help scientist by going into volcanoes and gather information. Dante 2 climbs inside the volcano and collects data. It was built to stand very high heat. He looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. Dante 2 collects information about the gases that come out of it.       Agribots are robots that can pick up fruit like berries, oranges, and apples. They can grow plants . They can help farmers by helping them pick the fruit in their farms. Some people are triing to build robots that plant fruit, or plants.They help by planting the fruit for the people.       Mr. Goweris a robot that helps doctors, and the people in the hospital. He brings medicine to the nurses to give to the patient. He has many cabinets for the medicine. When he charges for two hours he can bring medicine for twelve hours. Mr. Gower can speck to. He can say many things like 'your delivery is here'.  He can pull 500 pounds.

Jay sat on the porch, siping lemonade.It was another hot afternoon in michigan,and Jay was spending his time relaxing, after working in the house the whole day he decided to rest.His mom came out then. ''Jay its time to do youre homework' she called.Mrs.Dill was just like her son, same brown hair and light skin exept her eyes were a bright green.'Come on' she said 'get youre homework done then you can play outside all you like'.Jay was about to get up but then a deep rumbeling sounded.Jay and his mother froze, then it stoped.

It was around 3 a.m., California time. So it was 6 a.m. Michigan time. It was a chilly, windy night here in California. No one ever thought what would happen after this night. The family woke with a start. They went downstairs, and were expecting so see some kind of monster, but no. They saw a nearly identical robot of R2-D2. Was this a dream? It certainly was. It felt real though.            The robot was bowing to us - like we were some Greek God. It said 'I am here to help you with anything.' This was getting creepy. A robot that just appears at night and expects us to give him chores. Then the robot said 'Amelia, I know things have been tough for you, managing all the chores at home while Ben is working full time. Thats why i'm here, to help you with the chores and you can cherish the weather or your garden.' My mom and dad nearly fainted. Their faces gto as pale as a ghost. This was clearly not a dream. But it's really suspicious how a robot from who knows where just appeared at 3 in the morning. He could at least have better timing.         My mom replied very strictly. 'Whereever you came from, the back doors right down that hallway. Turn around and get out. We don't need you.' I was very surprised to hear something like that from my mother. Just as the robot was going to answer my dad picked the robot up, but it wouldn't budge. I think it might've super-glued himself to the ground. 'You need me. I need you. It's as simple as that.'                                  &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;             Over the next few weeks, the robot, which doesn't really have a name was helping with anything. Dishes, laundry, watering plants and even cooking. He even offered me to change into my pajamas. I said no. Truth is, it was nice and better having the robot around. He would help with anything you need. We never asked any questions about how he got here or what his past was like. But man, he sure was good. Mom was so less stressed out and dad never got angry. It was paradise at home. Everything isn't perfect. Except for this. This whole arrangement was perfect.               Then something terrible happened, an exaxt year later, at 3 a.m. The robot left. No note, or heads up. After that, for some reason everything got better. Not worse like it normally is with mom, dad and I. It got better. Everyone did their fair trade of chores. No more yelling or stressing out. I felt like the rbot was somewhere in the house, helping us in invisibility. But how? Thr robot was gone and never was coming back. Probably going to another family to help them with their problems. But that didn't matter. the only thing that did was that the robot was here for one year exactly and he helped us with every single problem. To financial problems to getting a B- on a test. We knew the robot wasn't dead or even hurt. It was probably a thing my dad ordered to help - like a time share. A time share robot? I don't think those are invented yet. That would be something cool to invent though. Whatever it came from, a time share agent or even just spontaneiously it was real good.          *Snoreeeee* That dream was probably the best dream ever. Why? Because the dream came true.

Not many people knew her secret but most people did. She was known as The Robot Girl she didn't just know how to tame robots she knew how to sct to robots. So one day Patrisha went outside to see what's going on in her garage. As she got there she found cans, glasses, and a bunch of other stuff on the ground as she looked up she saw the most terrific thing she has ever seen.                 A Robot                The robot looked very mean and vicious with the silver metal and the gleaming red eyes staring right at her. Now this robot wasn't like the others. This one was built like a human. Patrisha freaked out at that time. She ran inside knowing that the robot was following. Right then she froze turned around to see the robot standing right infront of her. She held her hand up and so did the robot. Hand to hand she figuired out that the robot wasn't mean it was friendly and was only looking for a friend. The only hard part was that the robot doesn't know how to treat a friend.           So to start off she brought the robot into her bedroom and had it sit right on her bed. Once the robot was settled in she started talking. The robot looked confused and threw a lamp off the shelf hitting the floor and it shattered. So she thought maybe talking wasn't the robots thing and instead games were. They tried a bunch of games but none of them worked except one. It was the game SORRY the robot got so interested in how you could put the little piece back in it's home. The only thing is how do I comunicate with it? So she put her thinking cap on and started listing some ideas. In total she had 40 ideas so she went down the list.           Number one did not work and so on to ten. NOTHING!! She was getting so confused on why the robot wasn't doing anything she wanted it to do. So she went from ten to twenty. No results. Patrisha just about had it so she thought before giving up she should at least finish the list. Twenty to thirty. You know what I don't think I can do this anymore maybe I should just call someone to take the robot back to where it belongs. So she looked at the list one more time anf said. WAIT!! I want to try forty.           So she went straight to the robot and did number forty and there was no response so she started walking away when all of a sudden. HI!! MY NAME IS ROBOT 201 THANK YOU FOR FIXING ME!! I HAVE HAD A LOT DONE TO TRY AND GET ME TO TALK BUT NOW THAT I CAN TALK WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY FRIEND?       UH!! I don't know the way you were acting before was... was...       OH I JUST ACT THAT WAY BECAUSE ME NOT KNOWING HOW TO TALK IS ME NOT KNOWING WHAT YOU SAY. SO I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAY!!       Oh so I cured you? said Patrisha.       NOT ONLY THAT YOU TAMED ME!!           Patrisha was so happy that she gave the robot a hug and since then that robot has been her BEST FRIEND becuase everyone who doesn't know her story thinks she's crazy. That is Patrisha's story.             	NN NN NNP , WP MD PRP VB IN DT NN VBD JJ . MD PRP VB RP CC VBP , MD PRP VB CC VB IN PRP VBZ JJ CC JJ CC MD PRP VB CC VB PRP .

The name's Bob. I guess my creator wasn't in his right mind when he named his creation but things like that just tend to happen.              I don't have a battery that needs to recharge at night like my other robotic friend but I run on food. Real food. I doubt you'll want to hear about my basic eating habits so I'll get on with the story. It all started in Michigan at Ernie's workshop with a hammer, some nails and a bunch of scraps of metal. That's what Ernie my creator used to build me. He had never had a child and was in his early sixties when he was offered the job of being an engineer. He was in good shape and he loved his work. By the end of his second year he started building robots. One of them is my 'twin brother' and is named Billy. Who names two robots Billy and Bob? Anyway. By the time he was 67 years old he had finally made another robot. Me. It was a total success. I was and still am the most sophisticated robot man has yet made. I get energy on food, my lips move when I talk and I grow the older I get. Ernie made my growth rate the same as an average human so I could fit in when I went to school, but did I fit in? No, I never did. I was just a metal scrap which had been animated and morphed.               About ten years after he created me he moved away and forgot all about me and Billy and this is the story of how we found him.                                                                                     Chapter 2                                                    The Search Begins            One morning in the middle of May I went downstairs to unplug Billy from the charger and wake him up. Then I had breakfast while Billy got his school stuff ready. Then it hit me.'Billy, where's Ernie?'. 'No clue.' Was the answer I got from him. When I went to check if Ernie had accidentally had sleeped in. He wasn't there, instead there was a heap of metal. I knew what it was. It was the same thing he put into me when he had created me. The battery. The special feature about that one is it charges itself. There was a note right by. It read 'I'm sorry I left without you two but the police officers wouldn't let me take robots onto a plane. By the time you read this I will most likely be in Toronto, Canada. And put that rechargeable battery into Billy.'            It took him all day to finally put the battery into Billy. They knew Ernie's 'secret' stash of money and by some miracle there were 200$ left untouched. They stared at each other and knew what they had to do.             By the next day we found ourselves in a tent eating rations. Actually only Bob ate them. Thankfully we were robots and Ernie had only made one mistake when he made us. We had no energy limit. All we had after a week was a knife, some food, a tent and a bow we had made and 67$. We had no idea how long it would take us to find Ernie but we knew it would be a while. But we didn't know it would take us as long as it did though. And that is how our journey began.                                                          Chapter 3                                                   RUN!!!!                         It had been almost two weeks since we had left and we still hadn't encountered any problems. While Billy scouted ahead I had to stay back at camp and make arrows with the knife. For self defense of course. By the time I had finished my third arrow I heard a growl. I had no idea what that was so I just went back to work. That was my greatest mistake, because seconds after a large grizzly bear broke through the bramble and charged me. I had just enough time to recover from shock to get out of the way. I picked up the bow and one arrow. I drew it and fired. I missed the bear. The angry grizzly charged again. I jumped out of the way and fired a second arrow. It missed. Then the real problem happened. Two more bears came and charged. My first thought was 'I'm doomed'. I closed my eyes. Nothing happened. I turned around and there were a pack of wolves running away. I packed my bag and ran without bothering to retrieve my arrows that had nudged into a tree.           It wasn't untill late at night that I found Billy. He had wondered where I had been. I was too lazy to say much. 'It involved three bears and a pack of wolves.' That was all I said untill next morning.                                                           Chapter 4                                               The wolves are back                    It was friday, August 13 when things went bad. It started with howling noises in the middle of the night. Billy came running into the tent and started packing up as fast as he could. I didn't need to ask questions because the howling had already answered them. I started packing too.               We had been running from and dodging wolves as they jumped at us. I had made lots of arrows and had been practicing with them. Three of the wolves had already stopped and turned around from injuries but a bunch of them still were on us. A minute later we emerged from the forest that had so far been protecting us and we found ourselves in front of a sign that said Welcome to Toronto. The wolves had turned around and given up when they saw what laid ahead of them. The city was marvelous to my eyes and I asked around if anyone knew of an old man named Ernie. We got lucky. Within the next day we were sitting next to ernie having a nice family reunion. Ernie had finally made a coat of skin and other stuff to help me look like a real boy. I was now proud of myself and felt like life was not as bad as it seemed anymore. Life is good.

I was so surprised, it must had been years since it last worked!     I did not know what to do with it, maybe I could keep, should I give it back to the creator.     It looked like Google's robot car and I was wondering why somebody would through that away? The robot seemed really dirty and dusty, so I decided to wipe it off a little, it also smelled like a oil leak, which made the robot sticky for when I wiped all the grim off.     Luckily my Mom and Dad put the trash in a trailer, so we were able to put it in their. I was barley able to convey them to bring it home with us, but I said 'Please, we should really find the creators, that makes it in California.'      The next day, we contacted the Google company to arrange a time when they can come to our house to pick up the robot. We left it outside, so it would be easy to get it in the back of the truck that the Google company was bringing.      Later that day, the truck was at our house. They had a thick rope to pull it and a fork lift to pull the rope, that was attached to the robot. Once they were finished, they said 'Thank you and we will be able to restore it.'      I was so excited that I found it and I wonder what it will look like restored?      	CD NN , DT NN RB VBN TO VB IN PRP VBD VBN VBN TO DT JJ NNP PRP VBD RB VBN , PRP MD VB VBN NNS IN PRP JJ VBD .

Maya, a very intelligent 8 year old who loved to draw and invent robotic instuments never could get anything she tried to work right. Jack, age 11 who was also smart loved to help her firgure out how to get it to work. As much as they tried it would never work. But soon it would all change.                   The drafting of their next robot was almost done with all of their supplies ready to make the new robot. It was going to be able to do all of their chores and homework so they would have more time to work in the lab. It would also bring them food and water so they would not have to take a break from working. They each wanted their own so they could do work for each of them.                    It took at least three years of planning and creating to get their final product. It was finally the day to turn them on and they were really nervous that it would not work. They switched the switch on each of their robots but they did not turn on. They took the batteries out and charged them for another day. Then they put them back in their robots and plugged them in. Finally the robots turned on and Maya, and Jack could not believe they just build a robot that worked. It even did everything they wanted it to do. That would change their life forever.

He rushed down the stairs to the assistant scientist.   'I did it I have finish Betty and she is finally working'!   'Look!'   He turned on the robot anxious to watch Betty move and talk.   'Oh my gosh you actually did it!' John said as excited as Mathew when he saw her drawer pop out with a snicker doodle inside.   'This is amazing'!                                                                         Mathew picked up the cookie and took a bite, 'So is the cookie'! John chuckled a little and then they went to call news 8 to tell them about Betty.           'Aww wasn't that cute'!

Betty is a light purple robot that does not only move and talk, this little robot can also make bakery treats inside her! Fascinating!' well that's all the time we've got today so tune in next time for more top stories I'm Carl and this channel 8' 'siya!'         'Wow its already 8:00'.   'Wow the day went by so fast with Betty and the interview and the news coming to the lab...   'Yeah I'm ready to fall asleep right now'!   'Same here'.   So that's what they did. They went to the lab they got ready for bed and they fell asleep.       But they were so tired that they forgot to take Betty back to the lab and she got left at the newsroom. She felt lonely and wanted to be played with and then she got mad because nobody was there and she turned evil.                                                To be continued..... 	NN VBD PRP .

'The robot was here and now it is not.It is not my imagination this really happen'   'Explain it one more time?'the police man asked.   'I do not know he was here last night and when I woke up he was gone'.'   The room went silent.   ' I know everyone thinks I am crazy but he is out there right now.'   'Now sir what does this 'robot' look like?'   'He is light blue with purple and gold stripes.'   'Yes sir, and you said he had... super powers.' The police man tried to say professionally but could not do anything but laugh.   ' Mr. Police man sir, I understand that you think this could be a laughing matter but as far as I he could have run away.'   'So you are saying that he just... suddenly came a live.'   He said trying to hold down his laugh.   'Sir I know you do not believe in robots but trust me he is real.'   ' Okay sir'    ' He is like family to me.'    'So your 'robot' son ran away.'    ' I do not know.'    'I do not think we should waste police materials on your 'robot' son.'    'Sir do you have kids'    'Of course not. Kids are gross and mean and so much more.'    'Fine do not help.'The scientist grab his coat and out he went.        Other wise on the other side of town George the robot was to happy to have come to life.    George could clime on things and he could  run through water and the could also go into very hot things like volcanoes. But he just miserable. He was lonely and he was cold.    George wished he could go back to... Well, not being real.When it hit him... How was he alive. he wished the scientist was here so he could ask him but he was a long way away.    So he went out on a searcher for some clues leading to why he was like this.        'George' yelled the scientist       'George come home' he screamed again.    The scientist was tiered of searching for his little robot son.    But he did not want to give up so he search and search until...            George was trying very hard to find clues when he decided to go home.         'George.' he screamed    ' I miss you come home.' he said and cuddled up with a lamp post and fell asleep.'       While gorge was whipping around the corner to his house he saw the most bizarre thing he had ever seen.It was a idiot cuddled up with a lamp post. Then he realized that was his idiot. It was the scientist.        'George' the scientist called as he saw his robot.`           ' George how did you...:' you know I like you better this way he said as the walked to into  the sunrise home!

Every hour of the day garbage was being dumped into the landfill.         Maria had always been a only child. Even though she had lots of friends at school, she was always lonely at home. Maria needed a friend to keep her company at home, when her friends were a away. She needed someone to call a brother or sister. She needed someone to play with her after school. She needed a robot.         'That's it!' she thought 'I need a robot'. But how? How would Maria be able to make a robot, and with what would she make it with? Then she looked back at the landfill. She looked at the loads of metal that were dumped into the landfill. 'That's what i'll make it with!' exclamied Maria, 'I'll make it out of recycled metal'.         Maria ran to her house, opened her front door and slamed it shut, rushing to get to her phone to call up her best friend Sammi, so she could tell her the great ideas of how she was going make a robot. Maybe Sammi would even want to help her.'Hello?' said Sammi, answering the phone. 'Hi Sammi, it's Maria. I need you to come to my house imediately!' said Maria, hopping no stranger would take the metal that was in the landfill. 'Okay i'll be over in a bit' said Sammi, and they both hung up the phone.         'DING-DONG' the door bell had rang, it was Sammi. 'Hey Sammi! Come on in' said Maria, excited to tell Maria her big plan to make a robot. 'So why did you want me to come over so badly?' asked Sammi, and so Maria told her the brilliant idea on how she was going to make a robot. 'That's an awesome idea!' exclaimed Sammi. 'Well then, what are you waiting for? That's go get the metal and get to work!'         Maria's mother and father probably would not have liked that Maria was going to bring a load of old, used and rusty metal into their house, but Maria's parents were on a buisness trip in Japan to check out the new robot's this smart man made. So, she just hoped they wouldn't come home anytime soon. As soon as they had all the metal they needed (or thought they needed) they dumped it all on their kitchen table and started to brain storm ideas of how the robot look and how it would be made. Just incase you are wondering how in the world these girls are going to make a robot well, both of the girls parents work for companies who build robots. 'Okay, I think it should have a square body and a triangle head and be painted yellow' decided Sammi. 'No, no, no I think it should have a circle head and a egg shaped body and be painted white' explained Maria. 'Yeah that's a great idea!' exclaimed Sammi, so they decided to have a robot with a square head, an egg shaped body and be painted white.         After hours and hours of blood, sweat and tears, they had finished making the white robot. 'Maria I have a question' asked Sammi 'how are we exactly going to make this robot come to life?' Maria looked at her with a smile on her face. 'You'll see' said Maria. Maria suddenly jumped out of her seat and ran down into her dark, mysterious basement. 'What could possibly be in that basement that would make a robot come to life?' thought Sammi.         Sammi waited and waited but Maria never came out of the basement. Then suddenly a dark blue glow came out of the basement, and so did Maria. As Maria walked toward Sammi she held a small metal ball that glowed the color of dark blue. 'This' Maria said 'is what's going to make our robot come to life'.         She moved closer and closer to the robot and opened a metal flap by where the heart should be. She stuffed the metal, glowing ball into the flap and connected three wires to it. The whole robot started to shake, and the floor started to shake! And then everything stopped moving, and a little white robot started to fly through the air yelling 'Finally i'm alive!' Then it stopped moving and floated toward Maria 'thank you master you made me come to life'. 'Please, call me Maria' ordered Maria. Sammi stood speachless in the corner of the room. Then the phone rang 'Hello Maria?' spoke Maria's mother 'Hi Mom! You could not believe what just happened! I've got a new friend!' and Maria hung up the phone, so excited to play with her new robot friend, Marie.

Bob was a big robot who was made from parts that Steve found in a junk yard. Bob was rusty and dirty but Steve loved him. One day Steve was eating a hot dog and reading the news paper, When he heard a loud crash coming from his shed were he builds things. Steve ran and hid under his bed. 2 hours later Steve finally got anough courage to get out from his bed and go downstairs. He looked around but the only thing he saw was his cat, Muffin, eating lettuce, that Steve had dropped on the floor when he got scared. Steve decided to take Muffin with him and go see what made the raquet in his shed. Steve got to the shed and looked around, then gasped, Muffin passed out and fell out of Steves arms. There in the middle of the room was a hornet.       Steve ran as fast as he could and didnt stop until he was under his bed. 5 hours later it dawned on Steve that 1. he had left Muffin in the shed, and 2. that a hornet couldnt have made that much noise. So Steve went out to his shed and picked up Muffin who was still out cold, and looked around. He looked into the corner of the shed and did a double take.  The robot he created just for fun, and to try something differnet, was standing in the corner, its large eyes glowing a bright, blinding red. Steves eyes got as big as dinner plates, and the robot let out a loud       'Hello, hello hello hello'.       Steve opend his mouth but no words came out. Steve just stood there a expression of amusement and horror plastered on his face.           Later Steve found out that Bob came alive beacuse he mixed up some wires and he had came alive. Bob and Steve have done many fun things together and had some good memories. Steve takes Bob to the grocery store and to the amusment park, regular parks and on long road trips. Bob loves riding in the car and sticking his head out the window. Every 5 years on May 21st to May 28, Bob has to go to a special building with white walls and wall to wall white carpets, and alot of electric plugs and get charged for one week. Steve always misses Bob terribly, and treads that week. But when Bob comes home Bob is very exited and happy so they go to many different parks and places to try to get some energy out of him.           The fun didnt last on May 30, 3090 Steve got a terrible phone call. The people at Newchester (the charging place) always leave Bob in for 1 week only. If they are one minute late over a week Bobs knobs and weels and everything inside of him will melt. That is kind of saying that he dies. Well Martha, the kind lady incharge of Bob every five years, left Bob in the wall 1 minute and one second two long. So on June 4th 3090, Steve had a funeral for Bob.Steve went to say his last goodbye when suddenly Bobs eyes started glowing yellow and in a quiet but happy voice Bob said       'I feel better than I've ever felt'   and stood up and huged Steve.       Steve and Bob have lived happily in California ever since and now are even better freinds than before.

Gina is the future in the past its hard to explane but ginas every ware, Gina is a robtic mascito. Colege students from the untversity of Michigan state  made a robot named gina-990. gina-990 was bult to help them build minicher drons to hover over the president when he gave a spech. The drons wuld fly aroud making minimal noice making shure the was no harm for the president. Gina-990 hade a malfuction and made the dron the size of a maskito. The prefesor of the students was impresed he thout that it would be a chalenge but the profesor was impresed cand donate the son to be called gina to the pentaon where they could use it to prevent bomings and asasinachians. then they gave it the name gina.                                                 Ginas fetures              Gina has many many fetures. So include a camera that can soom in on a target a  mile away also gina has a built in het secing vition. Gina also can go and analise dna and finger prints and send them to athoratis. Ginas most holey advanesed technolagie charges solarly and gina has a dart that can be fired knoking the target out for a hour.                                           ginas first acienment           Ginas first acienment was classefied all i now was that gina had a warent to fallow a man that had ben making millions of dollars making and selling drugs. The man was meting a client on disiding a price for his rare drugs. When the man snaped pulling a uzi on the dealer the dealer was waring a suicidal vest.

Tiny was ignored, rejected and left out. All of the tin cans in Canville, had had arms and legs, ears and even had feet. They thought Tiny was different and weird, and not normal, so they never asked him to play. Everyday Tiny cried and cried about not looking the same as others, and not fitting in. HE could only dream about fitting in.   One day his dream came true.....                  A nice summer night in the middle of July, Tiny was getting ready to go to sleep when all of a sudden he felt a strange feeling.  A tiny blue light shined on his mound of trash, so bright that Tiny had to squint his brown, rusted eyes to see who was there, nobody was. 'Wow, that was weird,' he said to himself. 'What was that? 'Then Tiny heard a noise... 'ZZUUPPAA!!!!!!!' Poof! Tiny turned into a brand new shiny silver toy robot! Tiny couldn't believe it! His wish had come true, all he could ever want. He had mechanical arms and legs, a bionic inside, and his very own set of feet! Now Tiny could do anything his friends could, and have the most fun he could ever had! All of his friend excepted him, and apologize sincerely for being such bad friends. All Tiny could to was enjoy his new Robot figure by trowing a party for Canville. He used his mechanical arms and legs for putting up the streamers, his bionic insides to play amazing music, and he used his feet to rock the dance floor! The party was so great, all of Canville declared Tiny as the official party thrower robot.            And that's how Tiny became a Robot!

We heard a strange sound that me or my team had ever heard before It almost sounded like a robot. We stopped for a second but didn't think anything of It and kept playing. Our practice was going great and then theirs the sound again but this time I was hearing It from different parts of the gym but not At the same time.          Practice was just about over so coach let us out a little early and our whole team Went to where we heard the noise and then we went to the very top of the bleachers and I saw a silver Object flying towards me making that same sound and when It got closer I notice It's arms spread out and It pretty much just does a perfect tackle on me as I fall to the ground It stands up and I see that It's a robot.         I look at It everyone's surrounding me and this little robot. The robot just says hi my name is Spike. Everyone just stands there with there jaws dropped down to there legs and I was the only one to say hi back and the robot says, ''can I live with you.'' I don't know what else to say so I say sure and he just flies right out the door. My teammates haven't moved an inch still and I just follow him along.         That night we did nothing and whent right to bed. Spikewakes me up with a huge bacon and egg samwich wich was amazing but still no words. Then he said can we go for a walk and I said sure we were walking and then I saw a sign that said missing toy robot and the picture looked just like Spike and I said theres your house isn't It. He said I don't know but I wan't It to be. I knocked on the door and a little kid yelled Ssssssppppppppiiiiiiiiiikkkkkkkkkkkkeeeeeeeee and the gave eachother a big hug.

Not his parents nor teacher. Not his bother or sister, all he wanted to do is be a scientist. And an engineer. But no one would believe in him just because he got bad grades. He just wanted to live his dream.       Though his best friend, who didn't believe in him either, he suggested Fred show his ability to build a robot, but he said it in a sarcastic grasp voice,       'You'll never be able to build a robot, but if you're so cocky about it why don't you show us your 'skills.' Than I'll belive you.'       So Fred has his work cut out for him. But he would do everything he had to just to show them he could live his dream. He took a ton of time just to make this robot, some time he even skipped school. Months later he came up with this brilliant idea to make a robot so he started from scratch and made a robot called Filly-dilly-bob-joe. He was an amazing robot he could do absolutely everything you asked him to do. And the best part about this story is that he was a best friend to a wonderful young man.        Filly-dilly-billy-joe's job was to be the maid of the house. He had to buy groceries, clean the floors and fold the clothes. Everything cleaning wise Fred didn't want to do. And the best part is that he only listens to Fred's command, therefor his siblings and parents can't use him because they were the ones who never believed in him.       His creation became a big hit and soon enough everyone had a robot in their home. All exept his family and friends, they couldn't buy one because they didn't believe him.       I feel pretty inspired by this story to not listen to anyone else and live your dreams.       Everyone should live their dreams.       Everyone.

That was when everything that could go wrong did, only to lead to an amazing find.       I got to school then while I was walking to class I slipped and all my papers scattered everywhere. While I was almost done picking them up, the first bell rang and everyone started running to their homeroom, scattering my papers even more. I thought, About 20 people ran past me and none offered to help. Sheesh! Talk about rude! I finally finished picking up my papers then started fast walking(not running so I won't slip) to homeroom when I walked inside everybody ran out of the room, going to their next class.       I shighed and started to walk to science and we had a... pop quiz! Guess what else! I failed. La, had to write a story about fish, my pen broke and all its ink spilled all over me, my desk and my paper. Math, I fell alsleep when Mr. Garbon started to talk about cubic centimeters only to wake up with everybody staring at me. Scocial Studies, We went to watch a video about indians and I started to daydream then Ms. Yen asked me a question and I had no idea that she was even talking! The rest of the day went on and on until I rode the bus home.       I shouted out, 'Mom, I'm home!' Then I found a note saying, Sorry darling, emergency conference. See you after! XOXO, Love Mom. I decided to do my homework outside. I went to my backyard and then I saw a robot in front of me lying in a big heap. Then,out of nowhere, a lightning bolt hit it! It wasnt even raining, and it was a nice sunny day. Then the robot came to life.       I screamed then ran behind a tree. I peeked out, curiosity getting the better of me, and the robot's hand turned into a broom and the other a duster and it was cleaning up our back porch. It must be a cleaning robot! ,I thought. I tiptoed over to it and took its arm and led it to my room and I'll admit, my room was a mess it started to clean and I shut the door. This is awesome! I can have it clean my room every day and it will be a lot easier to find all my things!       Mom came in right as I walked past the front door and I told her everything, the robot my terrible day and how we could keep it and have it be our maid, everything. She agreed and said that she was proud of me going through that day and said that life will be easier.

Nicole is a very cool robot she can do whatever you tell her to but Nicole doesn't just do everything you say, and she loves to play but mostly she helps lots of elderly people and people who have mental problems and other conditions.                           If you are at home and you are very board, then Nicole is the perfect robot for you she can hang/play with you. Nicole can do many things such as play catch, transform into any animal you want and she can act like it.         She can even act your age, like a boy/girl teenager, adult, preteen, kid/child pretty much ant thing. Guess what she even has her very own home phone and CELL PHONE so you can call her and asks to hang, just don't forget she helps elderly/mental people so she might be busy!                          Now you can learn more about how Nicole works with helping elderly/mental people!!                  When Nicole is helps orderly/mental people she scans the so she can tell if they are sick or even have diabetes. If the person does she will take them to a hospital or even a doctor and she will tell the doctor what is going on with the elderly/mental person. Once Nicole is done explaining to the doctor the doctor will then take the elderly/mental person and do his or her business.

I was sleeping and I heard a noise.I could tell it came from the garage so i grabbed a flashlight and headed out to the garage.I shined the light everywhere and where the robot was and there was nothing there.I began to panic but then I realized it was probably just a prank my dad pulled on me.So I just left.But on my way there the robot popped out in front of me.       I stood there paralized. Then the robot said i do whatever you would like.I told it to jump up and down and it did. So i told it to do other things and it listened.The next day i brought it to school and it started beating someone up but then the person just started beating the robot and it got smashed.I was so sad i just ran home to my room.Then i heard a knock.I opened the door and the robot was there! It said to me that it fixes itself.And even today i still play with him.

We are in my garage on this beauftiful summer day and I am checking to make sure he will still be able to function when I bring him to my first day of school. Suddenly as I am checking his head, a wire pops up and out of nowhere he starts rumbling. As quick as it started, it stopped but my sliver, metal, human like robot wasn't there anymore. He was replaced by an actual human! A boy with brown hair and dark blue eyes to be specific.             The rest of the week before school couldn't have possibly been any better! The robot, which I named Jimmy, turned out to be a search and rescue robot! He has told me may stories about some extremely dangerous search and rescues. For instance, one time he had to go as close to a volcano as anyone has ever gone a go a little bit farther! The only problem was my parents, what would I tell them? I decided that since Jimmy never needed anything that when it came time for school I would tell them I made him look like a boy so he would be more impressive!              Sadly on the last day before school we were playing in our boat on the Mississippi River when the current tipped us over! I heard a few shocks from Jimmy and then he was gone. Even though I told everyone the story at school they still didn't believe me and without any proof I knew they never would.

He saw trees with brightly colored leaves, he saw squirlls hampering about, but one thing he saw surprised him. It was a robot. I'm not talking about those mini toy robots, but a giant real one. It was just lying there on the ground. He looked around it, he kicked it, he even smelled it and finally he dared himsef to touch it. It was hard and rusty. Cool he thought I wonedr if it runs on batteries? I could fix it! but just as he picked it up he heard a beeping sound, then all of a sudden it straighted up looked around and stretched. He walked toward Geff and just stood there with his hand out. Geff hesitated for a moment then shook it. Nice to meet you he said, do you have a name? The robot shook  his head. thats ok Geff said ill name u..... aha BoB. you can come to my house for supper I'm sure mother won't mind. So he led the robot to his house and was about to introduce him to his mother when all of a suddden.... SHREAK!!!!!! Geff get away from that that thing! yelled his mother. No mom you don't understand said Geff he's my friend. Suddenly his mother stopped Is he harmless? she asked. Yes said Geff he wanted to stay for supper his name is bob. he can talk? asked his mother. Well not exactly he just nods his head and points. Well then he can stay replied his mother go set the spare bed and come to the table your supper's cold.

Soon after they were married I came along. My name is Nick. I am 5ft wide and 4ft tall. When i'm all grown up all be as big as my mom, 10ft wide and 7ft tall. Alot of surprises of encountered since then though.                                                        Starting from day 1                I was a very tiny young one. I was only 2ft wide and 2ft tall. That's a very small robot for normal ones.I was born with a robot desiese called Rollaferbia. (Unable to properly wheel around on balance). But  i wasn't able to go to the robot children's hospital till I was over the age of 1 years old.Without a doubt after my amazing 1st birthday party full of  obstacle courses and lot's of present's I was brought to the hospital.I was brought to my bed and was brought to the surgical room. I was knocked out so I didn't know much but this is stories I heard from my great ol' grandmother.The bad news was that the procedure didn't  go well I lost one of my wheels and spreded the desiese to my arms. My parent's were'nt happy. They were really disapointed. That night whrn I finished my glass of chocolate milk and chocolate chip cookies i fell asleep in my bed. The next morning I woke up and the only person there was my grandmother was there  crying.Where are my parent's? At the lunch room? Went to grab something from home? Soon afterwards my grandmother told me. ' Sweedoms, I know this is going to be hard for you to understand but'. Small Pause. ' Your parent's won't beable to take care of you anymore and your going to live with me'. Tears were running down my eyes this can't be happening. But it turns out it was a true story.                                 Sweet ol' grams and a lot of rolling                        Over the next year or so I was in no sociallality or anything pesides my physical therapy. The ladies were nice there. Julie, Samantha, and Ivy. My favorite was Ivy. The other two are nice and helping but Ivy actually guides me through the process and does all my files. One time she was so worried about me she spent the night. I loved it there. I loved grams but every since the surgery she's been way over protective. It's not a big deal though, I know why she is, plus I see Ivy everyday. I kind of have a tinsey crush on her. She also always bakes a lot of cookies for me just like grams. Soon after another year and a half went by suddenly grams passed. I did'nt know what to say, she was my only connection to my family. It turns out she had a similar desises called wheelervy. Similar but it affects the whole body. Her theramal camera first broke down then the rest just stopped. I had to get put into the foster robot system. I was put there for 6 months , and at this point I wasn't aloud to go to physical therapy anymore which I was very bummed about. When I thought news can get any worse no joke Ivy , Ivy came and adopted me! I was so happy I couldn't even help but wheel to her and fall. She laughed. 'Nice try Nick time to get back to my place '. I was so syched I finally forgot everything that has happened to me and only focused on the future. Me and my mom Ivy's future.

The LAX-17 has two mechanical arms and and treads intead of legs becauseif it didn't it would get stuck in the mud on those rainy days. The LAX-17 only weighs 64 pounds so it is pretty easy for a human to carry if needed.           The LAX-17 is capable of picking up a lacrosse stick and playing just like a pro. It also can give pointer to new people to the sport. Now lets say your out on the feild and your stick breaks well the LAX-17 can restring your stick, fix it, or just make you a new one any way you like.       So if your one of those people that is crazy about lacrosse then you should definetly gat a LAX-17.

WRITING:                                   Two Brains, one Body           'Dr. Henton, the final motor circuits are in place, and testing is inevitable now' the lab assistant triumphantly proclaims. 'Great, we've already recruited testees for the A.A.M.B.' Dr. Henton replies, fingering the oily steel mechanics resting on the workbench. 'Now we'll bring in the experiment' he smoothly replies, buttoning his white lab coat.             Both nervous and excited, Nate Carpenter runs his hands through his long black locks, on his face, on his jeans, staring at the cieling lights, thinking 'this is the last time I'll ever feel these'.   The nurses' calming words do nothing to ease the waterfall of emotions of being the first to try inventions, a jumble of fear, excitement, nausea, and gratefulness for the privilege. The last thing he sees as a human is the nurses pulling anasthaesics out of the polished cabinets and giving him sleep medications.             Sixteen hours later, he wakes up to find his senses strangely acute, and his physical abilities strangely stronger. But, the oddest thing of all is that he felt another presence in his seven and a half foot tall body of steel. The scientists told him that there was an emergency computer brain that would take over if he went unconscious. They had surprised looks on their faces when he said he heard another, computerized voice in his head.             Another week later, he had a debate with half his body. He won, but it startled him. After a few more days of it, he was steadily getting more weary from his body growing more and more rebellious. He tried to reach the phone, which took immense concentration. But to his dismay, his hand swatted it away like a bug. The computer then spoke to him. 'You shall comply with all the rules and regulations set  by the Athletic Aerial Motorized Body. This includes dismantling any mental or physical uprising  by current organic being. Emotions are now banished by body regulations' droned the computer.             He then had any thought disappear, only capable of seeing and feeling. He would cry out if he had the ability to think about it. All he could is see what the computer could see, a iron fist grasp agonized faces, guns being fired, another robot clutch him, blackness. Then he could think again. He was alive again! After losing consciousness again, he was back in his organic body.

The next moring the robot wasn't on  the  ground he was on the of my roof. So I went to go get him.I grab him of the roof and took inside and throw him i my room.Later that day i was wait for the robot to shake but he didn't do it  he just lay on the floor.So i went to bed but the robot was in my dream. we were dance together             	NN VBD CD NN VBZ NN IN DT JJ NN NN RB VB PRP RP DT JJ TO VB NNP NNP PRP VBD PRP NN IN NNP WRB PRP VBD CD RB DT NN NN TO JJ PRP VBD TO VB CC NN CC NNP VBD VBN IN JJ CC PRP VBD JJ CC VBD TO NN IN PRP PRP VBD DT NN NN DT JJ NN DT NN VBD VBG IN DT NNP NNP NN TO VB IN PRP VBP VBD RB VBP CC VBG PRP IN PRP VBD JJ PRP VBP RB IN DT JJ IN NN DT NN NN VBD TO JJ PRP VBD TO VB CC NN CC NNP NNP NN IN NNP NNP JJ NN DT NN VBD RB IN DT NN PRP VBD IN DT IN PRP$ NNP NNP NNP VBD TO VB NN -NONE- NN PRP IN DT NN CC VBD NN CC NN PRP PRP PRP$ JJ IN NN PRP VBD JJ IN DT NN TO VB CC PRP VBD RB VB PRP PRP RB VBP IN DT NNP PRP VBD TO VBN CC DT NN VBD IN PRP$ NNP PRP VBD NN RB	0		20131022161047	2411	0		20131022161021	2344	0

The name of this awesome robot will be the otter bot.       'I will be up for dinner in a second.'' I yelled to my mom.''It is not about dinner honey, you have some serious company.'' she yelled at me. I ran up the stairs to find a man in a suit.sitting on the couch with a hummer in the drive way. '' Hello Marcus the man said with a smile on his face. ''We need to talk about something very serious.'' he said. I sat down on the couch next to my mom and said to him what is this about. ''My name is general Martin of the U.S.A marines. I would like to talk to you about a job that could change the war. At the tie we were at a war with North Korea and the U.S.A needed a technology upgrade.       ''Are you an inventor Mr.Price the general asked. ''Yes I am.'' i said cautiously. ''The marines have a job for you that could change your life forever. we need you to build a spying robot. ''Ok...'' I said. It is up to you how you want to make it but it needs to be strong and stelthy.'' he said. Me and my mom walked into the kitchen to talk about it and she said it was ok. ''I will do it.'' I said with a smile.       I sped down stairs to get to work right a way. I started thinking that it should be able to swim sense North Korea is surrounded by water. Then the idea hit me i would build a robot otter. it would be about 2 feet long and way about 30 pounds  and have all the characteristics of a real otter. it would have a tale,claws. and the ears and nose would be censers. So I got to work.       7 weeks later       Well i am done and it looks incredible! It looks just like a otter it even has fur and everything. it can swim, knows about 70 languages, is bullet proof and has night vision. I  turned it in to the marines and it is now in North Korea spying as we skeak now. One thing that the general didn't tell me was I got 1,000,000 dollars! now if you will excuse me I am in Hawaii and i have to catch a wave.

'Well we programmed it to help the world, discover unknown things, make the world reveal whatever its hiding. Someone has to do it, but most of the journeys are too dangerous. People would die. We are positive this robot is loving, along with the characteristic of lovable. He is a very good crop collector, too.'             'Well, how do you know what this piece of junk does, it looks useless and it isn't even powered up.'             'Yes. That is the only thing left we are working on. Turning it on has been the greatest challenge yet. We have tried everything, it just seems like we did something wrong. But now, it is late. We can continue the conversation tomorrow.'             The scientist flicked the lights off and left the laboratory with his son.                                                  3,000 years later...                         'What is that over there by that old building?' asked Dr. Naureen. 'It's very shiny.'             'That looks like a robot,' shouted Dr. Barbknocker. 'Excavate it, we shall take it to the laboratory. C'mon, let's get to work.'             Later that evening, the scientist figured out a way to make the robot come to life! The thing needed a name and some major cleaning. The scientist named him Derek. They washed and oiled him, painted him in a nice dark green. He looked brand new! It took lots of time, but Dr. Barbknocker (the leader of the scientist) and some others found out what Derek could do. He could shrink to small sizes and fit into places the human thumb could never get. Derek discovers the unknown and is very careful with new objects.             He is also very caring, he loves children and animals. He can sing, dance and entertain. He is very useful for those in handicaps. He serves doctors so doctor may focuse on more important things. Derek is a plant lover just as much as he loves everything else. He helps farmers grow and collect fruits, vegetables and other crops.             Derek is loved and everlasting people praise, respect and protect this robot for all the goo deeds he has done to change the beloved world. 	JJ VBZ PRP VBP .

The  leader there was Men-Ching, the Chinese dictator who was insane and was obsessed with having military domination of the entire world. Men-Ching and his team of scientists were almost done building their lifetime dream. . . . . . . . . D-39, a man-size robot designed to bring down the mighty U.S.                Meanwhile, in Washington DC, Anthony James, the president of the US was meeting with his army generals to discuss the current situation with China. 'OK,' said the president, 'today we are meeting to discuss our current situation with China.'             'I think we should capture Men-Ching and interrogate him to find out what is going on over there.' said Brad Wickman, the leader of the Marines. After some of the other generals stated their ideas, the president decided that the best course of action to take would be to send a small robot with a lot of microphones and cameras into the China through the Himalayas. That night, a B-2 bomber equipped not bombs, but the little robot, flew over Asia and dropped the little robot into the mountains. The robot fell approximately 2 kilometers away from the secret Chinese military base. The scientists watching the live video directed the robot toward a faint flicker of light up ahead. Soon, the robot reached the base and the fascinated scientists had it roll around the outside until it found a way to get in. The entrance just happened to be where D-39 was being stored. The scientists gasped as they saw the huge killer robot come to life and turned towards it. The robot fled quickly away, but the spy robots little treads were no match D-39's long legs. It quickly caught up to the little droid and blasted to bits with it's shoulder mounted Gatling guns. All of the Chinese scientists came running as fast as their fat little legs could carry them. When they got there, the saw the little pieces of metal on the floor along with some cameras and microphones. 'Oh no,' said one of the scientists, 'D-39, what happened?'   'This little spy entered the complex through my door and me killed it.' replied D-39 mechanically.   'So know the stupid Americans know of D-39. We must attack them right away.' said Men-Ching.             The next day, the first ever foreign attack on the continental US occurred. The Chinese dropped D-39 along with a thousand elite Chinese soldiers.With D-39 leading the attack, the Chinese easily took the unguarded city of Boston. Then, they made their big mistake they decided to stay the night outside of Boston. As the soldiers were sleeping, and D-39 was charging, the Americans bombed their camp with over 50 planes. Every soldier was killed except D-39, whose armor was so good that the bombs had not hurt him severely. His biggest injury was the rockets in his chest exploded when a bomb went of near him. When they blew up, they damaged part of him that kept him in contact with the Chinese and kept him loyal to them.              The next day, when a party of heavily armed US marines, lead by Sergeant Jacob Domalgski, went to see what was left of the Chinese camp. When they got their they found a confused D-39. The soldiers approached him and he didn't fire. He allowed the soldiers to put him on a stretcher and carry him back to their camp, from their, he was sent to the Pentagon where scientist repaired him and made him loyal to the US. The best thing by far they did to him though was gave him the ability to feel emotions and have a personality. As a thanks to the squad of Marines who had rescued him, D-39 asked the leaders if he could join there unit and they said it was fine. Exactly five days later the US, lead by D-39 captured and executed Men-Ching and started a democratic government in China. Finally, the world was at peace again. THE END.

I looked down, all I saw was me, but that wassn`t me, no I was me. I tried to turn my head again, it worked. I was so shocked to see all of me dead, I screamed. I was dead everywhere, they all looked like me. I am a robot, I thought, and I had just awakened, but my fellow mes had not.       2. I was in a room, a room when I woke up again and I was lying on carpet, soft carpet. I looked arounded , and I saw a girl, not much older than four or five, she was lying on a bed sleeping. I looked around again, it was a mess. I quietly got up and went to the door, or so it seems. you see I kind of look like a human with two arms, two legs, and a big head. I then went down the stairs as quietly as possible to the door, when I heard a sound. It was a ear-pericing scream. I closed my eyes. If I was going to get out of here I had to run, quickly and quietly. I tiptoed over to the frount door, opened it, and ran, when a big jerk pulled me back inside.       3. Why am I here I am just a robot and this is not my life, what is going on, I thought. the jerk was very forceful. So, I started kicking and screaminig, when finally the the thing that jerked me back was gone. When it let go I looked back, how stupid could I be, I thought, it was just a door knob. I started running at top speed toward somewhere, I didn`t know where I was going. Since I was a robot I don`t care where I am going, I just want to get out of here and I never get tired. Then a car came and I got hit I by it, I was dead, or so it seems.       4.I couldn`t move, but i could see only the dirty white/black walls. Is theis my life, if it ws I was a goner. Then I heard a noise, what was it. I felt like I needed an oil change. I wsa so energnic. Then I felt something like I couldn`t move it hurt so badly, not like I could move anyway, almost like I got hit by a car and then I was out.       5. When I woke up I was in the hospital and I could move again. I looked down at my clothes, I was me. I felt like getting up but my muscules and nerves did not. Then a nurse came in and asked me what had happened, like I new. Then I said no and then she said I got hit by a car. I was so shocked. Then she asked me how and if I remembered. I said no and she left the room. WHAT DID HAPPEN TO ME?

All he does is look for stuff like aliens but found nothing that's why hes forgotten. One day he found a new species and he called it Swami. They always liked each other because they were both forgotten. In the year 3564 NASA looks at the screen for no reason and they saw the new species called Swami.       They now are sending a NASA rocket ship to find this new alien. It took 5 years for the astronauts get to the galaxy. When they got there they saw a new world of  Species. Then when the crew saw the robot they saw more robots and they all thought there was more planets they could live! 'Can you hear me, crew 375' said captain Brain. 'Yes we can Sir' said the crew members.       The next day the crew decided to explore the new galaxy. Then at the space station had gotten a call that the had gotten attacked by aliens. Marv then heard the crew welching in tears for help. So he went to them and fought off the monster. Then the next day the crew decided that they had to go now and said the would never forget Marv.

Young Timothy green was trying to build a self manuvering robot. 'Timothy! youve been trying to make a sucsessful robot for 8 years are you ever gonna Give up?!' Timothy could feel a sarcastic reply about to burst out of his mouth but he decided not to reply with an attitude. 'Mom ive been working on this project for a very long time why cant you just support it?' Timothy replyed in a staggering voice. 'Well ive been trying to support it honey but youve been doing this for years!' 'Its driving me crazy!' Ohhh Timothy could feel an argument brewing in himself one that which his mother has never seen before. one more thing and he would snap. His mother replyed again but he just decided to ignore it. All through the night Timothy worked efforetsly on his Machine trying to figure out how to get it to work. Until suddenly it said One word 'Hello'. Timothy had been shocked! amazed he called  for his mother in excitment. 'Mom!' 'What' she replyed still mad from the arguement. 'It works my machine said something!!' 'Ok im coming but if this is a lie im gonna get even more mad.' she said sorley. As Timothys mom came down to the basement Timothy gently turned the machine off. 'Ok what is it?' Timothys mom was already down next to him staring at the heap of metal that was suspose to say something. Timothy Pressed the palm of his hand on the ON/OFF switch. He turned it on. The machine replyed with a cold arkward silence. Timothys mother said 'Is this a joke?' 'I have better things to do than sit here waiting for this peice of metal to actually say something.' Timothy replyed in an offended voice 'Hey!' 'It actually did say something! im not lieing!!' 'Yeah and pigs can fly' she replyed in a sarcastac voice as she went back upstairs. Timothy sat there in disapointment his hopes had boosted up a minute ago then another minute his hopes had went way down. In disgust he turned off his machine and went to bed. In Timothys dream he drempt of making a machine that could do all the basic things a human could do. Make food, do chores, e.t.c. But Timothy woke up before he was rewarded the best machine maker in the universe. moaning and grumpy Timothy got up and put some coffe beans in the coffe maker. When it was ready he put the whole brew of coffe and put it into a big mug. After his pleasent cup of bland coffe Timothy changed his cloths and drank the last sip of coffe he went straight to work. Right after going downstairs he heard his mother creeping down the basment doorway. 'What the heck are you doing up so early?!' She said sounding very irritaded. Impatiently Timothy replied 'Im working on my machine.' 'What!' 'Your working on that junk again!?' She said as she pounded up the basment stairs. Timothy whispered to himself agrivated now 'Well good morning to you to.' Timothy just couldnt figure out how he got the machine to say that! he considered rewiring it but that could take a week. 'hmm' he said curious   he wondered if he could make an outlit in his machine then transfer it to the computer and then control it from there. 'Ok i better get working on the outlit' Timothy said excitedly.   'Argg if only i can make the outlit big enough for the cord!' Finally after a hard 6 hours of trial and error he got the cord to fit. 'Ok now i need to set up a program into the computers mainframe and somehow transfer it into the machine.' Timothy decided after making the program he would name it Operation Robot. He made the program so when he typed a word in it would hopefully send it to the robots speakers he installed earlier. Before he could test his masterpiece out he had to instal a tiny little computer onto the robot to transmit the sounds to the speaker. He began on the computer around 8pm at night. He had dosed off around 4:00 AM in the morning. Groggy he woke up around 6:00 AM laying somehow on his workbench. Yet again he made himself some more bland coffe and quietly worked downstairs not to disturb the sleeping lion which his mother was. He turned on the lights downstairs and installed the computer into the robots chest. Then finally he installed the word program into the small computer. He turned the speakers up and booted up his computers. Quietly he walked over to his contraption turned it on slowly then sat down at his computer. Sweating very hardly now he slowly typed in 'Hello how may i help you master?' Then he pressed 'ENTER.' After he pressed that one button it changed his life forever. The robot replied exactly what he wanted it to say. he was dumbstruck after a few minutes of sitting there he jumped up out of his chair ran upstairs pulled the sleeping lion out of bed and brought her downstairs. he told her what he did then she tried the machine out by typing in some words. 'Amazing!!' 'This is incredible!' She said 'Thankyou now do you see what i was doing isnt usless at all?' Timothy said in a proud voice. 'Well you can get back to work' she said as she walked up the stairs. 'Wheres all of the coffe?' his mother asked from upstairs. 'Umm i dont know i dont drink coffe its disgusting.' 'Ok if you say so' his mother said suspiciously. Timothys mind was racing rapidly now if he could make his program do more things this could be even better! He was thinking 'I could make this robot do many more things from just the touch of a button!!' 'Moving, serving, doing simple tasks!' Now Timothy green just began his journey in making robots. The following year Timothy installed all the things he wanted the robot to do his dream had finally come true. After imaging robots and building them ever since he was in kindergarden he reached an amazing accomplishment. Then the next following year he was rewarded a Nobel prize for best invention and many other life achivment prizes. But when timothy was little and in school nobody supported his ideas and imagination so Timothy Green had no friends. And this robot had one simple name it was the name Timothy had kept in his head ever since he was little.'Friend'                                                                                                              THE END                                                                              (P.S hah had he shown them sincerely, Timothy Green).

Anywhere I went it went with me.then when i turned ten I axdentily spiled some water on it i thought it was gone for ever. I whated a couple long hours then it grow and then a aging and next thing I knew it had lost its legs was flying and was about as big as my torso. It had a peace sing on its chest. It emdel went out side and started taking care of the earth like watering my plants and it acttuly found some squrills and started feeding them. Later that day what i was really suprized to see was that it had started a garden which i thought was perrty impresive.                           So it was night time me and all my friends made a huge fort in the back yared and was sleepling in it. we all fell asleep  around 4:00 am we all screamed then we all said ' I had the Stangest dream ever' then of coures we all started gencseing each other. It was funny. Then we all looked up and started screaming agine are dream had came troue every thing around us had been blowen up and all we saw was a little pice of land that were sitting on and a little blue robbot. We all covered are sevels in are blankets and sleeping bages so that only are eyes would show and my robbbot only turned its head around at us and I said ' I think blueberry is a little mad' everyone turned to me and wispered ' you think.' every one got put and we had people volunteer to go down off are cliff first mellisa volunteered to go first but the minetut she pt her toe ont he ground she was gone like  she had fallen to the senter of the earth. so then we what can we do. so we staed there and thought a little longer. then it hit me litterley hit me a peace sign then i thought my robbot has a peace sign on its chest. then i said it agine  but out loud. Then i said 'senec peace means now fighting no wars no nothing and every body is happy the robottos mide is probley over loded with all the bad that goes on in this world that it is powerful eonh i could destore as much of the world it wanted' Then hailey says sarcastcley ' ho really it can destroy the whole world you dont think i can see that' I just stuck my tonge out at her like yousally. I said then 'were did every one  go then both of are phones started ring on my phone it was mellisa and on haileys i was her parents.when we started talking we could here screaming in the back ground they told us every body was stuck in the middle of the earth and that i was akouse me and hailey both said at the same time ' we can here that!' then i said try i calm every one down get friends an family to help you seper them in to boys and girls it is going to take forever 'then well but me on speake phone' i said so they did and then i yelled as loded as i could and i screamed ' quite!!!' and it went huse then i exsplend that if they ever want to come back on earth they will have to mack peace with one other becasue if the dontu will one by one disuper me and my friend are the only ones left on earth beacause this is my robbot that did this so if you all can just be nice to everyone for a little and when you came back to earht if you do please stay that way now let be nice and everyone get apartener from a diffrent country and do every thing you can and no fist if eneyone has a weapon then put it down because that will not help you get back to earth. so then we hang up and we look at the ground beneath us we can see everyone which means they can see us then i tell Hailey we need to my roboot i thouoght there must be a reason it left us then i think well we are best friends . Then i think a little more why is it so far away then i say we need to hold hands to get to the robott seens we still fight but at some point we will for give each other. So we hold hands and we just barley put are toes on and we don't fall and we slowly put are whole body weight on it and we walk. As we walk we slowly start to see plants animals and two by two all of the people come back. when we finally get to my robott i turns around and cungatultses us. At first we are confused but then he tells us ' seens u have worked togther you have brought back life now if some people down under ground dose not learn a to get a long with a least one person you will never see them agine got it.' hailey and I both at the same time say 'got it.' he says 'OK now if this world or your to ever gets out of hand i will come back.' Hailey and i both have to excplane to the robott that in this world there will always be fighting we will never all like each other but all of us can try to get a long a whole lot better.

She had just gotten home from middle school when she heard a strange sound from her bedroom. She thought, oh it must be my guinea pig running on his wheel again. She was far from right. The noise stopped. Hannah wanted to get some markers and colored pencils for her project she was working on for school in her bedroom. What she saw on her bed would change her view on life forever! It was a little robot! It was turned off but Hannah was screaming at the top of her lungs! She wanted to tell her Mom but she was at work, so was her Dad! Hannah was like, 'WHAT THE HECK DO I DO? IT MIGHT KILL ME!' She was so flustered by the idea of a robot of having a in her room, she didn't even notice that it was off! Hannah had to tell someone so she called her best friend, Shannon Bunker to come over.       Shannon was over her house lickity-split! She lived about a half mile down the road. She was as shocked as Hannah was about the robot! They both wondered, how the heck did this robot get in here, and why??? That was a question they could never answer. Finally her parents got home and Hannah told them everything that had happened in the past couple of hours. They were as flabbergasted as Hannah and Shannon were! Hannah showed them the robot in her room. But this time, it wasn't there! Instead it was on the ground, waving at them! This was too much for Hannah. She thought she was going crazy! I know you people in this club would be very shocked if this happened to you! Anyway, the robot was a small fellow, metal and all. He looked very innocent, not a killing machine. Then suddenly, he spoke. He said, ' Hello, my name is Wally. I come from small planet, no people, only robots. I will do no harm. As matter of fact, I'm here to help.' The whole Brown family and Shannon were in complete shock! Hannah stuttered, 'Help with what?'. The robot answered kindly, 'To keep this house clean and to play with everyone, of course!' Hannah finally thought, 'Hey this might be so bad as I thought!' And from then on, the little robot and Hannah became good friends. Also, no one else knows about this robot so you better not tell anyone!

All of her friends had left to goo home so she walked the rest of the way home all by herself. She turned around a corner on the street and saw a metal box, it was shiney so she went over to it. when she walked over and tapped it its arms, wheels,and head popped out. Laney was fritened at first but then it started to talk so now she understood that it was nice. Laney just put everything all together she knew it was robot.       She started to be able to uderstand what it was saying, it told her its name. She couldnt understand at first so she asked it to repeat what it had said. The robot spoke again, ' My name is Roxy.' it said it in its robot voice! Roxy told Laney what her personality was lke and what she enjoyed to do in her free time. Roxy said, ' I enjoy riding around really early in the morning when there is not that much people around to see her, she said that she likes visiting the cars at the dealership beacause they could talk to and they were all the best of freinds.' Laney asked Roxy if she could come home with her so she could tell her mom about her, but Roxy didnt really think that that was such a good idea. Laney was a little sad that Roxy didnt want to come home with her, but could understand.       Laney went home and promised that she would come back there right after school tomorrow. Just as yesterday Laney came off the bus and walked with her friends until they all left and then she went to see Roxy again. Roxy was very happy to see Laney because she could not go to the car dealership because they were having an event so there was a lot of people there. Roxy was so happy to see her that she started riding around in cicles with a bid digital smile on her face. Laney felt really good because Roxy was so excited that she was here. Once again Laney asked Roxy if she would come home with her. Before Roxy said anything Laney  said that she would make sure that nobody saw her. Roxy felt really bad now but again she had to say no because it was to big of a risk. Laney was now sad again because she said no to her again.       That night when Laney was laying in her bed reading a book she heard a noise from outside her window. She went over to her window and saw Roxy sitting out there behind a bush. Laney could still see her though. Laney laughed and went outside she ran up to Roxy and gave her a huge hug. She was so happy to see Roxy that she was jumping for joy. Laney told Roxy to come iside and sleep in her room tonight. She said that she would show her to her mom in the morning when she woke up.

Once in a time a girl found and be-befriended a girl at school.Her name was, ' Cindy Loads.' She was an average girl in a small town with the name, 'Taper Town.' She went to school at Taper Town Elementary School for 2nd Grade. Her first day of school was today! March 21, 2007. Cindy's teacher was Miss Lizzy she was the nicest teacher of all. She was nervous when she stepped on the school bus 214, but when she stepped on the bus a girl with black flats, a red shirt, and black dress pants said,' sit here, with me, come on, please!' Cindy was kind of relieved she had a girl to sit with but she did not know this girl. Cindy sat down with the brightly colored, dressed girl Cindy asked,' what is your name?' The girl said,' nicoliabot.' Cindy was blown away when she said, ' Nicoliabot' because that was an unusual name for a kid in Taper Town.               The Two girls went to class with each other asking a bunch of questions each. One said,' how old are you' and ' when is your birthday' all day long. Nicoliabot sat next to Cindy and Nicoliabot stared at Cindy and she mumbled to herself. Cindy did not get what she was saying but she did not really care because the teacher was talking, ' Hi I am Miss Lizzy you can call me Miss L if you want to!' The teacher let us have snack time and everyone was like, ' HOORAY' except Nicoliabot she just sat there. Everyone had food and drinks but Nicoliabot rapidly ran out of the classroom, Cindy ran after her and said, ' what is wrong?' Nicoliabot did not say a word, but pouted. Nicoliabot went back to the classroom and the teacher said, ' Where were you two' we said, ' we were in the ladies room' Miss Lizzy said,' You need to sign out next time, okay?' 'Okay' we said.We still had snack time and i said, ' Do you want some water?' Nicoiabot said,' GET IT AWAY FROM ME!' Cindy was left with a surprised face in a bad way.               Cindy ran quickly to lunch and caught up with some other friends of hers and Nicoliabot with her head down sitting at a lunch table where no one sat at. Cindy felt sad that she left Nicoliabot by herself, but she screamed at Cindy and that was not appropriate. Cindy went to the hot lunch line and heard someone calling her ,' Cindy' 'Cindy' it was Nicoliabot Cindy said, ' What do YOU want?' Nicoliabot said, ' I want to apologize to you about screaming at you at snack time.' Cindy walked towards her and said,' apology excepted with a hug. Her hug felt hard and rough. I asked Nicoliabot,' what do you have under your jacket' she said,' my clothes?' 'Why?' 'Oh nothing' said Cindy. Cindy asked Nicoliabot,' do you want to come to my house today after school?' Nicoliabot said, ' I will think about it as long as astrobot my dad says yes.' Cindy asked, ' why do all of your names end with bot?' Nicoliabot said,' time to line up for recess!'                Nicoliabot went home and asked her dad, ' can i go over my friend Cindy's house? Please Dad?!' Her dad was surprised that she made a friend on the first day because she was a..... ' Dad do not say it' said Nicoliabot. Her Dad said,' That is fine stay safe, do not reveal!' 'Okay dad, I won't' Nicoliabot said. After she said bye to her family she quickly went out the door she went to Cindy's house. Cindy was really excited in a way, but she knew something was up. Nicoliabot knocked on the door and said,' I am here' *knock* *knock* Cindy answered after the second knock and said,' Hello how are you?' Nicoliabot said,'great!' She rolled herself in Cindy's house where it was cool and cold. They went in her room and Cindy Spotted she was not stepping on the steps she was actually gliding from the steps. Cindy asked,' Are You a ro......' Nicoliabot said,' Yes but keep it a secret i thought you would know at the first day you met me on the school bus. Remember?' Cindy had nothing to say but in her mind she was like I'm friends with a robot that is really cool! I knew that you were some kind of a robot because you ran away from liquid and when i hugged you, you felt like metal and know we are at my house and all your names ended with bot i should have known this at the start and i just found out that you were a robot? ' Yup that is very true' said nicoliabot. 'We are going to be best robot buddies ever right' said Cindy. Of course I am Cindy.

Katie had wings to fly me to school, the robot could shrink to hide itself , Katie could duplicate into anything or anyone, and it could talk.       When i made Katie I checked every wire and little bolts just in case she fell apart. When she awoke it felt great because I made my first robot but of course it was 5:00 a.m in the morning and i had school in 2 hours. Then i  thought well I really want to go t o the moon then i look at the robot that is when it hit me the robot can go to the moon but it will need some claws, a storage, and a camera. I attached it on really fast.      After school I went down to my work shop and did a little few touches and the robot was ready to go to the moon but I had a little problem how is a 12 year old girl going to get a 100 pound robot to the moon? I didn't think of a solution so i gave up and went up to my bedroom to watch some TV. On the news it said the space shuttle is launching tomorrow at 5:30 pm. I'm going and i will camp out in line all night.      At 5:30 it was launching time the robot was already to go to the moon. The pictures were beautiful pictures it was like seeing a new world that you never new about. When I was looking at the camera a astronaut was stuck under a rock. I grab the controls and I got the robot to lift up the meteor and saved the astronaut. Then I flew the robot home.       The next day the president came and asked me my name. I was shocked that the president saw what I did for the astronaut then I said it was nothing. The president said it was something amazing. The president said here is a check for 10,000 dollars and I would like to take the robot and put it on display. I was like yeah sure!      So the president took my robot and i never saw that robot again but I still have that check maybe I should make a new robot someday.

He was also strong he could carry people from one room to the other.  Down the road lived another robot named Dante 2 he was so cool he could go into very hot places and gather information that scientist M needed from the middle of a volcano it was the funnest job ever.   He looked like a spider,so that he can go into the small an hot places.he was almost to the end of the volcano when boom he reached the lava of the   volcano he needed to get some lava for a test so he got out his super gadgets and got a sample it was so hot. He took it to sciences M and he began hi research.       While scientist M did that,the Gemini-scout robot was also gathering stuff to  but he was 2 feet tall and carriers people he saves them when the miners are stuck in small places he gets them out and gives them food and water until the Mr.Shell and Mr.Gower come to help.      All of these robots are very cool but have you herd of the Google self driving robot/car you can sit in him and he drives not you Zoom they zoom by all the other cars as fast as they can going 60,70,80 no 85 miles per hour on the Highway it was so fast the fastest car or robot on the road.Sadly some places don't let you rid this kind of car but in some places they do let you have a Google car.  after they were all done with there jobs they met up at there place and talked and then had dinner.They were all very tiered they had worked a long time and they worked very hard . The next morning they did the same and this is how they all worked and lived.

He did not know how to build a robot so he stole the formula from some scientists who knew how to build robots. Then he made a few modifications to the blueprints to make the his idea to construct some war machines for him to command. Then he took over a factory with his goons and made the factory a place where he could make the robots. He wanted to take over the world because everyone was mean to him when he was little.          One thing he had to do was design the robots to obey his commands. But first he had to construct the actual robot. He made the robots then he equipped them with laser guns. He also figured out that he could program them by powering them with plasma batteries and putting a microphone in there head. So they could all here him when he was telling them orders. Ha ha ha ha 'I am going to make those people that were so mean to me pay.         After he finished constructing the battle machines he said we are going to make those people pay for what they did to me when I was little. Then the battle machines marched off into the city shooting stuff with their laser guns as they went. The police tried to fight back but there were thousands of them. It looked like the battle machines were going to to take over the world. All of the authorities in the world met in a secret spot to try to figure out a way to stop this invasion. After two hours of trying to find a way to beat these war machines. One person spoke up and said why don't we find who is controlling these machines and capture him or her. Great idea everyone said. Meanwhile the city was in complete disarray, the robots seemed impossible to stop they just kept coming. Who will find this mad scientist and stop him from taking over planet earth. To be continued....

When its time to go to the museum, Ken was jumpping and ran to the car and he went to museum. At museum he saw many thing that so cool but what he was so interest about was robot. He thought that was so cool and this happened changed his life.                               When he came back to his house he dreamed something. that dream was to make the really cool robot own self. Then first, he went to the library for get many book about robot. Then he go back to his house as fast as he could and read the book. He interested at robot more after he read the whole book about robot.                  Wjen he got older he was making the robot. Robot was not competed yet, but he was doing well.   After oe year the robot was already completed, Ken named him John. John could, talk and Ken was talk to him everytime. Then John and Ken live the rest of life together.

Here is a story of a small robot, and how she made a huge discovery, even though nobody believed she could.            'Hey!' shouted Amelia Agribot, 'Give that back! It's mine, not yours!'. . . 'Please?' she whispered, to quite for anybody but herself to hear. The popular robots in her neighborhood, Garry Gower, Delia Dante, and Samuel Scout, had just took her arm off, locked it in Garry Gower's cabinet body, and rolled away.              You see, Amelia was a small, defenseless, strawberry-picking agribot. She really wished they hadn't took her arm, not only because it hurt, but because the robotic parts dealer wouldn't be there until next month, and the harvest season  was going to start the next week.            Back at Delia Dante's house, they were all having a good laugh about the way Amelia had reacted. 'Did you see the way she almost shorted herself out with her own tears?' Samuel Scout asked, between laughing fits. 'Hey, do you guys want to have a little fun before we give back her arm?' asked Garry. 'Sure,' said Delia and Samuel. After they went over the plan, Samuel went home, and got an old sack, and came back to Delia's house.            Twenty minutes later they found Amelia  walking down the street alone, with no adults to be seen. They snuck up on her, shoved her into the sack, and stuffed the sack into Garry's cabnit. Garry locked the cabnit, and they rolled up a steep hill. From there Delia took the sack, and rolled down into a steep volcano. She then tied a rope to the top of the sack, grabbed one end, and rolled out. Then Samuel held the rope and begun to bounce it closer and closer to the hot magma. Amelia just huddled in a ball and sobbed, sure that she was facing certain death, when Samuel dropped the rope. The odd thing was that, even though he had dropped the rope and Amelia's arm, Amelia could feel ground, and she wasn't dead.            For an hour she struggled to get out of the sack, and when she finally did, she wished she hadn't. In the volcano, she could see molten chunks of metal that looked an awful lot like robot frames. When Amelia calmed down a little, she noticed that the ground she was standing on was shimmering in a color she had never seen before.  I wish I could leave!  Amelia thought. This place is crazy! As she thought the ground became brighter, and Amelia closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she was back on her street.            Wow! Wait till I tell Mom and Dad! Amelia thought as she rolled her fastest towards her house. After she showed her parents, they told the whole neighborhood, and they all came to Amelia to grant wishes for them, and Garry, Delia, and Samuel never messed with her again.

I used to work in the dress making district in where I measured, cut, and sewed delicate silk. I had a built in ruler that helped me measure accurately. I had been painted pearly white (my commander, Alice's, favorite color).            Yes, that was my life until Edgar came. Edgar is a prince. A nosy little pain-in-the-neck prince. Edgar is 6 years old and thinks he is already the king.             It was Thursday. A lovely Thursday. I was cutting 34 inches of mirrored silk for the queen when Edgar came in. Alice was not with me at the moment. She had gone to the market to get some oil (I had been working in the rain and got a little rusty). 'Alice', he called out.             'Alice isn't here', I said from the back room.

The reason his name is chiropratic robotic is because he mainly does massages he can do other stuff he makes me hope that one day i can have enough money that I can run a store called the robotics massage ther will be robots everywhere and they will all give massages and will give people like my friends emerson,hannah,and jenea whatever food that they want.            emerson said to me Abbey how much will this cost and Abbey said oh its on the house. to all of you this place is just for you. would you guys want to come over my house tonight i have a robot called the speak alot that can tuck us in and bring us whatever midnight snacks that we want it to.             Jenae said that sounds great does that sound good to you guys Emerson and Hannah said that sounds absolutly great yay said abbey lets go. as soon as they got home they saw a disaster the robots had started a party everyone had to chip in to help they had to shut down the robots and clean up the mess .            Abbey said instead of cleaning up the mess our self i have a robot in my closet called the cleaner upper and then everybody yelled noooooooooooooooooo no more robots we will clean it up our selfs.

Then as I looked back all the charecters started coming out of the paper. first the robot army started coming out then the evil robot king came out came out they all of a suden ran for all the stores and taking all the people in their way prisoners. This was going on for hours and then i figured out how to stop them. the police did not stop me from running and grabbing the soaking wet paper that started it all. i got ran home and added a new part to the writing I wrote that there was another stronger force the the on that was already freed from the paper. Once I finished that part I brought it outside and brought it to were it all started.then same thing happened but this time the robots were on my team.                                     The battle was on. Finally there was a way to stop them and that way was happening we were wining after the battle was done everything was back to normal except all the good robots were still in the U.S.A so we put them to work in our army. That rain was weird and never happen again and the rain was also never never explained.

Every day he went to baby sit his neighbor, who happened to be a little robot girl named Jessie CopperBottom. Together they would Sing, Dance, and he even was giving her lessons on how to play the piano. Jessie loved spending time with him while her parents were out working somewhere out in Robot City. Although Albert enjoyed to spend time with her as well, he decided he might have to find a better job because he felt he was finally old enough to start his life. But breaking this to Jessie wouldn't be so easy.      Albert was hoping maybe he could find her a replacment babysitter, so he could do something more exciting with his life, rather then spend everyday doing the same thing.   So Albert set out looking for a replacment babysitter for Jessie. He wanted to make sure he found someone really special for her, someone who could sing, dance, and do everything they once did. Although Jessies parents could probably find a new babysitter themselves, Albert felt he should wait to tell them, until he could find the perfect new babysitter himself. He figured if he didnt, his parents would hire anyone without Jessie's opinion on them. He wanted be make sure Jessie would like the new sitter.       So Albert set out on a long quest to find the perfect sitter.   he started out by searching the internet for sitters. He contacted two, that seemed okay,         	NNP NNP , VBD DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP NNP VBD CD NNS , JJ NNS , CC JJ NN NNP NNP NN PRP VBD TO VB NN PRP$ NN , WP VBN TO VB DT RB VBN NN VBN NNP NNP NNP PRP MD VB , NNP , CC PRP RB VBD VBG PRP$ NNS IN WRB TO VB DT NNP NNP VBD NN NN IN PRP IN PRP$ NNS VBD IN VBG RB IN IN NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD TO VB NN IN PRP$ IN RB , PRP VBD PRP MD VB TO VB DT JJR NN IN PRP VBD PRP VBD RB JJ RB TO VB PRP$ NNP CC VBG DT TO NNP MD RB VB RB NNP NNP VBD VBG RB PRP MD VB PRP DT NN NN , RB PRP MD VB NN RBR JJ IN PRP$ NN , RB RB VB NN VBG DT JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD RP VBG IN DT NN NN IN NNP NNP VBD TO VB JJ PRP VBD NN RB JJ IN PRP , NN WP MD VB , NN , CC VB NN PRP RB NNP NNP NNPS NNS MD RB VB DT JJ NN NNS , NNP VBD PRP MD VB TO VB PRP , IN PRP MD VB DT NN JJ NN NNP NNP VBD IN PRP VBP , PRP$ NNS MD VB NN IN NNP POS NN IN NNP NNP VBD VB VBN JJ NNP MD VB DT JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD RP IN DT JJ NN TO VB DT NN NNP PRP VBD RP IN NN DT NN IN NNP NNP VBD CD , IN VBD NN ,	1		20131022161051	2351	2		20131022161038	2348	0		20131024171056	2402	1

Mr.Cuddlebear said.' sheesh you are one cold uncuddly cuddle bear sir'.'just go'said Mr.Cuddlebear'.Ok bye'.           After that experience he jumped off a cliff and fell off of sky island. then he fell onto the surface were he lived in a junk pile in the middle of nowhere.but before he landed he got swooped up by a giant bird.' let me go' sledge demanded. 'cacacookolfsarawrcooooooo' the bird replied.'well that was an awkward answer now WILL YOU LET ME GO!'. jus then he was let go right in front of the gas station. 'oh hi and sorry for yelling at you will you come and work for me again'. sure said sledge and they never fought again.       The moral to this story is: there is no moral.

No one has ever seen a living robot before. He does not believe he will ever see a living robot that can talk or do human like things, but he has no idea that his dream will, one day, come to life.               It was a normal day. The radiant sun shone upon the home where John lived in the country. It was the perfect to read his favorite book, Robots. This was John's very favorite book, because it talked about a robot coming to life and becoming best friends with a boy, just like John. As John started reading his imagination started growing bigger, until 'John!' yelled his mother. He replied 'What, I was just in the middle of my story!' She always interrupted him.'We are heading to town, so come get ready were leaving in 5 minutes!' she yelled again. John never had time to himself. He always had a few minutes at a time to read his book. Arrg he thought and headed down stairs.                 As they walked into town, John's mother stopped to get the newspaper like usual, but something caught his attention. There on the street was a magician, that smiled at him! Magicians never came rarely came into this part of town,or smiled at people like he had. 'Mom! we have to go and see the magician.' he beseech-ed. 'Not today honey we need to get home.' she replied.'But mom... please?' he pleaded, and with that she replied 'Oh fine but not that long okay, maybe one trick.' cool he thought and they headed towards the way John spotted him, but nobody was there! Just a note and some potion that he'd left behind. 'Sorry sweetie,' his mother said. John was sad, but at least he saw the magician and maybe the potion was meant for him, so he took it when none was looking.                  When he'd gotten home he went to his bedroom locked the door and starred at the potion. He imagined of all the things it could do. When he spotted the note attached to it. It said Dear potion user this will give you only one wish, but give you memories to last forever. Let the adventures begin. Wow John could'nt wait to use it, so later that night he wished for a robot that would beecome his best friend forever.                   In the morning John had a smile on his face and he went down stairs to have breakfest. He got down and searched every where until his mother asked, 'What on earth is wrong John?' He answered 'Um... nothing i just lost something.....oh found it got to go.' And with that he left the room. Where could it be he wondered. Then a strange noise made him jump he looked in his closet and there in front of his eyes a robot was coming to life! It was making a noise like a computer does when it boots up. He could'nt believe it a real life robot he'd be the first one to discover it, amazing! He wanted to tell his mom, but could'nt she get mad at him for taking the potion in the first place. He said I'll call you 'My name is John.' Then he almost jumped to space when the robot said,' Hi John.' He didnt know what to do what would he do about him? 'Come with me' he whispered ' Okay.' The robot said back. They managed to sneak outside and they went to the back yard. After a whole day of teaching sheldon what to do, John's mom came out, wondering where John had been. 'What is that!' she screamed. 'It's.. my uh... robot?' he said not knowing if she was going to to punish him.'Where did you get it?' she said. ' From the potion I took'opps he had'nt meant to say that,but it aws too late his mom went off telling him how its wrong to steal and he told her about the magician and that he'd smiled at him and that the potion was meant for him. Then she'd said 'Okay I believe you, but we have to get this into town and give it back okay?' she said sincerly.'Yes mom.'As they took the robot back. John would never forget the robot and the day that he'd shared with him, and the memories they had. They saw the magician agian and returned the robot along with what happened th emagician thanked him and John whispered 'Goodbye' and so did the robot.

Perhaps it was the shape, it was much more square shaped than the others.  Maybe it was the fact that it was an older model, ancient in fact, a prototype for the newer more advanced robots that soon replaced our our old ones.  But I never thought that it was because it could come to life.       It all started one morning when we were donating some of our older robots to museums so that people could look at them and remember how we used to not depend on them so much.  We always fixed our robots up before giving them away, and this one in particular needed fixing. It had large rust spots everywhere and there were remains of the blue and green paint that had once coated the entire robot.       We decided to work on the inside of the robot first.  But as soon as we lifted it up onto the table, it came to life.  It was a spectacular sight, the paint reappeared as if it had never come off and it looked new and bright shining like a jewel.  Then all of a sudden it hopped off the table and ran out the door yelling, 'I'm free.  What took you guys so long to let me out.' It surprised me very much because our robots only speak when spoken to and this one had a mind of its own.       I found it eating ice cream in the cafeteria and chatting with the  cafeteria robot. It was very strange because the cafeteria robot hardly ever spoke and there it was, chortling and smiling. I ran up to the little talking robot and asked for it's name, it suddenly seemed at a loss for words. It squeezed its eyes tightly together and it shrank before my very eyes. All of the people in the cafeteria were wide eyed bcause even our most advanced military grade robots could only shrink to half of their size, and here was an ancient robot shrinking to the size of a flea. Goes to show how peeople in the old days did know a lot.       The robot seemed to have disappeared, but then my tracking device started beeping, it was outside next to an anthill that was close to an underground quartz mine. I decided to call in our mining robots  called subterrabots. They located the mischevious robot and brought him to me. To my surprise all three of the robots were smiling slyly. The little robot shot a stream of water into my face, it was not pleasant.Then I realized what all of our robots were missing. We were so focused on how to make them better that we forgot how to make them fun.This was why the little robot had been trying to tell me all day, why it didn't tell me in words. I don't know, but it did tell a good message.  After that I decided to give all of our robots a break and played a little game of soccer (the robots won). The most important thing was that everyone enjoyed it, well almost everyone. The military robots at first were angry and wanted everyone to go back to work, but after talking to the ancient robot they decided to join in.           We never sent another robot to the museum again and thanks to the little robot we all learned to have fun. But it still had to be controlled somehow so we  decided to make it do some cooking every week, it was a great cook and after that work was always exciting.

At that time no one used cars, in fact most of the children didn't even know what a regular car was. All that there was at that this time is flying cars, technology, and robots. Now robots are everywhere, moving around, doing work, and helping people. After all of that robots were still not alive. Imeen they were programed but I think that people who have their own minds is alive to me. But I never saw eye to eye with robots. I always thought that someday they would get back at humans for making then do all of their dirty work. But no one believed crazy old me......

Well, VOSO-G is a well operated invention that can help you get through your everyday life with doing everything simple, and relaxing. VOSO-G is about 3 feet tall, even though it's not very big it can pull/carry anything that's 712 lbs. VOSO-G looks like a giant blob of jelly with a mustache. With convertible or changeable arms and tools under its mustache, the giant blob of jelly is very smart. This superior robot can talk. The VOSO-G can do things from practicing volleyball with you to saving lives.        I woke up this morning with a huge stomach ache, but I didn't worry about it because i knew my VOSO-G would take care of it, it was the same routine everyday, if I needed anything I would say 'VOSO-G! Can you please come here?' With respectful manners, as usual, my VOSO-G would here my voice calling him and he would sprint to me. My parents are always at work, so usually VOSO-G takes care of me. When he came, I would tell him what I needed. Currently, I obviously need some medicine. I'm Gabby, 16 year olds usually take care of theirselves, they're suppose to be responsible and hardworking, but I'm too lazy to do almost anything, I'm honestly a slob. That's why I have VOSO-G.        I know what you're thinking, aren't 16 year old's supposed to be in school? Well, I don't really care about school, school is like a boring prison! I have to go anyways though, or I'd be stuck at Summer School all summer, i actually have something better to do. I'm flunking in almost EVERY subject already. I usually go to Dunkin' Donuts everyday before school. Well I should really be on my way.        As I walk outside to my Lamborghini Revention I forgot the keys to my car inside, but no need to worry, VOSO-G converted his jelly hands into keys so I just used that for the rest of my day. Dunkin' Donuts had a huge line! VOSO-G whispered in my ear (loud enough so I could hear it from my backpack) 'Ain't nobody got time fo dat! I'll just make you a coffee myself!' I slowly walked out of Dunkin' Donuts and into my Lamborghini Revention. VOSO-G slowly pulled out a mini Coffee Maker under his mustache. My backpack wiggled and moved. I said to VOSO-G ' Hurry Up! I'm already 7 minutes late fore school!' Suddenly there was a silence and VOSO-G slowy popped out of my backpack with a fresh cup coffee carefully balancing on his head.

All except for young Tim who wants to ask his science teacher about the upcoming Quiz. Mr. Lou, would you be alright if i stay after for some extral help. i am a little bit behind on my notes. Sure thing Timmy, if you need any help come and ask me, says Mr. Lou. Tim does all of his work but on his way out He notices a Robot that is in a cabinet by the door. He thinks that he sees it move but instead he moves on.        The next day during science class they have the quiz. it is dead silent in the room. I think that it is even possible that you could hear a pin drop. But suddenly something breaks the silence. Suddenly the cabinet door gets swung open and out walks the seven foot tall metal robot. There is a loud and long women's scream as the principal, Mrs. Joseph walks into the room. Great timeing Mrs. Joseph, says Mr.Lou sarcasticly as Mrs. Joseph runs out of the room.        Everyone in the room seems to be frightened except for Mr. Lou. Children, children, Mr. Lou says calmly. Do not be frightened, this is my creation, actually it was supposed to be a surprize for the Science Fair.  Although it isn' t much of a secret since Mrs. Joseph saw it. Anyway this robot is harmless and it can actally help people very well. It has a mind of its own which is very useful. The way it can help you is by studying and learning. The way that it helps me is by correcting your papers. This school could be completely different with a lot of these around.         The next day just about the entire schoo had heard about it. Everbody was fascinated bu Tim was in awe. All that he could think about was how the robot could help him study. He could be a straight A student. No more staying after school for hours at a time. All of his studying could be done in ten minutes. It would be a dream come true.

So I went over to it and poked it. It felt like metal and is was purple. I walked all around this thing. It was just a little square. Then all of the sudden little eyes popped up!! That really scared me. Then little arms, legs and a head!! When it was done, I figured out it was a little robot. It was so cute. Then it just said 'hi!' all nice and happy. I just said 'hi?' I didn't know what to do!                   After a while of examining it, I just walked away. Then it started following me home!!! I said 'stop following me!' but it didn't stop. So I said 'OK come home with me.' Then the robot smiled at me. I didn't know what my mom was going to say about it. When i got home my mom said, 'what is that thing?' So i said 'a little robot.' Then I brought it up to my room. I asked if it is a girl or boy, it said girl. I just said, 'OK.' Not knowing what to do with her.                    The next day I told her I had to go to school and she said 'OK.' So then I left to go to school. When I was at school my mom called and said my robot was gone! That was at the end of the day. When I walked out of the school building, I saw my little robot! She was sitting there waving at me. I ran over to her and picked her up and said, 'we have to go home.' That's because I didn't want anybody to see her and ask a lot of questions. Then I walked home with a little robot walking next to me!! When I got home I said to my mom that she came to pick me up from school.    ...                      It has been a week now of having her and I still haven't gave her a name! So I went up to her and said 'your name will be... Molly!' Then she yelled, 'YES!!' She was so happy. I felt good that I made her happy. Then I said  'do you want to be even more cute?' She said 'yeah.' So then I painted some pretty flowers on her. She was happy again. Molly is so nice and always does what I say. One time she even did my homework for me!                      I think I will get to keep Molly until I die! Mostly because she is a robot and wont ever die. I just think of her as a little sister and that is what I always wanted. Molly helps a lot around the house. Like cleaning and things like that. I really love Molly, she is the best! At first I thought she was just a weird little robot but she is NOT! So don't go around thinking I am weird because I am walking around with a little robot! :-)     	DT NNP NNP NNP CD NN PRP VBD VBG CC PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NNP NNP VBD RB VB WP PRP VBD . .

I didn't want to get up at all but I had to so I got up and went to work. When I arrived at work the Scientific Robotic Creation Center(SRCC). Went inside and went to my station(programming the robots to do stuff like pick up blocks and they can even do the Harlem shake if I programmed them to). So when I got to my station I noticed something on my desk, it was a present. It was big so I figured it was just some cooking supplies from my Grandma. I hesitated for a second but then I got out my pocket knife and opened it. Turns out it was a robot.   'WOW! Its a ERG-6. I shouted full of joy.' 'I wonder what it does.' I say curiously.   'Hey Montes you get the new robot?' Jorge Said.   You know I did bro. I said back.   Any way Montes get to programming it it will speak and dance and many other things. Says Jorge.           Later that day after I finished my work for the day I decided to take the robot home with me. When I got home I turned the robot on and tested what it was capable of. I told him to do the Harlem shake. It said: 'Wheres the music?' And I said are you challenging me little man.   Maybe I am. The robot said back.           And the two were in a fresh dance   battle to see who does The Harlem   Shake better turns out the robot did.   The robot lived happily ever after   because he became a millionaire, star,   and playbot. As for Montes he lives   as a multi-billionaire for programming   the worlds most awesome robot               THE END 	JJ DT NN NN IN NNP POS PRP VBD TO PRP IN PRP VBD RP IN NNP NNP VBD RB VB TO VB IN IN DT CC PRP VBD TO RB PRP VBD RP CC VBD TO NNP NNP NNP VBD IN NN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP .

Small groups of kids trudged down the steps beside me, tired from their after-school study session. I dug through my backpack for my phone rummaging through the crumbled notes and large binders. I heard an ear-splitting honk from the street. I looked up to see a shiny sleek sedan pulled over in front of the school. I sprinted towards the black vehicle. 'Hey, Mom.' I said, opening the door.

Timmy was walking home with his dog R.U.F.F( Robotic utility for fun) When he walked into his room he saw his his B.E.S ( Best Entity to Sleep) was gone and all his other robots. 'M.O.M' (Master of Mistake). No one answered. Timmy was worried that some alien had robbed them or worse the R.H.G. ( Robotic Hater Gang) Then he heard a bang it was upstairs where the R.R.C (Robotic Recharge Center). When he went up there he got knocked out by something that felt like one of the kids at S.C.H.O.O.L( Special Child Office Only Learning)       Timmy wakes up to see his M.O.M but much different. Her hair wasn't so heavy and hr metal was replaced with skin. Timmy was all confused because R.U.F.F was also licking him but it didn't seem to be water but something his Grandpa had called saliva and that the government made sure no one can have saliva. Some times he wished that his Grandpa would return from the hospital. Just when M.O.M starts to talk ' Listen us robots have one main job to teach you how not to be selfish. Me and Ruff decided to become human so you can learn your lesson.'. ' M.O.M I don't understand how am i supposed to learn. I'm not selfish first and I try to tell you guys that i wanna get my shirts on by myself.' Timmy rushes out the door to see that the other robots are human too. Maybe he is just dreaming he thinks to him self. Boom.       Timmy wakes up to see everything is back to normal. He rushes downstairs to see M.O.M cooking breakfast. 'M.O.M I'll cook ok' Timmy says. M.O.M looks at him funny but gives him a slight nod to say he may.

People preparing the Agribots and Choppabots for the festival. Nick was sleeping in his bed. 5:49 read the clock. 11 minutes until the great bell rang. every September 22 the Great Bell rang with clash farmer all over Boltsville and Nuts Central would harvest the biological enhanced foods and cut down the sturdiest tree possibly grown. This one sturdy tree was made when a 21st century scientist put the molecules of uranium into a grow-able seed. It took 3 years to grow and were always chopped down and harvested on September 22. Nick was only 17. 21 is the age at which you start the harvesting, chopping and replanting.                    Nick woke up at the Great Bell's screeching. As the Great Bell clanged Nick went and got his personal robot. Every kid in the 39th century had robots as pets. Normal pets were getting extinct due to bad treatment. It is now illegal to have animal pets. Nick's robot was a rover with a square meter of solar panels that produced 8000 Volts a second. The robot, Argo III was 2 feet tall. Argo III had all terrain treads and rockets for quick transportation. Argo III can charge Iphone 809 and Ipad mini 792 in 26 seconds. This vehicle has safe storage areas to put your wallet or other important objects in.               Argo III can also turn into a baby Ocelot robot. In the Ocelot form Argo III can run and find something up to 100,000,000 kilometers away. The Ocelot form of Argo III can run up to 290,884 kilometers per hour. Argo III in the Ocelot form can be taught tricks like real cats. Nick wakes up with a cup of nutritious citrus fruit blended into a smoothie. In the 39th century there are many problems about civilizations. people are claiming land and fend off their territory from trespassing humans. Nick was son of Joseph ruler of the mythological civilizations. Every Sunday (today) people would great the gods at high noon. This was Nick's favorite part of the day. Seperating Boltsville and Nuts Central was Mount Olympus II.                Afternoon nick rode Argo III over Mount Olympus II when he saw an unusual storm approaching.

This robot was pretty much a normal person who could eat,sleep, and go to the bathroom!! My robot wasn't always famous, he had been created in Holmes Chapple England by an old toymaker and he was given to Harry as a gift.He was  actually  Harry Styles favorite toy while growing up because he looked exactly like him! The coolest thing about this robot is this robot also grows old,so when Harry is 16 the robot will still will still look exactly like him.                    The robot would help Harry on his home work and he would tutor him while growing up. Harrys sister Jemma would always get into fights with Harry and his robot friend because they have the same personality. While Growing up Harry had a terriffic singing voice and the Harry Styles robot had helped him with voice warm ups all the time.When harry had audditioned for the x-factor Harry had grown out of his robot so he had sold it on e-bay for alotta money. My grandmother has seen that he was seeling it and bought it for me since im a major one direction fan (thats the name of the band Harrys in) 	NNP NNP NNP . . . .

The geminni-Scout is less then two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and can take sharp turns and also roll through water. Geminni-Scout can even carry food, water, and other supplies. For coal minners the Geminni-Scout can test the air to check for gasses. If the air is safe the Geminni-Scout informs the coal minners that the air is safe for them to do their work.                      The Geminni-Scout can also go into volcanos to experience what they are like in the inside. They can survive the high-heat air the volcano has and is controlled by the scientists that are safe in their labritories.The Geminni-Scout can also detect the air for warm temperatures that help find lost or trapped coal minners. Once the lost or trapped coal minners are found they can use its two-way radio to talk with the rescue team.

She had always wanted to make a robot herself but didn't have the time to do it. her stepfather Minister Pete of the city of Boise was not very nice. Her mother had just died in a car accident. and he was very strict. Lillian would always call her stepfather Pete, Just Pete. Her little sister Clare was very stubborn and her older brother Mike had just left for college.                                                 ***      One cold winters night a blizzard was going on. Even though it was cold outside Pete made her feed their horses and hogs. She went out side in her overalls and heavy coat as she went to feed the horses, see got a wonderful idea. What if there was a robot who looked just like me and did my chores that i have to do! That would make life so easy she thought. I could go make friends and have sleepovers without having to miss any of my chores. After feeding the last hog she went inside cold but excited. She ate dinner and then went strait to her room to start planning the design of her dream robot. The robot would have the same straight black hair as her and the same brown eyes and pale skin.          It would also have cameras in the eyes she decided so she didn't miss anything she needed to do, like to iron Pete's shirt. The robot would have a compartment in her torso where she could store valuable items and money. The robot would be called Lilly for short. No one would know about Lilly besides her self only because she didn't have any one who could share her secret with, at least not yet. Then a discouraging idea came to mind she told her self out load' What am i going to make this robot out of? How is it going to work? Clare came in the room just then. 'Hows what going to work,' she asked. 'How am i going to work if i die because I'm not getting enough sleep because my little sister is tiring me out,' I replied. 'Well, that means I would get your room and I wouldn't have to listen to you complaining while you pick up all my toys that I said that you through out,' she said with a smirk planted firmly on her fat cheeks. 'Goodnight,' I groaned.           As i went to bed i dreamed of what it would be like without Clare to come and get me in trouble for things we both know I didn't do. Then in my dream an escape plan popped into my head. What if i were to run away. I'd be free. I would have to get many clothes so i could change I'd bring all my money i had saved up. with is now at least $205. So i gathered all I needed and set of. it was very cold out side but at least the snow had stopped. I went all the way to the market place. I knew as soon as i had set off this was all for my robot design Lilly.           I stole a bike and rode around until I had to stop, and a few minutes later I heard an alarm clock ringing and realized that I was only dreaming all of it Clare, mike, and Pete were all dreams I had experienced. They were all in my head and by my side there was my human like robot Lilly. With her black hair, pale skin, and brown eyes holding what was my breakfast,and for the first time that day i was very happy. seeing Lilly had made my day and then i realized i was crying. It was like a happy ever after.

So I finally bought all the parts and it costed a lot of money.                                                    So next I went online and looked up how to build a robot on YouTube. It gave so many that were so confusing so I finally found one that taught me how to do the brain and how to do the body works. it also taught me how to make it more proficient. It tough me how to make him do my chores and how to climb walls.                           When  finally got him finished he didn't work but he wouldn't turn on so I go on YouTube look up how to fix a robot and it said 'The most common mistake is the battery or the brain isn't charged'. So I thought that stupid they usually come out of the package charged so then i went trough it all and fixed it up even more then I tried to turn it on and it didn't  work.                                                                        So finally after a month my dad helps me and the only thing wrong with it was the battery and the brain so we had to charge both. then finally we turned it on and it was so smart, fast, and it could climb anything, it could do back flips, and front flips. So now I know when it says that you might wont to try charging it you might wont to charge it.

But what he did not realize is there was one little gear out of place the he  had kicked back in so they where spinning. And as he closed the door the light blue gleaming eyes lit up.          He slowly began to move him self to the tools. After he got there he began to fix the pieces that had fallen off. After he fixed is leg he began snooping around. it was a distant yell that made him freeze almost as fast as he herd it. 'Lets go Tommy',said what he thought was a female voice. After he herd a car drive away he opened the shed door as he did he herd a soft creeek. He slowly walked across the lawn. Then he herd it it almost sounded like he knew it was the sound of glass breaking he rushed in only to find...a man. A man in all black with a black mask on. The robot said'How do you do?' but before he could say anything the robber dashed out of the house. The robot was confused was the man frightened by him? He felt sad. So he cleaned the glass up and slowly with his head down he walked back to the shed.        When they got back they didn't even realize what had happened. The boy just went to his room and played but later he came to the shed just to see the robot standing there the big blue eyes.'Hello',it said the boy said 'H-hello'.'Can you fix me to make me look nice ?'he asked.'Like upgrade you?'the boy asked. 'Yes'it said.And the boy walked out the door stunned. The next day the boy came back with new paint pieces.          So the boy fixed the robot and then painted it blue and white.The robot wanted to meet the family so the boy took him the parents nearly jumped out of their seats once they saw him. They said who is this? He said it my robot friend I made him.The robot told them about the robber and they decided to keep him. later on they realized the bond between the child and robot and they could not hold the smile off their faces.

I would make my robot indestructible because it can help humans do extremely hard things to do. I would also make a self destruct button because if the robots wanted to rid the world of humans and turn on us just destroy them with that button.                 First off if I had to choose the things my robot would do I would make it do anything I wanted it to do because if you needed your room clean by dinner activate the robot so it could clean your room. If you need house protection just tell your robot 'house protection activate.' then it will protect your home like a dog. If you like to play games the robot will and can play with you it can play any type of game you choose it to play. It can also help you with homework and talk and a lot more.             Next off the batteries are as indestructible as the outside of the body and the batteries run out every three years unless you charge the batteries and I would put the self destruct in the batteries. The batteries are located in the programing chip in the back of the head  this is where it learns new things from humans including  how to speak other languages. The batteries are made out a metal called titanium and is very hard to destroy. A good thing about the batteries is that they don't give off pollution.             Finally how the robot changes its form is simple you just have to say the animals name. If you like dogs ask your robot to change into one. one cool thing about when it changes is that it still acts like a normal animal. if you like dinosaurs ask your robot to change into one it is as simple as a,b,c if  you want the animal you have chosen just say tame animal like if you choose a lion then say tame.              As you can see that the robot I would create  would have the things it could do, the batteries, and how it transforms.This is what my robot would be.

It looked a lot like a human and had lots of the same features as a human. When they finished they tested it and it seemed to be working fine. They left it outside because there was no space were they usually put the robots. They put a white sheet over it just in case it rain. Later that day it did start to rain but it also was thunder and lighting. SH-3P0 got shocked by lighting and SH-3P0 came to life. 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' he shouted as he ran away from the lab. He ran and ran until he saw a rocket ship. he climbed it until he reached the top. astronauts were entering the rocket ship as he climbed to the top. ' are ready for the countdown' said one of the astronauts in the speaker. The rocket ship started to count down. '10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ignition'  the rocket ship burst into the air when SH-3P0 was still in it. SH-3P0 went into space. He went to the moon and stayed there for the rest of his life. most of the time he felt lonely and depressed. But he found out that mars is having a party. He was happy he could see species. So he got his jet pack and went to mars.

Try the remote. See if she works! (robot rolls forward) YES! I'm clean en out my locker in the morning this baby is going to school for me! Thank god. I can't take Mrs, Hopkins anymore! I can be in school without going to school. Through the camera on the top I can see my class and do my work from home. All my worries are over. The next day I went into the school and got everything out of my locker. I said goodbye to all my friends and teachers and left. I got in the car pulled the remote out of my pocket and pushed forward on it. My robot rolled into school and strait to class. When I got home I turned on my computer and I could see into my class. Finally at the end of the day I rolled the robot into the school ofice where i powered it down for the night. That was the best day of school ever! The next time I go to school is for a field trip. And when Mrs, Hopkins started yelling I just turned off the mike. This is the first time I have ever said this but I can't wait for tomorrow. What did my mom say to that? She said WHAT THE ROBOT!

Billy living so close to the beach and his school was all ways happy when it sunny.      School was a breeze for him he did not really care for school though he just fell asleep in class and woke up just before he was going to his next class. Science class is what bored him the most. So he just told himself Just go to sleep. He fell asleep when the teacher was talking about something huge around the corner. But that was all Billy heard before he fell asleep.       The next day, Billy got very ill and had to stay home and go to the doctor's office. The doctor said,' Billy has come down with a bad case of the cold.'In Billy's mind he was happy because that meant he would have to miss school for 4 weeks. Little did Billy know the huge thing around the corner was 5 weeks away.        When the 4 weeks were over Billy came in his Science class and noticed that robots were all over classroom. The teacher and the students all looking at him without a word. Then one of them said,'Billy where is your robot?'. On the inside Billy was panicking he had no idea that he was needing to bring a robot to school.        ' So I am thinking that since you got sick and stayed home your robot is done and fully functioning.', said the teacher.       In Billy's mind he was now terrified because now he has to have a fully functioning robot.       'And if you don't bring one by next week you will fail 8th science. ' said the teacher.       All day Billy was thinking what the robot was going to do and how to fix any glitches it might have. All day he just thought that 'F' could be on his report card.       Then it hit him, what if I make a robot that could do my homework. Then I could just play outside and never have a worry in my life.        He got to work right away and in 4 days he had a robot made from various things he found in his house. But, instead of working out the bugs he left to play on the beach. When he came back he had the machine do his homework. He was so proud but...All that touching it make water slip through a crack in a metal bar that lead straight to the motherboard and with it getting wet the machine got a bug and instead of printing right answers it started printing wrong answers.        On the day of the robot experiment Billy lost due to 'false answers and because the robot was to do something for the environment'. Billy also learned it had to clean up plastic pollution. He told himself' I will never sleep in class or I might miss something very important'.

The reason i loved that robot was because she would make my life much easier for me. The reason she did that was because she always landed me a hand when i needed help. She would always help me with my chores and every time i am watching a movie with my older brothers she would always bring me some popcorn or she would bring us some beverages.                                      She would also help me with my homework every time i got stuck with a problem. The way i felt for her was like if she was my very own sister. Also, she would not just help me with my life, she would even help the life gard to safe the people that are not really good at swimming. Also, i am not the only one who gets to use her, she also helps the doctors with their patients so that the doctor will also not have to be rushing from one place to the other.                            The other reason i really like her is because she is very loving with the animals. She would be a very good animal sitter she loves animals as much as i do. Her favorite animals are the dogs, cats, horses, etc. She would not harm any kind of animal. The other reason i like her is because she even gets to go help the scientist all over the world. The last thing she could do is talk,she could talk in Spanish, English and Portuguese.                                 So if you want a robot you should really get one like mine. Also you should remember that she gets to talk Spanish, Portuguese and English. She also gets to help the scientist, and the life gurds so if you think that my robot is awesome then you should get one like mine.

Gonzalo was happy with his life in Castroville because it wasn't as loud as where he lived before he came to there. Then, one day when he got home from school his dad brought in a big box. Gonzalo was curious what was in the box so he went to ask his dad.   'Its something that will change our lives' answered Gonzalo's dad. 'but whats in it' asked Gonzalo. ' you will have to wait till your sister gets home from school' he said. When his older sister Amanda got home from school Gonzalo's dad asked everyone in the house to come to the living room. When everyone came to the living room and he was going to open the box. When he opend the box everyone was shocked when they saw a big metal robot standing in the box.                    Gonzalos dad explained to his family that the robot was to help around the house. Everyone was surprised to see a robot in their living room. The dad asked if Gonzalo wanted to name it so Gonzalo named the robot Rob. That night they had to take it outside because it was really big and it barely could fit in the house. While Gonzalos family was sleeping a lightning storm was happening and one lightning bolt hit rob. The next morning Gonzalo woke up because he could hear stomping from the living room. When he got there he saw Rob moving around although no one gave him a command.Then Gonzalo noticed that there was a mark on Rob's back. Then he found out that lightning hit him while he and his family were sleeping and that now Rob was alive.                    When everyone woke up he Gonzalo told his family that Rob was hit by a lightning bolt and came to life. Rob talked to them which really suprised them. He told them that a meteor was a about to hit Castroville in 5 days. The whole family was terrified and they started packing, but Rob told them not to worry because he knew what he was going to do. Rob didn't tell Gonzalos family what he was going to do wich they didn't like because they wanted to know.                     When 5 days passed the meteor was coming closer and closer by the minute. Finally when Gonzalo asked Rob what he was going to do he said, ' Gonzalo, I am going to try to push the meteor away form here since I was built to move heavy things out of the way'. Gonzalo  did read his manual but he didn't know he could do that. When the meteor was coming closer Rob flew in the air and started pushing the meteor minute by minute. When Rob pushed the meteor away and flew back down. That day Rob was a hero to the people of Castroville and he went back to live with the Gonzalos family again.

Also that ''The students at Castroville Elementary School would have to build a robot and they can work in a groups of two''. As soon as he had announced that two best friends named ''Drew and John'' got together to decide what the were going to make it out of. John was mostly worried about what it would look like, Drew was worried about how they were going to get the parts they need to make the robot for the science fair.                                                                                                  The next day John told Drew that ''I found out that my dad works at a tool store''. Drew replied ''Well I found this place were people throw away parts we can use to make our robot''. After school we can go check it out if you want, ''yeah sure'' said John. The only thing standing between them and the trophy was these to really smart students named ''Hathan and Roscar'' they were good friends just like ''Drew and John''.                           Roscar and Hathan won the science fair every year they were in it as team but, John and Drew were both confident in them selfs. After school they went to the junk yard and Drew siad ''I know we can win this year'' then John said ''But they won every year solets get started on the robot''. They were both at work when finally after 3 whole weeks they finished the robot. ''Not bad'' said John, ''came out better than I expected'' said Drew.     So they took it to school and set up their station for the science fair in 1 week. When they arrived at school they saw two people messing with the other projects and screamed ''hey what are you doing to those porjects''. Smoke was in the air when it cleared the two poeple were gone. Thier stand was set up and they left to go buy ice cream.                         When they seen Drew and John leave they were messing with Drew and John project they put a chip in it to controll it. Right after John and Drew came back to check on the project and then it came to live. They both new they had nothing to do with this so they new it was those two poeple that were in here. 1 week went by it was the science fair now and they new how mest with the projects.      It was Hathan and Roscar.... assistants but they didnt know how the assistants were. It was time for the science fair and all the projects were mest up so Jonh and Drew said ''we know who mest with our projects it was ''Hathan and Roscar'', aasistants thats why they win every year. Drew and John robot woke up was fandalizing every project ecsept Hathan and Roscar so they finally lost and Drew and John won. They trained the robot do to things for them. They named RG3 and it became a super hero.       ''THE END'            	. NNP # CD NNP , -NONE- DT NNP CD JJ NN IN NN DT NN VBD RB VBN IN JJ MD VB NN NN IN CD '' .

One day when he went to school the teacher told them that a human was going to be visiting robot island, and theybwere going to be recording all they participating at their house like if they were cleanig, doing the grocery,  taking care of the garden, doing their homework, and washing the clothes.              When thunder got home he went to tell his mom that humans were going to come, to robot island to record them to show other humans that live in human island that robots do what they are expected to do. So,he started to work on his chores of the house first he started with his messy room. He thought he was never going to finish his room, because his little brother came and threw everything to the floor and threw all thew all the dirty clothes. He finished cleaning his room in about 45min. Soon he started cleaning all his clothes, it was alot of clothes to wash. First, he seperated the white clothes and the color clothes. He washed all his clothes and folded them fast in 5min.

I just invented a robot dog, it was 100% robot and 0% dog. The only reason its a robotic dog is because it looks like one and sort of acts like one too.   I stepped out of my lab with my new robotic dog which I named SHRD which stands for Super Helpful Rescuing Dog which is pronounced shred. I took Shrd to the park which was only 3 blocks away from my lab. So far nothing has happened to Shrd, he has'nt blown up or malfunctioned. I found a stick next to a gaint oak tree, the thing was so big I could barely see the top. I threw the stick and Shrds immediate response was to go after it. He retrieved the stick back to me and I told him great job and fed him a bolt. After a few more tosses we went back to my lab and I ran a few diagnostics threw him. Nothing was wrong with him, nothing broke or glitched. I went bed and Shrd followed me to my bed and he got on the bed and powered off, (an other words he fell asleep) and so did I.

After I finshed the robot it came to life and it looked just like me. The nexted day I didnt want to go to school , so I send the robot to go. When he got home he told me he has done all my work in school. After he told me that I told hime to do all my chores my mom told me to do. Every morning I told him to make me breakfast.                      After a month I became so lazy that I told the robot to do every thing for me. Every single day was the same thing intill one day when the robot blew up. After that day I was still lazy, so I missed school every day. When I finally went to school all my friends didnt talk to no more because thay found out that the robot did every thing for me. After all that happend I never wanted to see a robot or even want a robot ever again.

He was happy because it was rare that the girl 'Alexa'wanted to play with him , she usally thought he was just a waist of time.The next morning Alexa for some reason was delighted when her parents told her Robbie was to be her bodyguard , her parents where surprised so like always they rewarded her .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When they arrived to school Alexa suspiciously brought her friends to meet Robbie .   She had a victorious smile , her friends started to unpack their back packs they took out balloons filled with water . Alexa said 'now', robbie thinking all of this was a joke followed along but when he turned around hearing someone call his name . The girls with all intention threw the baloons and Robbie died! The girl was so sorry for what she had done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Her parents where ashamed and grounded her but when they didnt expect it Robbie came alive when he heard that she was crying . Then on , they treated each other like brothers and sisters !!! But what every one didn't know was that Robbie had heard Alexa talking to her friends in the night planning every thing. he gave her a lesson and thats what counted  !

In the robots words 'How may i be at your service' he took the robot home gave it to the famous APPLE company and they eventualy devoloped more. Who would of that a boy would have made such a huge discovery that would change the world.

After year everything went well until a doctor made a robot called kipo63. Kipo63 had a mission to complete which was to make hpy-20 vanish. kipo63 had to do what his mission was or else his creater would vanish him from earth.He did not want to be vanished because he doesnt have or know anyone else that will help him or let him stay at their house. He didn't know somethimes he would want to just leave.             Hpy-20 knew what was happening when he saw a strange person always following them and giving him and jack malious looks.He then knew he had to save the whole city that day came before he expexed.              That day was March 18,2228 at 12:00.Hpy-20 was eatingb lunch with jack when he heard an explosion then onther he saw that kipo63 was bombing the city and doing horible things to people so he fought kipo63 for 2 hours until kipo63 confesed why he was doing horible thinges to the city and people. Hpy-20 understued why he was doing horible things. Hpy-20 made kipo63 swear he would never ever do anything horible in his life. the both decide to give kipo63's creater. when they got there they both fought him then they handcufed him and took him to jail there.          The rest of the two robots lifes they fought against crime and helping others.

Gemini-Scout is a remote controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under ground. Gemini-Scout collects a bunch of information to give to the scientists wherever it goes. The Dante 2 is a spiderlike robot that climbs like a spider. It climbed into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. An agribot is a robot that picks up fruit. It might also pick berries, oranges, grapes, or even apples.       About fifty years ago, the author Isaac Asimov wrote a story called 'I, Robot'. When the story was written, it was a fantasy. Many playful robots are made to copy animals, too. You can buy a lifelike pet, such as a dog, a seal, or even a dinosaur to be in movies. Other robots help people play with live animals. One company, I-Pet, Companion, has made a robot that lets people play with kittens, but from a distance. Today, robots don't exist, but some kids like to play imaginary with their friends.

Out of  knowwhere the town bully walked up to Anthony and stole Anthony's basketball. Anthony asked for his basketball back but the bully said come back when you have a team. So Anthony was walking back to his house through the park when he saw a tall golden man shaped robot. Anthony kneeled  down to grab a stick an when he looked up the golden robot was gone. Anthony thought maybe he was just seeing things so he decided to turn around and walk home.While walking home he saw the golden robot again laying against a tree and ran towards it and poked the robot with a thick muddy stick. Nothing was happening so Anthony decided to just sit there and wait to see what happens,while waiting anthony fell asleep. Anthony woke up to the talking of the robot '' hi im Robot whats your name?'   Reply:Anthony.   So Anthony do you want to be my friend? said robot. Sure said Anthony. Hey Robot do you like basketball? asked Anthony.         'Yes i do' said robot. Hmm Robot would you want to play a basketball game with me? sure why not. replied Robot. Follow me then said Anthony, k said robot. So Anthony and Robot returned to the basketball court and the bully was their waiting with his friend.The bully said are you guys ready? Anthony said yes. The bully told the rules then the game started. Anthony and Robot were down by two points 20 - 18. Anthony had the ball passed to Robot then Robot passed back to Anthony. Wide open at three the 3 pointer Robot shot the ball for the win!!! Swoosh nothin but net.    Anthony said to the bully Revenge is sweet.                                                   The End.

My class         wasn't very thrilled about it. I was a tiny bit happy I got my best        friend as a partner.  Anyways, the project was that we had to build     a robot with a lot of different abilities. In the back of my mind I     thought there was no possible way, we will get this done by next     week, but anything can happen,right? The bell rang for lunch and      a shot up out my chair to go find my best friend. Soon enough I     found her, 'thank goodness' I thought. We ate lunch together, she       on the other hand was freaking out about it too. I pushed the    project out of my mind for the rest of the day.         After school, I got  to brainstorming. I thought of a banjo     playing robot, No, then more and more ideas popped in my head.     Then one finally came to me, an Anything-Opener. It was the     perfect idea, it would open anything you wanted it to. I texted my     best friend and invited her over. We got right to work. She also    really liked the idea too, but it took her awhile though. It took us     a few days to do it.We used some of my dad's tools and bought some batteries for it. It was made completely out of solar panels. We finished on the day it was due,Friday. We took it school proud of it.         We both got into class, I looked at our competition, there was a    lot of weird looking ones and the one we both didn't want to see,      the smarties in our classes robot. It looked like a human! Our      jaws dropped. Our teacher did the judging. There were two more    to judge, the smarties and ours. We both crossed our fingers. The     smarties were before us to judge. Their robot talked, but all of the sudden it started acting funny, and it was smoking up. The teacher    gave them the thumbs down. We were up last, the teacher sighed then smiled. We both gave him a fake smile and looked at each other. The teacher examined it and he gave us a thumbs up and a       A+. We hugged each other and jumped around. The class ended and I was the last to leave and no one else was in the classroom . I saw my science project sitting there and I said,' I knew you could do it' and smiled and walked out of the classroom.

It was the middle of night, as I was outside in the garden, I heard the faint humming of Kronur. As I tried to escape I thought to myself.Didn't I kill him last year ?Oh well, this time I have to destroy him once and for all.I guess I should stop writing in this book and ,tell you from the beginning.Here we go........ flashback.           It all started last year,it was year 2291 and our government was progressing, I had a youth robotics meeting in Los Angeles, now our new capital.The terrorist group, Marmara,had bombed D.C.When I got to the meeting I saw many people preparing for an evacuation.As I stopped and asked a few people whats happening, I saw a meteor as big as Puerto Rico hurtling toward us.I quickly assembled Kronur to evacuate people.As I stood marveling my creation, an Evacuation Department took me away in their hovercraft.Later that day as I stood in my house I saw the threat of Kronur.Well, obviously he was created by the government to be a ''War Machine'' , to destroy bombs, to deploy bombs.Even though I ''created'' him to be a savior and a hero, he didn't quite do that.I wanted him to go to places we humans can't go.Well,I guess that won't be happening.I guess I will just have to des- BOOM!Whoa,what was that !I suddenly hear the sirens that tell me to evacuate and that they tell me of a dangerous bomb .As I evacuate with my family , I see the faint image of Kronur.And I just have t- let's go move,move,move soldiers! Man, that general is on my last nerves !Don't know why I appointed him my bodyguard and security, i should of have hired a Roboguard.But, I don't trust robots know.Except maybe my puppy, S-BAC.            You must be wondering why Kronur tried to kill me.Well, your not alone.That robot is going down !I don't care where he is, I am going to kill and destroy him once and for all.BOOM,BOOM!   OMG, that little robot is going down.If I don't destroy him then the world will have to pay for my sins, and I don't like doing that.             As I boarded my hovercraft, I saw my lab and house in the distance.I put my destroy codes in my pocket and turned on my computer.I put the hovercraft on auto-pilot mode and started the process of destroying.Little did I know that Kronur was already destroyed just waiting for me back at my house.But how he died will always remain a mystery.            A few months later, I had forgotten about Kronur, as least he was dead.Know these days ,when ever I work in the lab, it always reminds me of Kronur.i always get flashbacks of the bomb exploded house and streets.He was a nice robot, but even good people can turn into bad people.How he turned into a bad person will always remain a mystery to me and history itself.          Well, know that you know my story, shall we progress to the future?Well, even though I have some spare time i should hurry up, considering the fact the U.S. Marines are siding with Kronur.As I waited for the Navy Seals , I played with S-BAC, my robotic puppy,as I played with S-BAC , I thought of a plan , I would decipher the chip inside and destroy but if I mess up then i'm doomed for life.Well, if I don't see you tomorrow, then consider me dead.              WHOA,whoa,whoa. Where are you all going.Don't go anywhere, I need your support, don't you want to know my plan?Yeah, I thought so.well,okay this is what I will do.Well,I will tell you later.

It would also feed me by buying me take-out food buying me junk food from the store.He would also build me a mansion and have awesome stuff in it like a trampoline,a flat screen, video games,a basketball court inside,a swimming pool inside and outside,and a dog.And since he got me these stuff I would share it with him.And if a robot actually turned alive and did all these stuff he would be the greatest robot in the world.

In all places. If  I make a robot I want it to clean or take care of my sister because my brother are old to take care of there self now. If I can chose it to be a girl or a boy I want it to be a boy. I would name it the Work Boy or for right now i don't have ideas but when a big Iwant to make a robot that every one will like even the dog. And I cant leave out the animals so I will make a robot that feeds your animal, wash them and clean there popo so u dont have to.

He was   really smart and enjoyed making robots. His lab was filled with robots that never came alive. Until one day when he decided to make a robot that could help people. And this time it would come alive.   So many years passed and Ronald was almost done with his   robot.   Finally his robot was done and he was ready to make it come   alive. Ronald put some finishing touches to his robot. And now his robot was alive. He would present it to the world and the hospitals. He would become famouse.

On the next day,my cousins and I woke up in the morning when we went down stairs the robot got the breakfast ready for us and our lunches,too.When we finish our breakfast we up stairs to get ready for school.The robot said 'Have a nice day at school kids ' and we said 'Thanks for the wonderful breakfast you gave us and we hope the lunch is good ,too.After school was over we went back to the house and we saw the robot cleaning the house really fast ,when he stop he told us to go to our room we were running up the stairs and room were super clean then it looks before and my mom never clean like this the robot is really helpful.At night we all went to bed except for the robot when I went down stairs to get water I saw the robot and I think he heard me coming down and he asked 'Why you got out of bed' asked the robot, then I said 'I came to get a drink of water what are you doing' I asked.Just when I got water he just said go back to bed and I know something going on.           When I woke up, I saw the robot with somebody and their were asking him that he is going to get some people to take everything from us then I realize that he is not a good robot he is working for the wrong side of the company then when I went up stairs to my room and went to the computer and I check online that my mom got the wrong robot online then I woke my cousins up I told them that the robot that my mom got is that works for the government company.Then I call a different company and I ask them to get a playful robot and I heard the doorbell and they open it and somebody got the robot that my mom order and send the other robot.Now,we were living with the right robot in the house and all of our family were happy.

One day that Micheal was walking down the street he saw a little boy named Patrick. Micheal went up to patrick and said hi.Patrick responded with another hi.Micheal asked him if he wanted to be his friend.And patrick said yes.But there was a problem Micheal didn't know that patrick was a robot.                    Since the day that they met they have been the best of friends.They both spend their reeces together,after school they spend the whole day playing with Patrick's dog.But what Micheal also doesn't know is that Patick's dad is not really his dad he is Patricks creater.Partick's creater created him because he always wanted to have a sone to play catch with and go to a basseball game with.                   One day that Patrick and Micheal were playing catch with a baseball Patrick wasn't paying attention and got hit in the face with the ball.Patrick started to act really weird and Micheal was getting scared.Patrick didn't say a word and just ran home.Micheal was worried and chased Patrick their.Once patrick got home his creator got straight to work and started to fix him.Since Patrick was in such a hurry and left the froont door open so Micheal went right inside his house.Micheal found patrick getting oppend with a screw driver and other things by his creatosrMicheal was shocked of what he just saw so he ran back home.                      Since the day that Michel saw Patrick getting oppend he hasn't talked to him.But one day Patrick went to Micheal's house trying to find him to play.Micheal didn't want to go outside because he was to scared.Patrick tried to explai Michel of what he saw.Patrick told him that he wasn't a normal person he was a robot.Micheal was shocked at first but then rememberd all of the fun things that they did together and became friends with Patrick again                             In conclusion, Micheal is a very nice friend because he gave his robot friend a chance in being his best friend.

First,jimmy was outside just playing like he normally did when he came home from school everyday.But that day he noticed something different he noticed some shadows in his room but then he said,''its probably the shadow of the big tree right by my window''.but then he noticed that they were not tree branch shadows they were like human shadows and he thought it cant be my mom she dosent come home from work until 5:00 o 'clock .suddenly he felt this chill down his back it felt like a ice cube right out the freezer.He then thought  i  have to get in and not let that robber destroy my house or my toys.So he thought for about ten minutes he said,''i know what i got to do ''.                                       secondly,Jimmy barged through the door and ran down to his basment and locked the door turned on the light and started looking for pillows,pans,bats and tape.When he was all suited up bat in hand and everything ready he said ,''im going in''.Jimmy rand through the basement up the stairs and into his room but he saw somethind different from a rober it was a robot not rober.jimmy was suprised at we he saw he totally wanted to keep it.He went up to the robot and said ,''what is your name''?I dont have name you dont have a name everybody is supposed to have name .but you  know what dont get sad i will give you name and from now  opn you will be called robo 3000 the robot said''my name is robo 3000''yes and from now on your my robo ok                                       Thirdly,now the only problem we have is getting you past my mom and dad .What should i do thought jimmy i  know i will just hide you up here until my mom and dad go to sleep and when they are sound asleep thats when the real  party will begin .So days past and nobody noticed robo 3000 until one day when robo and jimmy thought there parents were asleep but they really were not jimmys parents had thought he was acting really weird he was happier than he ever was they had no problem asking jimmy to clean his room all he said was a simple yes .so that night jimmy went out to get a snack for robo when his parents heard jimmy door open they immideatly got ready and went into his room and there they found robo jimmys mom yelled to  the top of her lungs jimmy and jimmy ran upstairs .jimmys mom told jimmy what a robot was doing in his room jimmy immediatly started explaining to his mom the story and how he came home from school and found robo .                                                 finally,jimmy new he had to convince his mom to let him keep robo so jimmy broke out into tears and told his mom to let him keep robo his mom got easily convinced and let jimmy keep robo .

Emily wanted a way to do her chores a little faster and her homework a lot easier. She already had invention for cooking sweet goods; and now she wanted a way to help her do her chores faster and make her homework easier. So she sat in the kitchen and thought about what she could about her little problem. Her first idea was to hire a maid but she didn't have the money, and she knew well that her parents would not lend her the money. So she thought a little longer. As she was thinking her little brother turned on the T.V. and as soon as it come upon a cartoon about robots. Emily soon stop thinking about her problem and got distracted by the cartoon. It was about a little boy name Charley and his friend that was a robot. Charley had created this robot because he was tired of being lonely and friendless. As Charley and his robot, Pat, became closer Pat developed feelings and started to act like a human and soon became one. Charley was so happy because he knew that Pat would be his best friend for a long time. As part 1 of the show played a commercial break came and an idea popped in Emily's head.                                   Emily ran straight to her room and had an idea to create a robot, that was highly advanced to solve any problem in any subject. She also wanted it to detect messes and clean them. As soon as Emily   planned everything she got to work. She took apart the oven and took the S-Drive from her laptop and use it as the robots brain. She took the main part of the oven and used it as the robots body. As time went by Emily had created the first robot that looked like a human. Emily was so happy that there - for her at least - was no more cleaning and no more homework. But since Emily's robot was made from an oven it was also made to cook. That was a bonus for Emily!          But as a week and a half went by Emily got lazier and on her test scores, Emily turned into a below basic student from an advanced student. Even worse the robot had came too life and started to develop  feelings just like the cartoon. Since Emily became bossy the robot got angry and refused. Emily knew it was normal for her robot to be acting that way but she thought it was just a miner problem.         As the next, came the robot took the form of a human and looked just like Emily. It even mocked Emily and told her to go clean. Emily didn't like the way the robot was acting so she tryed to think of different way to get rid of the robot. As Emily was thinking of the quote ' I brought you into the world and now I could take you back'. She did the same. She trick the robot to say, ' Control, Alt, Delete ', because the robots brain was from her computer and it worked! The robot deactivate it self and Emily finally got her life back!

Now let's start off. I know a robot that just randomly comes to life is just plain crazy. It sounds crazy right? Well you may think it's crazy but it's absolutely one hundred percent true! I was building a robot one day and I got kind of bored so I left. I came back and the robot was alive! He had trashed my room, gone to the bathroom, and started playing games!                       First he totally trashed my room! I came home and all of my clothes were scattered on the floor! All of my snow globes were broken and all of my trophies were broken. My bed wasn't made anymore and my mattress wasn't on my bed anymore! My computer screen was broken. And he broke my phone and iPod! It was completely unfair because I had spent all weekend cleaning my room and it was a mess again! It was a big mess. When I say big I mean BIG! All of my hard work just went down the toilet!                        Speaking of toilets, my robot should really learn to use one!  don't know how crazy I sound when I say that a robot actually went poop on my floor but I know I sound crazy! It may sound weird that a robot pooped on my floor but I am telling the truth! Never in my life did I think I would have a robot that pooped. I don't know what he ate though but it made his waste smelled awful. He could've eaten that rotten sandwich that my little brother left under my bed this morning but that's all I can think of. He totally stunk up my whole room! It was nasty.                       Lastly he pulled out all of my bored games. He pulled out Monopoly, The Game of Life, Scrabble, Candy Land, Checkers, Chess, Headbands, and a lot more. I know I have a lot of bored games. But if you know me then you know that I absolutely hate when people touch my things without asking. So just having my robot touch all of my bored games and leaving them on the floor was rude. I had a meltdown. After that he took out all of my toys and started playing with them too! He took my sister's barbies and cut off all of their hair and took off all of their heads.I had enough of this robot. It was time to get rid of it. I told my mom everything that happened and she took me down to the recycle place and we recycled him. Or was it a her? I never checked. I had fun with my robot but all I have to say is, never again!

She created  a robot called  G-14352 it was 7 feet tall and 57 inches  but it wouldn't work cause she wanted it  to help people. It was made to bring medicine to doctors and nurses when needed . Em (short for Emerson ) was very disappointed when it didn't work. But her and her friend Christopher Maloney are going to try to bring it to life ( secretly Christopher is in love with em and she is in love with him but they don't know they like each other). The next day all of a sudden the robot G-14352  came to life and now that it  was alive it wasn't going to be helpful it said in a deep voice 'i will kill all humans ha ha '. Em was scared she called Christopher and said to come over quick. When he got there he saw the robot now it was 8 feet tall so Christopher did what he had to do he leap towards Em snatched em and moved her to the other  side. Now he was in front of the giant  G-14352 and it was saying ' you'll never get me to turn off ha ha ha  you fools I turn off only when wet................. :-o oops i shouldn't have said that out loud .' Then Christopher ran towards the door went out side got the hose turned it on ran back inside and sprayed the robot it screeched sparks were coming out of it then died . Christopher  said 'ha now that will turn you off .................Em Em where are you'. He turned around saw Em lying on the floor past out he ran to her grabbed her head lifted it towards him so he can  see her face she woke up and said ' Christopher is that you i wanted to tell you something i .........love you '. Christopher was shocked then he leaned close and kissed her this wasn't just any kiss it was the kiss of love. A few days later the robot was getting compounded and Em and Christopher were dating kand they lived happily ever after.

The future,evil,demonic things that will take over the worl? Well think again,robots now a day are things that every day people use. They are anything but unordinary. Some robots work at special jobs that are far too dangerous for humans, for example ''Dante 2'' a robot that works in volcanoes doing research for scientists. Without ''Dante 2'' many scientists would have been injured or even killed. Another robot that helps people is ''Mr. Gower.'' He helps nurses and doctors at hospitals, when a patient needs medicine ''Mr. Gower'' is always there. Another type of robot that doesn't even look like a robot is a car. Technology is so advanced now a days that people are trying to figure out a way to make an automatic car. And i don't mean like an aaaaaaautomatic and a standered car, no  an actual automatic car that will just drive by itself without the help of a person. So next time someone asks you something about robots just remember that they are not just a thing of the future. 	WRB PRP VBP IN NNS NNS DT JJ NN WDT VBZ IN PRP$ NN .

Robots would be really fun in my inpinon because they help us do a lot more things than normalin a life, like to a robot that could fly when its holding you. When you get bored just go outside or play video games inside if you dont want to be stung by bee's all day if its summer and if its winter then have a snow ball fight. You can go on a camping trip to see wats in this world its pretty fun some times or scary or a bit creepy.

She had blue print of her labrortoryshe said my wish had finally came true.Itzel's lab was finally made.she was so confedent she had gone far and became a scientist.She hyad friend,love,attention,and a husband who was also a scientist who had the same life story and the special feature was he had a dream just like Itzel.His name was Albert.

But when it went down into the middle it lost control of the tempature so we made another robot to go down and change the tempature the second time we sent a robot down it found the other one we made the robot fix the other one then they joined togother to find the distinked animals they had been down there for mny years and we had to hurry and find some clues of where the animals were so we kept looking and looking.   Finally we found a clues it was a foot print we dont know what its from so we made the robot scan it it was a raptor. so we were gonna be finished and let the raptors happily live down in the earth but then the robot took control over its self we could not do anything to stop it they killed all the raptors but then something bad happended that was unexspected a big giant dragon comes out of the hole and breathes fire on the robots so they ran and hid behind a rock but the scientist made them fire proof so they cant be burned to death but the robots did not know that so they kept hiding and running finnaly the dragon cornerd them he bit and chewed them till they were just scraps so then the scients found a way to get down there and get the data with the foot prints on it it took them many years to build it but they got it in 1984 they finally made it to the area were the robots died then they recovered the data but the dragon did not want them to leave so he tried to burn them but he could'nt because they were in a fireproof stonedigger that can not be destroyed in any way   but they kept going the dragon could not do anything to stop them so they finally recovered the data and got out of there.

It all started on a Thursday moring I was at school, I was in science class and we were talking about robot and what they do everywhere even in space. Then our science teacher said that we could make a robot some day that can do many thing. Then, Lucy (one of my annoying class mates) said ' I know I can build a robot but I bet you Sheila can't .' I was so mad I said 'oh yeah well I can make on I'll show you that I can!' After I said that I knew I was going to regret it!                 Now I was did it I didn't know How I was going to make robot I was going to make one so when I came in with a robot to school just to see how Lucy was going to react when she saw the awsome robot that I am goin to build. When I got home I took out a piece of paper out of my backpack and started writing down ideas for my robot. Then I started to think where am I going to find all these parts for my robot. Then I rembered my friend Alanna (Alanna was my best since pre-school) her dad collects all sorts of stuff in her shed. I'll ask her at school tomarow .              The first person  I see from school is Alanna. I told her alll about how I had to build a robot. Then I asked her if  I get some thing from her shed she said ' yeah my dad won't mind.' Then I went to her house after school I got a load of cool stuff. When I got home I got right to work I didn't sleep all night that day good thing it was on the weekend.                   I all most was finish with one more day of work I think I can bring it in on Monday. I so I worked so hard all day. Then I forgot I needed to put a microchip inside I went to Alannna's house in the moring before school and the only thing I found was a very small microchip I said 'oh well' then got home put it inside and I got to school early and then I remebered that I needed bateries for the robot oh well I said maybe they won't notice. Then the first person I see is Lucy she said 'how come it doesn't move.' Then out of now where, my robot come to life! And says 'are you bind can't you see me'  she looks like she is about to faint. That is how my science project came alive and became my friend.

Robots are made of copy animals some robots plays with animals.         For Example:moviemakers can designed huge robots apes and dinasour to be in a movie.robots arent only made for movies some robots and pets has stuff in common.   they want attention so people can teach them tricks.there are even new version of robot pet that has fur so you can pet your robot just like you do to your dog and cat and you dont have to take it outside to feed it.

If  too much power is in the rock it can make the robot go crazy and come alive.       Dr.Robert and my dad made sure to check if the rock has to much power by using a special kind of scale before testing the robot . Dr.Robert hired a guy to check the Plutonium rocks, his name was Gary. Before it was time to test the robot with the Plutonium rock Gary had to check how much power was in the rock but he did not know how to use the scale. So he pretended that he knew how to use it but he did not know that the rock had so much power in it. When it was time to test the robot something bad happened . The robot came alive and broke out in to the field and made a hole in the wall. It was so crazy that it turned evil . Its purpose was to entertain but instead it was scaring the guts out of people .       It could even walk on walls, on the ceiling too.It had a scary face, it looked like it was possessed. That's why people were so scared of the robot . Someone needed to take the Plutonium rock out of the robot but who?Maybe Dr.Robert needed to hire someone to catch the robot or maybe could catch it since I wanted to make my dad proud since my grades weren't so good.Then I can make him proud now.But how am I going to catch the robot? Easy the rock and parts of the robot is like a magnet.So I could ask Mr.Bert from the magnet store.I went to the magnet store and got a giant magnet I went ahead of the robot and caught it .I got the rock and gave the rock back to my dad . Dr.Robert fired Gary and I became the assistant and made my dad proud.

For example, a babysitter, a housekeeper, a docter, or even a construction worker. But in this story we are going to talk about how they help you. A construction worker can build you a house. And a babysitter can take care of your baby. Also a docter can save lives in minutes.

You could play hokey because they have wheels and they are strong and they spin and shoot the hokey puck and espesialy you could use a robotic car and you don't drive it because the robotic car drives its self because you could choose your location because it has a gps robotic cars cost alot because its a drive self car and there could also be a babysitter because when your out the babysitter could take care of your kids.

On the way to school Nicolas and Touachi found pieces of metal on the sidewalk.They decided to pick it up and take it home. When school was over they went Touachis house to see what was the metal.When they look at it closely they saw a head, body, legs, and shoes. Later that day Touachi and Nicolas tried building the robot. But before making the robot they had to name him, so they named it Robbie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It too them days to built the robot. Three days later Touachi and Nicolas finally finished with the robot. They built the robot to be kind and be playful.The next day they had an assignment at school that they had to talk about them creating a robot. When they finished they went home and the next day they brought there robot to school. When they went to class the robot was teaching the students how to do the math meanwhile the teacher corrected the students writing.                                                        The entire school liked the robot they even wanted to make here own robot. This will be our future for later on but the humans will always be there.

He was going to school and was ready to learn some more math and study really hard for the next test that they were going to take  the next week.Then after school was over he walked home and then turned on the T.V. and was loooking for something to watch.Then when his mom came home he changed it to the news and they both watched it.Then the next day after school Andrew's mom took him to the store so that he can buy a new toy to play with.When they got to the store Andrew's mom took him to the toy section,and there it was,the perfect toy.It was barely the new toy and Andrew was just about to buy the first one.Then he got the toy and then they went home and he started to  play his new toy right away.He played with his toy for a hour and then went to go take shower.Before he went in the shower he left his robot on his counter and when he got out of the shower his robot was under the bed and Andrew thought that that was really wierd.The next day Andrew went to school and when he came back he couldnt find his robot so he looked everywhere and had found his robot in his closet.But he was so shocked and he just found out that his robot was alive.He was shocked and his mom went running to him all worried and he told her that his robot was alive and she went to go check and she grabed Andrew and her car keys and left the house.Then she called the police to get it out of her house and then the police station used the robot for good things that the police couldn't explain to anybody!

BAM!!! a gigantic  robot pops out of the door!He said his name was Bob and he would take us out on an adventure, but we only had a limit of time till my parents got back from the market.We climbed on his back and flew around the world.We visited a lot of great places and brought back souvenirs.He brought us back home just in time for when my parents came back.Of course we were sad that the fun was over but,we had a really fun time.If it wasn't for Bob we would have never had that opportunity.

School had just ended when I finally got the package.'It's here! It's here!' I said running down the stairs in excitement. I ran out of the door to the mailbox. When I went in my room, I opened my box and there it was 'The Robot.'                   As soon I fixed my robot, I showed my brother, Nick.'What are you going to name it?' asked Nick. My brother and I sat in my room for about 5 minutes then all of a sudden I got it 'Agent R.' I was going to train him to be a professional spy.                  While I was daydreaming about going on missions and kicking butts, Nick threw a paper at my head then gave me all of these spy movies.'This will be so helpful' I said smiling. He gave me 'Jackie Chan' movies like 'Rush Hour I, II, and III.'                   Instead of watching and then training, I hooked the DVR to Agent R. and recorded the data. I fix Agent R. so he can have weapons and arms/legs for better combat. Later I got my dad's old kickboxing dummy and made it fresher. We started practicing in the backyard doing some basic combat moves.                    I said to Nick that Agent R. and I will start spying on my dad. So Agent R. and I went down stairs to get started. My dad was on the couch sleep like a bear. We had to have some fun, so I got the whip cream and made a clown face in him. After that I went and put Agent R. on sleep mode and went to bed.

He decided when he is finished the machine is going to be called a robot.After one month he build the machine he wanted.He said he is going to take over the world with it.                     So then he went to test it.It had so many features it could  go every where people couldn't go to.It could go to so many places volcanoes,underwater,and more.So then he changed his mind and show it to the world so he could be the richest man in the world.

'Bye,' 'Bye,' 'Bye' they all said to each other. That night Emilie worked on the robot. She put it together, then put a sheet on it like the kid in a movie to bring a pet to life but it is a robot. She clipped two kites on it (To attract the lightning) then she put it up in the hole in the ceiling then...  BOOM!!! Here comes the lightning. The lightning struck to the robot. she took it back down, and took the sheet off...       When the sheet got took off the robot sat their and waited... then she was like 'did i do this right, what did i do wrong?' So then she sadly waked away, right as she herd little foot steps she tired around. AH!!!! She shouted, it was right behind her. she was like 'hello' 'hello master' the robot said 'ill call you, Roby' 'OK master' said the robot. 'Fallow me' 'OK master.' So Roby fallowed Emilie to her bedroom. she was like Candy, Celeste and Alyssa are going to love Roby. The robot ended up to be a helping robot. The robot gave and served Emilie hot chocolate. then she got all tied and told the robot to stay here then went to bed.       In the next meeting Emilie brought Roby. Then Emilie went up to the front and said 'Today i am going to show you the robot i made and built. Okay first the robot is a helping and serving, Roby will greet you and serve you. so here is Roby' As she takes the sheet off him. 'So this is Roby, i made him with the lightning like off of shows like that one when a kid tries to bring animals back to life. OK back to my point, so ya that how i made him' everyone was like 'Yay,''Cool,''Awesome.'

One day they went to the hospital to visit their grandma and they met this robot who's name is Mr. Gower he is a robot who works in hospitals all over the world. Everyday Mr. Gower brings medicine to patients all over the hospital. Even though he runs on batteries after charging for two hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping. For two months Jane and Josh visited Mr. Gower everyday and learned all kinds of interesting things about Mr. Gower.            Then one day when Jane and Josh came to the hospital to see Gower he wasn't there Jane and Josh looked everywhere and still couldn't find him. So they just left but on the way home they saw him out side a repair shop. They ran to him and shouted with joy but the robot still looked  very sad so the children asked, 'What's wrong?' Mr. Gower then showed them his arm which was bitten off at the shoulder and he told them the story. His arm got bitten off by a crazy patient and then the boss told him he couldn't work there with only one arm. So he came here to buy a new one but he didn't have any money. But the children wanted to help him so they went in to the hospital and found lots of body parts and stole an arm and they attached it to Mr. Gower and to there surprise it came alive! So then Mr. Gower got his job back and Jane and Josh again went to the hospital daily and visited Mr. Gower.

This robot can help you in school,do the dishes, and even just having fun! I have made this robot to talk, so you can actually understand him! I programed him with hundreds of words, so he can make sentences! He can carry as much as 500 lbs! Here are some abilities the robot can do.          This robot can help you with school. The robot can calculate, spell, and even research! It has satellites that collect information from libraries and schools. There is nothing this robot cant figure out! This robot has a keyboard so you can research anything you want.   For parents, there is a parental control setting, that allows you to fix notifications. You can also download games on it!            A second thing this robot can do is helping you in the kitchen. It can wash dishes, clean up the table, and can even prepare dinner! If you want the robot to clean, set it to cleaning mode. This robot has its own cleaning stuff so you can just kick back and rest! If you don't feel like making dinner, program the robot to cooking mode! You can search a recipe and the robot will cook it without instructions! Trust me, the food is all natural, no artificial flavors!            The last thing this robot can do is playing with you! If you want to play a sport or any type of game, just type in the name of what you want to play and bang, your ready to go!It has a dial for the difficulty of what game your playing. The options are: expert, hard, medium, easy, and beginner. The robot can 'run' as fast as 4 mph. It can also stretch as far as 3 yards. It also has a built in umbrella and cooler so you can cool off yourself and   your drinks!                 As you can see my creation has several great abilities. The Everything 2000 is a robot that can help you in life. It can also make your life better. This robot was not meant for me, it was made for the people! So, in conclusion, I hope you would take the time to observe my creation.

Now,I'm going to give you some information about a robot called Mr.Gower.......Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals,helping docters and nurses bring medicene to patients.Mr.Gower can go anywhere you need it to.It can ride in elevators,steer through hallways,and move around things that get in the way.The robot runs on batteries.After 2 hours he can deliver medicene for 12 hours!It can talk to. It is programed to say all kinds of things like 'Calling elevator' and so many more things.                          I'm going to tell you more things about robots.This kind of robot is called,Agribots. An Agribot is a robot that picks fruit.It can pick what ever kind of fruit you tell it to.Like apples,grape,berries,oranges, and so many more!They come in all different shapes and sizes.They are alound to move around on there own,if they dont run off....They sense the colors of the berries.That helps them tell if the berries are ripe or not.The Argibots are like little baby farmers...:) They help grow tomatoes with no human help.Every plant has a sensor and that sensor tells the robot what the plant itself needs.                      None of these robots are normal.But they all have there own needs.Here,I'll name everyone of them so you'll understand each and everyone of their needs and everyone of there uses. First there is the Gemini-Stout. Then there is the Dante 2.Then comes Mr.Gower. Then comes the smartest one of all, the Agribots.....All these smart little robots are uses for something. The Gemini-Stout is used for gathering all the research that the scientists need. The Dante 2,is used for climbing things. Mr.Gower is used for working in hospitals and helping docters and nurses that need help...Also,Delivering the medicene to some of the patients that need the medicene. And then there are the Agribots,the Agribots are used for working on farms,helping the farmers that need the help,planting the plants that the farmers tell them to plant,and helping the plants,like, getting them all the supply that they need to survive.See, I told you that all these robots have special uses for. :) :) :) :) :)     	RB , RB VBZ PRP$ JJ VBG TO VB RP IN DT JJ NN IN VBZ DT NN VBN NN IN VBZ NN CC NN NN IN NNS IN DT NNP NN MD VB RP CC IN NNS CC VB RB JJ NNS , PRP MD RB VB IN DT NNP NN VBZ JJ , CC JJ DT NNP VBZ , PRP VBZ NN IN NN CC JJ RB VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB NN NNS .

One night aaron created a robot named garron. Garron was a eight foot robot who was entelligent , stong and awsome.       One night aaron finished creating garron and he went to his bed and prayed, he also wishe that garron would come alive. the next morning he saw the kitchen light on so he went to the kitchen and he saw an eight foot robot cooking him bacon and eggs.       Aaron made garron sit down in a seat and talked to garron. Aaron asked garron why he came alive and garron told aaron that he wished for him to come alive . Garron was a protective robot who hellped poor people later in the year everybody like aaron because of his creation.

Who invented a robot named goro who helps   surgeons. but just two weeks after he was invented they noticed something wrong with goro.     he was growing skin.            So they decided to do some tests on Goro.  after they gave him a couple shots they noticed that he was starting to grow orgins and the metal was devolving into skin.  So they decided to   put him in a room and come back tommorow.  And as soon as they came back he was a human he was a live they were astonded they didnt know what happened.

They both desided to ride thier bikes to the creek. When they got there they sat down and had a picnic. When they got done they wanted to explore. So they went up in the woods where they found this cave. When they went in they found a big toy robot. They went back to Hunters house and tried to get it to but but it wouldnt. The next morning when you both woke up, the robot was gone. They looked everywhere so then they desided to ask Hunters mom if she had seen it anywhere, but she had no idea what they were talking about. She just thought they were pretending so she said 'Well I think I might of seen one in the backyard while I was planting my flowers this morning. So the two girls started looking abut the backyard, but they couldnt find anything. they desided to go back to the park and look in the cave again. So they did. When they finally got there they went up to the cave and sure enough the robot was there in the cave right where they got it. Accept this time it was moving. They girls were scared so they ran back down and got on their bikes and went home to tell Hunters mom. When they did she didnt believe them. Again she just thought they were pretenting. When they asked her to come look, she did. So the mom got on her bike and rode with them to the park. They got off their bikes and went up to the cave. The robot was still there. This time he was cleaning. The mom was a little scared but also very exited to find out what it was. so she went up and said 'hi.' Then the robot said replied saying 'why hello.' The mom was so exited that she asked it if it wanted to come home with them to get somthing to eat. the robot said ' i would love to' So they went back to Hunters house and sat at they table while Hunter and her mom made lunch. the robot said 'Hi my name is Robert.' Kendra replied ' Hey my name is Kendra.' So they sat there and ate lunch while Robert told storys. He ended up living with Hunter and he mother.

Dawson loved science.Holly J. would always want to do science everyday,she wanted to do science only for homework so she made up her own friend to get more science homework.One day Holly J.s class was assigned to make their own toy robot, Holly J. took it very seriously she wanted to make a real robot, one that would come to life,one thart could talk to her about science all day long,the assigenment was due next month,Holly J. could not wait to get started.So the next morning Holly J. ran down stairs into her garage and started to make her own labatroy.When Holly J. was done it was only about 2:00 so then Holly J. got to work she started to work on her robot.First things first she had to come up with a name for the robot,just then Holly J. had figuerded it out, she was going to call her robot 104 Becky.Now all Holly J. had to do wa scome up with waht abillities 104 Becky was going to have Holly J. wanted 104 Becky to have the ability of stength and the abillity to talk to her an d the abillity to have laiser beams come out of her eyes.                                                                                                                                                                             It had been time for Holly J.s class to turn in thier assignments,Holly J. wanted to go first,once the whole class had seen Holly J.s robot they started to gasp they could not belive what they were seeing.The class did not seem to like 104 Becky,when it was recess time once 104 Becky got outside with Holly J. everyone made fun of 104 Becky,they had kept on telling 104Becky that she was ugly,that no one would ever like a robot like her, the 104Becky had started to oil out tears 104 Becky ran home into the garage crying.Once Holly J. got home she was looking for 104 Becky but she could not find 104 Becky,Holly J. had looked everywhere but she couldn't find her.Holly J. started putting up flyers all over town then Holly J. had gave up and went home.The next morning it was time for school when Holly J. got there.....104 Becky was there.

He shouted,''golle! is it a robot13?,a brand new conversationalist?'' He was right. He said,''I need to tell Frank and Dad! Frank, a tall 18 year old boy, was Joe's older brother. The boys had a father named Fenton Hardy. He was a tall man definetely in his 50's.       When the trio found out how to turn the robot on, they found that he was an obnoxious fellow and was always bragging about something. He was a booze and cigar fueled robot and made the house smell terrible. He spent the family's money like he didn't care. He bought tons of expensive meals with Fenton's credit card and would steal money from Joe while he wasn't looking. As for Frank, Robot13 pulled many pranks on him.       This kept going on and on, until Frank, Joe, and their dad had enough of his nonsense.They decided to take out his batteries. When they secedded, the threw him in the trash.

Its inventor had finally put in a few important parts, so the robot felt like moving around a little. Creak. Creak. The robot's head turned around and stared at the inventor. It tilted its head and opened and closed the robot's mouth slowly. There was more creaking. The boxy head and round body was balanced precariously on one wheel.        Out of the robot's mouth came the words 'Hi.' The robot's inventor jumped and screamed. Then the inventor stopped and stared at the robot curiously.        'Hi, my name is Carrie. I created you,' she said, still shocked. 'I think your name is supposed to be something like House-bot.'        House-bot nodded and rolled toward the door. It reached up and turned the doorknob. Then House-bot started down the stairs to cook dinner, just like it was programmed to do. After a few minutes, a steaming dinner was set on the table in front of two startled parents, one glum sister, and a smug inventor. Over the next few days, House-bot did all the chores. The family couldn't ask for more. With House-bot doing everything, there was more time to relax, focus on homework, and even take apart computers. That is, until Carrie's mom came home furious.         'I want that robot out!' she screeched. 'I can't do anything anymore! I can't cook my pies, I can't make my own lunch! WHY? BECAUSE MY COMPUTER HAS BEEN TAKEN APART! ALL BECAUSE OF THAT HOUSE-BOT! GET IT OUT!'         House-bot continued to do the laundry and sing at the same time. The dogs were yipping happily around it. Carrie sheepishly took out a bag of computer parts. She handed it back to her mom.        'Sorry, Mom, I was trying to make more robots that are as helpful and fun as House-bot. I was going to make a robot that could organize your files in the computer,' Carrie said softly. 'But I don't think you'd want it.'        'Why did you take apart the computer? It doesn't even look like computer anymore,' House-bot said in a monotone, like it was trying to pretend it was an old, creaky robot.        'The new robot isn't supposed to have a screen. Meet Com-puter!' Carrie said triumphantly.        This went on all summer. When school started, Carrie had no more time to build robots. When the time came for her to go to collage, she got into the best collages around all because of the robots she had made.

They work on farms and in mines. They help our doctors save lives. They also explore volcanoes! I will list some of the robots that do hard work.               Gemini Stout is Remote Controlled and does search and rescue work in mines under ground. It is less than 2 feet tall and has wheels. The robot can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it can even roll through water. It is small but strong. The robot carries food water and other supplies. It even drags hurt people to safety.               Wherever the Gemini-Stout goes it collects information. An example is that it tests the air for gasses and it tells miners when the air is safe. The robot has a Thermal camera to help it find miners. A thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.               When the robot finds trapped miners, the miners can use it's two-way-radio to talk with the rescue team.                This robot was meant to be easy to use. Its remote control is the same control that we would use for out video games. If you played a video game you may know how to use the Gemini-Stout.                    Dante 2 is a robot with a interesting job, it climbs INTO volcanoes to get information for scientists. Like a spider, the robot has 8 legs. This helps climb the steep walls to the volcano. It is built to survive extreme heat. When a volcano is to dangerous for scientists to enter Dante goes instead.                	NNP PRP VBP IN NNS IN CD IN DT NNS IN DT NN .

So i've always wanted a real helping robot but my mom says no because it's my job so i do it alone. So one day i decided to go to the mega toystore in the valley while my mom was gone in Paris and my dad moved because he got a job in England. So i went down to the mega toystore and everything was on sale. I went to to a ile caled Robots and found a shiny silver plain robot. And i asked the worker how much does this cost the platnum robot 3,000. So he said not much because it didn't get very good buisness around this ile. And so i said i will buy it so I did. When I got home I ran up to my bedroom and riped the box open and it was the shiniest robot i have ever seen.                     So I put the robot to work but it wouldnt start and I already put in the battiers. But it still wouldn't work so i satrted kincking it and hitting to try to start turn on. And so I satrted to cry because i spent all my money that my mom gave me on this robot that doesn't even work at all. Si I went back to the mega toystore and said they wouldnt take it back because I already opened it. So I went back to my room and went to sleep so i put the robot in my closet to sleep tight and warm. The next day I woke up I opened my closet and the robot wasn't there. So I went down stairs and there it was the platnum robot 3,000 cleaning the floor and washing the dishes at the same time. So I was kinda happy that i didnt have to wake up to thinking about cleaning the floor and washing the dishes. So I took the robot outside and I tried to talk to it slowly so i wouldn't scare it away and i really really liked the robot it was nice and sweet and it would keep me company and help me if I was lonley and it would play my favorite sports like basketball,soccer,and baseball. So at the end we became best friends.

Her class had gone to the dusty, old library behind the school. During the trip to the library, she had seen something odd. After she had pulled out a huge, torn up book that said '' Guide to...' The rest had been covered up with dust. Behind the book was a little machine that looked like it had been once a working robot. Brook silently picked up the robot and carefully put it her backpack.            ' Are you okay, Brook? ' asked her mom. ' Yeah, never better!' called Brook from upstairs. Brook didn't want her mom to know what she had brought home from school, afraid that she might take it back. Ripping open her backpack, she lifted out the robot. She pressed her fingers to the delicate metal. Smearing dirt of the head of the robot it read ' Gemini- Scout'. Below that was a faded red button. She eagerly pushed the little red button. Nothing happened. Brook sighed. ' I guess this was all for nothing.'               Later the night, Brook had got ready for bed. She stared at the robot sitting in the corner of the room, its dull eyes staring at nothing. ' You worthless peice of junk,' whispered Brook. She soon fell fast asleep.               Suddenly, the faded eyes of the robot gleamed in the darkness of the room. The room filled with an errie red glow. Blinking her drowsy eyes, she got out of bed and flickered the lights on to see what was going on. She shrieked a scream of fear. Her mom and dad came rushing in. Her dad had a bat and was still in his pajama's. ' What's going on?' asked her mom. ' The robot... it just came on!' ' Robot? That thing?' Her mom pointed at the  Gemini- Scout. Suddenly, the robot turned on once more, this time going around the room seeming to search for something. It finally came upon the book.           Picking it up, it rolled over to Brook. Gemini- Scout handed it to her. The family began to read the torn up book. When they were done, they finally realized that this little robot could do a lot of things for them. It's strngth could be for helping aroung the house! Later on, the Gemini-Scout had been a great help to the family, until one day it broke down. They were all very disappointed and made a mini grave for him in the backyard. He was unfixable after falling off the railing while trying to do the moonwalk down the stairs. As they sat by his grave, they realized he should have a name. hey named him Bob. They were all very sad, but in the end they all learned a lesson, never moonwalk down the stairs, and that it doesn't matter weither you are tiny or not, and that you can do great things no matter what the size.

The robots have taken over jobs that the doctors and nurses don't  have to do anymore.  This task allows the doctors and nurses time to get other very important tasks done.  That they didn't have much time for before the robots were created.  These robots have many abilities they can walk, talk, climb stairs, and ride in elevators.  The robots can pull up to 500 pounds.  The robot runs on batteries.  After being charged for 2 hours the robot can run another 12 without stopping.             The robot world has also come up with the Agribots.  The Agribots can pick berries, oranges, grapes, and apples.  These robots are not widely used by farmers.  But many farmers are very interested in what these robots can do.  The robots come in all shapes and sizes.At MIT scientist are working on growing cherry tomatoes with no human help at all.  They have created a greenhouse full of plants that are cared for by small Agribots.  Every plant has sensors that tell the robots what the plant needs.  If a plant is to dry, a robot will water it.  When the robots Senses that a tomato is rip , it uses its mechanical arm to pick the tomato.  It is amazing how well robots have taken over some jobs.  Sometimes all you can do is wonder what will happen next.

I want to see here and ask how i can be like her.   robot is a agribot but he wants to be like mr.gower.   No said Rachel you have to stay here and pick fruits.   Agribots are fruit picking bots they no when they are rip and when they need water.   Ok said Angel if i let you go will you come back and help the other mr.gower bots.       Hk,i promise.   He was almost there and he quickly new it was not safe for him.       He asked another bot were as the building for the mr.gower bots.    The gemimi scout said down the street.   thanks he got ther and no body was nice to him they pushed and teased him but one bot was nice.        It was a bot that ran away from the same place e was made and the bot told him how he missed angel so mr.gower said come back with me   The bot agread and they went to angel and they were happy together they liked being friends so they did for the rest of there lifes.

PAPER          One morning i woke up i was so exited because it was my birthday. I ran down the stairs and found a enormas present in the living room i saw who it was for and it was for me. So I ripped it open and wwwwoooosssshhhh I fell over on to the couch next to my mom and dad and then my present landed in front of us. My present was a robot, it was purple and had a W on the front.          I got soooo exited I got up and jumped on the robot we went outside. I told him to jump it grabbed on to me and he jumped so high i could see China. When we went back down it was like the panic plunge at Silver wood. When we were back down I thanked my parents for the present.          Then i gave the robot 20 bucks to get grocery's. He brought back fruit, chocolate milk eggs, pancake mix, and the 10 bucks back. We had the best morning ever. 	.

Sam a twelve year old boy who was very interested in ribotics. 'I forgot about the science fair!' He rushed off back home after school and dashed into the city junkyard. 'Oh no you don't young man! You are not going to bring a bunch of trash into the house!', called Sams mother. 'But mom, it's for the science fair in a week!' 'No, I won't allow it.' That night Sam thought. What am I going to do for the science fair? The pi equation, homemade mini sapce rocket? Then it came to him. A robot! Voice command an universal! It was to perfect that Sam passed out for the night.       The next day, Sam went to the junkyard agin and settled there. 'If I can't work at home then I'll work here.' First, he brought out his tools and extra materials. Then he got things like a voive box, some robot chips and a lot of  scrap metal. Then for the past days he work on his robot. He gave it legs and a torso. Then a heart shaped fule pump. Then a head and started programing the robots brain. Overall it took five days. The result was a small machanicle person with a screen for a face, it's waist lined with tools and powerful robotic limbs. Sam called in OHM, Operation Handeling Mechanizm. Sam activeated O.H.M. and said 'Follw me.' and they went back home.       On monday Sam went to the  science fair. The judges went up to Sam and said 'What have you made?' 'I call it OHM, Operation Handeling Mechanizm. Do you have anything that is broken?' One of the judges handed him a watch. 'OHM, fix watch'.  and activeated him. OHM brought out a screwdriver and in a flash the watch was fixed. Sam won first place. Later that night there was a gigantic lightning storm. Then a bolt of lightning struck the robot in Sams room. A faint thudump entered the room and it was coming from the robot.       The next morning OHM was gone. Sam jumped up from his bed and went into town. It didn't take long to find him because OHM was right next to town. 'Sam!' OHM called. 'How are functioning without me to give you a direction?' Sam asked. 'I don't know, I just think it's fun!' 'I have to show you to everyone!' Sam excalaimed and they barged into town. People gathered around OHM in awe. Then there was a scream and an explosion. There was a gigantic car wreck and all of the sudden OHM charged into it! About twenty minutes later OHM was carying two large stacks of people on his shoulders that were in the wreck. Like a wildfire, OHM was known all over the world as the r life saving robot made by a twelve year old boy! 	DT NNP NNP NN . '' , VBD NNP NNP DT NN NN JJ NN WP VBD RB JJ IN NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN NN .

The toy was only three feet tall.  It got up and said 'hi, how may I help you today?'  We were stunned and didn't know what to say.  Frank said get me a coke out of the fridge.  Within seconds it came back with Frank's coke.  I asked it for my soccerball and it got me the soccerball.  The robot was clever but was it clever enough to get us an A?  The next day it was time to turn our project in.  My teacher was stunned!  She didn't know what to say either.  Right away she gave us an A+.  Everyone else got a A, B, C, or D.  No one got a F.

There is Gemini Scout he is a remote controlled robot that is used for search in rescue and brings food and a radio for people. He is only 2 feet long and has wheels that can make tight turns and can climb stairs and can get through water. He carries supplies for people and a radio so they can signal back and tell them were they are. Dante 2 is a robot that looks like a spider and has 8 legs. He has a interesting job he uses his legs to climb up walls from volcano craters to help scientist learn more about volcanoes. He was built at very high heat so when its to hot scientist can stay safely away while he goes and looks. He looks for gasses in the craters. Mr. Grower is a hospital robot who brings medicine to patience who need it. He goes everywhere in the hospital and can carry 500 pounds! His bottom half small cabinet and the rest of his body is shelf on wheels. He can talk to he is programed to say over hundreds of phrases. The last robot is called a agribots and is used for helping farmers pick crops. It can sense the color of the fruit and see if its good or bad. They come in all rapes and sizes they can have to be pulled from the back of the truck or they can be smaller and move on there own. These are some of the things Ive learned about robots.            Fifty years ago there was a author named Isaic Asimov he dreamed about robots taking care of children. Lots of robots have been made to copy animals and there behavior. Some robots in Oregon made by college students are made to play hockey or shuffle broad with themselves. One robot was tested to play with kittens it was successful!

The ground was shaking and so was i. so i travled to the sound and in a big open feild ther  lyed a humungus robot. I was teriffied to see what i was seeing. Next i whent home and told my friend what i saw. He whent with me to check it out. We whent in closer and tryed to touch it. it was very very cold. But suddenly a big noise appered agin. We whent around to the robots back and saw a big door. we opened it and saw all of these buttons and switches. We touched one of the buttons and every thing came on even the robot. Then it started to me then................... Booooom we went up in the air and came down fast. We jumped out of it and saw him talking to us then he started shrinking to our size.We asked it a question. It told us his name and were he came from. His name was robei and came frome planet nutron. He said he wasn`t staying long his mom was at the store.We thought that was weird so we took him around town and showed him our homes. But then we saw on the news that people were seeing red and blue lights and one second later robei was on sleep mode. the police knocked at the door asking have we seen anything we said no then shut the door. Finaly robei went back home and we saw a star twinkle in the sky that1s how we knew it was him.

Yes sir ,but one question how are we gonna stop it. there is only one way to stop it and it is the heart so we have to take out the petroleme to stop it. Im almost there so just get in.           Sir im in where is the the heart at? In the center of the engine . So how do I take it out. You don't take it out you freeze it . Ok im takeing out my freeze ray i did now what. Take it out and run and quick. 10 seconds to run so run. I made it we save the world from getting destory.

The Gemini Scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground.Its remote control is the same one that is used to play video games. Wherever it goes, Gemini Scouts collects information. When the robot finds the tapped miners, the miners can use its two way radio to talk with the rescue team. Dante 2 is a robot that climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. The robot is just like a spider, is has eight legs.The legs help the robot climb the steep walls on the volcanoe. It is also built to survive very high heat. Mr.Gower helps the docter's and nurses bring medicine to the patients.It can go anywhere in the hospital,it can ride elevators,steer through the hallways. The robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds. The robot Robbie takes care of children like a babysitter,unlike the childrens parents. Agribots is a robot that picks up fruit. Agribot can tell if the fruit is ripe. Theres a robot that help people play with live animals. A Japanese robot can work,sing,dance, and even play the piano with its two mechanical hands. There are many types of robots that could be in the future,like these robots.

Bryan was an old man who lived alone and worked on a robot in his garage every night. He wanted to make a robot to keep him company on the long and boring nights he spent alone. One night the robot had came alive! Bryan decided to name the robot Rob. After a couple of months, Bryan got very sick. He was always sitting in his bed. Rob decided to go and check on him. Bryan was not moving, so Rob decided to wake him. That night Bryan would not awake. Rob later found out that Bryan had passed.                 Rob was a playful robot. He decided that he wanted some company, so he got a puppy. His little puppy`s name was Jack. Every night he would go out on a walk with Jack around town. Now even though Rob was a robot and Jack was a dog they had lots in common. On their walks they would stop by a cafe, there they would get bundles of attention. Attention was one thing that as a robot, Rob and Jack had deeply enjoyed. They would also stop by the park once in a while. There they would play fetch with the other robots and pets that were there.                 Today was an extra special night, it was Jacks 1st birthday! Today Rob decided to go a different way into town so they could stop by a new dog store that just opened up down the road. Rob went to go grab his rain coat and a little coat for Jack due to the rain. In matter of minutes they were off and headed down the road. About 30 minutes into the walk Rob started to worry, there was nothing in sight. They suddenly stop, right there in front of them was a huge forest. 'Oh no were lost!' shouted Rob.                 Rob decided to just head back home. As him and Jack turned around there were even more trees. Rob climbed up the trees to get a better idea of where they were, but just saw more trees in the distance.They tried every direction there was, but just ended up in the exact same spot. ' What do we do now?' Rob asked. Jack even knew something was wrong and started to cry. All of a sudden, Rob remembered  that Bryan had put a chip in his head to monitor his behaviors. He assumed this chip could direct him and Jack back home. Rob tried and it worked! 'Hey, Jack look, were back home!' exclaimed Rob. 'Home sweet home,' mumbled Rob.

I  found this at these web sites http://www.nbcnewscom/technology/furtureoftech/rescue-robot-just-made-mine-disasters-121251 and http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/03/us/robot-completes-volcano-exploration.html. Gemini-scout is a robot who collects information. For example, it does tests on air for gases and then Gemini tells miners when the air is safe! Dante-scout is another robot who does amazing thins for example he climbs into volcanoes and gathers information for scientists! Dante has eight legs like a spider, it helps him to climb steep walls in the valcanos. Another robot is Mr.Gower  he works in hostpitals to help out nurses and doctors. Mr.Gower is very strong he can pull 500 pounds. A different robot is an Agribot. An Agribot picks fruit like berries,oranges,grapes,and apples. Last but not least is Dante II he scales hillsides.

Scientist 1 went to pick up his daughter from school and realized he left his phone. he drove back to the lab and looked for his phone. he couldn't find it anywhere. his daughter came in wondering what was taking so long and she saw the robot lying on the table. 'Wow! this is so cool!' she said. scientist 1: oh that, its not finished. we are going to throw this away. 'what? why? its so cool though! hey! can i have it?' she said. 'well, it might be really dangerous. but i guess i can take out the cord that makes it turn on. sure.' said scientist 1. ' Yay!!! I'm so excited!' she said. 'okay lets go home now. i just wonder where my phone went.' little did they know that with the phone magnetically attached to that robot without the cord was just what it needed to come alive.           the next day was the daughters day for show and tell day at school. she put the robot in a big box and took the bus to school. she arrived with everyone staring at her. her teacher said, ' what is that?' she said,' its my show and tell .' 'oh. okay well everyone listen up. this is your show and tell presentation.' said the teacher. ' okay ' she opens the box and walking out comes  the robot.' everyone gasps. she just stands there. then a phone rings. ' how many times have i told you students not to have a phone in class?'   everyone looks around. the daughter sees her dads phone attached to the robots leg. she turns it off and the robot shuts down. she turns it back on and the robot turns back on. everyone applauds. she presses a call button and the robot walks. everyone is amazed. so is she. she sees a scanner in the robots chest. she thinks about the homework she forgot about the night before. she packs the robot back up and they finish their school work.           she goes home and when she gets to her room she turns the robot on. she puts her homework in the scanner. its history. the robot makes noises and then starts acting like queen elizabeth the 1st. then starts acting like abe lincon. she tries to turn it off but it just gets louder. her dad walks in and gasps.he  runs over to the  robot and looks at his daughter with a smile. he asked 'how did you do that'? she said that she didn't. he then sees the phone and then he takes out the batteries. 'wow. these batteries are dead! i just recharged them.' he gets new ones and puts them in the phone. the robot is back to normal. the girl says 'well... you should take it. its to dangerous.'           he takes it to the lab and they create many more but one has a more accurate battery that will last a long time. the scientist gives the robot to his daughter and it helped entertain her with the scanner. she could play movies and lots of other things. later in life she becomes a scientist. she find the old robot and makes a potion that will make it real. it then get a brain, heart, and soul. then the robot leads everyone to further science and many discoveries are made.

It was a house robot and a hospital robot. It would clean up around the house and it would help in the hospitals by collecting information. And if you needed it to, it would pick fruit. It also plays with the kids so you don't have to.               One day, the robot's eyes turned red while it was playing catch with the kids. The kids' names were Sally and Robert. They got really scared and they ran to their mom screaming. She asked them what was wrong and they said the robots eyes turned red. She said they were going crazy and went back to watching TV. So they went back outside to see if the eyes were still red and they were. Then all of a sudden the robot started to talk. They ran away and the robot started chasing them. The same was happening to all the robots in the world. The robots were attacking everybody.               The Sally and Robert didn't know what to do. Then one man came and his name was John Connors. He was destroying all the robots but they were to many. So he called in his team. He told the kids 'come with me if you want to live'.So they went with him in a helicopter and they destroyed all the robots.               Then Robert woke up. It had all been a dream.

Time travel robots will get information about the past and future.   They will tell us when there will be a war or if a naturail disaster will come.They are going to find what life was like when the oldest living man was like or the prehestoric age. robots that time travel will probably prevent the world to be a waste land by telling the people from the past and future to start cleaning up.            Robots that have imotion will take care of children in need.They can get a job as a actor for people who dont have money. They be a movie star by their imotions they can act like a nice nanny or a horrifing creature.These robots can do like what a human actor can.       the crime scene robot can find finger prints in a istant.They can even find the person if they were in a mall or a meeting.The robots can use the evedince to test who it is.They can breake down doors and properly use a gun. They can be useful of many things at a crime.            Some robots can have the face of a human and expretions of a humans.these robots can atach it self to a person who does not have the following:arms,legs,fingers,kidney heart. they are the most important robots in the world.

I walked out of the house and noticed that i was the only human to be seen.All around me their were robots. i said to myself,'robots cant come to life they're toys'.I turned around and a robot was right in front of me so i screamed and ran as fast as i could.I went into the first house i saw luckily the door was open.I looked inside there were so many different weapons i could use to kill the robots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             As looked at them i started to get in gear.I noticed some noises coming from up stairs.So i went up stairs and all i saw were these very mean and angry robots.So it kept getting closer and closer to where i was.It started to throw lazer beams at me.So i grabbed my weapon and killed it.There were still so many around the neighborhood left. So i thought a moment and i was going to run full speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I went all around town killing all the robots.It was pretty tuff but i did it.Now i know what to do when robots come to life again.I kinow what to do.Robots are kind of weird.I know i didnt think they were real before.But know that i have expierienced it i know what to do for when it happens again tho the neighborhood next time.

It was usually quiet there every single day, but that day was not one of those days.  As I was walking past my garage   I heard a very loud and strange sound which starled me in the beginning.  I took a couple steps front, and a couple steps back to see if anything would happen.  Nothing had happen.       I decided to go in my garage to see what was making that noise, but it took a lot of courage for me because I am always easily scared.  I took some deep breaths and slowly opened the garage door.  As I picked it up, I could see that the light was not turned on, which meant it was pitch black in there.  I held my breath and tipped toed inside, as I tried to reached all over the walls to find the light switch, I stumbled on something very perculiar.        All of a sudden, the light turned on and I could see everything that was happening.  I looked down to see what I stumbled upon, and it was a robot!  It wasnt just any kind of robot, it was a very unique kind of robot.  It was not like any other robot I have seen on television.  It had a fluffy body which was shaped in a diformed kind of way.  It only had one eye which was always twitching for no reason.  It had wheels for feet and an opening on the tummy.       I blinked in disbelief while I examined the robot. It looked friendly and not harmful at all.  I pet the back of the robot, it just looked at me and smiled with it weirdly shaped mouth.  ' I wonder what it can do?', I asked myself.  There was a bright red button on the opening of the tummy.  I pressed it and othing happened.  I took a huge step back and thought for a moment.         All of a sudden the lights turned off, and then I saw differnt kinds of colors flashing everywhere.  There was smoke coming from the robot. I stood there in shock, not knowing what to do.  The robot calapsed and it slowly opened.  Streamers came out from it, shooting everywhere inside the garage.  Music started playing from it and there was candy and little gifts all over the ground.  i couldnt belive it!  For the first time in history, I discovered a party robot!

The robot tells me that he belongs to a machine scientist,but he says that he could stay in my house for a while. The robot was programed to help people and respond to commands. My mom, dad, and brother always tell him commands. I also tell him to do things too, but he should be treated with respect. So I give him an award every time he does something. Then I called him skippy because he always skips happily when he does something. On a bright day a man bumped into me. He looked familiar because he looked lika scientist. Then he asked me that if have I seen a small robot and I told him yes. I showed him skippy. Then he proclaimed that skippy was his because he had been looking for him ever since. I gave him back his robot and he thanked me. I was dissapointed until I thought I should make a robot. 	PRP VBD RB VBG RP IN DT NNP NNP VBD PRP VBP CC VBD TO VB NNP NNP DT IN DT JJ PRP VBZ TO VB .

The robot could almost do everything as if it was alive. Everybody thought that the robot was alive but it was just that way. Days passed and the robot would do more magical things. It looked like if the robot was a real person because it did everything what a person does. After months past, the robot was coming more misterius and much more. Then he just desapeared for a while. The people were like curious because it was weird that he would desapier with out telling anyone. It was like if he was dead or something because it was so misterius. Months passed, and the robot wouldn't come back. One person was crying because  the robot was helping her and she just didn't know anything about the robot.After one year passed the robot finally came back . Everyone was asking the robot questions but he just dint respond to none of them.Only one person was crying because she said that he was like his dad or something,  but then she said that if she would of asked a question to the robot he wouldn't answer her question because he didn't answer anybody else questions. So she kept saving the question for days. While other people were asking him other questions but he just ignored them, because he did not want to respond to them. After months everyone was getting mad at the robot and didn't like him no more because he dint respond to the questions about why he desapeared so quickly and not telling nobody. Then years passed and the girl finally asked him why he was so misterius and desapeard with out telling nobody. When the girl asked that crying  the robot thought about it and then told her because he was turning into a person. Then  the girl just started  to cry louder and louder. After like three years passed the robot desapeared again and a new person came.

This robot can achive meny meny difrent things and all we have to do is tach it what can happen if something does go wrong. If we start today we dont have so meny lifes in danger as we do now. You and the world should know that if it is to hot for us that that bot will melt. One thing that the scientists dont know is that how hig of a temperature that bot can take.

The got me a  best cellphone in the world, a laptop, and a pair of earphones. I was really excited to get the cell phone. So after the party i ran up to my room pluged in the ear phone and searching for songs. When i was about to press play but i heard Your dead in the earphones like a smooth wisper.       I asked my sister if she said anything and we both thoght it was the wind the next morning my sister was dead and bleeding all over her bed with my cell phone on her. I didn't know yet no one knew but i checked on the laptop and it was a virus from my phone and said i killed your ugly sister. I chuckeld and said yha thinking she wasn't dead so i checked on her and she was acoually dead.       I wasn't really sad though but i got my mom and she took her to the hostpital. I wasn't crying but my mom started to flood the floor with her tears. I thought how could a cell phone kill my sister. the doctors said it was suicied. when she was gone things kept heaing and seeing wierd things on the laptop, in the earphones, and without.   life was going better for me without my sister just me and my mom becouse my dad died in the military.

One sunny day I was in my backyard looking for my shoes because my little sister keeps hiding them. I looked every where but still, I couldn't find them. I'm in a hurry because I'm having a student council meeting at my school. I'm the student council vice president. Suddenly, I find broken metal pieces on the grass. 'Maybe i can use these metal pieces for my school project,' I said excitedly. After that, I finally found my shoes and then I ran to school.                                                                                            After I came back from school, I did my homework and then I went to my room. Suddenly, I remembered about the metal pieces I found in my backyard. Then I thought to myself 'What if i build a robot.' I knew building a robot wasn't going to be easy but I have to at least try my best. After that i started building the robot.I stayed up all night working on my project.' I cant wait to show my new robot to the whole school!' I thought to myself. 	PRP$ NNP .

All of a sudden it came to life. The robot said 'Don't be alarmed I will not hurt you. everybody thought I didn't work but then you came.'. Then I started screaming and the robot came after me. I locked myself in the bathroom but he unlocked it.       Then I knew that he wasn't going to hurt me because he was looking at me with puppy dog eyes. So I said 'Well I think I will name you Rusty Maximus Willard Behanna.'. So I walked out of the bathroom and he asked me 'Do you want anything to drink'. I said ' I will grab it''. Then he said 'No I'll get it'. So I said 'Give me a Coke'. So I sat down on the couch and he brought my Coke to me.       He told me that he also closed the door. I asked him if he could make something. He said'yeah what do you want'. I told him that I wanted a hotdog. He said'okay I will be back with your hotdog'. I thought to myself 'I might as well keep him'. After a couple of minutes he brought out my hotdog.

It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns,and it can even roll through water,and other supplies.it can even drag hurt people to safety.       Wherever it goes gemini-scout collects information. For example ,it tests in air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe.The robot also has a thermal camera to help miners. A thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things 	IN PRP VBP TO VB WDT NN TO VB RB VB IN PRP VBP DT NN JJ IN DT NN PRP VBZ DT NN VBN NN IN VBZ NN CC NN NN IN NNS IN NN .

My sister was tired so we stopped to take a brake.Then we walked some more and saw something shiny we thought that it was just the lake but when we got there it was a robot.     After we saw it was a robot my sister wanted to take it home so we did but we couldn't tell our parents so we kept it in the shed.The next day me and my sister wanted to tell our dad since he was a scientist but we couldn't because they would experiment on him.     Then one day mom went out to the shed and saw him but didn't tell dad she made us tell him.When dad got home we told him and he was kinda angry at us for not telling him but then he was kinda exited so he could rub it in the other scientist faces but we made him promise not to tell anyone.     One day we were all looking at it and it moved.Then it woke up and we all were scared at first but then it said 'I come it peace' then we all were reliefed.My sister and I named it Bob the robot.One day my dads friends came over and saw Bob and called the science department and they rushed over and took Bob.They took Bob apart to see how robots were made.The next day dad tried to get him back they said that he couldn't take him back.Finally we never got him back but we get to sees him whenever we want.

He can do a huge varity of things.                    One thing the Gemimi-scout can do is go under water and look at sunkin ships. and if they are going on a small boat to look at the sunkin ship. the Gemimi- scout can carry your supplies. like food, and other things. then when it is time you make the Gemimi-scout go and look at the ship.               Another thing the Gemimi-scout can do is, it can go in mines and find the oars and it can climb latters and make sharp turns.  the gemimi- scout can bring up all that stuff and its yours!                       And one more thing the is if you have ever played a video game then you know how to use a Gemimi-scout. It is that easy to contral.                        i think Gemimi-scouts are cool they are my favorite kind of robot. i cant wait to see what other kinds of robots they are going to make.

One day in the summer he was in his room like always inventing what he always has been trying to do for almost one year now he claims it is a robot. His mom is a very hard worker she works all day long. So that means that she pays him no attention and it is just him and his mom. 'Yeah I finally finished it now to see if it works.' 'AHHHH I broke a nail and it hurt.' The machine did not work so he finally stopped inventing things. The next day something strange happened he found the robot standing in front of his bed walking around its self. 'Yes it actually worked.' Ryan was so exited he told his mom and even brought it to school. After all he was the first kid to make robot in Texas.       THE END.

My bionic human carries important equipment.The robot carries medical stuff and entertaining stuff. The medical stuff is like a first aid kit but better it will be able to help anyone that needs help. The entertaining stuff is to keep kids from being board.                   The other bionic to the super human is able to wistand high heat tempatures. I put that in the robot so it can help save lives. The robot can walk right into a burning building and save every one in there.                 The robot has excelent eyesight that can see miles away to see if any one needs help. It can also see all kinds of stuff.                    clearly thats an excelent robot.

So after Lynn got home from school Lynn ran up stairs went straight to her room and pratice how to make a robot. Later that day Lynn practice,practice,parctice so finally she got it. Later that knight she went to sleep and she heard a noise so then she got up and look around and she saw that her robot that she had made came alive. Lynn got scared and she screamed so then she hide up under the covers and the robot started talking. Lynn was so scared that she used the bathroom on her self. The robot said 'Hey what's your name'? and Lynn answered back 'Lynn. So later on that knight Lynn tried to come up with a name to name the robot and then she finally thought of one and named it Deanna. So Lynn got up early and woke up Deanna and they hurried up and got out of the house and ran to school. When Lynn got to school everybody was like who is that robot with you? Deanna said ummmm this is my robot that came alive and her name is Deanna. So later on that day Lynn and Deanna was leaving school and then later on when they got home and it was time for bed Lynn and Deanna went to sleep and Lynn woke up the next morning and Deanna didn't wake up and Lynn was sad.

Our planet is called Galactica it is 200,000,000,000,000,000,000.142374593241524364657 lightyears away from your socalled Earth. We have started a war between another planet which is exactly the same distance away accept it is on the opposite side. In the box next to this is a robot so advanced that it can dictect the very thought that you think. Now you being the leader of your planet you must decide weather to join us, however if you thinkanything other than the words yes I will join you, this robot will blow eniliating your entire planet.

People did not know that robots could do so much some thought that all they did was watch kids. To people back then they didnt think they could make a robot that helps ervey one and has its own little job helping people. Most people would have never guessed that they could drive for you but now every thing that people thought robots could do is coming true they take care of people they can help doctors and nurses and they can even help sciencetic study volcanoes because they can get closer to them then humans cause they can handle the heat unlike humans. Some robots can pick fruit and know when its ripe by the color of it. Pluse they are going to be able to drive in Nevada they wil have a red licens plate that haven't been used sence the 1940s. Some people thought of robots to be useless but now robots can do some things humans cant and some things we can but it makes it easier for sciencetic to study volcanoes up close and not feel the heat.

Can carry food,water,and some other supplies,also they can even drag hurt people to safety.   Also,there is a robot call Mr.Gower it needs batteries so it can run,Mr.Gower can go anywhere in the hospital.It can also ride a elevator can also steer through the hallways and can move around anything that get in the way.Robots are so strong that they can pull about 500 pounds.But also the batteries need to charge for two hours, they can be used for about twelve hours NO stopping.    There is a other different robot also too it is call Dante 2 it is a robot it is a interesting, robot because it can work in jobs like can help scientists,Also scientists could not learn about volcanoes that is why Dante 2 is changing,so he can help them.Dante 2 looks for vents or for holes,in the crater then they can now collect  the information, for scientists.   This is the last robots it is call Agribots this robot can pick up fruits like berries,oranges,grapes,apples,sometimes strawberrys because they really don't grow only in Japan they can grow and the strawberry's ,also can sense the color of the berries.This can also help the robot smell them so they can pick them faster.   Finally,robots like playing with each other.Robots have friends like we do they have family's also like us.They have fun together playing,there was a man that had kids they liked playing with robots the babysitter can the robots Robbie.The man wrote a story they all liked the story because it was fantastic then people were thinking that robots are true,because the man told them in the story about that they have family's like us,have fun,and do jobs that is why people starting to know that robots were true.   This is why i wrote this story about robots and that they are true and they are lots of more robots to learn but these up there were some i learn today,someday you well learn about robots.

He slammed the door behind him and turned around and went straight to his desk, and pulled out the front drawer and there was nothing there! He started going crazy looking all over. It was no were to be found. there was only one solution he thought to himself. He walked into his brothers room while he was sleeping. 'OUCH!' Adam yelled. he picked up his foot and was astonished to find an arm, not a human arm but a robot arm, HIS robots arm. He had been working so hard it and now all of his work is down the drain because of hi stupid little brother.       'MOOOOOOOOOM I'M HOME!' Adam yelled as he got back from school. 'How was your day?' she replied. 'Good'. Adam slumped on his bed and tinkered with the robot pieces he had found in his brothers toy chest. Adam suddenly sat up, he had an idea, why sit around and mope all day long when he can fix it and make it even better. he thought it was a great idea and so he got right to work.       he began by finding some old screw drivers and wrenches and a bunch of other tools. He got to his room and sat at his desk for the rest of the day and the entire evening. when his friends called he told them he was sick and coughed a little so they would believe him.       About a week after he fixed to robot something strange happened. he came into his room and the robot wasn't standing on his desk. Adam knew where to go first. He marched straight into Jonathan's room (his brother) 'WHERE IS IT!!!' he yelled.   'wewrs what?' Adam was furious,'never mind' he marched out in to the kitchen and and his eyes almost popped out of his head. Adam stood there watching a robot make eggs and toast. his robot was....

They are not mythical creatures that came from the future. They are simply just objects that help humans out. In the next few paragraphs, I will tell you the many ways a robot can help.                One type of robot that came to life is a Gemimi-Scout. Gemini-Scouts are very small but are mighty strong. They can collect information about mines, because they work their. This wonderful robot can even save somebody's life! But of course, this robot is used by a remote control and goes whereever you want it to go.                A Dante 2 is also a robot, with many jobs to do. A Dante 2 can climb with its eight legs. These kind of robots can survive very hot heat. This robot can also collect information about gases that come out of vents and other objects.                Mr. Gower is a robot that helps doctors and nurses in a hospital. Its body can hold many different types of medicines. Mr. Gower has wheels. As you can see, robots are very useful and helpful.

He thought of   making a macaroni helicopter, or air plane out of tomatoes. He even thought of doing a volcano made of corn flakes. But none of that sounded any good to him so he kept thinking. One day he came up with idea to make a ?ROBOT! He was so exited that he finally came up with his idea so he started on his masterpiece right away.       Many Year Later ' Finally it is finished.' he said. 'now lets turn him on.' FLICK goes the on switch but off stays the robot. The scientist was crushed . He sat in lab trying to see what went wrong until he noticed he was very hungry. So he slowly walked over to the kitchen to make macaroni and cheese for dinner. When he was finished eating he went to bed.        When the scientist woke up the next day he was happy to see that his robot was up and running. The robot had done the dishes, cleaned the floor, mopped, vacumed, made breakfast, and played with the dog and every one was very happy from then on.

The class yelled and some hid behind the  teacher's desk.The teacher got on her desk and yelled 'QUIET,it's a helpful robot.'   The class quieted down while the teacher told the three students to take the robot home and they were excused to go home.'I'll tell the principal that you forgot today was monday and you thought it was sunday'.The three students went throught the restroom window and left.Before they bought a robot they had a puppy. 'What are you doing home from school?Did all you get suspended?' Their mom asked. 'no we were excused from school'they said. 'oh...ok' she said.They all left to the store and left the puppy home alone.They came back and saw them playing. 'Guys I think I know what we are going to tell everyone about the robot'one kid said 'do i get the camera?'the mom said   ''yes''.She got it and the next day they showed the class the puppy and robot playing.They got an A!They went home and showed their mom.She was so happy the went for ice cream with the robot and puppy.

They all walked in and looked around for a bit when Dillon yelled' guys come take a look at this'. The other two walked over to Dillon and found him staring at something under a tarp. The thing was fairly large and was on wheels. They took the tarp off and found and found a huge robot. There was a little green button on the side that said 'power on'. Dylan c had to be an idiot and press the button.              The Robot roared to life with a crash and a clutter. The robot sped out of the room and flew into the sky. the kids did not know what just happened because it happened so fast.             A few day later the sky turned red and the robot flew down with his robot army. The robot yelled i am going to take over the planet.  The robot army killed all of man kind. It took over the planet and went on to take over more planets. It failed and a different robot army won.

Their are robots for helping people who are in danger and robots who just help out in the hospital.the robots that are out side their are some who are inside . their are robos who sing and dance and just play around with you .There are many robots who help and play with us and we should be glad for them.

Bob couldn't talk or move. So the next day i tried to fix Bob and I did till lunch time. I left Bob in the barn while I ate. While I was eating Bob came to life! I went back out to the barn and Bob was petting my dog. my dog's name is Pepper. He is a blue heeler.        I could not believe that Bob came to life! Pepper liked Bob. Pepper would jump on Bob and lick him. Iasked Bob if he wanted anything to eat. Bob wanted some pizza rolls. So i made him some. He ate all of them. I wanted to go fishing and Bob didn't know how to fish. So I taught him. We each caught seven. That night we had a big fish fry.Me and Bob and Pepper ate all the fish that we had caught.Bob had learned alot today. He is very strong and can talk.Bob had two legs and two arms.

Robots work really hard all day every day they do many jobs   nobody ever works as hard as robots do.I think robots work   harder then anyone in this whole intier world.       Robots also save lives and they save lifes.they can do that   because sientist made the robot and sientist can make and   do anything they can.       There are alot of other robotsb and one of them is called   a gimi-scout robot.a gimi-scout robot is a romote controler   robot that does search and rescue mines under ground.   the gimi-scout robot is also strong and they also collect   information.for example it tells the air for gases and then   tells the mines when the air is right.       And thats what i lerned about robots and my favorite robot   is the gimi-scout robot its really interesting to read about.

He was very lonely and was bullied at school. After school one day he came home to find a letter in his mail box, 'You have been randomly chosen to receive out a toy dog.' Joey read aloud, 'this dog can do many amazing things. And you are in luck, your toy will be here soon!' Joey was completely enlightened and couldn't wait.       Three days later Joey found a box in the mail. 'That can't be right,' He thought as he looked down at the box that was no bigger than his thumb, 'The box is so small.' So, Joey walked into his room and opened the tiny box. A little, itty-bitty, metallic dog fell out of the package holding a piece of paper. 'WOOF WOOF!' said the dog. Joey was surprised at the bad quality of the toy. Joey put the dog into his dresser and left his room. When he came back the dog was running around, even though he was only an inch tall. Joey realized he had come alive, he didn't really think it over because he was to surprised by the dog.       So, Joey decided to read the paper, 'Congrats on your new puppy! your toy will do amazing things! He will play fetch, grab your newspaper, teach him tricks, cuddle with you, and much, much more! your dog won't ever need to go to the bathroom, and just feed him table scrapes. Furthermore, he will grow when ever you want (as big or small) just tell him to grow or shrink and he will.'       'I'll name you Spot!' said Joey astounded. 'WOOF WOOF!' responded Spot. Joey then commanded Spot to grow to a normal sized dog. And he did. The two boys played together for the rest of the day in Joey's room. The next day Joey realized that he didn't tell his parents. He already loved Spot and didn't want him taken away, so Spot remained a secret. Joey said, 'Spot, shrink down, be quiet, and get into my backpack.' Spot did as he was told.       At school Joey met up with his friend, Bob. At lunch Joey show Bob Spot. Bob was also surprised by Spot. 'how did you get him?' asked Bob. 'He came in the mail. I wasn't really expecting him.' Bob took some pictures of spot so he could remember him. None of them realized that the school bully, Sam, was watching them. Joey had spot get back into his bag as they walked to class. Sam followed them around without being noticed until they got to the library. Joey put down his backpack and walked away. 'Now I've got you. But where is your instructions?' said Sam, 'I'll deal with that later.' Sam then took spot and ran off. 'WOOF WOOF!' screamed Spot, but no one heard him.       When Joey and Bob left the library they look for Spot. 'He's gone!!!' they both screamed. 'Lets look over the pictures to see if there are any clues of where he could of gone.' said Bob. After a little while of looking over the pctures they saw Sam in the backround staring at Spot. 'Sam must have him!' yelled Joey. After a while Joey had a plan, 'We'll go to my house and see if there is something in the instructions.' 'then what?' asked Bob. 'I have apsoulutly no idea on what to do after.' 'We will figure it out. And we will get him back.' 'Thanks that really helps.'       After reading the instructions they had no idea on what to do. 'This is hopeless.' cried Joey. They had both read over Spot's manual 500 times. 'We will get him back.' said Bob. School was over for the day, so they would have time to think of plan over night.       By the next day Joey had a plan: the would follow Sam around and steal his backpack. But, if that didn't work there was a backup: to go up to Sam's locker and whisper spot into it until he responded (luckily Sam and Bob had lockers that were next to each other). And he came up with a backup for the backup: Just go up and ask him for Spot.       Joey told Bob all of his plans and came up with just doing the backup. They went to his locker and said Spot a bunch of times until he responded. Then they picked his lock from th inside out by telling Spot what to do.  they almost had when Sam walked up and said, 'What are you doing to my locker.' They then asked if they could have Spot back and Sam responded with a loud 'No.' They askd him why and he said,'I've always 	RB IN DT NN EX VBD DT RB JJ WP VBD RB CD NNP NNP , VBD DT NN POS NN , CC PRP VBD DT NNP NNP VBD RB RB CC VBD VBN IN NNP NNP NN CD NN PRP VBD NN TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN , PRP VBP VBN RB VBN TO VB RP DT NN NNP '' NNP RB VBD , NNP NN MD VB JJ VBG NNP CC PRP VBP IN NN , PRP$ NN MD VB RB RB .

It could even stop sound from a high distance and order it would be useful for businesses and other useful things and that it would be alot useful without making a sound in the room. If you want yours high volumed the cone shall stop the sound for disrupting other people and also you could do it without any wire. If your delivering boxes or doing all that stuff you could use it if your done finishing delivering boxes or when your on the rode you could also hear music.Its that easy and useful too.It might become distractful as long as you dont bring it to school.The thing is if you dont have a cellphone or a walkietalkie you will usually count on them.

They had to get up go to work and concentrate for their busy day ahead of them. Although, this wasn't just an ordinary day for a special robot named Jerrry. Jerry was a ' Mr. Gower' kind of robot, this means that Jerry carried medicines and zipped through elvevators, and  stairs to get to the docort and nurse fast! Jerry was the best robot in the hospital! Right when nurses and doctors called for medicnes Jerry would be there within a heartbeat! However, for the past couple weeks the word was getting out that the ' Famous Jerry' was unblievable! That day visitors were wanting to see Jerry including an evil man. This evil man had no known names, for he switches his names so he can keep his identity hidden. That evening, the evil man disguised himself as a doctor and put a potion that would make Jerry a human, so he could work for him. Once he stteled it in Jerry's small cabinet while he was charging, he dashed out to look as if he wasn't there. In only a couple of minuets the hospital would soon be filled with smoke, with no one not knowing where they were. 'BOOM!' Jerry heard screaming and commotion and dashed out from the hospital. He now realized he was human.           Jerry could now here himself breating and couldnt stop running till he reached a coffee shop. He didn't know where he was and what had happened. Soon he saw the hospital he grew up in on the news! He couldnt believe that it was closed, and who would do such a thing! But he realized the big question, how was he human, and what can he do to get back? He had plan but didn't know if it would turn out fine, but the number one thing Jerry had to was to be safe and get his life back.

Alex and Trent are on their lunch break when Morgan comes to them,thinking they look 'trustworthy'.'Where am I'Morgan asks them.'You're on Mars'says Trent jokingly.Alex punches him softly and says'You're in a school,in Ohio.Morgan looks confused.He pulls his sleeve back and reveals some sort of watch.Without saying a word,he presses a button and waves goodbye.But he doesn't move at all.He looks back at his watch and there is some taco sauce on his watch.Trent pulls back his shoulders and says'Sorry dude'.Morgan looks angry and sighs'The name is Morgan''Alex and that is Trent'replies Alex.'Well that Trent of yours just ruined my time tr-uughh watch'says Morgan.'I said sorry!'screams Trent.'Well here's the deal,My partner is creating a robot that wants to nuke the world.'What do you want us to do?'says Trent.'Shut up Trent,you've done enough already'Alex tells Trent.Andrew comes over,looking as if he rules the world.'What's going on,who is that?'   'That is Mo-'  'I'm Jacob'Morgan interrupts.           'Ohhh really?'Andrew sarcastically replies.BOOM!.Everybody faints.Alex awakes and realizes that Morgan is strapped on a wall,bleeding.There is a hole in the wall and Trent is missing.In the background,you can see Andrew trying to fight back to some stranger.Alex gets up but falls back down,noticing that he is also strapped.Andrew then grabs a remote and presses a random button.Alex and Morgan are now free.Morgan seems really angry,walks up to the stranger and gives him a 'taste of his own medicine'.There is a machine that flies up into the air.A computer announces'Nuke will be laucnhed in 5,4,3..'Trent comes in and grabs the robot and slams it back into the ground.Andrew then turns and tazes Trent and freezes Morgan with a freeze ray.Andrew comes toward Alex but Alex is able to escape and lock Andrew in a chamber.But the robot still remains...          Trent and Morgan are still paralyzed in the building.Andrew puts the building on self destruct mode.Alex has to make a choice.The world,or his friends.He goes on a high speed chase on the robot because the robot is about to destroy the world with the nuke.'5 minutes remain until self destruction'Andrew tells Trent and Morgan.Hudson,however is still alive and freezes and Andrew.'You're a traitor'Hudson tells Andrew.Hudson saw that    Andrew gave Alex the key to destroying the robot.Hudson is about to de-activate the self destruction,when Alex shuts down the robot.Alex has no idea what he has done.         Hudson is going after Alex now.Not him,but another robot,named the HA-J4.Alex has no other friends to help him,him being an orphan and not really popular.He has to save the world himself.         BOOOM.The building has self destructed.Alex is about to save Morgan and Trent once it blew up right before his eyes.He goes back to the school and grabs Trent's unfinished taco.He puts it in his pocket and goes to a nearby volcano.He wants to spread 'Trent's'ashes in the volcano.Once he arrives Andrew tackles Alex.'Prove your loyalty to me'Hudson says,smiling.He grabs Alex and throws him in the volcano.Morgan arrives with Trent and they teleport both of them and save Alex.'How did you get out of there?''My watch was still working'chuckles Morgan.Alex gives the taco back to Trent.But really,the taco is a robot....

A steady red light flashes on the tiny three centimeter robot as Sally spotted her robot, nicknamed the Factor 1.  Sally asked,' Have we finished our chores?' 'Yes, Sally,'the Factor 1 replied in a stiff voice, skillfully throwing a dirty paper towel into the trash bin next to Sally with one of its mechanical arms.             Sally sighed,' I'm bored.' There was nearly nothing to do when Sally's babysitter, Richie, was in the house.  With his trusty thermal camera, Richie could spot Sally a mile away, even if Sally went on the fastest scooter.  'What about a walk in the woods?'the Factor 1 suggested.  ' We aren't allowed to go there!' Sally exclaimed. '... Which makes it a perfect hideout from Richie... Factor 1?' 'Yes?''We're going for a hike in the woods!' Sally announced.               As Sally packed a peanut butter and jelly sandwich into her stuffed backpack, Factor 1 kept a keen eye out for Richie.  Richie was saying his farewells to Sally's parents, who were going to an all night dance party.  'Affermative,' Richie declared as Sally's parents gave him the last of their instructions.  ' Now is a good time, Sally,' Factor 1 whispered as Richie waved to thered car.   'Come on,' Sally said as she slipped past the back door.  Richie closed the front door just as Sally closed the back door.  Richie has excellent hearing, so if Sally closed the door too late or too soon, Richie would have heard it.               Crunch, crunch, crunch.  As the fall leaves crunched under Sally's feet, Sally raced silently along the rushing creek water.  As Sally saw an opening, she sat behind a tree trunk and munched on some barbaque chips. Factor 1 scurried into Sally's view and rested on a cusion of leaves.  Trees surronded Sally, the canopy high in the air.  Rays of white moonlight burst through the leaves and shone on Sally's shoes.  ' I think there is something in the trees,' Factor 1 muttered as it approached a huge object behind the trees.  Sally silently followed in wonder and curiousity. 'A robot!' she excitedly exclaimed as she saw the robot covered in moss and with animals scurrying around.  As she turned the On switch on, the robot rumbled with life and white light blinded Sally.  The animals ran away in fear as the mighty robot stood.  'Back off!' a familiar voice cried as an orange light flashed in the darkness.  In robot rankings, yellow was the highest, then comes orange, blue, purple, pink, red, green, and finally white.  An orange light was considered strong to Sally and to the giant robot. 'Where am I?'the giant thundered as it took a step foward. Richie came into view.   A light appeared on the giant unknown robot and it was black.  'Stop, Richie!  Look at the light color!' Sally said as she noticed the black light. Black represented blank or nothing. Richie lowered his laser and the three went home with a new friend, now named Giant.

Gemini-Scout is a robot that does search and rescue in the mines underground.this robot is small but strong. he is less than two feet tall and has wheels. it can go up and down stairs. it can even take tight turns. it also carries food.              Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job, it climbs up volcano's to gather information. like a spider it has eight legs. It helps scientists gather information from volcano's that they cant climb so the robots climbs it. it looks for vents or cracks in the volcano's. now they can study volcano's from outstandingly close distances.

Some can even play sports and make you practice and get better at what you play as. Also they can be your alarm when your running late to class or job.       Some robots even can cary your stuff when you have a lot of stuff to get.It can also help sheffs when their cooking something really hard and they need extra hands with something.Then some of the robots are made to practice shooting for the police or act like their robbing a pretend store and they got to stop him.They can also help fire fighters when there is stuff in the way and there is no way to get in so it can just move the thing that was in their way.       Many other robots can be used for karote so it can help them with their skills or to deminstrate a thing to the student in the karote class.Some can even be used in a movie like iron man the movie they use robot parts or maby they are robots.Also many are for acting in a commercial,ad,or even a newspaper.They can even be the future helpers or even todays helpers.      And a lot of they robots are remote controlled and they can work in mines.Then it can also find trapped miners and some have a radio to contact the rescue team.A lot are even used in vidoe games the robots are built to be easy to use.Another robot was built to help scientist and it was built to look like a spider so it can crawl to places were scientist can't go.       A other robot is one that picks fruit it picks berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. With that robot you can get a fruit that you couldn't reach or pick from a tree like an apple.Another robot can have gadgets, guide trains on tracks, and sort trash. Some can even dance, sing, and even play music.And another car can drive all by it's self it is one of the remote control one's.

For example if they are lost in the mountains or woods the arrow scout can help you go in the right direction. The arrow scout can find you easily at day and at night how? In the night it has thermal vision that can help it see through rain or snow. In the day it can find you by the ground movement you make. The arrow scout is a ground robot that can not be harmed by animals or bad weather.The arrow scout has an emergency kit inside the robot if someone is hurt. It just pushes the kit out and you can simply get it quick. The arrow scout has a camera that sends photos to search teams and labs.                      The arrow scout can help search teams too. The arrow scout can also go in water and point to the direction a tsunami is going to come that way.The arrow scout helped a scientist named Ryan that was lost and injured find his way back to the lab. The arrow scout can also provide protection mostly at night from harmful creatures how? people ask. it has a special light that scares animals away it may sound weird but it is not. People ask why is it so big? the creators say it is big because it might get crushed or covered in snow.The arrow scout is so strong it can carry and pull 600 pounds that is why it is also big.The arrow scout is a magnificent robot that can save alot of lives and helped alot of people. It was first used in a training site in  Atlanta,Georgia. It was a success and no problems ever happend. And so it was created a robotin 1995 and is still used today and  scientist and the creators of the arrow scout trying to make changes to it.

Her daughter Stephanie and son Adrian went with her to Building shop and saw some one throwing away a broken toy. It was hard to tell what it was from a distance, but when they got closer they saw it was a broken robot named 3-pio. They begged their mother if she could fix it but she said,'No, it is to old and rusty'.                                                                                                      Later when they were leaving, Adrian snuck the robot in his mothers purse. When they got home he snuck the robot into his room and started trying to fix it. His mother called him so he put the robot in the sun where he thought no one would find it. But Stephanie found the robot and told her mother. Stella was furious with Adrian for taking the toy home, but he told her that he would take good care of it if she would just fixed it.                         Stella came out the room with the robot in her hand and turned on a switch that made the robot come alive, the robot asked Adrian who had brought him here? Adrian said that he did so the robot told Adrian that he was his master and he would obey Adrian's every command. Adrian's mom told him that when he dies out of energy to just put him in the sun. One day 3-pio told Stella if he could come with her to the science center contest. Stella said,' That she would be thrilled for him to come.'                                          A couple days later              Stella tells him to stay calm when we enter the Science Center ,but when he got in he couldn't believe what he was seeing. He kept asking Stella to buy him things but at the end when they got home Stephanie and Adrian were screaming at their mom for buying him everything he wanted and she didn't buy them anything.                      3-pio came out and told them that he was sorry that he didn't get them anything, and said he would share with them. But Adrian screamed at 3-pio and told him that he didn't want his stinking stuff that he bought. But finally Stella said,' Kids remember that hes just a robot and he knows no better than we all do so leave him alone and Adrian go take 3-pio to get some sun', but when Adrian got a second to be alone with 3-pio he told him to leave.                     3-pio left with a broken heart and kept running to were he found a spot to stay there was a little boy named Luis, he told Luis that if he ever needed help that he come back. When Luis came to talk to 3-pio he was  gone he was so sad but, Luis understood that 3-pio was going back home with his family.                                  Soon later Adrian told his mom what he had said. She told him that he did very wrong and that now he was going to have to find him soon because it was going to rain. Adrian never found him until........ one day after it rained and found 3-pio on the ground dripping wet, he told his mother to fix him. She came out with him. Adrian told 3-pio he was sorry and that he would never let him leave again.                    But one day when 3-pio was walking around the neighborhood he saw a little boy that looked just like Luis. When he got closer the little boy ran to him and hugged him. Luis told him that his family had died and that he was looking for him. 3-pio told him that he could stay in his home with his family. When they got home the family welcomed Luis to the family. Luis told 3-pio that he had never felt this much love before. The entire family celebrated that  3-pio came home and the new family member Luis.                                            The End                                                                                                                                                                                     	DT NN IN CD DT NNP CD NN IN DT NN IN NN NN , NNP NNP VBD VBG IN WRB JJ PRP MD VB TO VB NN TO VB PRP$ TO NNP TO DT NNP NNP NNP NNP NN NNP CC NN NNP VBD IN PRP$ TO NNP NN CC VBD DT CD VBG RB DT VBN NNP NNP VBD JJ TO VB WP PRP VBD IN DT NN , CC WRB PRP VBD RBR PRP VBD PRP VBD DT VBN NN VBN CD NNP VBD PRP$ NN IN PRP MD VB PRP CC PRP VBD , NNP , PRP VBZ TO JJ CC NNP NNP WRB PRP VBD VBG , NNP NN DT NN IN PRP$ NNS NNP NNP PRP VBD NN PRP VBD DT NN IN PRP$ NN CC VBD VBG TO VB NNP NNP NN VBD PRP RB PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD DT NN MD VB NNP CC NNP VBD DT NN CC VBD PRP NNP NNP VBD JJ IN JJ IN NN DT NN NN , CC PRP VBD PRP IN PRP MD VB JJ NN IN PRP IN PRP MD RB VBN NNP NNP VBD RP DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN CC VBD IN DT NN WDT VBN DT NN NN JJ , DT NN VBD NNP WP VBD VBN PRP RB .

There are so many robots like the Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr.Gower, and Agribots.These robots can do so many things for people. They can also help nurses and scientists on the things they need to do. The Gemini-Scout is controlled to search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground.                    The Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job. It can climb into volcanoes and gather information for scientists. This helps scientists by being safe and not get hurt while gathering information on volcanoes. Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals. It helps doctors and nurses to bring the medicine to the patients. The Agribot is a robot that helps farmers pick fruit. It can pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples. The agribot can sense when the fruit is ripe.                There are some robots that play well with others. many playful robots are made to copy animals. Some robots can play with other animals. There are some robots that have fur and can be an animal so you can pet it. The other thing about robot animals is that you don't need to take them outside or feed them.            Other robots can play by themselves like hockey or shuffleboard.

Doctors can open the drawers when medicine is needed .It can go any where in the hospital .Hes is so strong that he can pull 500 pounds.He is ran batteries . Mr.Grower charges for 2 hours then he can deliver medicine for 12 hours nonstop .He also can talk wicth is pretty neat .It can say hundereds of phares ,like 'calling elevator ' or  'your delivery is here ' . Mr .Gower does work that people at the hospital . This allows the people to do more inprotant things around the hospital .                                                                       Dante 2       Another robot was the the Dante 2 . He climbs into volcanoes to gather information .He has 8 legs like, a spider .His legs help him climb the steep walls of the volcanoe .Its built to handle the height of the volcaneo . He looks for dents vents or holes .To find information .Scientists could not find out as much about volcaneos ,but not any more thanks to Dante 2 .They can study now really close when they still can stay in there labortaries .

The mistake was that he puts the red and the blue wire together. When he was suppose to put the blue and the green wire together. When that happens his robot comes to life. He is so astonished he faints. Before his robot can ask any questions about why he is alive. When Drew faints his robot catches him before he fall on the floor and puts him on his bed.          When Drew awakens he sees his robot looking at him and names his robot Starr. The next day Drew goes to school. While he is doing his work, he thinks that he should modify his robot. So that it can do his homework, so then he can have more time to himself. At lunch at school he starts making ideas so that he can modify the robot when he gets home. He starts thinking I should make two slits, so that one can be were you put two pieces of paper and one so that the finished work comes out.          When he gets home he starts modifying the robot. He puts two slits one that gets two pieces of paper. The other slit would be for the other work. He puts a computer chip. So then the work will be correct. Then he puts in a piece of paper for a handwriting sample.          The next day he gets homework, so he decides to see if Starr works. It works!!!!! When he gets to school he is so happy he blurts is out to his friend Jason. Jason believes it and wants Drew to prove it to him. Drew proves it to his friend by using his homework. Jason tells Leena, that doesn't like either one of them. To make them sad she tells the teacher and the teacher believes Leena. The teacher makes a house visit and questions Drew about the robot. Drew tells the truth about Starr, because he doesn't like to fib to people and Drew's mom tells him has to destroy, because he is cheating. So then Drew takes out the computer chip and destroys the robot with a sledge hammer.                                         THE END!!!!!

Robots can actually   do anything. Even helping the earth.           There was this odd thing on the road picking up trash. So, of course I would walk to it , slowly. I went behind a bush next to it. I couldnt believe my eyes. it was a machine like a robot cleaning the road. To me it looks like a metal trash can. Is it?       It saw me. It spoked. He said 'My name is Trashy , I clean up the earth , I got hit by a lightning bolt. Then all of sudden i was alive.' I thought i was dreaming but no I wasnt. 'Then how do u know how to speak,clean,and walk. I can see you have legs and arms and thats creepy but still how?' I asked. He sat next to me and explained 'I guess im this some type of robot now that knows to do everything, just how you learned to do things when you were a kid, I did also. I been like this for one year. I guess your new here because you never seen me before.' I was silent for a minute and I guess this isnt a dream, its real. I was in real life. Talking to a robot!       He told me about how he got legs and arms. Someone attached those to his body. After he told me facts about all the robots he knows. One robot he told me about was Mr.Gover. That robot helps the doctors and nurses in the hospital. It brings them medicine so they can do there more important jobs. Then theres Gemini-Scout, who works in mines under the ground. The robot is less then two feet and has wheels. Its strong though, if someone is hurt he can drag them to safety. Gemini also carries food,water, and other supplies. Dante 2 has a very risky job. That robot goes in volcanoes to get information. He has 8 legs to climb up the steep and rocky ground. Its also built to survive VERY hot heat!       Trashy wished he had a very important job. 'You do!' I said 'you have the most important job. If you never clean up our earth then animals die, it would stink, but it would mostly look like a Dump. You save lives, you save animals lives or babies too. They dont know what to eat and if they run from there parents and they dont know, the babies would eat it, and probally die. Your job is important and helpful.' Trashy never thought of it that way. He always wondered why did he get made it to this robot can afterall. was it a lesson? Though he wasnt a big help before. Even when he wasnt alive he only had trash put inside of him, he never did anything except keep the animals away. 'your right!' trashy yelled, 'I am helpful and if i never were alive this world would be actually a trashcan. Where people just throw stuff away and dont care!'. 'correct' i announced.       We learned about robots, helping the earth, and cheering up friends. Theres hundreds of robots people build today. They keep us company and help out. Robots are fascinating in every way. Today we invented many things, but not a lot of robtos. Dont you think we should?, I do! 	DT NN NNP .

He is tied on top of my car right now because it is to dangerous to put him in my car. Right now i am taking him to Dr. Richard Fleeman. He thinks he has the skills to figure what type of robot this is and what it can do.           Right the robot is with the doctor, and i will get back to you as soon as the appointment is over.................................................................2 hours later. OK Dr. Richard Fleeman has just figured out what this is. It is and RX_219, and it is a robot from Neptune.

The U.S. did not allow these robots to be sold in their country because they believed the robot had some bugs, it was true that it had bugs so scientists perfected it. It was then legal in every state in the U.S. after it was tested.         Mark, a boy who lives in California made his parents buy one, so they did. When Mark got the robot it was amazing! It did his homework, did his chores, and a small statue of him out of his mom's books. It was wonderful he had everything he wanted until one night. There was a boom and a crash. All the F-34 escaped their owners and was never found again. Because of this, the U.S. made the ownership of the F-34 illegal and sued the scientists who caused this incident.

Another man said,' Im not quite sure'. Then a brave police officer said,' Lets go check it out'. So him and some other people started aprroching the strange thing. All of a sudden the mysterious thing started to move. Every one jumped back and started running.       The creature sat up in confusion. Then the Brave policemen called for back up. He had told the policeman that a wierd and mysterious 'thing' had crashed into the ground on Maine Street. When the brave policemen saw the 'thing', he then realized it wasnt so much as a thing ,but a 'Robot' from Space!       When the other police man orrived they all surrouded the 'Robot'. They wern't what to do. The 'Robot' had arrived in a little tiny rocketship, that looked verry futurisct. While the policemen were talking on what to do they heard a strange noise.       They looked over and saw the robot standing up. Then the 'Robot' spoke 'Hello I come in piece'. I bring no harm  to your planet'. ' I come from the planet of  JitSu.   The police man stood there in shock. One police man responded,' What is your name 'Thing'. 'Just call me Ribit' said the 'Robot'. 'Sure thing' said the cop. 'I came here just to studies about your Planet Earth.       The cop said,' How about I make you a deal? 'What kind of deal? said Ribit.' We give you all the information about Earth that we have, if you give us all the information you have about your Planet JitSu'.'Deal', said Ribit. 'One day you can even come visit my planet if you would like to'. That would be a pleasure',  the cop responded. ' I most go now, my people need me' said Ribit. 'Good luck and goodbye.'       So from then on they kept trading information about their planets. This made them very intellegent on eachothers planet and universe.

Robots actually have many interesting jobs and some dangerous jobs. Their is some robots that can save lives like a superhero , robots used in mines for search-and-rescue or can be used to play video games in the mine, and their is even a self-driving car that lets you take a nap while the car is moving. With all of these all of these robots the everything would be so awesome.           One of my favorite robots is the Google car. It's a self-driving car that can even let you take naps, drive up to 700 miles per hour, it can talk to you, it also has a laser mounted on the roof, and the best part is that it can transform into a transformer! It is the best car their is. This car is possibbly the best car you can get mainly because it can turn into a transformer. Okay the transformer part might not be true but everything else is.           The next best robot is Mr. Gower. Its a robot that helps doctors everywhere save lives. In the hospital it helps doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower looks like a cabinet on wheels. It can ride in elevators, steer through hallways, and move things that are around 500 pounds! Mr. Gower might sound like a boring robot but outside the hospital he's a superhero. He doesn't just save lives in hospitals he also saves lives be defeating super villans, and stopping crime fighters.           Another robot that's pretty cool is the Gemini- Scout. While at work in the mines Gemini-Scout does search-and-rescue missions. This robot is about two hundred feet tall with wheels. When this robot rescues two miners these two miners can use the robots two-way radio to talk to a search and rescue team or just make prank calls. When the miners are on break they can play with the robots built in game system. This robot even has games that lets the miners jump into the game. Don't you think that's awesome because I do.            As you all know robots are pretty cool. You might of seen some pretty cool robots before but I assure you nothing can top these awsome robots. You got a car that can turn into a transformer, a robot that's can save lives working at a hospital or as a superhero, and a robot that works as a search-and-rescue robot in mines or used to play videogames at the end of the day. If I had one of these robots it would be so awesome but you know that's mot going to happen.

A vending machine is a type of robot and so is a mcrowave they all are th same thing but they are also different at the same time becaus they are both robots but they do diferent things.         In this selection we are going to talk about two different types of robots and what they to help pople and mabey you may see one some day. One type of robot is called the Gemini-Scout. the gemini scout is a remote controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under ground. the robot is less that than two feet tall and has wheels. it can go up and down stairs and make tight turns.         The Dante 2 is a robot with an intresting job. It climbs into valcanoes to gather info. for scientists. Like a spider, this robot has eight legs. this helps it climb the steep walls of the valcanoes. it is also built to survve very high heat. when a valcanoe is too dangerous for scientists to enter, Danate goes instead.          Those are some very important robots that we had alked about an now you may se them in real life.

Jake look all the ways but people were just walking, using their cell phones, sitting on the grass, etc. but none of theme seem to notice the box not even the people that pass next to Jake. Jake got the box that weight a lot.             When Jake was at his home's backyard he open the weird box and back off amazed of what he saw in the box. He got in he knees and got a 5ft gold cube with a blue circle in the top face of it. He click it and weird noises. Then a golden robot with blue eyes came out of cube that had diissapear.             The 7ft tall robot open his metallic mouth and said,'I am GCR-2025.' Jake run away in horror into his house. Jake watch GCR-2025 carefully and then the robot saw Jake and toward him ready to smash Jake then Jake the robots eyes weren't blue they were red.             Jakes 5 last seconds of life were weird. All heard was his mom telling him,'Jake,Jake' then Jake woke up and he was on bed. Then Jake remember he need to go to the park to visit his grandma. At park Jake was walking with his grandma joking but Jake stop he couldn't move he saw a big box some feet in front of him and said to himself,'not this time.' and continue walking with his grandma ignoring the box.

'thankyou uncle thankyou.' i said confusly. i was thinking and i maked up my mind and went to santa muerte with my horse the path was too long and awful it was scary and i was hungry until finnaly i saw the big poster saying santa muerte it was almost torn out. i was scared straight their i saw an antique store in it their was an old man i tryed to go in the store even thogh it sai closed i dident know waht to do as soon as the man came to me he screamed 'go away! go!' 'sorry but i came to have some information a man bought him a robot this week hes my uncle' i said 'what what what! that robot cant be in hands of a girl like you never!thats a special robot give it back give it back!' he said 'sorry mr but know its mine whats wrong with me having such a robot!'

It kept me from walking, and so, I set out on my journey.   My journey was to find a way to help me get around better, but I knew my time was running out. I had to act fast, or soon, my legs wouldn't support me, and I would have to be stuck in bed, or worst, be in the hostpital, having surgery on my legs, that would take them away from me forever.        The next day, I packed my bags, and set on my journey, alone. I was frightened, but I knew, if I was to make it threw this, I would have to keep going. My wheel chair was quite new, but it would not last me forever. I found myself in a world full of people, of what seemed to be, rumiging threw the most horrific smell I have ever smelled in my life. It seemed to be trash, or some type of old, and disgusting food, that had been left out for days at a time. But I remembered that I had packed my food, and so I wouldn't have to go begging at the doorsteps of the cruel neibors, that lived in the huge hotels of the city.         As for the poor, I felt more at home with them, they were conciderate, and understood my oppinions towards the 'High Rancked' people in the hotels. I was still on my journey, but I had to delay it, for I knew that I had to help the poor. So, I gave them the few dollars I had left over from  my pocket money. It wasn't much, but they were grateful.          When I got back on track with my journey, I now had to hurry, it was getting dark, and I was still looking for a place to take shelter. Thats when I met 'Gemini-Scout'. He was a robot that stood no more than two feet tall, and was as strong as 25 men commbined into one! He took me inside his home, which was not much, but I didn't care, all I wanted was to commplete my journey. He knew how desperrate I was, and he knew how much I really wanted to commplete my journey, so we made a compremize. He was to take care of me, while I was to take care of him. All he had ever really wanted, was to look after someone, but no matter where he looked, there would be no one to look after. And no mater where he went, he never really found what he was really looking for.          So, ever since that day, he has been living with me, in my own hotel, where we feed the poor everyday, and make sure we take care of one another. He is 'My Robot.                                                                                      -foreverways-                                                                                                                              BY: Amanda F.

It all started on the day of August, 19, 2033. A scientist named Frankendoodlestien made a robot named Mr. Gower who was made to help at hospitals so the doctors didnt have to do as much.           Mr. Frankendoodlestien was very proud of himself, but then the robot was goin out of controll! The scientist tried to stop him but the robot smacked him in the face and he went flying through a wall!           Then the robot noticed the hole in the wall and he headed straight for it. Soon he was in town smacking all of the people around being a bully untill his seond personalty came in. Then he became a person who does tax returns and gives them to people. He also donates alot of money to charity and helps people out.           He wanted to help all of the people he smacked and bring them to the hospital. When they arived at the hospital all of the sudden he turned into his last personality. A man who was a little bit mentaly challenged and did not like other people. So he ran into the hospitals' bathroom and locked himself in there. Then the nurse found out that was the robot Mr. gower they were suposed to get. So she unlocked the door and shut him down.           The nurse reprogramed him to be normal and then he worked at that hospital untill the end of his programming.                                           The End.

Some are helping to save lives,some are doing research for scientists,and some are even playing with children which could be very helpful.         First we have the Gemini-scout. This little fella is less than two feet tall an can save lives. He is a search and rescue robot that works in mines. He can carry water and food to the injured and he can drag the injured to safety this little robot is very strong.         Second is the robot Dante 2 who has a pretty cool job. He gets to go in volcanos and gathers information for scientists. He has eight legs like an arachnid to help him climb up the steep spewing mountains. Dante 2's body is specially created t withstand extreme heat so he wont melt. He looks for vents and hole in the volcano and studies the gases to help out. Humans wouldn't have as much information on volcanos.          Third is Mr. Gower this robot helps doctors and nurses by getting and carrying medication. This friendly robot is also very stong he can carry over 500 pounds and he runs on batteries which can be charged for two hours he can go twelve hours nonstop this robot can also talk and say things like 'your delivery is here.' and 'calling elavator?'         Agribots are next and these robots are little farmers that grow plants by themselves. If a plant is dry he'll water it. They alo know what colors fruits are to pick them if they are ripe. These could help on a farm.         Next the google car this robot is a car that drives itself. This car knows when ther are drivers coming into their lane and if some one is cutting them of. It knows when to stop at a red light and when go when it's green. This car has actually been tested on freeways and highways in California and Nevada.          Last but not least play robots that can actually play wth children. There is not a specific name for this robot because there are many. One of these robots HRP-4c can actually dance and sing, I bet that will keep your child busy.           Robots are being created and are helping and assisting every where soon these robots may be in your house. Some save lives, some play with children,and some do research these are amazing things that should be known and I hope they soon will be.

Nothing wrong ever happens there, everybody loves to be at that place because its just so peaceful and everyone is very respectful. But, there's one family in the neighborhood that stands out, there the unquie ones, everybody gets scared when they come by, everyone just stares as they walk,their mouths open so big that not even an ant can crawl under. But the reason why they are so afraid of them so much is because they aren't like the ones in the neighborhood, there not humans. Insted of having skin, heart, and blood running through your body there body is made out of metal. They don't have to breath or eat to survive. But yet they can still do the same things that humans can do and even more. They are robots the only family that there is on earth. There's a father, mother, a son, and a daughter. There all a lovley family but since there robots nobody wants to talk, or even be near them, so insted of having firends the only thing they have is each other so they have to always stay together. The daughter and the son are HRP-4c robots, they are the best dancers in the world. They can move there legs from side-to-side along with the rythom of the beat from the music that they have. They can do flips and never get tired of doing it, even somtimes they be having a little dance compition to see who dances the best but it always ends up in a tie because they both have the same talents. Also, the son and daughter can sing too. they can sing any type of music from opra to rap. But the sons favorite type of singing is rapping and since he likes to do it more than his sister he can rap better than her. Insted his sister likes to sing opra, her vocie is so wonderful that even some birds would respond to her singing and sing along with the melody of her vocie. And the father is a Gemini-Scout robot, which his talents is that he is very strong, and also is one of the most helpful robots that there is. He can save people from danger even if the weather is frigid or if the tempurture is so hot that is u walk your shoes would melt, but that doesn't matter for him and can still walk through the heatness or through the coldness. And the mother is a Agribot robot, she is the best planter to pick fruits, she is even better than what humans are able to do. That's why in her backyard of her house she has her own little space for her to plant fruits even though she doesn't  eat, so insted of eating the fruts that she plants she give it to the grocery store so that humans are able to eat because they are the ones that need it more than they do. So one day when the mom went to go give the fruits to the grocery store she went with her daugther so that she wouldn't feel lonley because neither her son or her husband wanted to go with her, but her daughter agreed to go with her just to drop the things off. So once they enter the store a girl was staring at the daughter, but not with fear, but with concern. She wanted to know what was different from both of them and wanted to get to know her. So then the girl went up to her and asked if she would want to come to the park with her to play. So then the daugther agreed and they talked, and the daughter told the girl what she was good at ang now the girl didn't think of her as a strange thing, now she actually like to hang out with her and the girl presented her to the family. And also the girl had a brother and then they got along with each other too so then everyone in the neighborhood got along with each other every with the robots. And it was all because that girl wanted to know her better and know the girl and the robot are the best firends in the world and they help each other out in anything that they need. And now the robot is teaching her best firend how to dance like her so that they can both be the best dancers in the world.

Robots used for rescue. The Gemini-Scout is a romote-controlled robot that rescues miners from underground mines if they are in trouble. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns. It can even roll through water!        Then robots are also used for research. The Dante 2 is a robot that goes into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. This robot has eight legs.

They saw these metal machines that seemed to be living there for a while. They brought one of these back for NASA. NASA told them that they could not tell anyone of their amazing discovery and the space program made the dicovery top secret and classified.       Ever since Apollo 11 landed on the moon, they sent more and more humans to the moon to get more machines. They decided to call these machines 'Robots'. They brought so many robots from the moon to earth, NASA and the US goverment decided to sell these robots into the US trade center. Sales were booming and everyone wanted a robot of their own. Everyone has a robot. The goverment trained the robots to do everyday things like sing, dance, play, and take care of kids while their parents are gone. The other countries all over the world envy the US and decide to go to the moon to get some of their own.       Some countries like Russia, Germany, and Japan have launched their own sapce programs to get robots for their own. The United States decided to race all these countires back the moon. The race started on May 15, 2972474. One man helped the US build their space sho called the SS Atlantis. This mans name is Danious Ceasrai. This man was a german man who moved to america in late 2972473. Danious made this ship so that it was fast as the speed of light times 99999999. His bosses names were Frenchious Fabulous, and Madious Masterious. They were robots and had expirience in space before.       They told Danious 'build a ship that will never be forgotten'. This inspired him to make the best ship the world has ever seen in the un iverse and go get some robots before the other nations of the Earth do. He would lead his crew to the moon and back on a mision to bring bak the most robots. Fortunatly for him, he got there a year before everyone. While he was there, he trained some of the robots to be soldiers and fight off the Russians and Germans and Japanese.   He trained these robots very well and they were loyal to him. When the germans came, the germans were not prepared for war and rushed back to earth. The japanese came also unprepared and rushed back. Last but not least the Russsians came with guns and laser cannons to fight off the robots and win the victory aaginst the Americans.       It was a long and cold galactic war over control of the moon. The russians fought hard but the robots fought harder and beat the russians. the russian general Jonious Beadious accepted his loss and retured home to russia. Danious became a hero and became the leader of the moon army. No one ever judged his power and no one ever fought him again,.

Last Tuesday I was minding my own  business playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 quickscoping people like a boss, and being the complete MLG PRO I am I decided to quickscope using a Diamond Thermal Scope DSR-50 with Fast Mag. Then, weird stuff happened. Everyone else in the game lagged out, and me being the host I had no idea why the game did not switch hosts (or why they would) or restart the game. I was forever alone, quickscoping walls on the map Turbine, when my controller started rumbling like crazy. It felt like my controller was having a seizure, so I thought I would take it to the hospital (Gamestop) and then my Xbox turned off. My brain derped and I was totally confused. Then, I saw my Xbox grow legs and arms from my four controllers and some extra wires. Then, he started talking.       My Xbox called himself 'Serial#XXTHISISNOTREALXXSKNCVM1235433' I was really confused with his name and therefore there would be no way my awesome and all-mighty brain would remember it, so I just named him 'Nug.' From the start, I knew Nug and I would be best buddies. Me and Nug went everywhere together, I took him to go get candy (he couldn't eat it because Xboxes can't eat candy so I basically got twice the sugary and teeth rotting delights). I took him to get ice cream. And I took him to school the next day. People tried to steal him but he went beast mode and protected himself. From that point on, I knew he learned a lot from my awesome skills on video games. I sat down at my table with my homies Justin, Ryan, Lucian, and Jake (pronounced haw-kay), and they were confused. Justin asked 'Mishan what are you doing with your Xbox? How obsessed have you gotten?!' I said 'My Xbox came alive and we are best bros.' Ryan said 'You really had to take it to school?' I came back with 'My Xbox was a him, and yes I had to. My grandma hates technology.' Jake said 'Good idea, but won't your grandma be bored all alone?' I said 'Well, she's like that everyday. Also Xbox (who I named Nug) really loves me. We're as good friends as you and I are.' Then, after a long day of school I went to my after-school place Learning Edge. The Asians (the place is probably 90% Asian) there have probably not seen an Xbox before, nor have they met one like Nug. It was a silent day, but a fun one. Nug helped me with my homework because he had the internet on his side! Then I walked home, and something went weird.       Nug told me that he loved me. I said that I loved him too (not in any homosexual manner, but more of a friend way). He started getting a bit too close to me, but I was fine with it. It was probably the first time he had ever crossed streets. Cars scared Nug and he always seemed to bark at them. I don't know why he did that, but he is himself, and with his &frac34; full memory unit, he was getting a little crazy. I was fine with that though. I told Nug my deepest secrets on the way home, and he promised not to tell anybody. When I told him that I liked a girl though, something went wrong.       Nug started to short circuit, and the turn-on button turned red. I asked him if he got the 'Red Ring of Death' and he said 'NO.' I have to admit, someone as manly and good looking as me got a little bit freaked out, but of course I always know when something is wrong. He grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and of course, even bigger, untill he was officially considered to me as 'Bigger than my ego.' And that is really big. Nug started smashing stuff and exclaiming 'NUG ANGER!!!' Nug was really pissed, I could tell. Usually when people get mad, they get mad. This, was bigger than mad. All this destruction of the town of South Pasadena, just because I told him I liked a girl. This looked like a job for, Hobonugget! Defender of all and the ultimate winner of everything. Who was this majestic Hobonugget? Me. I ripped off my shirt and started flying into the air. I gave Nug a huge slap that sounded like 'Smackle' and a giant punch that sounded like 'Fap!' Then, Nug fell to his knees (or extention cords), and died. We all knew, I was way too good for him.       I fixed the city. I bought a new Xbox. I got more girls loving me (they were all rejected by me nicely, but still I have them in my mind just in case they are ever 'needed.' Lastly, I replayed all of my video games and learned to not be as much of a good quickscoper. I was talking to my friend Desmond about this, and he believed me and responded to what happend in two words. Screw logic. We all had a good laugh, and had a good time, but there was one thing that didn't end well. Nug died. At least there were no casualties and there was nothing destroyed but El Pollo Loco. With Nug's enlarged parts, they were able to sell the parts of Nug to Microsoft and made millions of dollars. This is also the story of how El Pollo Loco became a huge resteraunt chain. They expanded with the money they made from Nug. And for Hobonugget, he will save the day again, not today, tommorrow, but some other day.

I was training him to help people and do what I tell him to do such as get me a drink or get me a snack. So one day I asked him to get me a drink so he went down to the kitchen to get me a drink.But he never came back.  He has been down there for 5 minutes already. So I decided to holler to him,so I yelled Robby where are you. There was no response, so I hollered again. Then I heard glasses and cups breaking and being thrown. Then I decided to go down there. When I got down there Robby was freaking out there was glass everywhere. So I  said whats wrong. He didn't answer. So I decided to take his battery's out. When I did that he stopped freaking out. So I started to think why he was doing that. So I looked it up on the internet and it said to replace his battery's when he does that.So I scattered the house for battery there was none, so I got in my car and ran to Target really fast.When I got there I went to the battery section and got 10 triple battery's. When I got home I put the battery's in Robby. When I did that he came back to normal.

Robots make are jobs easier. Today there are robots that help in hospitals,volcanoes,mars and in feilds. Robots are gadgets that help when its6 need. Examples of robots are dante 2, mr.grower, agrilbots and, movie makers.           Mr.gower is a helping robot in our hospitals. These robots help doctors and nurses bring medicne to patients.Mr gower is like a small cabinet on weels. Mr.gower carees medicine around. Doctors can take madicine out of mr.gower when its needed. Mr.gower can ride elevators move threw hallways. This robot is so strong it can pull 500 pounds around.           Dante 2 is an intresting robot. It has 8 legs like a spider and climes volcanes. This robot helps scientists study volcanes. Its 8 legs helps it by climbing valcones walls. These robots are build to survive high heat. When volcanoes get to hot for scientists they send dante instead.                Agribots is a robot that helps by picking fruits. This robot is programed to pick fruits like berries, oranges, grapes, and apples. Farmers use this robot to help around the farm. In japan there is a simaler one  that picks straw berries. Some of these even have sensorse to tell witch one is riped fully.

They also have many different jobs. Like this robot called Gemini-Scout. He can go inside mines and find traped miners and he can also checks for gases in the air and then tells miners when its safe. Gemini-Scout is  at least less than two feet tall and he can even roll in water.There is evn robots that help doctors,nurses, and pharacists. So robots can even pick fruit .Take Agribots for example  he is a fruit picking robot. He can pick berries, oranges, grapes, and even apples. Agribots can help many farmers who needs help picking fruit. You can find robots every wear doing different types of jobs.some work as baby sitters. robots love to make new friends that is why there good baby sitters. Robots are allways looking for a adventure. Isaac Asimov wrote a story about a robot that is friends with a child.Robots are sagnifigant machines. Some people think that robots are going to be built in the future. But there wrong they haev already invented them. Robots are built to every thing a human can and can't do like. Some Robots can pull up to 600lbs-1Ton. Humans can only pull 100lbs-250lbs. Some robots are built to compy animals. At the Massachusettes  Institute of Technology sienctists are working on a cherry tomatoe growing robot without humans help at all. They have also created a green house full of plants that are cared by a agribots. Agribots are like robot farmers. Some robots are built to stand high tempatures. Take Dante 2 for example. He has to go inside of valcanos for the days when scienctistest can go near. Dante 2  has eight legs like a spider. This helps  it climb up steep walls that are in the valcano. Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. Then the robots collects gases that are in the vents. So now you know that rbots are just as important as us humans. This was my story of the future.

There was a huge machine I found on the ground. It was a robot made in Japan. I took it home to clean it and fix it. I felt really curious about what type of robot it was and what kind of job or thing it does. There were a lot of butterflies in my stomach just to show this to my mom. And I know that she will be really surprised when she sees this really creative and smart robot.       I dragged the robot home to clean it and to fix it. All of a sudden, my mom came and her mouth was wide open. She froze for a minute. I knewsomething great and surprising was going to happen. All of a sudden like a thunderbolt, my mom said, 'What is that?! Is that a not useful robot or what?!' I didn't want this to happen to my mom, I wanted her to be very proud of me and be very excited. This is important because she was asking what type of robot it was. Then she said, 'Dint' I tell you to bring house matericals?' This is important because this means that I forgot about the house materials. Careless.       After that happened, I started examinating the robot. All of a sudden, it rapidly woke up and started to go outside to pick apples out of my tree. I said, ' This robot is an agribot! It's a robot that picks fruit.' This is important because agribots can help us pick fruits so that we don't have to pick them. To be honest, we were actually lazy so we were commanding the robot to do our job instead of us, just like a slave. My mom said , 'Oh my goodness! Wow, this robot is really useful!' This is important because this made her happy and froget about the house materials.       Now, since we have the agribot, we didn't have to buy expensive food anymore! Now we can just use the agirbot for searching for fruits and picking them! My mom said, 'This is a very smart robot! I think we should stay home everyday!' I knew she would be really happy and I actually wanted this to happen. This means that she is really happy and she would use the robot everyday. I said, 'This is the happiest day of my life!' No words can explain how happy and excited I was. This means that I was very lucky and I was very happy to have this robot.       This agribot was very useful for me and my family. If my mom haven't told me to go search for house materials in the darkness, I wouldn't have gotten this happy. I was very lucky to bring that robot home.

I finally gathered up enough of courage to walk and when I did I found what looked to be a hole on the floor,but when I got closer I  realized it was connected to something it was a ladder.I saw a speck of light so,I decided to pull down the ladder and climb down it.When I did I found a room totally diffrent from the room I had just been in.This room was more brighter,more welcoming and for some strange reason I felt at ease.Then I heared someone coming,and I hid behind this bookshelf type thing.When I peeked out theyre was a human staring right at me!I was so scared I had no idea whet to do.                            The human must have been as scared as I was beacause thing i know shes trying to run away from me.If I had enough skill at this whole talking thing I would have tould her I was harmless and just trying to fingd my way home.Actually I dont have a home, or I just dont remember where it is.The human finally got enough courage to come back to where I was and then the strangest thing happened she picked me up,actually held me like I wasnt some kind of monster.It had been three good long weeks since I met this human and she has took me in taught me things I would have never known.She taught me how to talk,read,play and eat.It has been a pretty amazing time with the human I hope I never leave.She is like my family since I never had one.                          I would like to think her for taking me in like a son.I know its not easy having a thing like me living wiht you but she treats me like im normal not a monster.I hope she keeps me for the rest of my life.

The gemi-scout is a robot that helpes people trapped in mines. It locates heat signitures to locate people.             There are also robots that help gather information like Dante 2. Dante 2 goes in volcanoes to dangerous for scientist to go into. Dante 2 is built to withstand very hot tepetures. It looks for lava vents in volcanoes to gather iformation. Dante 2 is built to climb steep volcanoes.             Robots can also be asistants at a hospital. Mr. Gower is a robot asistant at a hospital, he does little stuff like getting medicine for the doctor. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet with wheels. Mr. Rover is able to get anywhere in the hospital. Mr. Gower is programed to talk, it can say about a hundred phraises.            Robots can also help farmers like Agribots. Agribots can help farmers by picking the vegtables,they know when the fruit is ripe.   Robots can also grow Fruits by themselfs.           So what if these robots came alive, they probably wouldnt want to risk there lives for us. They would probably build a robot army take over the world. They would probably try to attack us and start a war.

He was huge and he looked like he was going to stomp on me but he didn't. He just said 'Hello Master, what should I do first.' I was speachless what was I going to say? I tried to open my mouth all that came out was....NOTHING!!       I realized he was going to be some trouble around here so I had to get rid of him. I tried to cover it up but it was to obvious. What was I to do? So I decided to make the robot leave, but how was I suppose to do that? I remebered in the story I wrote I would be the robot's master so I went over to my story and I change it to 'the robot just looked away and walked far far away and never came back becuase well I was the master!

I had gotten lots of things but one stood out it was a remote controlled convertable. My friends and i were mesing around with it, and we accidently rolled it into a radioactive puddle coming out of the nuclear power plant. We triend to controll it but it wouldn't move. Then all of a sudden it jerked and squigled around and it moved all on its own i dropped the controller in fright and the car turned around and came hurdling towards me. My friends and i got scared and ran away but the car picked up the controller and drove over to us. Then Sydney picked up the controller and threw it and the car drove over and grabbed it and came back. It was as if a dog took over it's body. We raced home to tell everyone the news. We had played with it for hours even my dog Lucy thought of it as a friend. Then it was time to go to sleep but the car had little headlights on the front that worked like eyes and it drove into evey room and it would wake up everybody so my dad put it outside and then it started to bark at the birds. Then I guess one of the birds got agrivated and picked it up and flew away. And i never saw it again.

Except there was one small problem.Fred was a toy robot.Bob imagined that one day he would hear Fred talk to him. At school Bob had no friends. Even at home he felt lonely and wanted some real friends. One day Bob wished for Fred to be able to talk,walk,and play with him. He went to sleep with his hopes high.            In the morning, Fred heard something moving. Fred was scared and thought that there was a bunch of robbers in the house. It turned out to be Fred, Bob with a tear in his eye could not believe that his wish had come true. He then said 'i'm so happy that my wish came true.' From then on him and Fred were best of friends for the rest of their lives.

'Why won't we make a robot that starts as a space ship, kind of like personal space jet with cockpits and all but in groups and transforms into all-terrain vehicles for exploring planets'Suggested one scientist.   The scientists agreed.                           '' 10...,9....,8....,7...,6....,5...,4..,3..,2.,1, Blast off!''   The rocket containing the black robots were sent off to space. Then from the Scientist's laboratory, the scientist control the robots for the deep space exploration.                  The scientists were navigating their robots in a meteor band when they started to lose control. ''Where are we?'' said C4-238 the robot. 'I don't know' said A6-786 'This is cool! said B5-761. 'Hey look at that planet! Lets go there!'cheerfully said B5-761.   The robots went down to the planet. 'Ooh what is this?'asked B5-761'I'm going to find out' 'Cool! I'm a vehicle' 'I'm a vehicle too!' The robots start venturing the planets. 'Look at these minerals, they look strong and cool. I'm going to keep it in my compartment' said A6-786.     The next day. The robots climbed a mountain and was surprised to see civilization. Flash! A4-786 took a picture of the vast city.They climbed down the mountain and into the city.They were greeted with kind inhabitants. The translator enabled them to find out what the inhabitants were saying. They were asking them to travel deep space to get the information from the planet called Earth. The robots were happy to help.           After a long time they got to the planet earth and landed near the city. There the scientist found the robots and was very happy to see them.

I say 'Erik you got to help me that robot may seam nice but in my dream it turned evil!'                So at that moment We looked at the closet to the right.In that closet we had bats,fireworks,spy cameras,and two sun glasses.The sun glasses were high tech.With it we can see behind us and the re is a computer screen on the lens.It was time to make the Turbo Turain into a bucket of bolts!But when we terned around Turbo was there and listen to us the whole time.Remeber when I said it can do anything Erik'yea' Well... That was not a joke.then Erak said 'RUN'!So...we jumped out the window.Now we have to attack but when we went back in the house was empty.I can't beleve we let a evil robot that can do anything into the world!                Then all of a suden we see a robot but it can't be Turbo it's difrent 'that's because it is are battle robot' I said.Then we see Turbo.Then we have a battle we shoot some miseles at it but nothing.Then comes the lasors.one hundred lasors to the face stile nothing.So I jumped out and went into Turbo.In him were a lot of strange tools.Then I get to the power soure.There is a red,green,and a blue wire.There is a sign that says'one wire kills you one wire shuts down and another wire desroys the world.I said 'a am so dead'!So I picked blue (blue is my favorate coler) and cut it and gus what it was the power wire.Turbo Turain falls down with me in it.                I came out of the smoke and didn't get hurt at all.That was the last sean of Turbo Turain.So after we were the greatest peaple in history. today peaple know us as Erik and Matthew the great!

'Come on class it's time to get on the bus,' exclaimed my teacher, Mrs. Dell, as 32 kids piled in to the big yellow school bus. Moments later we arrived at the coolest place ever, the Science Center!     'Welcome to the Science Center,' said a cheerful voice. 'Are you guys ready to see our newest robot,' the class tour guide asked. Screams of joy and excitement burst into the air, we were going to see the very first robot that can be programed to do anything you want. 'Then lets go!,' she said, leading us into a dark room.      'Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, prepare to see the one and only...T-BOT 5000!,' announced a man with a microphone behind the curtains. Then, the navy blue curtains opened and right there was a five foot tall, black robot with brand new rubber wheels, metal arms and a futuristic face. The class stared for a moment then stood up and started cheering and clapping for this amazing new creation.      'Thank you, Thank you,' said a man walking up onto the stage. 'As you all know, the T-BOT 5000 can do anything you tell it to, watch,' he said, pulling out a remote that looked a bit like an X-box controller, but with letters and many other buttons. 'I am now telling it to go to the cupboard and bring me a water bottle,' he said nervously looking down at the remote. Seconds later, the robot exited the room. We sat on the edge of our seats, egarly waiting for the robots return when suddenly, in came the robot with a water bottle filled with ice cold water. Once again, the class clapped and cheered for the amazing invention. A few tests later, Mrs. Dell told the class we had to go. On the way out, we were given a small key chain that looked just like the robot to remember the awesomestuff we did today.      That night, when I got home, I sat upstairs in my room thinking how amazing it was to see the robot.  'I wish I had my own T-BOT 5000,' I said, looking down at the key chain and suddenly my tiny key chain turned into a real robot! I stepped back and found the remote sitting on my bed, so I picked it up and pressed the letters spelling out 'MAKE MY BED' thinking I had nothing to lose. The robot got to work immediately fluffing my pillows and pulling back my purple covers. 'SO COOL!' I thought ti myself.       The next day when i got home from school I walked in and found T-BOT vacumming! 'Hi honey,' my mom exclaimed, 'I found this in your room making your bed for you I looked around and found the remote and thought I'd try it out!,'      'Ok,' I said laughing, then skipped up the stairs to my room. It was pretty cool having a robot to do anything you want.      Later that day, I went outside to shoot hoops and T-BOT came too. Turns out, he's a pretty good basketball player!

They are designed to save a lot of lives in case some people get hurt and some other stuff.Grower's main job can save a lot of people,because it is robots he's making robots and stuff so he can do stuff and help out people who really need it like if they're legs are paralyzed robots will do they're thing.In the present which is today robots are only designed by cops and scientist who have permits to make one.Here are some reason why we need robots now.   We need them for people who need them. They would help themselves and the human a lot.   They would Treat us in respect and help out the cops in case a bank thief leaves a note in front of the bank.         OK they don't have so many bad thing to do.but as long as they don't turn on us and we have to go through world war again.         Agribots an agribot can pick up fruits it picks berries,oranges,apples,and grapes.Agribots can impress farmers because what they do and farmers say picking strawberries in different than picking up apples.They will sense when a tomato is ripe    it will bring out its mechanical arm and grab it.         There are different robots to there is one called the Robbie the Robbie is a robot who plays with the kids when their parents don't have time to play Robbie will keep them company until they die, But the robot will do fun stuff like it will sing,dance,party,throw candy and make cupcakes for the kids and stuff.and its cool to have one Robbie!      Gemini-scout is a 2 ft tall and is controlled by a remote control so its easy if u know how to play video games then it will be easy to control it.The robot carries medicine,food,water,and it can drag hurt people to safety it will climb into VOLCANOES for research for the scientist.When the robots find miners the minor can use the 2-radio to contact the rescue team for help.It can roll in water in case it need's to for the safety of us.         The Dante 2 is another robot that is helpful,because its climbs in volcanoes and gathers information for scientist.It is like a spider with 8-legs and that s pretty cool.Dante 2 looks for holes,craters,vents for stuff and research.The Dante 2 is awesome.

I hid behind a tree and watched it crawl around for awhile. Then I stepped out from behind the tree and said 'Hello? ... can you talk?' It turned around 'Beep? Beep! Beep!'         'Uh...Hello' Then I saw on the side of his body The words Dante 2.'Is your name Dante 2?' 'Beep.' I look around trying to see where it had come from. I didn't see anything at first but then I noticed a semi truck parked on the side of the road. I took the robot over to it and locked it inside. Then I turned around and ran all the way home.

Jake was an evil scientist, and he's been trying to over rule all of man kind but it won't work because his robots wont come alive.So he trough his robot out the window into a dump. And went to the mall.         BUT little did he know that in that dump was  a witch who also wanted to rule all of man kind. when she saw the robot she was really happy. She started looking for her spell.          It took her a long time to find her spell book becuase she trough it in the dump to that same day.When she found it she'd put the spell book in her hands and tryed to find the spell to make it come alive. When she the spell she said h'm now you may talk and walk''.         After that the robot thanked the witch and went off trying to Jake his master. The witch was really mad and wanted to get rid of Jake so she fowled the robot.            once the robot spotted Jake he went running over to it. the robot caught up with Jake and gave him a big hug. Jake was really scared but then he got over that.            The witch came to cast a spell on him. but then she saw that they can work together to over rule man kind. And they went in a coffee shop and discussed on what they can do together and the robot was the by Jake every minute of his life.

This robot could do so many things. It could play with pets, clean up after you, or simply be your best friend. But there was something really strange about this robot.       My robot and I were playing in the backyard and something really strange happened I went inside to get a glass of water and i came back out and my robot was gone. Without thinking I started to panic.  I ran inside and screamed 'DAD! DAD! THE ROBOTS MISSING!'   We looked for hours but we still couldnt find him. The next day came and we still couldnt find the robot. Another day went by. Than another.       Before I knew it a week flew by and we still couldnt find him. One afternoon I was outside walking my dog and I heard someone in the bush. I thought it was just a bird so I just put my headphones back in and continued walking my dog. The next day came and I was outside was my dog again and i heard the same noise from the same bush so I started to walk faster. I heard it again and I ran all the way home. I didn't think much of it because i thought it was an animal or something, so I didn't tell anyone. But, boy was I wrong.         The next day came and i still heard the same noise from the same bush. I just continued walking. The next day came by and i still kept hearing that noise from that same bush. Then another came by and I still kept hearing and ingoring it. Two weeks flew by and i still heard it.          One Afternoon, I was out just walking around, I passed by that bush and i heard a the noise so without thinking, I looked over at that bush and I found a... a... A ROBOT! Not just any robot, OUR robot! I was so happy. I picked him up, but i don't think this was our robot. It was a little smaller, it looked like a human five-year-old. Than someone tapped me on the shoulder. I couldn't beleive it. IT WAS OUR ROBOT FOR SURE!             We all went home. Then something really strange happened. Our robor, our robot kid ( I quess), and I were all sitting out in the living room when all the sudden, our robot turned into a human. The little kid turned into a ROBOT! WHAT?! Without really thinking I jumped and hug him. I don't know why I did what I did. But, then they said that he and the little kid had to go and thats the last time I saw our robot or the little kid.

He is making a robot, he never thought the robot was going to work.  One day when he was having his regular school day something happened, A METEOR STRUCK EARTH!!!!!!  The meteor was so powerful that i triggered something in the robots' electronics' system.                Then when Phil-Up got home the robot was gone.  He was searching all over for his robot.  Then finally he found him, the robot was by the Meteor. Then the robot heard Phil-Up walking through the leaves, so the robot tries to attack him, but then Phil-Up said, 'No!, IM your master.'          After that they lived Happily ever after at his moms house, until one day.

In a rainy day the car began to move and then it turned into a nine foot tall robot. Officer James was getting a coffee from Starbucks.When he came out he could not believe his eyes.His police car was a robot.From his ten years as a cop he has never seen this.        Suddenly they herd shooting Robo turned back to a car. Right away James got in the car. Moments later they arrived at the scene.James got out he had his gun pointing at them.Robo turned back into a robot instead of shooting James they where shooting at Robo.But he did not get hurt for him it felt like little pebbles.Robo garbed them and officer James did the rest.       For one year they were the ultmint duo.They put every criminal in jail.they even got the key to the city and a bage for there brave and strong work they do.                  One day it was peaceful until they called for help.The mayor was hold hostege they rushed to the scene.The swat team was there Robo and James rushed inside.

We were getting closer and closer we saw something in the shadow it  was small we thought it was a dog but it wasn't it looked mechanical we think it's a robot it was a robot .Is it dead or alive we wondered.It had many different buttons.We pressed one and it turned on.We were asking it if he could talk but he didn't say a word.                                                                                                                                                Later that day we took it to a room were anyone could see him.Then something happened it was starting to talk.We it were he came from but he didn't know we told it that what was his name.There were many tool's and wood he started building something.It was a building maybe that's were he came from we were looking in the computer if their was the same building he was making.We told our parents that we have a robot in the house.They told us were did we got it from we told them that we found it in the backyard we didn't know when it got here.We told our parents if they could help us take it back were it came from they did help us we put posters up and passed paper to call us.That says found robot call us to the number that comes in the bottom of the paper.Finally someone found the lost robot.

It has wheels, it is less than 2 feet and it also can go up stairs but it has wheels. The robot is small but it is very strong and if people are hurt the Gemini-Scout could drag them to safety. It collects information , this robot was built to be easy to use and the controll is like a video game one.              Then we are going to talk about the Dante 2. The Dante 2 climbs volcanoes to get information for scientists and it has 8 legs. The robot goes instead of the scientists because it is dangerous for the scentists to go. The Dante 2 came now the scientists can study safe in their lab and the scientists could learn as much mor facts but when the Dante 2 was not here they couldn't get as much facts as they get right now.               Next we are going to talk about Mr.Gower. He workes in the hospital helping them bring the medicines for the patients. He looks like a small capinet on wheels. He could move stuff that get in his way and he could also go anywhere in the hospital. Mr.Gower can carry five hundred pounds and he could also deliver madicines in two hours with out stopping.He can talk and it could say 100 phrases.                Now we are going to talk about the Agribots.He can pick up fruit and  picks up berries,oranges,grapes or apples. They come in any shape and size. Some move around  by themselves and other don't.In Japan there is strawberries picking robots that sensec the color.                 Finally there are storries of person that are about how robots play well with others. If there parents are not there they could play with them and go to  adventures with them. When the car is a driver is another story also they can't go anywhere else were they are at. This robot car has a $80,000 cone shaped laser on the roof. THis is what this passage was about.

I score two goals and then we went to go eat pizza with my dad. My dad and I got back to my house and I went to my room to use my amazing robot that I made.I couldn't find it so I check under my bed, toys, couch, and cabins. Then I call my friend Freddy.       Suddenly, Freddy said why is your robot outside my yard. Then I went to get the robot at Freddy house.I said thanks Freddy for telling me that my robot was outside your back yard.Then I got back to my house again, then I called my friend Gary to come over to my house to go  play video games and then watch a movie.Then he brought his fighting games and dancing games. Gary and I went to play outside baseball suddenly I saw my robot walking outside.          After that, I told Gary to look back and see the my robot. Gary saw the robot and he was surprise and I ran to grabbed it and took it to my dad Peter, and told him that it walks! Then me and Gary were playing baseball with the robot. Gary, my dad, and I went to the store to buy wood and nails to make the house for the robot to sleep or have his own room.Gary and me put a picture of us with the robot.                                                                Finally, we went to the mall to walk and eat at Chinese food at the second floor and use chop sticks. Then Gary and I went to get shirts the same and toys. My dad and the robot went to get some tools for his work. We got back to my house and keep fixing the robot more.That is my robot that I have.

But we're going to talk about a robot that could be a babysitter.For kids,and animals.It could even talk act like an animal take care an animal.For twelve fool hours with out resting any time.And could even take your kids to walk even your animals.       There is this scientist that had a laboratories but he didn't now what to do so he got a bunch of metal and had created a car but wasn't any car it was a robot car that was made into taxi.It could take you any were.it wouldn't run out of gas or battery's.so it lasted long.Took orders it self by hearing the people's voices.And it could transform into a normal robot.That was at least twelve feet tall with wheels.

Suddenly my robot turned into a motorcycle. So we got so early to my house. Suddenly my parent parking in the drive way so my robot turned into a remote control helicopter in went up stairs when my parents open the door. They were so hungry that they to go eat something so I called my robot to come down stairs so he did come down stairs.My parents came back from eating so I had to tell the true to my parents.                                       Then we went with a scientist about robots because the robot turned disrespectful to my family especially my mom and dad . So instead the scientist said maybe lets just squish the robot Then burn down the robot then put cold water so it can be like a pure solid rock.Then we can youths break it into little peaces.

But one day I was just doing my homework and he started talking! He says his kind will soon take over the world. Robots? Really? I mean, humans are the ones who make robots.Plus, They're only like two feet tall! How could they defeat humans. So I just threw him away. Oh was that a bad mistake. The next day all these robots were attacking their owners! Meteoroid even came after me! We had to stop them! All of the kids went out on the street with bats and sticks. Then we started to attack! It was awesome! We beat the robots by a long shot. In the middle of the battle our parents came out and attacked them to. It was cool seeing everybody attack their own robots. The only robot left standing was mine. He just wouldn't die! I beat him with all my might and so did the others but he still wouldn't break! So what we did was bring him to the dump since they crush cars with that big machine. But he actually broke the machine. I was so tired of this I just bring him home. Then I had a great idea. I put the oven on and put  him in it. He melted! I was so happy! Even though I was grounded for a year because I broke the oven. Well at least now I know not to put metal in the oven! From that day forward we never saw a robot again.

By: Alexandra Szurna            Once again I had the WORST day at my new school in Detroit, MI i moved here from Ludington, MI on Saturday. I started going to school here on Monday of this week and its only Thursday. I have made one friend since I've been here. It's not been easy I can tell you that right now! So I'm walking home alone and I see a house, the house everybody only talks about. Supposedly he is a crazy inventor that lives by himself and everybody says that he killed his wife. But I don't believe any of it! So like I said i was walking his and I saw a little blue head sticking out of a trash can. Now it wasn't a human head it was a robot head? I took it out, there was a note on it. I read it aloud, 'YOU MAY FIND BUT DO NOT SEEK, YOU MAY GO BLIND YOU WILL BE WEAK!' I took the robot guy home, letting the note fall to the ground. What I didn't notice was the old man watching me through his window.        I call Stacy-my new friend-over to look at this.        'I bet I could get 10 bucks out of the guys at our school for this,' I told Stacy.        'Where did you get that?!?' Stacy yelled. I was more alarmed than anything else.        'Um that old guys house,'        'AAAAGGGGHHHH! You can't steal from him! He'll kill you and eat you up like he did to his wife!'        'It was in his trash can with a little note attached to it,'        'What did the little note say?!?'        'It said you may find but so not seek, you may go blind you will be weak,'        'It was a WARNING!'        'I don't care, you're no fun,' I said pushing her out the door.        'Hey! I'm not supposed to be home until dinner at 6!'        'Whatever,' I said slamming the door in her face.        I walked up into my room to get the robot. But when I went up there the robot was walking around the room. He was shooting lasers; the rhyme was making sense, you may find, but do not take! You may go blind from the lasers. But why would you go weak?        The next morning I found out the meaning of you may go weak. I, tired as could be, walked down the stairs yawning every other minute. When I got to school I had drank enough coffee to barely keep me awake. I had also realized I had forgotten the robot at home. Great I forgot the robot and the boys are actually looking at me; wait a minute the boys are looking at me?        'Stacy!!! Where are you?!? STACY!?!'        'I don't want to talk to you!' Said Stacy at her locker.        'What? Why? What did I ever do to you?!?'        'Um, I don't know? Does last night ring a bell?'        'Oh yeah sorry about that. Um you're probably never gonna forgive me are you?'        'You know I shouldn't forgive you but I told you at the beginning of this week that I would give you 3 strikes. You now have 2 okay?'        'Yes, I know, I promise I will be a better friend!'        'Strike 2,'        'What why?!?' I asked        'Just kidding. Don't be so hard on yourself okay?'        'Um, right, hehe. Let's go to class, we're gonna be late,'        'Okay, come on!' I started running after her.        At 3:40 I was on my way home from school. When I got home, and I walked in, something about my house was different. What is so different about my house? I asked myself. Then it hit me. My house was CLEAN! Did I ever mention that I have 4 little siblings? 2 twin little brothers and 2 twin little sisters. Well with 4 three-year-old's running around your house, it's NEVER and I mean NEVER going to be clean. My siblings must still be at day camp-a camp and daycare for 2-5 year-old's. And my mom must have taken the day off to clean.        'MOM!' I yelled 'MOM!' I yelled again 'MOM! I'M HOME!' I yelled for the last time.        'SORRY HUN, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU!' She walked downstairs holding Fifi my mom's beloved miniature poodle that hates my ever since I tried to drown her after she ate my favorite barbie dress-what I didn't know is that dogs-poodles-could swim. She growled at me.        'Oh shut-' I started        'Megan-' my mom started        'Okay, okay. You know that when the twins get here their just gonna wreck the house right?'        'Wait you didn't clean the house Megan?'        'No, why? You didn't?' I gulped        'No? But I do know who did clean the house,'        'Who?' Before she could answer I sprinted up the stairs to find the robot playing with the twins.        'This-is-great-fun,' the robot said        'Who are you?' I asked the robot.        'I-am-Robbie-the-babysitting-and-cleaning-robot-I-have-come-to-help.'         'Cool,' I said, 'Now I don't have to babysit them!!!' I walked into my room with the biggest smile EVER on my face, humming a song the twins also sing.        That was my story on 'OMG MY ROBOTS ALIVE!' I hoped you liked it!

Robots can do alot of great things like help people, carry things, store food, ride under water, and speak. Alot of people  build robots to tell them what to do but, if i had a robot i would name it the Iron giant because The iron giant is my favorite movie and he play's a robot that's super incerdibly nice and protective in the movie. I would ask The iron giant to get me whatever food i want because i like food. I would take The iron giant  everywhere i go, for instince i would take him to school with me to help me school work and do my homework for me when i get home, and he would go swimming with me.Those are just a couple of things i would do if i had a robot. in the movie The iron giant is very suspicious about weapons. i would want him to be like that.        Robots are a wondeful thing to have. Some robots are dangerous. But i would love to have my icredibly robot The iron giant with me everywhere i go.

He was thing to himself, 'Why does Ohio have to be so boring? I want to change the world by showing them a little Ohio boy can be smart too!' So that's just what he did. (After he watched a few episodes of MicGuiver) The little boy found his old backpack, packed some clothes, and a couple of ham and cheese sandwiches.                                                              10 YEARS LATER...         'Sir, the robot is ready for the awakening.'          'OK I'm on my way make sure the batteries are ready.'           'Will do sir.' came the reply         'I have done it,' thought Anthony, 'At the age of 18 I have created the worlds first robot. I proved a little boy from Ohio can do it.' He thought as he stood up. He started to walk to the awakening of the robot to see if he really did do it.        When Anthony got there, the room was packed full of scientists who were here to watch the awakening of the robot. 'This is it, the moment you all have been waiting for! A change in the Earth's history, the first ever robot!' Everybody clapped. Then all got silent. Anthony walked over to the table and looked at the robot. Then he carefully placed the battery inside and turned the robot on with the flick of a switch.                                              'BOOM'        The room went silent as a cloud of smoke filled the room. All of the sudden the room cleared. Anthony looked at the robot and saw... That it had worked! A small Ohio boy had actually created a robot! This was the happiest day of Anthony's life.        'So what does it do?' asked one scientist        'What's it's name?' asked another scientist        'This robot is called... Mr.Gower! This robot will work in hospitals and help doctors and nurses deliver medicine to patients who need it. This robot will run on batteries and after charging this robot for two hours you will be able to use this robot for twelve straight hours without stopping. This robot is also programmed to say hundreds of phrases. I will also be working on making other  robots that will help in mines, help us study hard and dangerous places such as volcanoes, pick fruit and help farmers, and much, much more. 'Does anybody have name requests? If so write them on this piece of paper and turn them in. I look forward to seeing you all at our next meeting, but first, who wants to try out my robot first?' Lots of hands shot in the air. While they were trying out the robot Anthony decided to take a look at the requested names.

Ford Museum.My friend Athea,and I were on our way to the Museum for the day.It was sunny,but not that hot.'Were here!' said Athea.That's when our day got crazy.       'I'll pick you guys up in 3 days!' said my Mom.We ran inside and went to the robot section first.'Cool!' we all said at the same time.'Look!' Athea said.It was a time machine!We all looked at it in fascination,then a tourist said 'DON'T TOUCH!'.He looked at us sternly,'Ill be watching you....'.       'Lets go.' I said.Athea started walking away.'Hey!Where are you guys going?'.I walked under the rope,Athea following me,we put our hands on the machine.'NO!!!!!!!'said the tourist guy....then blackness.       'Uggg....Athea?'I said,'Where am I?!?!'.I was in a hospital bed.On the right was Athea.I looked at the calendar across the room...'3015?!?!?' I thought.'Your medication is here' said a voice,it came in the room.'AAAHHHHH!!!!!!!'.We  screamed.A doctor came in and said'Whats going on here!?'       'Where are we?!?!' said Athea.'Were in 3015!!!' I said.'Calm down girls!' said the doctor,'I'm Doctor Doughnut and this is Mr.Gower,hes a robot.'.'I'm going to tell you how you got here.'       'We got an emergency call from our ambulance saying some little girl found Ms.Athea on the sidewalk on the way to school.She was also in a concussion.Then two boys came in the hospital carrying Ms.Hailey.They said they found her on their bike ride on the bridge.It was weird though because they were in the hospital a week ago.'       'Wait!!' said Athea,'My boyfriend went missing a week ago, so was Hailey's.'.She put a smug smile on her face.'HES NOT MY BOYFRIEND!!!!!!!!' I said blushing,'what were their names?'.He looked at us weirdly.'James Perez and Phillip Youngman,their here now if you want to see them...Mr Gower,go get James and Phillip please.'       'Athea!' James said,'how did you get here?'.'James!'.Athea started crying because she was worried that he was gone forever.'Phillip?!' I said,'how did you guys get here?'.He looked at me worried,'the same way you guys did.'.He looked mad,'Its was that STUPID time machine!'.       'We need to get out of here!' James said softly,'Phillip and I found out in 72 hours all the robots are going to turn evil and kill every human in this time!' He said not to softly this time.'Then we need to find a time machine...quick.'       'Athea.Athea.ATHEA!!' I said.'Heres your clothes,Phillip and James are waiting.'.We go out into the hallway,'Hide!' whispered Athea.We run out into the night,James and Phillip grab their bikes and Athea and I grab roller blades.'Lets head down Mapple Street,its a short cut to the museum.'.We turn right suddenly...'Hult!'.A Robo-Policeman was standing at the intersection of Mapple and Olive Ave.'Oh no!Keep going straight!' I yelled.       We got away,but we were lost big time.'We need a map or something!That cop could be right behind us!' Athea screamed.'Calm down Athea!' Phillip says.'I have my cell,plus it has a map.' I suggested,'Were in the woods,so we need to go West to get back to Mapple Street.'.We start going west,we make it to Mapple,but something sudden happens.'Hello Hailey'.       'Who is that?' James asks warningly.'Its me,Micheal' says Micheal.He comes out of the alley with a bike.Then we hear sirens,Robo-Police sirens!'RUN!!' yells James.We all dash into the alley.'They're gone,that was close.' says Athea.'Howd you get here.' says Phillip.'A time machine.'.'Guys!Look!!'.It was the museum!       We ran into the museum,found the machine.....ZAP!!!We were back!'Were back!' said Athea and I together.'Hailey?Athea?'.'Mom!!!!' I said,ever so happily.'Glad that over!' said Micheal.We all laughed.                                                         	DT NNP NNP NNP NNP RB VBN .

They  different types of robots Gemini-Scout, Dante2, Mr. Gower, Agribots, HRP-4c and may others. Some of theme can save people, some can go into water...They are even some that can do surgeries. There is a robot that can be like a babysitter, it can dance, sing do all kinds of things they can even talk. There is the robot Agribots that can even pick fruits. It might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples.Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmeers are very interested in what thesse robots can do. Because picking a stawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms others are able to move around on there own.      We can think that they are bad in an other bbecause if they do everything we won't do anything. That is why we can think there amazing and we can think there bad.

He is very small and he is silver with a little bit of purple on his arms from when I spilt grape juice on him by accident.But when I woke up, I saw that my robot was missing so I looked everywhere for him and I couldn't find him. When I was looking for him, I heard a strange noise in the kitchen so i went to check and i saw my toy robot.             Robot was fixing breakfast. I didn't know if I should've been worried or not. I had thought long and hard about having a real robot in my house. After a long time of thinking, I figured that it would actually be fun to have a real robot at my house because of all the cool things we could do together; i.e., fly everywhere, make anything we want, and we could even have a robot party.             During all of the fun time we had together, I had forgotten all about school and my parents so I had to take my robot to a far, far, far away land known as Mars. It was the hardest goodbye ever because of all the things we did together and we wanted to stay with each other forever. When I got home, I told my dad about my robot and he felt so bad for me that he let me get my robot back. I told him that I would always do my best and that I would always try harder with my robot.

The robot can help people in mines,climb volcanos,help in hospitals,pick fruit,and can drive itself. I would like to bring this robot to the next meeting to test it and give it a name.                                                                      sincerly, Antonio 	NNP VBD IN DT JJ NN , IN PRP VBD DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN CC VBD VBG NN PRP VBD NN NNP PRP VBD DT NN WDT MD VB NN WDT PRP VBP NNP NNP NN MD VB NNS IN NNS , NN NNS , VB IN NNS , NN NN , CC MD VB NNP PRP MD VB TO VB DT NN TO DT JJ NN TO NN PRP CC VB PRP DT NNP RB , NNP	0		20131023141031	2349	0		20131023141038	2411	1		20131025141018	2328	0

Her arms could stretch and her neck could stretch to. She would have bang's that go to the side her hair would be curly. The my proffer walked in he asked what was I doing i said I'm building a robot he giggled he said that impossible I gave up faith. I pushed on I got up and had faith again. I remembered what my sister always told me to never to give up faith. the robots name would be Rosalie # 1. She would have a compartment. She would be a gold robot.My mom said a golden robot I said ya.       I started building. I started shaving metal so they would look like curls. Then I made curved a piece of metal so they could be her bangs. She will have eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose. she will help me take care of my kids. The first time she worked I for got to give an oil hole. So she broke down. The second time there was a lose wire. so her head exploded. The third time was the charm lightning strike at her and i yelled shes alive. Then I yelled thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus.       The first year i had her there where some  glitches at first. so then i left her alone and she stopped so I worked on her so she could work again. Then she worked I had her help me because I broke my arm she was like my sister. She was always there for me. So I called her one of my own kids and that's how I had a robot kid and how i built a robot. And that's my family.

He was programmed to help miners by: checking the air for toxic gas, carries food and water to miners, and dragging the miners out of the mine if he had to.                                                                                                                 The next day Billy 1.0 was activated and something happened, because he realized how sick and tired he was getting from helping miners every single day. About an hour later a new robot named Mr. Gower rolled into the room and said ' here you go, here you go. here you go, here you go!' Billy 1.0 was confused, he asked Mr. Gower why he was talking but was rudely interrupted by Mr. Gower saying 'Here you go, here you go, here you go!' A little while later after hearing the words of Mr. Gower Billy 1.0 finally said 'I hope your batteries die!!!' When Mr. Gower heard this he was infuriated, in fact he was so mad that he exploded!(here is a quick word about Mr Gower, he is programmed to carry medicine to patients and say something like here you go or i am here with your medicine.)                  Billy 1.0 was horrified about that explosion. Billy 1.0 was mad at humans for creating a defective robot, as mad as Billy 1.0 was at Mr. Gower saying 'here you go' over and over again, he did not think that Mr. Gower deserved to explode. At that point Billy 1.0 decided that he would rebel against humans. On the street, when Billy rode by humans he would shine his high powered flash light into their eyes and here them yell bad things at him while they couldn't see. Billy 1.0 also rebelled by taking freshly mined minerals from miners and putting them into missiles that were shot into space to put them on the moon. People and scientists and especially doctors were getting worried. The people were worried they would run into billy 1.0. The doctors were worried because there offices were getting full of blinded patients. And the scientists were worried because they said that they released the robot Billy 1.0 int o the public. So scientists conducted a search for Billy 1.0, scientists thought Billy 1.0 had come to life, pretty much. After a year of terrorizing people Billy 1.0 became careless where he hid himself. So one day the search party found Billy 1.0 and took him back to the lab. At the lab the scientists and technicians fixed and upgraded Billy. To this day Billy became known as Billy 2.0. BUT don't think that is the end because it is most definitely not! After Billy 2.0 was upgraded the scientists added a new feature... that billy 2.0 would blow up if he thought about rebelling. It was late and stormy when they upgraded the feature and forgot to nail on the self destruct bomb. The next day Billy 2.0 was playing in the grass outside of the lab, when a robot bully(don't ask why they made that) popped out of the bushes. It startled Billy 2.0, then he remembered the bomb, the bully made fun of Billy 2.O's scientists that created him. Billy 2.0 got mad and activated the bomb and threw it at the bully thus blowing the bully robot apart. The scientists heard this and ran out side to see what happened. When they saw what happened they laughed because they were trying to find the bully bot. Scientists thought billy 2.0 was a hero and congratulated him. Again something in Billy 2.0 Changed and as fast as Billy 2.0 could he ran over all of the scientists. More scientists came and caught and upgraded him again making him Billy 3.0, that final upgrade was just what Billy needed because after that he went back to helping miners. Scientists are now saying that if Billy 3.0 rebels again that they are blaming Eddy Blarby Jr. because he is a bad technician that nobody trusts. Eddy Blarby Sr. hates all of the scientists because they make fun of Eddy Blarby Jr. so he modified Billy 3.0 to rebel again but it didn't work.

They were designing a robot in Gorham Laboratory of Science for cars or just to have with you in case of emergency. This robot was one foot by one foot and in an emergency it would flash, make noise and set of a signal to the emergency center. These robots did not use cell phone towers or satellites they use sound waves to hide emergency codes.       Well my family was one of the few people to test the robot. This all was because of our crash and no phones worked. So everyone in our family got one and we brought them everywhere. My family has never done something like this before so this was new to all of us.We went swimming with them, they were waterproof and had tracks and we went hiking with them. They were great to have around.        One day we were in crash way off the road. It was horrendous like the truck was going to explode after going a hundred ninety mph strait into the huge pine tree. We were in the top of NH where no one lived so it was not like people would notice. We had no cell service so we pulled out our robots and the did not work.  All the sudden they were after us. We ran and ran we at least had to be going 70 mph and they were right behind us. They were monstrous little things all scary and demanding. finally someone found us because it felt like we had been running for hours. We got home and called the laboratory and told them what happened and they told us it was just a little malfunction but the robots were alive. In the end robots weren't my thing.

I gave him and then he sat down and i turned him off and gave thim a battery change and went to bed  the next moring i turned him on and gave him a oil change and ask thim to make a telaproter to go to work and the store. And i told him that he could have a little party well i am gone so he did when i came home the house was a mess so i told thim to clean it up and piant the house well he was at it and then we used the telaporter to go to the park and we played togehter  and we played on the slide and swings at the park.

That's weird my name was Gemini too, I wonder who was saying my name. All the sudden I started jerking around from left to right as if being controlled by someone or something. I saw one of my own kind, for if you haven't guessed I'm a robot, but there was something wrong with him, he was all rusty and he wasn't moving. A piece of worn, ripped cloth was in his supplies box and he was stuck under a pile of rocks my owners must have knocked down. Before I could help, I started being controlled again and swerved around the pile of rocks to a sleeping... oh, what you call them... humans! A human was stuck half way in the pile of rock. How could anyone fall asleep in a place like that, especially one of those picking humans. Well, I guess I should wake him up, but the thing who was controlling me had other plans. I was forced to nudge him. The human wouldn't budge and if I nudged  any harder my circuits would blow or its head would. 'Testing gas levels, testing gas levels. Testing complete, gas levels low.' I heard the voice say again. I was getting real tired of the voice's attitude, I didn't have gas. I mean I drank gas but I didn't pass it. I tried to take control, but the voice wouldn't let me. Instead it led me through the mines, which I lived in, and to a camp of humans. One of them uttered something to another like,'Stupid machine.' and another, 'Who owns this bucket of rust!' Why I ought to... I was about to teach those guys a lesson when the voice said, ' Opening supply crates.' Wait, no that's my supplies! Stop it, stop it!!! One of the humans walked up to me and said, ' Hey little guy I'm Mo. How about a little touch up, your stating to rust.'                       Hey, what are you doing stop that it tickles! The human named Mo took me into a little tent and started messing with my antenna and my radio and a bunch of other things too. Something obviously went wrong because my monitor went black and I couldn't see a thing. A few minutes later I awoke to see the man watching me. I have to admit it was a little creepy how he was looking at me. I could feel my body was free again, but I heard a rumbling noise. I remembered the last time this happened. All the walls started to cave in and I jumped up and tried to tell the man to follow me. He did! We raced down the caverns and into daylight with a hundred other miners following. Mo bent down, ' I owe you my life little guy how about you come live with me.' He winked at me and I finally trusted him. 	IN IN NN .

I was living at Harvard Universety. Apparently I was the only 16 year old there. The principle of the school told me my parents had already paid as if they know I was going to go here. Then there was the fact that I got scholarships. I don't know why I was so smart when it came to technology but whenever I focused on inventing my head felt like it was going to explode.         I went to the main hall and checked the honor roll list. Of course the name Johnathan King was on there. If your wondering thats me. The robots were just sitting there making frozen yogurt for the students. I saw a poster that said Class of 2053, 2 years ago. There was one man who looked like me except he was taller and buff.                 'That was Robert King' the principle came by and told me. 'Very convinient he has the last name as you and was at this universety.' I lived alone my whole life if this guy was related to me I'd actually have a brother or a cousin or something. 'Where does he work now'I asked. 'He's working with Jake Ive, Apples designer.' Apple had been the oldest company ever. Old people told me they had an iPhone which is one of Apples oldest products. These days Apple is making robots.           I skipped all my classes today so I could go find Robert King. He was super smart. He said he created the iBot which was probably the robot made for every specific task. It uses voice command. Then he asked me my name. I told him it. Then he hugged me. He was my brother.          We're working on an intellagience helmet. Then I said a bunch of stuff not even I could understand and my head felt terrible.'Thats brilliant.' He said. Wait your head its extremely red. He told me to go inside a booth. He took an X Ray. Apparently dad had injected an intellagience chip in my head. The camera zoomed nto my head and John grabbed a piece of paper. He told me to leave and I did.          Six months later he came to the Universety and showed me The Intellegience Helmet. He had used the same chip in my head. It was amazing. Apple satrted making more helmets and Robert and I got rich.

Dr. Eicher was planning to make a robot. Dr.Cruz was studying Dr.Eichers every move. ' You know some of the technology your are planning to use has not eve been used before its only like 2030 and some of the technology you are planning to use is like 2060 stuff'. SHHH silenced DR. Eicher. When Dr. Eicher finally took her eyes off the small pieces she was working on she noticed a small but could potentially big problem. 'UGHH this will never work!', Dr. eicher storms out of the room.

He had been finishing a theory he had thought of. As he ran towards the door to stop the guard from closing it, two liquids got caught on his lab coat and spilt onto a cutting machine. after the night guard locked the door and sat down, he heard a lot of beeping noises. He went to go investegate. When he found where the noise was coming from he was confused. It was a silver machine that was about three feet tall and two feet wide. The beeps and buzzes just kept getting louder and louder. He didnt know what it was or what it was doing but he was scared. As it started to move he dashed to the door and locked it behind him.        About five minutes after the guard left for good, the machine made a ear peircing sound and the whole lab lit up like someone was doing fire works in there. The light and sound ended at the same time and where it seems the source of them both was a totaly different thing. It looked as if it was living. It was still the same color but it appeared as if it had eyes and a mouth. It also had three legs with rollers on the bottom and two arms with big clippers on the end. It first started to spin around in circles and was wrecking everything. Then it raced to the door and and snipped off the the lock and was gone.        It was a new world for the little robot. It rolled into traffic and almost got hit by several cars. It went everywhere and scared off a bunch of people. One of the people called the police but they thought she was crazy. A police officer that was on duty saw it and reported seeing it. This time they knew it was real. The robot went into and alley and just sat there. When it came out there was a bunch of police officers searching in all places they could think of. One of them saw the robot and blew his wistle. The all started chasing after him until it cut through a fence and escaped.        The robot was in the suburbs now And it was the morning. It kept going until the scientist that had accidently created him saw the and was fascinated. He went outside and and tried to pick it up but it was to scared. 'Your a tricky one, arent you', the scientist laughed. He snuck up behind the robot and picked it up. 'Your heavy', he said. He brought the robot inside and set him on th floor. It started to spin around again and break stuff. 'No', harold yelled. He picked it up again and set him in the backyard and left him there.        When he went to work, he came to see a bunch of daw droopped scientist looking at the 30,000 dollars worth of equipment destroyed. 'The night guard wasnt here when i came this morning and all of that stuff was destroyed', the other guard said.

Smith he also worked with robots.Joseph said he could fix the robot but it would take about two months to fix and he kept his word.On the last day Joseph brought the robot to Charlies house.Charlie put him in the basment to anocced it to the world ina week.                                                                                                                                                      Charlie went to bed after he practiced his speech but he woke up in the middle of the night to a huge bang he went down stais to see what had happened but the door to the basment had a huge hole in it the shape of his robot but bigger.He went into the basment and the robot was gone.He had to find him he walked outside and saw all of his neighbors cars smashed next to these huge holes in the road.The robot keeps getting bigger and bigger he had to stop it or he was going to keep getting bigger and start putting peoples lives in danger.Charlie found him on the highway  and brought him home.On the day of the big anoccment millions of people came and even more people watched it on T.V everbody was so excited but when he opened the curtains nothing was there he appoligize to everyone but he said that he distriod stuff and kept growing and growing and he was just not safe to have around people.He also said that he shut the robot down and it would never be seen ever again.Charlie was so embaresed and so angy he swore he would never make a robot again but he did think of a name for the old one the name he thought abot was distrucktion.After he gave up life as a robot maker he built a shop a candy shop and he is much happier seeing children smile because he never had kids because all he wanted to do was make robots so he didnt have much friends around but it dosnt matter now because he has his own store in Maine it is one of the most visited plases in New England.Oh and he got a new door and payed for all the damages distruckion made a least he had the money from making robots for a living to pay for the damages and there were alot of damages the town thought of sueing Charlie but he said they would all get free candy for a month so they were willing to over look the whole sueing thing.

We just thought we out did our selfevs. Edith took it home and she told me it walked and talked all by its self. I had to see that, so I went to her house to see it but it was not there! When we ran out to look for it we herd people yelling about that. The nexted day I herd about that robot in the paper and on the news. When we finally found it  its batters ran out. That was the last we saw that robot. 	EX RB VBD DT NN WP VBD RP DT NN . NNP PRP VBP VBG DT NNP NNP RB VBD VBD PRP$ NN : NNP : CC PRP VBP NNP NNP .

The Gemini-Scout was always helping people doing alot of things such as dragging hurt people to safety, helping people out of mines, and carrying stuff for them. Dante 2 climbs volcanoes and gets information for scientists it also helps people by checking the air if its okay. Mr. Gower works in the hospital serving patients medicine.The Agribot works at farms picking fruit and watering crops. There is also a robot that plays it plays with children and animals. The last robot drives.           The Gemini-Scout was climbing a volcanoe one day to get information for scientists until the scientists got him back down and told him to go find the hurt cop and get him to safety. So Gemini-Scout did find the cop and took him to the scientist. Then they took him to the google robot so he can drive the cop to the hospital. Once they arrived they took the cop inside a room. Mr. Gower came in and gave the cop medicine.           The cop felt much better after that so he got out of the hospital went to the farm and saw Agribot working. He told the farmer if he can buy a basket of strawberrys for 10$. and Agribot already had picked a basket of strawberrys because he is always working hard.The cop? went back to the scientists to thank them and Gemini-Scout.           The cop finaly went home to have dinner with his fmily. When he walked in he saw a robot playing with his 3 year old daughter and with his cat while his wife cooks dinner. He asked his wife why is that robot in their house she said because it plays with children and animals. He also told his wife that he got strawberrys from Agribot.           The next day the cop needed a ride to his work! So he called the scientists and told them if he can get a ride from google robot and they said,'ofcourse.'When he got dropped off at his job he thanked the google robot. Also, he went to every robot that helped him and maake sure he gave them a super good thank you.

I-Bot52 has 4 wheels,a camera,is water prof, and steered by its self. When I-Bot52 found an animal  he wound bring it to an animal shelter to take care of it until some one came to adopted one of the help less animals.           I-Bot has the numbers 52  in his name, because every week he finds and helps that many animals. He helps all different kinds of animals like dogs, cats, parits, hamsters and many more. When people are abusing animals in there homes and it is to dangerous for people to go in to the home I-Bot52 goes in and gets the animal.               With I-Bot52 he gets the job done. without any mistakes. Hopefully later on in life there could be more of I-Bots to help more of the sad and helpless animals. They all could work to gather to help more animals. An save more animal lives.

Now that he is 12 he found some more people that also liked to invent things. Jim decided to start a science group with all his friends, they would always meet up at his garage at his house to come up with ideas of things to build.                        One day, one of jim's friend suggested they should build a robot, everyone agreed to the suggestion and went back home to get materiels for the robot. When they came back everyone got some metal and welded it together into a human like shape. next they added detail to the face and added clothes, they drew eyes on his face, his mouth, and made his ears and welded them to his head. Next, they put the wiring inside of the robot. They were finished so everyone went back to their house and went to sleep.                         The next day, Jim decided to check on the robot they built the other night. When he got to the garage he was amazed to see that the robot was moving on his own, he also noticed that the switch was on 'off' mode. He was able to walk on his own without anyone controlling him. Just then the robot turned to Jim and began to speak!. The robot asked Jim 'What are your commands?' Jim said 'Walk over to the door and open it.' Just as he said that the robot walked over to the door leading to his house and opened it without a problem.                         Jim ran in the house grabbed the phone and called all of his friends over to his house. When Jim's friends arrived Jim called them to their workshop in the garage and showed them the robot. Jim's friends were just as amazed as he was when he saw the robot walking all by himself. After that Jims showed his friends how the switch they put on him is on 'off' mode, he showed how the robot obeyed his every command. Jim and his friends went to go tell his mom about the robot, at first his mom did not belive him but when Jim took her to his workshop his mom was startled to see a robot with human-like qualites as well as looks.                         In conclusion, Jim took turns with his friends to take the robots to their home, and use him by telling him to do his chores and homework week by week by week.

He wanted to take over his city and then countries and even the world. But he needed something something that could help him take over the world. So he started to work on a robot.                 'Almost done' Shane said. I only need one more piece to go. If only I could find that microchip. Shane has many things he has invented but he thinks they are the total opposite of useful. Once he found the microchip he put it in the robot. The lights started to flash. 'YEESSS!!!' said Shane. The robot started to come to life. What can I do for you master said the robot. I need you to help me make some weaponry so we can rule the world. I'm afraid i can not do that for you sir you have programmed me to be a nice and kind robot. WHAT!!! Professor Shane threw the robot out and began making his own weaponry.                                                                                                                                   Once the robot came out of the trash he knew that he had to warn somebody about Professor Shane. so he traveled at the speed of light to the nearest army base. Once he got there he warned all of them and they actually believed him because they knew not just anybody would go to an army base to warn them about something. Once they caught Shane they arrested him. The army base leader said thank you and asked him if he wanted to join their army base. The robot said no and also said he actually wanted to be a super hero with all of his powers so he became an unknown super hero across their city.

Some robots are nice other robots are mean, some are big and some are small, some robots help in the house, street, offices , and some in building.Robots do alot of things like helping people, this robots take hurt people to safety like to the hospital or to a helicopter. For example: if you where stuck in a mountai this robots could climb on top of the mountain and help you. Other robots help in building like, cleaning offices or making useful things like paper, computers, phones tv's and some other electronic devices. The cool robots are the ones the are playful like a dog.This robots play with you when your bored there like a dog robot.

It grabbed one of them by the leg and drug them to the bottom of a lake.  It then went rampage in the city.  Soon the city was a disaster and the robot was on the run.  It was headed for the airport.  There was a plane about to land when the robot was on the runway.  The plane hit the robot and exploded the robot was thought to be dead so everybody left.  They soon found that the robot was out for revenge to kill everyone and take over the world.

Now this was not an ordinary lab with test experiments, this lab was a robot testing facility!!! The robots in this place were speachel because they could survive extreme temperatures that other robots could not. But these robots were not bad. they were controlled machines an they were not alive  until than.                       When the scientist woke up to the bolt of lighting bolt that hit the roof of the lab he didn't reilised that anything was wrong at first, 'It was just a lighting bolt' he said in his mind. as he got up and looked in the mirror and saw his pale skin and blond hair as it shone back at him. He had lived in that lab for at lest a year now so he didn't like the way he looked pale and not strong  before he was always outside and he liked the sun but now he is just stuck in here inside until he finished his project as he looked around the lab I could still remember the first day that I came in to this lab because the government said that I had an IQ of 500 something.                      My first day here was hard I didn't know were anything was or how to do any thing they (the government) said that I was smart enough to do it make a robot that could withstand heat and coldness to extremes. I didn't know anything at all about robotics all I knew was that I just finished high school and that I had 4.0 GPA. after awhile I thought myself to make simple things like cars or bikes but now it is way harder to make a robot that can withstand almost everything. and last night I finished the robot.                      When i went to go check on it there was a giant hole in the roof and it looked like it climbed out. But how had it climbed out of the lab the is no possible way for it to climb out of here in is made of titanium.                       Later that day I was watching the news and i saw  it on TV the robot that I made, it was in a volcano climbing out then jumping in and it could never burn  so it stayed like that forever. 	NNP : . .

The gemini-scout is a mini robot that can help save lives! this small robot can yous its thermal sight to locate a lost miner. This device can be important later on.           BOOM! a volcano erupts and all scientists leave, but not Dante 2. Dante 2 is a robot that climbs volcanoes like a spider and will gather information. the lava starts coming out of the volcano and dante's  heat protection cant save its life.           When I was in the hospital a robot named Mr.Grower helped with operations on my burned body. after about a week in the hospital i learned some things about Mr.Grower               he is a cabinet on weals he can talk he can pull 500 pounds he works on batteries he helps the workers           when i got out of the hospital i wrote a paper about robots and you might read it some day.

'Thank you Dante 2 for this information' said the scientist.'your welcome' said the robot.So early in the morning there was a mission for Dante 2.This is an important mission.the robot had to climb into a hot volcano.             The robot climbed into the hot volcano and grabbed all the information he can.Then the volcano exploded with bursting hot coals shooting out of it.But one of the hot coals hit the robot and went threw him.And the scientist lost another robot.Then the scientist had no more robots.

The first thing that pops up in my brain is that stupid dog next door. Did he jump the fence into my garage? All of my hard work with this robot for 9 years would not be chewed into tiny pieces. I sprint to the garage and I see the most breath-taking thing in the world. Mr.Flap is walking and moving!                    I go up to him and check his battery box. Everything looks fine. What did I do last night that made him finally work? This has been my dream since Day 1! I reach my phone out of my pocket and call the science observatory manager, Mark. Mark is on his way immediately. Meanwhile, Mr.Flap is doing all sorts of things. He can pick up the heavy tool box with no problem! He can push the old laundry machine. Then I see him do the unbelievable; He mumbles something. Mr.Flap can talk! What else can this robot do?                   My head is spinning of all of the thoughts I can do with him. I can sell him for millions of dollars, put him in a museum, teach him to do more tricks, or even keep him. Then I remember seeing black and Mark in my face.I have fainted.                   'Are you okay? What happened?' asked Mark.'I'm not sure. Where's Mr.Flap? I said.Mark mumbled something.' WHERE IS MR.FLAP?' I shouted. 'I think we should get you to the hospital.' Mark said. 'I am dead serious. Tell me where he is. What happened to him?' I asked. 'Well if you reall want to know.. The laudry machine has fell over him. I don't think he will make it.' Mark whispered.

I wanted to make myself eggs for the morning but I didn't know how to make them. My family was working so I couldn't ask anybody to make them for me. I was starving and really wanted to eat some eggs. Eggs was the only food I had. I didn't have any cereal or milk. If I didn't eat right this second I was going to die of hunger.     I called my mother to tell her that I needed to eat something and the only food we had were eggs. My mom is a scientist and she has been working on a robot in the house. She said that the robot is in the basement and to tell the robot to make you eggs. Next she told me to press the big red button on its back to turn it on. I went to the basement and turned on the robot. The first thing that the robot said is 'what can I do for you'. I told it to make me eggs. The robot rushed  up the basement.        It had two legs and two arms. The machine had a shining silver color to it. It was very tall and it was light. It can communicate to people and do anything they wanted it to do. It was very intelligent and it could move very quickly. It was just a very astonishing machine.     The robot took the eggs out of the refrigerator. The robot started cooking the eggs. It was amazing to see it work. It worked very quickly and it was done it a couple of minutes! When it gave me the food it tasted wonderful. I wasn't hungry anymore. I felt revived. I should make it do my chores next time because it does it very rapidly. One day we may be asking ourselves if humans should still be allowed to work in their homes.

Young Casidee was only 9 years old, so she didn't expect anything huge to happen, actually she thought the most extravagant thing that could happen was one of her many inventions was them becoming a normal thing that people used in life, an invention that they sold in stores. She believed that nothing great would happen with her inventions.         One bright beautiful day Casidee was once again working on an invention. She spent nearly the whole day in her messy room trying to build a robot, but not just any robot, a robot that could talk and move. She thought that that was a perfect thing to build because she thought it could actually do something for her, unlike any of her other robots. So after a long day of working she decided to get some rest, so she put her pajamas on, brushed her teeth, and got into bed. That's when it happened. Her robot started doing its job by moving around the room, like normal, then it started repeating the only word it can say, like normal, then it did something unexpected. It when up to Casidee and said, 'Hello Casidee, my name is Patrick'.            'What? Did you just speak to me? I mean i knew you could talk, but not a complete sentence! This is amazing!' Exclaimed Casidee.     Casidee's robot was alive. Casidee's robot could now move wherever it wants, say whatever it wants and do whatever it wants.       Pretty soon Casidee's inventions were sold worldwide, and everyone wanted one. Casidee's robot, Patrick, also had a good life, helping Casidee with her inventions and acting like a normal person. Hospitals, stores, and many more places were buying the robots, the robots helped serve many popurposes. They cleaned, they helped with math, they did anything a person could do but better! Casidee's robots, and other inventions were now famous.

This scientest was married and had one little boy named Jeremy. Jeremy loved science and he also loved building this. One day he wanted to build something that would be very rare and then one day if you didnt want one, people would think you were crazy. This, this thing he wanted to build, was a robot.            Jeremy went to school at a regular school and was very smart. He was so smart he started in preschool but he never finished preschool he went right to first grade on the second day of school. That is how smart Jeremy is. He is ten years old and he is already in sixth grade. He and everyone else thought it was kind of weird too but he enjoyed it, but other people didnt. They thought it was weird and also unfair how he was only ten.            'Dad do you think I could build a robot?' asked Jeremy on the third week of sixth grade.        'You know Jeremy robots are pretty hard to build.'        'I know but the science fair is coming up in three weeks and I want to make a robot that can be like a human. This robot is going to be able to go swimming so he can get wet, he will be able to do everything!'        'Okay you can try if you want but if you can't get it to talk or anything dont be mad okay?'        'Okay dad I wont get mad!'            So of he went into his room to go build a robot. After the next couple of days Jeremy would get home from school, get a snack, and go straight to his room to work on his robot that he would soon call Jeremy Jr. He wouldnt even come down for dinner he would have his mom or dad bring it up to him so he could work on Jeremy Jr.            One day, Jeremy's second week (he only had five more days) working on his robot he ran down the stairs and yelled 'I made a robot I created a human like robot!'        'You did let us see it!' Said Jeremy's mom. So Jeremy went upstairs and brough him down.        'His name is Jeremy Jr. I made him so he can walk, talk, get wet, and pretty much do everything I can do.'        'He can well let's see it.'        'Okay but I havent't tested it I wanted to do it when we were all here and watching.' So Jeremy pushed a couple of buttons on a remot control and they heard a couple of noises, so Jeremy pushed a button that would make him talk. They waited a second and nothing happened. So he hit the button that would make him do what he wanted but nothing happened. 'Maybe I but the green wire with the blue wire, and the blue wire with the green purple wire, adn the purple wire with the green wire. Let me go fix it, it might take a couple of hours though.            The next day when he got home from school he went straight upstairs without getting a snack to work on his robot. He only had four more days until the science fair. That day his mom came up and asked him what he wanted for dinner and he just said 'I don't care you or dad can decide' and went back to work.            The next day he did the same exact thing but he told his mom that he just wanted pasta. He had to work hard if he was going to finish his robot in three days. It was the night before the science fair. Friday night. He had been working on it since four that night and it was already ten at night. He ran down the stairs, robot in his hand, and yelled 'I did it, I finished Jeremy Jr.'   'Okay turn him on son!'   So Jeremy pushed a bunch of buttons, but he wouldnt turn on so he just said, 'I guess I will just have to take a non talking, non walking, non everything robot to the science fair' and went back upstairs.           At the science fair many people asked if he did the robot on his own and of course he said yes. Then someone accidentaly bumped the table and Jeremy Jr. started to talk! It was a miracle he walked all over the place talking to people, shaking hands it was Jeremy's best day ever! He had done it he made a real talking robot! Jeremy was so excited he even got first place! Ever since that day he had loved making things, especially robots.

Greg did lots of things during the day.like doing dishes cloths sports the one sport he was really good at was tether ball. he was the all time champion at tether ball. because of his hard hits on the ball. and he was also a transformable robot. he could turn into a famous basketball player. or as i would say it anything you would want him to be.

The Gemini-scout is cool because it is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground. It is less than 2 feet tall and has wheels it can go up and down stairs and make tight turns and stuff like that. Now if I had a robot it would be voice activated only to my voice or remote controlled. it would look like the Gemini scout but only bigger like 8 1/2 feet tall and 8 1/2 feet wide. It would be able fly and on the bottom their will be handles that come out and it will have a helicopter blade come out to fly and wings come out of the side to go faster. It would have it's own security and be able to teleport me and itself some where safer or turn into morticicle it would have arms that are under the wings to do my chores and homework to so that what my robot would be.

The guy that was building Joe just got the job a few weeks ago. The new guy was told to build a toy robot but when he was building Joe he had a lunch break 40 mins in. When 40 minutes past the new guy put joe down on a table where it was safe.The toy that he built before was to become alive and he left the lid open on the magic powder and he tiped it over on the table that Joe was laying on. So the new guy was off to his lunch where all the other guys ate there lunch. They were all talking to the new guy and how Joe the robot was going. The new guy said fine. Then one of the guys were joking around about if the magic powerd got on Joe. Well the new guy was done with his lunch so he went back to work into his workroom. When he got in there he noticed that Joe the robot he was working on was gone. He started to freak out,he went to look for all around his workroom but he could not find Joe. The next thing he new he heard a loud scream it was back where he was eating lunch with the other guys. He ran through the halls to get back to the lunch room and he saw Joe picking up things and throwing them around. All teh guys were freaked otu of what they were seeing and they new the new guy built Joe. All the guys were yelling at him and saying ''What powder did u use'' and the new guys said ''the one that has a angle on it''. The guys said thats the come to life one. The new guys was terrifiyed of what he done. The guys said''the only way to stop it is to make a drink or food that the robot likes to eat and put a kill posion in it''. The guys were tieing up Joe with rope but they new that they had to hurry because they new the rope would hold on long enough for a long time. So some ran to the workroom to find the posion and mix it with some robot food. Once they had it they ran back to the lunch room and forced the robot to drink it 1 minute later the robot started to die and it shut down. The new guy was mad at himself for makeing that mistake but the other guys said its fine and that problem is in history now nothing to worry about. It was time to close up shop so all of them gathered their things and left.

Here are the three robots and what they do.   1). Gemini Scout, Gemini Scout(GS) is one of the tree friends and he does serch and rescue missions he recently has been to Africa and Haiti.   2). Danete 2(D2), D2 is again one of the three friends but D2 climbs into volcanos and other things to do the kind of stuff that scientest and other reserch people cant do.   3). Mr.Gower(MG), MG is a robot friend too and is a robot that does medical things includeing giving and delivering medicine and working in hospitals and is a part time doc.            So one time GS,D2, and MG were all on the same mission and they all had to go to the U.S.A to help with the people there. GS had to help the people in a small town named smallville and GS had to help do serch and rescue missions to find people that were in all the ruble of the volcano that had erupted. D2 had to go to smallville and help the scientist find out what had caused the volcano to erupt and to help futere things from not happening. MG had to help all the people that were killed or critically injured in the volcano. They all did there job and then the volcano erupted agian so they all had to do there job one lastime before mostly everything in smallville was returned back to normal!!!!!!!!!!!yeah..

This robot was meant to be a nurse in warfare. It turned against the humans in the 2nd war against the aliens. Since humans have never thought that he would do that they had no way to shut it of, so their only choice was to destroy it.       In time the Humans successfully made another robot, named john, to destroy the other robot that had went rouge. This time the new robot was remote controlled by humans.        A small ship placed John on the alien fleet. They moved him to a room that had many aliens on it. out of all the aliens there was the rouge robot behind them. Then they noticed that one alien was bigger than the others. they shot and killed it, then the Humans watched the ship fall and kill all of the alien species.

I thought in my head.It was my first day at this new school. BOOM!The bell rang with a flash of of kids running home.I had walked home thinking about all my inventions that were horrible,and couldn't even work.When I got home I lied on my freshly smelled bed with now tear of sadness on the pillow.Suddenly,it came!I will make a robot!                   I went to my wooden desk and thought about the design and how to make the robot. I grabbed a piece of paper from my ripped binder and started sketching.The robot was going to be red with black stripes,blue eyes,and a bow on top.Then,I went down stairs to get a screwdriver,memory chip,and some cords from the garage. while I was walking across the kitchen my mom said to me,'Hannah what do you think your doing with all that mechanical uses?' I said,'Jasmine Gonzales,may I please use these for my invention?' My mother replied'Yes,but if you get hurt it's not going to be my fault because I warned you.' I walked upstairs,feeling like my heart was beating out of my chest.                   I started to build this incredible robot!It took me hours and hours,but finally I was dripping sweat on the floor staring at the robot.I named the robot Martha.I turned the 'on' button slowly with my shaky hands.As I stepped back,the robot said'Hello,my name is Martha.What is your name?' My voice sounding squeaky' Hannah.'I screamed with excitement because my creation worked! I went downstairs and said to mom,'Mom,mom,mom it worked!Come to my room!' She came and saw the robot and said'What is this thing?' I said excitedly,'It's a robot!'She replied back,'Well, is this harmful or helpful?' I looked at her crazily and said,'Helpful!' With confusion she said,'Ok,as it doesn't destroy anything.' My robot and I started talking about life and what we do and don't hate.It was fun and intersting.All of a sudden, the robot asked me,'How is school going for you?' I looked at my robot with a sad face and said,'Not so good.'                      Martha said,'Why?' I replied with sadness,'It's not going dso good because it's the first day of being at my new school and I don't have any friends.' Martha said,'It's ok you just have to get out of your shell and talk to people ask if they can show- Then, I opened my eyes in my bed and thought this was all a dream.

Robots can do many things.  Robots can help people save lives, work on farms, and work in mines.They can even collect information for scientists.          One type of robot is the Gemini-Scout.The Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies to the miners. The Gemini-Scout can also drag hurt people to safety.          Another robot is the Dante 2. The Dante 2 goes into volcanoes to collect information for scientists. Dante 2 also collects information about the gases that come out of vents in the crater.            The last robot is called Mr.Gower. Mr.Gower helps docters and nurses bring medicine to patients.  Mr.Gower does work that docters, nurses, and pharmacists usedto do so they can focus on other important tasks.           In conclusion, robots are very important in our everyday lives. Robots can do alot of things that humans can. robots do things that humans can't do.

At the end they came up with one robot,the Blunderget.It had a mind of its own,a thermal camera to spot enemies,it looks exactly like a human,and it has all the trait a Marine should have.Bob said,'With this robot the U.S will have the strongest military force in the world.'As soon as it was approved it went straight into the battlefield.At that exact moment   something strange happened,the robot made the plane crash and the Blunderget escaped.The group was astonished.Al asked Bob,'Did you program everything correct?'Bob responded,'Well, I did make a few mistakes.'Right after he said that,the group was lying flat on their backs.                                                                                                                                Blunderget exploded through the door.The group was astonished.Blunderget picked up the group one big scoop at threw them to the wall.'Blunderget has come to destroy us.' John shouted.Bob remembered that he always kept an extra rocket launcher in the closest.Bob grabbed the rocket launcher and aimed it straight at Blunderget's face.Then POW!All of Group 913's work has come to waste.The group never talked about it again.

He got out his tools and started to work as hard as he could. Two hours later a lighting bolt came from the lab. 'Hes alive scremed' mr.mustache. The lights dimmed all the girls screamed. 'Its evil' shouted sallysue. Mr.mustache made a monster it was horrable. Half the town was gone but sallysue she stayed and it made the robot angry. Untill she said 'i love you robbiebob' the robot shrank down to a little robot and was cute ,soft and cuddle. 'From now on will you be nice' said sallysue. 'Yes' said robbiebob.

She was going to name the robot Alex. She was finished with the robot so she tested it out to see if it would work.it was working,but on Saturday morning she woke up and her robot was gone.

When she went to the backyard it was destroyed. All of her hard work was destroyed.She ran inside crying and she told her mom that her her robot (Alex) was destroyed. Her mom went out side to the backyard to see what happened.                                                   After a week she made a second robot named Alexis. She tested it out to see if it worked.'It works mom!' Her mom saw it cleaning her room,making the bed, and making food.After a few days the robot came alive while Ashely was working on her homework. Ashely ran to her mom and she told her that her robot was talking. Her mom did not believe her so she went to check it herself. Her mom was surprised that a robot was talking.They asked the robot questions and he answered all of them correctly.                A few days past and the robot (Alexis) be came best friends they always played together and they shared secrets. They  never left each other sides.

I didn`t know what to say at first,but then my mom came and said,'Ohhh....it`s here!' I didn`t know what was inside that box,but I didn`t care at all. I said,'We have to go to school your just making me late,so hurry.' My mom said,'OK then go inside the car and I put the package inside then I will come.' As I went to the car, my mom came and said,'Hey while you are here,Jake,can you take my son to school.' 'OK,' said the man. I went to the man`s van so we drove off to school.            I came home the next day, and told my mom on the phone about what was inside the box. She said something about a robot inside the box. So I went where the box was,I open it and it was a robot. I felt excited when I saw the robot.It was light blue,long body,long arm,and it has wheels to steer though the tight curves though the house. I wanted to play with it so much so I decided to play with it.I played with it all afternoon,and then my mom came and was still. I came by and said,'Hi mom,what are you doing here aren`t you at wok still?' My mom said,'NO,and I get off early!' I was tired after all those running outside the house with Narmel. I called him Narmel because it looked like a narwhal. I thought I was in big trouble, but my mom said,'Are you happy with it?' I was curious about what my mom said.I said,'I am happy with it and why did you said that?'My mom said nothing after days.            I woke up and it was not there anymore.I ran down stairs and saw it doing chores for my mom. I thought I was dreaming but I wasn`t. I went to my mom and said,'Why is it doing things for us?' My mom didn`t say anything at all. I felt like I did something wrong to it like played it to long. It came and said,' Are you OK?' It sounded like it was a human but it was working for us. I didn`t know if it was the robot that I played all afternoon yesterday. I went out the door to school and while I was walking to school,my friend came and said,'Whats wrong?' I said,'Nothing.'            When I came the next day, it came and said,'Me friendly.' I said,'I guess I got to get use to you then.'

She had one special little toy name Robbie. He was a robot with big green eyes and a silver body. Kassie would always play with Robbie since it was her favorite little toy. She took him to the park,the river,and to her grandmas house. One day she was eating dinner and she left Robbie sitting in her bed and he came to life! He was not a little robot anymore; he was a big robot,3'5 feet tall! She soon came back to play with Robbie and she seen him big. She was so amused with him that she asked him how he came alive. He responded with all the love you have gaven me and how much you care about me I became strong and ready to become alive! He said 'Thanks for always being there for me,now I will always be there for you'.              And thats the story of how Robbie the robot came to life with the love that Kassie had gave him. They became best friends but one day Robbie got smashed by a car when helping Kassie go to the store for groceries. Kassie was sad for years and she never had a friend like Robbie. She still remembers the stroy of 'Come alive Robbie'. 	NNP VBP NNP NNP PRP RB VBD IN VBG DT NN WDT VBZ JJ . NNP RB VBZ CD JJ NN IN VBZ IN PRP VBP PRP$ NN NN JJ . DT VBZ DT NN NN IN JJ JJ NNP '' .

I came back out and there it was standint there playing with my football. I looked surprised at it than it looked at me and said hi my name is rob the robot. what is your name? My name is jamie! Im your owner and how did you just come alive. I been alive. Wanna play football? Yes that is what i am made for. Jamie and Rob the robot started playing until jamie's mom came out with dessert and looked in shocked... Ummh... How did he come alive? I dont know really it just happened so quick.Hi my name is Rob the robot.. Jamie get away from that thing. No mom he is alright he wont hurt nobody... Are u sure? I'm positive..

Esquire was conducting an experiment,  She was planning to create the worlds first babysitting robot!  She was towards the end of the experiment and was in a pinch because she forgot to order the special part to make it come alive, Part-21590 also known as the Cloud-Dreamer.  She quickly ran to her laptop and looked up that part, 'Lets see 012950, 21480, 21591 wait!' She said, ' They don't have it!' Jamie nearly had an heart attack because she then realized that she had nearly 100 top scientists coming to see this babysitting robot.  She slumped down on the examining table and exclaimed ' Jamie P. Esquire gives up on being a scientist.'  She put the robot together and leaves it on the table.  She slowly packs up the rest of her things, Not knowing she forgot her laptop and cell phone on her desk.  'Click, Click', Jamie shuts of 2 of the 3 lights leaving one on the robot.                        The next week Jamie went back to her old job, High school chemistry teacher.  She sighed as she walked to her teachers desk.  As she reached in her backpack she realized she forgot her laptop at the Opal Science Conservatory.  She ran back to her car driving as quickly as she can to get there.  'I can't believe I forgot my laptop again!', as she ran up the steps she realized the robot was gone and there were tire tracks leading to the window.  She wondered ' where is that robot?', She then heard a screams and shouts out side seeing that her robot was destroying pretty much everything in sight!  'Uh Oh, Looks like I can't be teaching today.'  As she jumped out the window she saw that there was a solar panel on top of the robot.  Then thinking, 'the light must have given the robot energy!'                                      She got to the ground as fast as she could searching for the robot seeing it was heading for the huge parking lot.  She looked around for some transportation, seeing the bike she said, 'this will have to do.'  Jumping on to the bike she sped of towards the parking lot.  She soon saw the robot up ahead but the disappeared into a bunch of bushes.  She then exclaimed, ' Oh great could this get any worse?'  Jamie answered her own question the robot started to destroy all of the cars in the lot!  She ran has fast as she could to the robot.  As she caught up to it she looked for its off switch,  She shouted, 'Ugh where is it?'  She gave up and ripped the solar panel off and the robot drove around in crazy circles and then finally shut off.  Jamie said after that,' There that should be enough destruction for one day.'  Picked up the robot and put on her lab coat and exclaimed,  ' Jamie P. Esquire is now a scientist!'  She then walked back to the conservatory and began working on her next project.

Robots can carry things, Turn, play sports,talk,climb hills, and save peoples lives. Scientists have been able to create very smart robots thatcan do anything. Gemini-Scout is a robot that can detect lost miners in the ground so people can rescue them. It can go downstairs and make tight turns, and it can even go in water. Robots can have certain jobs, too. They can be programed to work in mines or farms. Some can even work in grocery stores! Robots can help with anything.                 Scientists were also able to invent Google Robot Cars. They work on their own and need no steering. All you have to do is sit back and relax.The cars have detectors and radars so they can see people and other vehicles passing. 'We get a lot of Thumbs up,' says Anthoy Levandowski, one of the leaders of Google's self-driving car project.   The steering wheel turns it self, so you dont have to hold teh wheel the whole ride. Robot cars can adjust their speed to the speed of the traffic.       Robots and robot cars are very cool and help a lot around the world. People love how the act and what they are able to do. They hold a lot of Technology and take years to make. Robots are truly amazing.

First, a robot called the Gemini scout can mine and find lost miners. Next, Dante-2 can climb down into volcanoes and has eight legs like a spider. Last, Mr. Gower works in hospitals and brings medicine to patients. To me, all of these robots are fantastic.       First, the Gemini scout works in mines and uses thermal vision to see heated objects or people. Gemini scout is also controlled, but it is less than two feet tall and can squeeze through tight spaces and corners.Wherever the Gemini scout is it collects information and tests air for gases and tells miners if it is safe or not. The Gemini scout is remotely controlled and they are similar to video game controls. Gemini scout is lees than two feet tall but it is very strong, and even carries food, water, and supplies. The Gemini scout carries injured miners to safety too. I believe this robot is very fascinating.      Next, Dante-2 has eight legs like a spider and climbs like a spider. Dante-2 gathers information on volcanoes and can stand high temperatures of heat. When a volcano is to hot Dante-2 goes in instead. Dante-2 looks for vents, or holes in the crater of the volcano. Then it collects information about the gases that come out of the vent. Back then, it was hard for scientists because they couldn't get deep into the volcano.      Last, Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hospitals and brings medicine. The body of a robot is a stack of locked drawers that store medicine. Doctors and nurses can unlock the drawers when the medicine is going to be used. It can go anywhere and Mr. Gower can even talk. The robot is so strong it can carry up to 500 pounds. Mr. Gower runs on batteries and after being charged for two hours it can work nonstop for twelve hours. Mr. Gower can say many phrases such as 'calling elevator' and 'you're delivery is here'.      In all, all of these robots are amazing. Whether its from Gemini scout to Dante 2 or Mr. Gower. But all of these robots, like I said are fantastic.

The new robot called Mrs. Zangler came to life on the day of November 23, 2000. Just like robots like Mr. Gower and Agribots the new robot has just come to life. This is a story about how Mrs. Zangler came to life and found out what type of robot she was.          Mrs. Zangler came to life on November 23. Like most robots, she did not start out as a robot that came to life. Scientists had been trying to figure out how and what would make Mrs. Zangler come to life. They had been searching formula after formula, but nothing would come out. Well, when Mr. Ziggby the scientist came in he had just the right formula for Mrs. Zangler. Once the formula was taken, the robot had come to life and had already wanted to start her job.          The scientists were amazed at the new robot and eventually figured out what Mrs. Zangler could do. Mrs. Zangler become an underwater searcher and would save peoples lifes. It was an underwater robot and could survive underwater. Thanks to Mrs. Zangler she is a life saving and can give scientists the information they need.

I am an only child and have always wanted a sibling to play around with while my parents were at work.  I am only 12 so I knew my invention would not really work but I constructed it anyway.  It was one of those days when my parents were at work and I was bored out of my mind so I went downstairs so I could work on my Brother Robot, when I noticed that he was gone.                I looked all over my house checking everywhere I could and he was nowhere to be found.  Now this scared me a little because I hadn't even put ant batteries in him yet.  The last room I checked he was there.  He was sitting on the couch playing video games.  I was so happy because I realized that I had finally had a brother!  He was just as I had expected.  But I was still wondering how he had come to life so I asked him.  I don't know how he would talk because I hadn't even put in a microphone. Though he could talk to me like any other kid.  I asked him how he came to life without my help. He said that he had grabbed batteries somehow and stuck them in his back so he could function.  Then he found a computer microphone and put that in his stomach.  It was really amazing what he had done.                I had instantly grabbed a remote and played video games with my new brother.  It felt good to not be so lonely all the time.  He had been with me for a week now and I realized that I had still not given him a name.  I had asked him what sounded cool to him so he chose Jonathan Jr.  My name was Jonathan and I was not very happy with his name choice but was flattered that he liked me, so I let him keep the name.  Soon enough I had taught Jonathan Jr. to play my favorite sport, baseball.  Surprisingly Jonathan Jr. was a lot better than half of the kids on my team!  Even me.  Then I witnessed the only bad part about creating Jonathan Jr.  Was I really becoming jealous of a robot, I think so.                 Anyway, Jonathan Jr. couldn't wait for the upcoming week.  I was going to take him to my baseball practice.  He had shown my coach what he could do and he was wowed by both of us.  Jonathan Jr. because he was such a great player, and me because he had no idea himself how to create a robot.  My coach let Jonathan Jr. on the team which was really cool!  My parents were really proud of me for being so independent.  They weren't so happy about having to take care of him though.  But when I told them that he doesn't eat or doesn't need anything we need they felt relieved.  I think that the best part about Jonathan Jr. is that he can play video games and he can go swimming.  He is really fun to be around.  The only thing I don't like about Jonathan Jr. is that he     ( like any other kid) he always wants to be first. Also, because he is a computer himself he is really good at video games and always beats me.  The only things that I really can't do with Jonathan Jr. is (a) I can't go to school with him  (b) we can't wrestle each other because he is too strong (c) Because he is a robot he can't drive so we can't ride dirt bikes together like me and a real brother could.                   I'm really happy that I created Jonathan Jr.  It's been almost 15 years that he has been with us and I don't regret any day.  I still hang around with my Brother Bot I see him all the time, probably because he lives with me and my family.  Jonathan Jr. doesn't grow up like I do so sometimes he wants do do some kid game that I'm not in the mood for.  my Brother Bot has made me who I am.

In the procces of creating them the scientists were all killed in a lab explosion. The robots ran away, they hid in the darkness among the hidden. They suprisingly formed a bond. When they came out of hiding they were shocked everybody liked them. Except the government they took them into custody to expeirement on them. They were furious, they escaped they talked to eachother.'lets make them pay.' said Mister Carl. Misses carl just wanted to leave and try to find a home elsewhere. But Mister Carl already was terrorizing the city. Together they rained fire on the city. Obviously the military was no match. They were super robots,Then on the run they left earth finding life elswhere.       Mister Carl now lives in the milky way galaxy. Living a very happy life. Misses Carl was killed on the travel there. Mister Carlis the evil master and is secret attacking alien forces attempting to destroy earth. Taking orders from the President of the World. They talk secretly. On earth the year is 2015 the world is in chaos. Mister Carl is secretly Planning on destroying it.   'Mister President I have a change in heart, I am joining forces with the aliens to destroy earth.' says Mister Carl in an evil voice. And I have no one to stop me with Misses Carl gone.       The final attack was ready With all military forces on standby. The final battle was about to happen. As the two forces collided The world was in terror. The world had won it was only a small force of aliens controling The small island of Borneo. Planning there final attack. In the World HQ of Alaska they had there attack ready to go. They fought for months honorably. With fina strike almost over the aliens only had a hanful of people left.       The world army just kept fighting even though they knew there wa no world left. With Mister Carl confronted by The President, the leaders would fight. 'Hello Carl your army has fought valiently.' said the president. with a ambush carl was surrounded. Shot plenty amounts of time before falling to the ground. 'We have won' yelled the president. Followed by a loud uproar.       A few months later the world was free of slavery with only 1 million people left they had to start a new civilaztion from scratch. With a loud clang Mister Carl was hung in the air             	NNP NNP NNP NN VBZ CD NNS VBP VBG TO VB CD JJ NNP NNP PRP$ NNS VBP NNP NNP DT NNS IN VBG PRP DT NNS VBD DT VBN IN DT NN NNP NNP NNS VBD RB , PRP VBD IN DT NN IN DT NNP NNP RB VBN DT NNP NNP PRP VBD RP IN NN PRP VBD VBN NN VBD NNP NNP DT NN PRP VBD PRP IN NN TO VB IN NNP NNP VBD JJ , PRP VBD PRP VBD TO NNS VB PRP NNP POS VBD NNP NNP NNP NN RB VBD TO VB CC NN TO VB DT NN NNP CC NNP NNP RB VBD VBG DT NNP NNP PRP VBD NN IN DT NNP NNP DT JJ VBD DT NNP NNP VBD JJ NNS , NNP IN DT NN PRP VBD JJ NN NN NNP NNP NNP RB VBZ IN DT NN NN NNP NNP DT RB JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD VBN IN DT NN NNP NNP NNP DT NN NN CC VBZ VBN VBG NN NNS VBG TO VB NNP NNP NNS IN DT NNP IN DT NNP NNP VBP NNP NNP NN DT NN VBZ CD DT NN VBZ IN NNP NNP NNP VBZ RB VBG IN VBG NNP NNP NNP NNP VBP DT NN IN NN , PRP VBP VBG NNS IN DT NNS TO VB NNP POS VBZ NNP NNP IN DT JJ NNP CC PRP VBP DT PRP TO VB PRP IN NNS NNP NNP NNP JJ NN VBD JJ IN DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNP JJ NN VBD IN TO NNP NNP DT CD NNS VBD DT NN VBD IN NNP NNP NN VBD VBN PRP VBD RB DT JJ NN IN NNS VBG DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP RB JJ NNP NNP DT NNP NNP IN NNP PRP VBD RB VBP RB TO NNP NNP VBD IN NNS NNP NNP NN IN RB IN DT NNS RB VBD DT JJ IN NNS NNP NNP NN NN RB VBD VBG RB IN PRP VBD RB NN DT NN NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD IN DT NNP , DT NNS MD NNP NNP NNP PRP$ NN VBZ VBN NNP POS VBD DT NNP IN DT JJ NN VBD NNP NNP NN VBZ IN NN IN VBG TO DT NNP NNP VBP VBN '' VBN DT NNP NNP IN DT NN NNP DT JJ NNS JJ DT NN VBD JJ IN NN IN RB CD CD NNS VBN PRP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP DT NN NN NNP NNP VBD JJ IN DT NN	1		20131024131014	2348	1		20131024131018	2351	1		20131025161057	2328	3

You will be very intrested in my story becauseits fun.Ok now im going to tell you the stoy but first I have to tell you that his name is Joshua.One evening when I was at the park I suggested I would like to build a robot.When I got home I looked up ''Robots for sale.com''.   Once I found the one I whanted I bought it.When it arrived at my houseI started to build him.It was 12:00 so I went to bed.     In one hour I heard a ''Bang'' I had no clue what it was next thing you know a live robot like human is standing infront of you.It was amasing to see him standing in front of me.The next day I got up and woke him up but first I desied to name him Joushua.After two fun weeks I had to give him away and I have never seen him again sine then.

Izzy and her mom lived in New York, New York.Her mo had always liked the city and she found a good job as a helicopter pilot. I know not a normal job for a mom but she is the best mom!          Izzy's mom was tired of seeing her daughter like this so she got her a robot one month before Izzy's birthday.It was just like a person but it looked like a robot.The robot would learn as it saw things.          Izzy was very happy about the robot. She decided to name he robot Frank.Frank was a shiny silver with sparkling beautiful gold eyes.          Izzy guessed it was an Agribot (a robot that picks fruit) but her mom told her no.Izzy tried every kind of robot she could think of: Gemini-Scout, Dante 2 ad even Mr. Gower but her mom told her no. Finally Izzy said ' Well... what kind of robot is it?' Izzy's mom replied ' It is a little different tan all of those. It is a little like the robot in 'I Robot.'          Izzy did not really care about what kind of robot it was. She was just glad to have a friend.          Frank and Izzy went everywhere together: Statue of Liberty , Empire State building and even on a few boat rides. When it was time to come home Izzy put Frank in his corner of the room and tuned him off so he could charge.          Izzy had just drifted off to sleep when she heard the click of  Frank being turned on.Izzy turned over and looked at Frank.He had turned on by himself. ' Oh my gosh!' Izzy thought ' Frank is alive!!' He was staring at her intently and his beautiful gold eyes had turned to a monstrous red.          Frank lost it when he seen Izzy look at him.Frank started acting like a crazy wild animal.He was throwing things and screaming at the top of his lungs.He would not calm down.          Izzy's mom called the police, then turned to Izzy and said: ' They will be here as fast as they can.'          Izzy still tried to calm Frank down but he just kept screaming. Izzy swore her head would explode soon. It sounded like nails on a chalk board.After a minute that seemed like a lifetime the police came.          The police had to throw ropes around Frank and take him apart one limb at a time. Izzy was devastated.She had to loose one of her dearest friends. Right before her  Birthday too.          Izzy's mom felt bad for Izzy so she went and bought her a B-day gift. Izzy was at the breakfast table eating her Birthday breakfast when her mom burst through the door with a brand new robot in front of her. ' HAPPY BIRTHDAY IZZY!!! her mom yelled.          The robot's head turned toward her.Its ice blue eyes seemed to bore right through her. The robot said: ' Happy Birthday Izzy.'

He was so amazed that this robot could actually climb in to volcanoes and collect information for scientists. It's eight metal spiderlike legs glistened in the sunlight. George wondered if he could ever build something as amazing as Dante 1.   Just then, Dante 1 started buzzing and flashing his bright red lights. Was something wrong? He called over to a worker at the museum, 'Excuse me sir, the Dante 1 is making weird sounds and it looks like something is wrong with it.'   'Oh my!' squealed the museum worker, 'What is happening?!' He ran away to get someone to fix it. But as George waited, Dante 1 broke the glass case it was in and walked out of the museum! George ran after it.   'Hey! Dante 1! Get back here!' It was desroying everything from breaking windows to throwing trash cans. George couldn't do anything to stop it, so he whipped out his phone and called 911.   '911 what is your emergency?' the receptionist asked.   'There is a robot on the loose, his name is Dante 1, help!' George cried.   'Young man, 911 is not for prank calls, do not call here again!' said the receptionist angerly and she hung up the phone.   Since the authorities weren't going to help, he knew he had to stop the Dante 1 on his own. He bought a hammer from a local department store and chased after Dante 1.   George charged at Dante 1 and smashed it as hard as he could with the hammer. Dante 1 stopped buzzing and flashing and fell to the ground with a crash.   The museum workers thanked George for detroying Dante 1, and they even built a new robot to replace it called the Dante 2!

He loved to go to those nerdy conventions that play like star wars, and others. When he was young he just knew that he wanted to be a mechanic that designs robots. He loved robots as a kid. So he decided that, he was going to design a robot right there and then.                                                                                                                                         He worked all night, and he worked all day. He wanted to finish a robot so he could have at least one friend. He thought that when he finished it, he would be the coolest kid in school. Finally, he finished it, and he was ecstatic. He brought it to school for show and tell and showed everyone. As he showed them, they all were all like ohhh and ahhhhh. Eventually, he did become the most popular boy in school. He hung out with all the cool kids, sat with them during lunch, and noticed that there was a boy that was all alone just sitting there by himself. So he asked his friend next to him, 'Shouldn't we go sit next to him? I remember how that felt when I was like that.'                   'Na, we should just leave him like that, he deserved to feel bad,' he said. Broseph just hung his head low and didn't bring up that lonely, little boy again.   So, when he got home, he had a little snack and went straight up to his room to hang out with his robot. 'I'm going to call you Darrel,' Broseph said to his robot. After Broseph said that, he thought he saw a glint of light in Darrel's eyes. 'Probably just the light,' he thought. Broseph still had a lot of homework to do, so he finished it and went to take a nap. After he took a nap, he woke up again only to see that Darrel was gone. 'Mom, where's Darrel?' Broseph asked worridley.    'Darrel who? Are you having imaginary friends again?' Broseph's mom said.   'No mom, my robot!'   'Well I haven't seen it since you got home.' And with that, Broseph rushed up to his room and slammed the door shut with a loud bang. Broseph suddenly felt tired so he went to bed and shut his eyes with a single tear drop able to slip past his eyelids.   The next day, he woke up and was late for school. He found out that his mom left him a note that said: Had to go to work early, remember to eat your breakfast, and NO COOKIES!! 'Oh mom,' Broseph sighed. When he went to school he found out that Darrel was at school, sitting in his desk. How did he get there? No one knew.

A shard of rock has fallen and hit Gemini-Scouts power supply, and he is running low on power, and he is a $1,000,000 robot. The company that is looking for the survirers can risk the survivers and Gemini-Scouts life. They have to send something down there to save him.       Mr.Gower may be made for a hospital invirement, he sure is strong. They have equipted him with a hook to be lowered down into the volcano. When he is being lowered however, the rope gets snagged and he plumets the last 20 feet.       When he lands, he's been hurt badly. Lucky, he can still get Gemini-Scout out of there. He gathers Gemini-Scouts parts and puts them in a bag, and grabbed Gemini-Scout and radioed to be pulled up.   He needed to get out of there quickly because Gemini-Scout has a cooling fan that needs to be on to cool his processor or the $75,000 processor. Since Mr.Gower is a hospital robot, who is in air-conditioning most of the time, grabs out his fan and puts it in to addition with Gemini-Scout's fan.   Gemini-Scout starts to run a boot-up program. Now that he's not dead, he could still hurt himself by falling from his arms.       When they finally get them both to the surface, they have an enginneer team for both robots. Mr.Gower took some damage from the fall but he is ok now.       While Gemini-Scout is not doing as good. The operation to fix him will be $500,000. Thats half his cost! But its worth it to fix Gemini-Scout.

I get up eat my breakfast and it's off to the shoppe where I am a janitor for a major robot convention.  Everybody had been making fun of me for being to second most ignerent person in the building next to Nervous Nelly.        I come home and the used to be dirty old appartment is clean!  I look all around for an explination and I hear strange noises comming from my room and it was the robot that came alive and cleaned my house.  So I went to the convention and showed off my new house cleaning robot.

We decided to take s shorter route back to the car after we ran two miles. then my dad found a spider-looking robot.       'What's that?' my Dad asked.   'I don't know' I told my dad  picking it up, ' It seems broken.'       We all looked around to find the owner, but no one was there.My mom had a confused look on her face, but my Dad stayed calm.       'Let's take it home,' said my Dad, putting it in his backpack 'maybe we can fix it.'        So the next day, my Dad woke me up early to fix the robot. My Dad had already set all  the tools on the kitchen table. He seemed excited fixing the robot.       'Do you even know how to fix a robot?' I asked 'It seems like a waste of our time, don't you think?'   'Trust me, I took an engineer class.' my dad said proudly          After five hours of me helping my dad handing him the tools and fixing the robot, it was finally finished. It looked brand new and very shine. So, my Dad decided to take it to the Golden park and try it. golden park seemed safer than our backyard because our house is still being renovated.        When we got there somebody seemed to lost, so m Dad help him while my Mom and I stayed in the car. The guy was freaking out! Then, my Dad called us outside. So, my Mom and i slowly went outside towards them with the robot still in my hand. Once he saw the robot, he gasp.   'Is that my robot!' the guy said wit his eyes wide open.   'Your robot?' I said, 'This is your robot? We found it on the ground in the middle of the track.' I said   'Yes! Thank you so much!' said the guy trying to grab the robot.   I still held it like it was mine. I wanted to keep it and play with it.I wanted to show my friends at school   'Honey, it was his robot, now give it back.' said my Dad as he took it away from me slowly, 'Can we at least try it out, together?'   'Sure,' said the guy as he was putting it on the ground 'but I don't think it would work.'           He grabbed a remote out of his pocket and pressed the button. Then, BAM!!! It came alive. It was Walking very fast, and it even talked a little bit.       'WOW!' I said amazed 'Thats awesome!'   ' Here kid, keep it.' He said ' you worked hard for it'    We were all very happy as we walked to car. I was so excited to show my friends.    And that was my weirdest Friday                	JJ NNP VBD DT JJS NN IN PRP$ NN WRB PRP WRB VBG IN PRP$ NNS IN NNP NNP NNP VBD TO VB NNS JJR NN RB TO DT NN IN PRP VBD CD NNP RB PRP$ NN VBD DT JJ NNP JJ POS DT .

'Dont talk or you will fail, and this time you wont get a second chance'. Janie immidetly piped down and started working. Later on in class Kim passed a note to Janie, the note said, 'Do you hear that stange noise?'. Janie nodded and passed the note to Marshell. Marshell went up to the teacher and told him about the problem in the closet. The teacher told the class that all he had in there was a robot that he got last year for Christmas. Mr. Tomson creeped up to the door and opened it, BAM! The robot comes flying out and hits the wall. Everyone was in shock, terrified in so many diffrent ways. The robot started climbing up the wall and a kid named Tarence threw his lunch at the robot and hit him right on the spot. The robot fell down and broke into tiny pieces. After that the kids crowded up to look at the robots broken body. Marshell spit on the robot and kicked it at least fifty times, that way we knew it was dead for good. That class never welcomed another robot in their class ever again. They would never forget that day and neither did the teacher and they never trusted another robot, ever.

One day I was cleaning my room and then I found alot of scap metal, so I decided to make somthing out of it. The pieces I had were all shapes. I had a circle, 4 long rectangles , 2 little sqares, 1 small triangle, and an octogon first I got some glue and put the circle on top for the head. Then got the 2 long rectangles for the arms, after that i got the other 2 long rectangles for the legs, then got the 2 little sqares fo the eyes, after that glued the 1 little triangle for the nose . finally glued on the octogon for the mouth. So after I built it I took it outside then BOOM!! a clash of thunder hits the robot and all I see is smoke but.... i couldent belive my eyes the robot WAS MOVING!!!!! IT SAID Hello human are you my master?? I was like um.. i guess so then he said ok well may i ask what your name is? i said my name is Bailey.  So then I asked him would you like a name? i thought for a second and came up with a name his name is Ralph. So we decided to go camping Oh by the way he LOVED his name. So ralph and I went on our journey to Big Bear. When we first got there we went to our cabin and there was A BEAR in there! he was in Ralph's face AND ATE HIM!!!! I cried and cried for days then i fogot about him when I got a dog. The End.

When I saw up close, I saw that it was a robot trying to get out of the rock. After it crawled out with trouble, I saw it and it was a small robot. It was about two feet tall and his eyes were a reddish color.   Before I could run to get someone, the robot jumped on me and started to play with my hair. After he was done with that I took him to my house and my parents, 'asked where did that robot came from?' So I told them, 'I didn't know but I wanted to keep it.' After one week of test to see if I was able to take care of him they gave me permission to keep him but I couldn't take him out of my room. At first it all went fine until the third week. Everyday he would make mess in my room and my was always got mad.   This was the story of my experience with a robot that I got to keep.

Mr. Gower works in hospitals to bring meds. to people how need them and help nurses and doctors. The fourth robot are Agribots. Agribots pick berries and apples. They also know the berries are ripe.       Robots that Play Well With Others by Kascha Semonovitch   This story is about robots that can play well with other people. It all started with the movie called 'I Robot'. Now people started to make robots that can play like animals or with animals.Or robots that can sing, dance, and play music.The movie makers made some robotic apes and dinosours. Then some can be robot pets and act like real pets.       When the Car Is the Driver   by Steve Henn   This story takes place in Nevada. Nevada finalized these new cars that can drive themselfes. They will know the speed the traffic is going. They will also know when someone is going to cutt the car off or when to pass a trucker. Now Hawaii, Flordia and Oklahoma are already getting the cars ready. Maybe one day humans shouldn't be allowed to drive anmore.

Ronald Heishmor was a failing student in math and science, but when it came to English, he was a GENIUS!!! Ronald was taking a math test at RoseMour Elementary  while depressed that his family had moved. When he suspected he was failing the test he decides to fill in the rest of the answers guessingly and get the test over with. When Ronald finished first, his teacher was suspicous and made him take it over again. When Ronald got home that afternoon, he was miserable, he hated how he didn't have any friends to hang out with and everyone at school had adapted to calling in 'Mister Failingheishmor'.(Which had made him cry sometimes.)              When he got home he decided to quickly grab a snack and run to his new room before his parents (Lesly, and Robert ) decided to ask him to help out. Ronald ran inside, sprinted for some kind of gummysnack, then went upstairs to his room. He decided he would be the first to find the best hiding spots so that if needed, he could use them. When Ronald opened the door to his room, he sensed something was different and began to inspect his room. When Ronald heard a lound CLAP! under his bed, he crawls under and finds a trap door. Ronald silently prayed that he would find riches, and opened the trap door.              He quickly finds a latter mounted to a wall and climbs down it. When he reached the ground, it was very dark and he needed a flashlight. He didn't have one on him so he pulled out his phone and starts looking around. He soon discovers that this was a secret part of the house and he is probably the only one in the world that knew about it. CLAP! Ronald shrieks as he heard the noise. He found a ledge and began to crawl towards the noise.            When he reached the noise, he found a giant box. When he opened the box he found a robot. Not alive, but he thought he could find a way to power up the interesting robot. Ronald grabbed the box and pulled it back to the little opening by the ladder. When he pulled the heavy little robot up into his room. Ronald herd a 'How are you master?' Coming from the robot. Ronald was afraid and wondered how it had powered up so mysteriously. Ronald walked curiously around the robot and found solar panels in the back of the robot. The robot repeated its question, 'How are you master?' Ronald quickly replied, 'Fine, My name is Ronald Heishmor. Who are you and how did you get here?' The robot said, 'I am H13-Master, I was imprisoned down there until you found me.'             Ronald quickly learns all about H-13Master and realizes that it imprisoned during WWII. Ronald decided to make this robot his friend. 'Master, I was a robot in what you call WWII. I can speak, climb, crawl, walk, store memory, and convert to play mode.' said H13-Master. Ronald couldn't believe it, he was having a conversation with a ROBOT. 'H13-Master, will you be my friend? We will have the most fun ever!' said Ronald.            Ronald and H13-Master went to school together the next day. When everyone saw Ronald with a robot, they went crazy. They all loved H13-Master and everyone wanted to be friends with Ronald. H13-Master couldn't take all of the people so he quickly went home. When Ronald noticed him missing he left school too.          H13-Master told Ronald how he hated pressure and crowds. Ronald decided H13-Master would be his at home friend. H13-Master and Ronald played video games until they got so bored. H13-Master needed a break from it all. Both of them couldnt believe the reality of this.           Ronald decides that H13-Master didn't deserve to be a slave to him. So he told H13-Master that the little robot could make his own desicions.

Just as she had said, my robot I had purchased from a local scientist had risen and was obviously, awake..or, alive. I stood in astonishment, as my once non-living, dysfunctional robot of some sort had now come to be a living object.           'How this could have happened...well, who could know,' proclaimed the scientist I had consumed the robot from as he inspected the new-living creature. 'All I know now is that it is indeed very smart.'           'This thing...smart?' My mother looked as though it was the silliest thing on earth. But, of course it was smart.           'We will have to take it in for some tests to have the final results on its being, or type.' The scientist said. My mother looked worried, but all I could think about was all the cool things I could do with a living robot.                    Following up many weeks of waiting for the results to appear in the mail, that letter finally came. After reading it over and over again trying to make something of all of this, I finally realized what was right in front of me. This robot..wasn't ordinary. And obviously I realized that the moment I saw it living..but, this robot could sing and dance and do all sorts of things. Amazing things.                Weeks after the results came, the robot came back right along too. The scientist drove over to our house and we retrieved my new friend. 'You must take care of it..understand? This robot may be able to amazing things, but you still need to tend to it.' The doctor had told me. I quickly nodded my head in understanding, way too eager to actually understand. And I mean, what was there to understand? It was a robot. It couldn't be that hard to take care of.             In the first week, I discovered many other atonishing things my new pet...or friend...robot, could do. It could play sports. And I mean actually play sports. Not just automatically throw a ball back to me. Like some kind of ball machine. It could hit, and throw, and just everything. Having someone to practice lacrosse was awesome. And yes, he can play lacrosse. Cool right? He could sing and dance, which was great for my little sister because she is always looking for new entertainment.                 I had Greg, I called him, for a total of six months. After those sixth months, there was the phone call. It was the scientist who had once owned the robot. I thought it was just one of his ordinary check up calls to see how the robot was acting and adapting to its surroundings. But, it wasn't. 'We must have the robot back admediately. He is one of the only ones of his kind who can do all of the amazing things he is capable of. He is wanted to go on a world-wide trip, to first visit Hawaii to scout the newly erupted volcanoes. Then, he is wanted in Africa to tend at a hospital in a disaster-struck little town in need. Your robot can do amazing things...and this is the opportunity to take. You up for it?' The scientist told me. I told him yes..it was the best thing for Greg.           Greg's goodbye was the hardest. Apparently admediatly really meant admediately. The day after, Greg was taken away from me. We had a short goodbye, and he seemed almost..sad. Of course my mother was happy. She had said that having Greg in the house was like having a puppy. My mom hates puppies. The scientists had told me that Greg would be coming back. But, by the looks on their faces, I could tell Greg could be gone for years, as to the many capabilities he has. He was my best friend. And I'll never ever forget of him and all the fun times we had.     	JJ POS JJ .

Robots:       Gemini-Scout:Works as a miner,collects information,helps people that are trapped in mines and that need help.For Example Gemini-Scout when collecting information it tests the air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe.Also Gemini-Scout has a thermal camera that uses heat sensors to find living things if trapped.If Gemini-Scout finds a trapped person in the mines(caves) it will use the two-way radio to talk to the rescue team.All I can say is that this robot was built to be an easy useat the same video game controls are the same for using this robot. Dante 2:Is a very interesting robot that has an iteresting job-so far all I know about Dante 2 is that this robot can climb into volcanoes to gather some information for scientists.This robot has eiqqht leqs just like a spider and that allows it to climb up and down.Since this robot was built to climb up volcanoes and go down to gather information this robot was built to survive very hot  heat,when volcano is really dangerous to scientists to go down their they send Dante 2.This robot looks for holes,or vents in the crater.Then the robot collects information from the gases that come out of the vents.Okayy now all i have to say is that this robot is awsome for its job. Mr.grower:is a robot that works at a hospital that helps doctors and nurses delivering medicines.This robot can go up and down the elavator,it can speak to comunicate with others and is shaped like a cabinet.

How do they opperate theme? if you are also thinking this read throw my passage                why am i asking these questions?I am asking this because i wonder how do they do this stuff? And why do we have to wait tell the futer to to get this experance? I think we have to wait tell the futer to proced this exspierinc is because if it were to happen right now it would be an unusalle expierianc because you dont see those kind of things every day. Do you think so too?          How would you opperate a robot in the futer? I think they would run by what you tell theme to do not by a remote like they are useing now.I think they will talk back to you like in movie. Not only help you around your house but mabey help people in need like docters or teachers. I really do hope that they will get robots up and ready by the time i grow up.                I think they would make robots not useing gases because it would pulot the air. I think they will run on elictrisedy so they dont do as much harm to the earth.I would hope that they wont do any harm to the earth because i want my kids to have a nice place to live in. Not only that but so they world can be a better place for everyone.               Now you see why i think robots would be cool to have. Not just for me but other adults too. And people in needs.

Here are just a few that might be more common in the future.                       One robot is the Gemini-Scout. The Gemini-Scout does many things, but mostly it saves lives. It is a remote controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under the ground. Here is and example for how you might use the Gemini-Scout. If there was a big explosion in the mines and there were people that were stuck in there for days they would need food water and other sources to survive there until they were saved. This is where the Gemini-Scout comes in handy. The Gemini-Scout can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and can even roll through water. It would look for the people stuck and carry food, water, and other supplies to them. But most of all it can drag hurt people to safety. It can test air for gases and tell miners when the air is safe. The Gemini-Scout can save many lives.                        Here is another example of how you can use a robot. The Agribot can pick fruit. It takes months for farmers to pick fruit but the Agribot can make this happen in half that time. Since it can work days and night it can twice as many fruit. Also, there is a robot that can save lives and help with time too! This robot is Mr. Gower. Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals. This robot is a cabinet on wheels, it stores medicine and takes it to the doctors, and nurses when needed. This robot can help save lives, and time. For example, if someone is badly hurt and needed to be treated right away, the doctors wouldn't have time to go get supplies. Since they have Mr.Gower they can start working immediately, which can possibly save a life.                          Robots are not only used for jobs they are also used for entertainment. The I-Pet Companion is a robot that lets people play with kittens from a distance. You can play with the kitten by pulling string so the kittens will jumps to it. It would be like a computer game with kittens. This would be very helpful for people that are allergic to kittens, or have a certain disability which doesn't allow them to play with a kitten.                           Another entertaining robot is the ones you might see on television. You might not know it but there are many robot animals on television. Since dinosaurs and giant apes don't exist they use robots to play there part instead. Most common people that use this are movie-makers. For example, the movie Jurassic Park uses hundreds of robots since the movie is about dinosaurs. Also, there are lifelike pets that are robots. One of them has fur so u can pet it and it will feel just like the real thing. You can also teach it tricks! The only difference is that you don't have to let them outside or feed them! This would also be very good for people that are allergic to pets and, if parents don't there child is responsible enough to have a pet that needs to be feed, walked, let outside and much more stuff. This will help many families that aren't fortunate enough to have a real pet.                          Finally, there is the robotic car. The Google Car is one step forward to the technology of the future. It can drive while you are eating, talking, getting ready, and a big one is texting. Texting is a big problem for teenagers. Many wrecks are caused by phones. If you don't have to have you eyes on the road it wont be a problem. This car is also amazing in many ways. It can speed up or slow down if there is traffic, or a sharp turn. It is a lot like a person driving, but better. It can see above cars and many places that you wouldn't be able to. Hopefully the car of out future is on the way!

One day as I came home from school I saw a robot in a ally and there was no one there. So I picked it up and took it to my house and was working on it. It was all beat up and it had some pieces broken and lost. So I had a journal I wrote down what I thought the parts looked like and I went looking for them i did not find all the parts but I did find some.I showed my parents and they helped me look for more parts but we did not find some. So the next day I got screws and made the parts then when I was done then I turned the robot on and it was talking,writing,and walking i loughed with an exitment.

He was still working on it till last night which he went with my mom to go to a concert in San Diego. I got to stay by myself  isolated in my bed trying to sleep, but all of a sudden I heard a booming sound, I jumped up. I got a broom and went down stair carefully......... something stood up it was the robot of dad's.''AAAAA'', I screamed. After awhile, a started to play with Mr. Gower, I have experience that he was a interesting robot. He could steer, bring stuff to me, and talk.

One day qwerty decided to roll in some manure little did he know that manure came from a mutant cow!Qwerty rolled and rolled and his body began to glow a faint greenish color then he began to howl. the qwerty grew and grew and grew until he was a taller than a house. when he tried to bark all that came out was 'I am Qwerty the super dog bow in my glory!' not very  far away a scientist named Yuiop heard the news from his robot,Wayne. Yuiop cried 'I will get that dog if it is the last thing i ever do!'yuiop set out on his journey. since Qwerty was as tall as a house he wasnt that hard to find as soon as yuiop saw him he was in awe. then  he stated 'capture that dog.'Qwerty heard this and licked Yuiop thinking that he was a milk-bone.Yuiop was grossed out the stood still and exclamed 'ewe!'Qwerty's slobber had time to dry and Yuiop was frozen.Qwerty said go qwerty, go qwerty its your birthday we're going to party like its your birthday and did a little victory dance.             the morale of this story is to never challenge a 17-foot tall mutant dog.

There is robots that are supposed to keep us updated on what's going on in the world and what we know and what we don't know. These robots are usually called cellphones or computers and these paticullar machines help parents by keeping the kids away from annoying them during work.                Robots might have a bad affect on us too. They might get us into car accidents or get us of track of homework. Robots can cause cas pollution because of use of gas or oil that they can run on as well. Cellphones can also cost a lot of money when they text message or call. Robots can also  be helpful we weren't able to explore the see if it weren' for robots that are programed to help us explore. Robots take a lot of weight off are back an we would like to thank them.                  Robots are great inventions and all of the scientists that created that invention a progamed metal or plastic figure that move or talk. This figure is a huge change for uss than man made things , but sometimes the harder ways are easer than the easy ways.

There are lots of robots in the world.There is a,Gemini-Scout,a Dante 2,a Mr.Gower,and Agribots.        A Gemini-Scout is a type of robot that goes into mines to find(if there is any)pepole that get traped in there. A Dante 2 is a type of robot that goes into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. A Mr.Gower is a robot that helps docters and nures bring medicine to patients.  Agribots is a robot that picks friut.It picks berries,oranges,grapes,and apples.                           That is all I know about robots     	DT IN NNP .

Toby was an adventerious robot he loved going to different places. Every time he wanted to go to a place he would always get ready. He would alway eat first so he wont get hungry later on.           Toby wanted to go to antartica. So two weeks later he got to antartica. Toby saw lots of animals he didnt even know about. When he went to see a white bear by the water. Toby went so fast he was sliding he couldnt stop so he fell to the water and died.            Six days later the polar bear found toby and took him out. The polar bear took toby to the part the sun would alway hit. So the polar bear left him there for three weeks so he can get dry. Then three wekks later the polar bear went to check if he was dry but toby wasnt there the polar bear looked around and he saw something move. He left to the place he saw something move. The thing that moved was toby the polar bear was so happy to see toby alive. Toby was also happy to see the white bear. Toby and the bear went some where to know each other and lost of things in common. They both became best friends.

All of a sudden the robot came to life. the kid was so happy that he gave the robot a name. The robot spook and the kid yelled out to his mom, and told her everything. And then then robot grew taller and taller. it was about the size of the little kid. the robot said to the mom,that he can help around the house. Now the robot is on the news. everybody is at the toy store buy a robot. But not all robots come to life.       Even the people from out of state come to see it for themselves. the scientist got some so they can fly then to the moon and collect information. Now the town was a big city because the robots built houses and everything. the robots are now helping doctors  give medicine to their patients. And help find people in mines. So the little town was grateful for the toy store opening in their town.

He went to the store to get supplise when he ran into his freind, Noah. Noah asked,'what are you buying','I'm buying supplies to make a robot', replied Bryce. At his home Bryce invited Noah to come over to help him make the robot. When the robot was done, they named it Tom. Tom could only pick up items and move around. One night Bryce left Tom outside and he got struck by thunder. Bryce came outside to see what got hit and when he realized it was Tom he was freaking out. Then Bryce heard a staticky voice,it was Tom.Tom said,'dont cry', and Bryce jumped into a bush. That morning Bryce called Noah and asked hime to come over to see Tom. Noah couldn't come so instead Bryce walked to Noah's house with Tom. The new Tom could speak, play, and carry. Noah was facinated and wanted to paly with Tom and Bryce.The two boys and the robot went to the park to play games. At the park they figured out that tom could run, throw, catch, and dance.                             The boys thought about telling other people about it, but some people they couldn't because they would be jelouse and try to take it them selves. They also couldn't tell Bryce's younger syster, because she would mess with it, and they couldn't tell Noahs older sister, because she would throw it away.One day roomer spread about Tom and at shcool the gang of bad kids came over to Bryce and Noah and said that they were going to steal Tom after school. Luckily Bryce had an older brother that could take out the gang. Bryce said his brother would scare them away, but they still came to get Tom.                          When the gang came Bryces brother was out on the parking lot and Tom was safely inside. Tom was sad and wanted to handle it himself. The robot went outside and told Bryce's brother to go inside.Suddenly a ball was thrown in the air and it hit one of the gang members. The ball came from the robot and everyone was scared. The gang ran away and nobody ever tried to steal Tom again.

Scientist Dr. Strudel is just finishing up a robot he calls S.A.L, S.A.L means Self Automobile Life. His aststant/ intern David Lackaceo at his side scaning the blue prints making sure everything is perfect shape. The robot is done all it has to through is the tests. First,  they tested how go of a climber S.A.L was. Then, they tested if he could swim in the deep and shallow water. They also checked if the robot could drag a dummy person to safety. Also if he could piuck extremly heavey objects. But know it was time for the feal deal.                    One of the scientist got an urgent call with an explosion in a near by mining cave a couple of miles away and they were the nearest place thgat could help. Scientist Dr. Strudel didn't know if he should send S.A,L out or not. David said that they have been through all the tests and pasted them all. They both ageed so they headed out as so as possible. When they arrived they found a small opening wher they could send S.A.L. He was prepared with a thermal camera a two way radio for communication, and some rope. He was off, he traveled through the shrubble of ashs and rocks and came out with over 20 people so close to dieing. The only people missing were the two oldest of them all.S.A.L did end up finding them but they were dead. A funeral was held for them.The two scientist and S.A.L went. From that day on S.A.Lwas famous for his act of acheivment.

We use them to find new things about the earth and outer space and even just to help with simple things. Scientists use robots almost everyday to research new topics. Lets look in closer to find out what kind of robots there are.       Robots can save peoples life and find information scientists need to in order to find new things that could change a lot! One robot that I think is very cool is the Gemini-Scout. This robot does its work underground. They robot goes underground and it makes tight turns, small squeezes, and goes up stairs. they help find trapped miners that are underground. Gemini is small, but it is strong enough to carry a whole person(miners)out of being trapped. These robots are true life savers! Another robot that saves people lives is Mr. Gower. He works at hospital helping nurses and doctors treat their patients. Mr. Gower is like a small cabinet on wheels! Mr. Gower carries the medicine and when the nurses need it, they open it and give the patients their medicine. They also talk like ' Your delivery is here'! Amazing right?                                                                                                                                                             Robots are also fun to play with! One playful robot is the HRP-4c. This robot sings, dances, and even plays music! This would be great if you an only child! It makes being alone... fun! They would have someone to play with. They could dance with robots and sing. Even if you aren't an only child it could be fun. The second robot that is fun is the robots of copies of pets. You can learn how to be responsible and how to take care of pets. This can be fun because its not a real pet so it would be interesting! Robots can be a lot of fun as well as life saving!       They also help scientists learn new things. One robot, the Dante 2, climbs into volcanoes and gathers new information. This robot has 8 legs just like a spider! Scientists use the information they collected to research about the volcano. Who knows what they will find. Also the Dante 2 collects information from looking in vents, holes, or craters. The Dante collects the infromation from the gases that come out the vent. Scientists keep the information safe in their laboratories!!       Over all we learned that robots are not only a futuristic element. We learned that people from our century use them too! Robots are so interesting! I am so glad I gained more knowledge about robots.

The workers in the mines digg all day with little pay. In the ruins of Brazil, South America, it is impossible to find work other than in the mines. Water is scarce on the surface of the world because of dramatic global warming.  The people believe that in their beds at night, they faintly hear the rumbling of a river below the caves of the huge mines.       Day after day, the hundreds of workers march into the elevators with pic-axes resting on their shoulders. They split up in even groups and march simeltainiously to their posts working on the big hole in the center of the main work room. Who knew one normal day in the mines couldchange Pete's life for ever. The ground rumbled tremendously and the men yelled orders to get out of the mines. 30 year old Pete stood whacking away at the walls in the deepest room of the mine with his  close friend Bill. The ground shook the worst in so far down in the ground. They hurried towards the elevator, but before they reached the button, the ceiling collapsed. The breath inside Pete and Bill was pushed out of their limp bodies by mounds of hard rubble and dirt.       The usually stubborn marshall of the mines stood, counting off names of miners. When he reached the names Pete Walton and Bill Weston, no voice echoed into the dusty air. 'Anyone seen Pete and Bill? Anyone?' Everyone looked around cluelessly and shook their heads. No one realized they lay covered in dirt down 50 miles in the Earth. The marshall scurried into his office and pulled open his drawers and through pencils and notices out of the piles, searching for the single thing that could save the two innocent men in his his caves. All of the entrances were blocked by mounds of rocks and brown dirt. only Gemini-Scout could save Pete and Bill. The assistant marshall banged open the door to the cluttered office. 'The people want to know what happened to those people in the mines.'       'They will find out soon enough. Now where is that controller?' Finally, a the marshall lifted out a controller that looked as though a video game would be controlled by it.'       'This is no time for video games! There are workers trapped in your mines. Do something!'       'I am doing something. Hold on.' He pressed a small red button on a dusty computer. The screen clicked on. It showed a small robot less than two feet tall with rough wheels sputter to life. The marshall twisted the joystick and the little robot moved forward towards the elevator blocked by rocks. The little robot lifted each individual rock and put it to the side. The marshall then pushed another button and the little machine pressed the elevator button. He rolled in and pressed 7, the lowest level. It continued picking up rocks and piling them up on the side. Finally, a human foot poked out of the rubble. Gemini-Scout dragged Pete out of the rocks followed by Bill. He tugged them all the way back to the awaiting marshall at the exit of the mines.   'You did it, Marshall! That goodness for the robots!'

Then, one day his parents were leaving to go to a restarant. They left a robot named Albert. When Bobs' parents left Albert did all the chores Bobs' parents told him to do.   Then Albert brought Bob to a carnival and got him all the prizes. Then Albert brought him to the bowling alley and played everyone there and one. After that Albert went to the pet shop and got a robot dog. His name is Sparky.   When they got home Sparky was really angry. He ran all over the place and destroyed everything. Bob and Albert had to catch thedog heran to the backyard, the basement, the bathroom, the living room, the kitchen, the attic, and the bedrooms. Finally, They caught Sparky and brought him back to the pet store.   Whenthey got home they only had five minutes until Bobs' parents.Then Albert cleaned everything up and finished five seconds before his parents arrived.

Lilly always dreamed of her making a robot that would save lives. Lilly called her robot Mr.Gower. Lily wanted her dream come true ,so she started to make one. Everyone made fun of her becuse she was in to science. People thought she could'nt make one. That did'nt stop lilly. She grabbed all of the materials and starded to build. Many thoughts were going through her mind.Yet she thought she could'nt make one. She lept going.         Finally she was finished. It was the most beautiful thing she ever seen. The shiny metal, the beautiful wheels. She loved it.  It could save people. When lilly went to turn the robot on it did'nt work. She was so sad she went in her room and cried.       That night a storm came. The news was on and lilly was sitting there watching. It was thunderstorms and heavy rain. Lilly fell asleep with the tv on. It was pouring outside. suddenly lightning hit the robot. The robot was alive!               When lilly woke up she heard noises in the kichen. she got up and peeked by the corner. There was nothing there. When she turned around it was her robot!! She screamed and hugged it. She was so happy. That day she got outside to go to the hospital. She told them about the robot. The docters saw it and decided to take it. Thanks to lilly she has been saving lives.

At first we were just creating some random things like little cars. Then he said, 'Hey Adrian do you want to build a robot?'. I of course said yes so we built it and we made it perfect we even added wires and added the old battery...what a mistake!             We then later accidently dropped it near the power outlet we heard a loud electric shock.The whole house went black the power went out!We went to turn it on again we heard some metal moving. We quickly turned on the light and saw our robot alive!We nearly died of being so scared and we screamed and ran but the robot was fast and caught us.Colby said, 'Adrian We Are Going To Die!'. I would have laughed the way he had said that but I was afraid it might be true.             The robot played some sports and was good and many other things he had to leave so we said goodbye and only wondered...where did he need to leave to?!

He was almost done with his robot, Excalibur. It would have features such as compartments to hold things, the ability to pick up to about 2000 pounds, and he had a faucet that produced ice cream (low-fat) and much more things.                     It was now 5:00 a.m. Dr. Carter took a deep breath and took of his safety goggles. He looked at Excalibur. He bit his chapped, dry lip. Something was wrong.   Was the ice cream dispenser on the wrong side? No. Was his head on backwards? No. He asked himself every question about it that could be wrong. Then he got it. Excalibur just wasn't alive.                   The Doctor spend days trying new things to make him seem more alive. He made his eyes wider, his mouth smiling and even made his hands set on his hips. Finally he got it! How he could he not have noticed it before? Excalibur needed to to talk!   The doc worked on his voice box for days and eventually after 3 months, it was done.   Excalibur could say over 300 phrases such as, 'Yes.' and 'I love You.' and 'Why?                   Dr. Carter's cousin worked on a farm and he needed help so he brought Excalibur with him. He made it so the robot could pick berries and help identify if they were ripe. ('Agribots') then when the doctor's cousin's kids were bored, he made Excalibur be able to play with them and also their pet cats. ('Robots that play well with others')                    One Summer day, Dr. Carter woke up and didn't see Excalibur in his normal spot next to his bed!   Dr. Carter looked everywhere then eventually went downstairs to find Excalibur making scrambled eggs in the kitchen humming to 'Joy to the World'!   'Excalibur?' Dr. Carter asked hesitantly, his breaths getting shorter.   'Oh hey, Master. Just making some breakfast.' The robot said and flashed the scientist a toothy grin.

They can be used to do many things, such as saving live, collecting information, and go places that are dangerous for human. They can also be used for practical uses such as playing, singing, and helping out .           Robots can be use to save lives. Robots such as the Gemini Scout can be used rescue miners, The Gemni Scout is a small and strong robot that can find traped miners, do tests in the air, and carry water and food. The Gemini Scout is also easy to control because it's control system is similar to video game controlers. Another robot robot that can save lives is Mr. Gower. This robot doesnt save lives directly , but it helps doctors save lives by carrying medicine in its cabinet-like body.             The robot Dante 2 is a robot that can collect information. Dante 2 can climb into dangerous volcanos and collect information. Dante 2 has 8 legs like a spider and can survive intense heat and radiation. Scientist use Dante 2 too go collect info about volcanos so that the scientist can study them safely.               Robots can also be used for practical uses to. The robot HRP-4c can dance and sing. Moviemakers like Steven Speilburg used robots to mimik dinosaurs in Jurrasic Park. The i pet companion robot allows you to play with kitten from far away. Some robots can even plays games by themselves.                Robots can be used to do an array of actions. They can save lives, Collect information, and do practical actions.

But i didn't open it i just ran and took it home. When i got to my room it was taped shut. So then i opened it and it was a baby robot. It was a helping robot. It cleaned my room,vacuum it did everything. But at the end of the day it ran out of battery. So I went to the Box were it came from and i found a special charger. So then i charged it over night and in the morning it was not there so i looked for it . I went down stairs and there it was making me breakfast. I kept it forever and i named it ruby because it could be what every you wanted it to be.

He was really sad until one day a space ship started to come down from outer space. Her name was Eva she was surprised to see somrthing on earth after everyone has been up in space for about seven years. Know one knew why there was no one left on earth. The boy was named Wall-e he had a square stomach and he could smash trash in it and it would turn out to be a square. Eva said 'Hi' to Wall-e and he asked her if she wanted to come into his house. Wall-e's house was a big truck that you get deliveries from. Eva said 'Yes I would love to come in'. Wall-es house had a bunch of stuff that people had left on earth.

There are several active robots around the world that actually walk, role, talk, and find information.In this essay I will tell you about a few of the robots out there.             One robot is Gemini-Scout, Gemini-Scout is a mining robot. Gemini-Scout goes into mines and saves miners who are in trouble. He is a remote control robot who is controlled by a remote that is similar to a video game controller.             Dante-2 is a valcanic exploration robot, he has eight legs like a spider that he uses to climb the steep and hot iinsides of an active valcano. Dante-2 look for vents and holes inside the valcano and studies the gases that come out of the vents. Dante-2 allows scientists to be save in their lab while Dante-2 goes into the valcano.             Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals as a medicine cabinent on wheels. He is programmed to say many different phrases such as 'calling elevator' and 'your delivery is here.' Mr. Gower can do the jobs of a doctor a nurse and a pharmacist without stopping. He rins on batteries that need to be charged for two hours.             Agribots are a type of robot that works on a farm like farmers. Agribots pick and take care of many different types of fruits. Agribots have a special system tells them when the fruit can be picked or when the fruit needs water. It uses a mechanical arm to pick them.             Google has made a car that can drive on its own! No human is required to drive. This car has a $80,000 dollar cone-shaped laser mounted on its roof. There are radars on the front the back nad both of the sides. The car can adjust its speed to help it around different road opstacles.             Now you know that robots do exist and save every day lives. There are many companies developing robots aroud the world.Maybe you will someday operate one of these robots or create one yourself.

He was haveing so much fun! Jimmy thought it would be fun to drive a car so he went to a car sales man and stared driving a red jeep. He was very good at driving. He also didnt text while he was driving so he didnt get in to an car cash. So every one started building robots and they would drive so the roads would be safe beacuse they saved people from car crashes. Jimmy grow up to be a sciene teacher and deied at the age 500 someone shot him when he was by a volcano and he fell in.

But most of them working robots. One cloudy day there was a 14 year old girl named Kendra Mathensan, and she was a very smart girl, but rarley wanted to show it.                          So, in class she would fool around and sometimes sleep when she gets bored enough. But there was one subject she loved, science. It was the only thing she truly payed attention to. So on the cloudy day she was bored out of her mind. Her parents were out on a date she thought ''ewww......''. While she was watching T.V. she got an idea, she thought 'What if I build my own robot.'' She did just, that she was putting the parts together, and programming the robot to talk. It took her a long time, a year to be exact. When she was done making it she named it Emilia.                         Emilia was a female looking robot with glowing yellow eyes and a silver body. She was programmed for fun, she could dance, she could sing, she can ever make jokes! So years later Emilia became a famous robot amoung children and adults!   Kendra was truly proud of herself for creating Emilia Mathensan.

Then he had an idea.Fred had always loved dinosaurs.He thought to himself,'Mabye I'd be happier if I had another companion.'Fred has always been lonely with no friends.He tried Facebook,Omegle,and Zoosk,but none of them worked.Then he was certain,that he wanted a companion.Since he had a compassion for dinosaurs,he wanted a dinosaur.Then he started to build.          After 3 months of hard work,he had finally finished his masterpiece.The dino-bot was complete.He named it ARIA-831,(he programed it as a she). He used ARIA as a car when he needed to get somewhere.They went everywhere together and had fun.Until one day,they were in traffic and ARIA went A.W.O.L on every car she saw in sight.It was a HUGE mess seeing cars toppled over,semis on there side,and everything else you can imagine.Then that's when Fred realized that he couldn't go places with her anymore.Then she went A.W.O.L on everything else she saw.Fred didn't want to do this,but he had no choice.He had to shut her down.Then he was sent to prison for lethal damaging.He had missed ARIA.She was the best thing that happened to him,almost.

Come on, come on we want to give you something we want to give you for your 13th birthday. At that remark i sprung up out of my bed like a rocket. Through my mind i was thinking of all the possibilities. The one gift i had wanted for ever was Playlist Live tickets or even Vidcon tickets. It is a big party almost where you get to meet your favorite YouTuber. my fingers were crossed tight. My eyes were closed even though they didn't havew to be. i put my foot in front of me but unlucky as i am i fell. SPLAT!!!! I didn't waste any time getting up off the floor. I ran for my family room to get the ultimate surprise. When my foot touched the soft, velvety carpet i opened my eyes to see and evelop sitting on the counter. Out loud I said, 'To squee or not to squee. Squeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!' i read the outside of the evelope and it said, To: Renton From: Dad. At the sight of this i started crying out of joy because my father had been stationed in Iraq for over a year and wouldn't be home until my next birthday. I opened my the evelope slowly so i wouldn't rip it. My eyes were closed tight. i put my hand in and pulled out a peice of paper, shaking like an earthquake i opened it. My heart dropped it wasnt tickets to the places but, has i started reading the note my heart went straight up to my chest again.           It read:                Dear Renton,                  I am very sorry i can't be home for you very important 13th birthday. i had sent you a present. it hope you like it. i don't have much time to write this but Happy Birthday!                                                 From, Dad                                        My mom pionted to the closet. I knew that was where the present must be hiding. I ripped open the door and saw a... robot. I started jumping up and down. it was in the shape of a cube about as big as my hand. I knew it was a robot because thats what it said on the note left on top of it.                                    Note: This is a robot for Renton. If you are reading this Renton you may have to fix it up to work it.                                     i started working on it right away. By 9:00 pm i had finished. i had added a button to turn it on. I clicked it and nothing happened. I got mad and just went to sleep. BANG! BOOM! POW! I darted from my deep slumber. BEEEEEEP! BOP!  It was coming from my closet. I crept over to look and i found my robot alive but it was in the shape of a dog. I pinched myself to see if i was dreaming i wasnt.                                           One month later...                             I had gotten used to having my weird alive by itself robot in my life. I ahd sent a thank you to my father not sure if he got it though. Life had seem great until July when my robot turned bad. He had wrecked the local park playscape and even my room. I knew there was something wrong so i fixed him up  and he was back to normal.

'Mr. Pines the robot has arrived'. 'Good get him to the service workers'. 'Yes sir'. As the delivery man took the robot to the service workers, he felt the box tug, but he ignored it and thought that it was just the old hospital floor. 'Here you go, your new robot'. 'Thanks, that is the, um... Mr. Gower, right? 'Of course'. The workers got straight to programming the robot, while doing so, they noticed a hazard light blinking red. After a few minor adjustments, it still blinked, so they let it go. The hospital put the robot straight to work, It delivered medicine all over the hospital.                 'Your delivery has arrived'. 'Wow this robot is great tha... Whoa, hey this robot gave me the wrong medication, it could have put the patient into a coma'. 'Do not worry, Mr. Gower knows best'. 'Mr. Pines the robot is acting up I think the robot has to be serviced' said Jack, the docter. 'Alright, alright take him to the service department' 'NO' said Mr. Gower the robot. 'Whoa this thing is crazy' said Jack. Just then the robot started shooting midicine everywhere and some of the medicine that mixed created a deadly toxin that filled the air. Everyone passed out, and they wouldn't wake up. Mr. Gower left, he was headed to the hospitals main control room and put the hospital under lockdown before anyone could get out.                  Now this was a matter of a 456 lives or the entire city. Mr. Gower held a docter hostage, he asked for some men to put together more robots like him or he would wipe out the entire city. The mayor refused, Mr. Gower gave him 48 hours to comply...... or else. The hostage, his name was Dean, He asked the robot 'Why are you doing all of this'. In reply the robot answered ' You foolish humans will destroy this planet, I... I am here to liberate it. Just then Dean saw a button and remembered that it was a qaurantine lockdown that would spread gas to melt the building and everything in it. What would he do,  455 people and his life at stake. SLAM! Dean pressed the button. Quickly a dome covered the hospital and gas spread throughout the dome and hospital. In a matter of minutes the hospital and all in it disinigrated. The city and possibly the world was saved by one quick and hard decision.

Like the Gemini-Scout it is a great way to save peoples life when there under ground and cant get out. other inventions like the Dante 2 can tell you more about volcanos and when they will erup and could save your life. Mr.Gower can give you the right medisen when you need it at a surten time it can be given to you.            Some robots are more helpful that others. Agribots pick fruit for you.You will never eat a bad fruit again. Robots that you children will play with is call I, robot that would be a helpful baby sitter. One day you mite have a metting and it is to late of a notice to call a real baby sitter so just call i, robot. It will play with you tell you will fall down and fall asleep. In conclustion haveing a robot in they house is a great idea.

He played with it every day. I saw him when I went to her house. One day I was over at her house and it was just her, me, and her little brother. He was playing with his robot while we were playing on the Wii. We heard a big thump and a loud scream from upstairs. We ran up up the stairs down the hall and into his room. We opened the door seeing what was going on. There it was but bigger and alive.        We saw her little brother knocked out on the floor. Next thing we know we are shoved in the closet. When we woke up we tried to hear what was going on. But all we heard was silence. we got out knowing that we were not locked in. But when we got out the brother was missing and the robot was gone.        We looked out the window there were the two of them. We were trying to come up with a plan. It took a while but we were going to do it like spys do it. Hide where we walk. Have code signals and other plans we did it all.        When we got to the backyard we hid behind the wall. We listened we heard all but nothing was bad so me and my friend popped out with water guns ready to shoot. There we are shooting water at the robot when her brother says stop. He explained everything. It turned out to be a mistake.         All the robot was doing is celebrating the friendship that they had. We were confused at first but got it later. This day was such madness. Now what do we say when your mom gets home.

Then she heard the noise again but louder.So she woke up and turned on the lights.                                                  ' Hello and good morning'Susan's robot  pet said.                          'Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!'screamed  Susan, 'Your alive and you talk,how are you alive?'                                                                        ' I do not know, but I do know my name is, it is Maria' Maria said.

' Thanks!' , said Susan.So she got dressed and ate breakfast.Then she got her  backpack   and went to school.What  she didn't know was that Maria was in her backpack .At recess she noticed her backpack opened.                                                                                         'Maria!' Susan said                                                                           'Sorry I just wanted to see your classroom and your school.'said Maria.                                                                                                  'Alright just do not let anyone see you. ' said Susan .At lunch time Susan saw Maria in her lunch box.

'Alright I willstay in here until we get home'said Maria.So she did and no one found out about Maria that day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	CD NN NNP VBD PRP VBD DT NN NN IN PRP VBD NNP NNP PRP VBD DT NN RB CC RB PRP VBP RP CC VBD IN DT NNP POS NNP CC JJ JJ POS NN NN NNP NNP .

When he came to life he said, 'My name is Robo' I was so scared at first but then he said, 'I come in peace.' The whole day Robo showed me the things he could do of course he could talk, he could steer, climb walls and stairs, he was is really strong, and carry things it was so cool to have a Robot in my house.        The next day I took Robo to School with me for show in tell my teacher didn't like a Robot in the classroom so I had to take it back home Robo was really sad. After I took Robo home with me my mom saw him hiding in my room she didn't like Robo either so I had to put him in the junk yard, and I could never see him again. When I took Robo to the junk yard he was really sad. The next time I saw Robo was not good it was really bad.                                                                   When I saw Robo next he was angry he started to take over other robots and made them like him he told them that we hated them and we are better then they are, then he said, 'we should rule this world.' After that they started to take over all the robots then the state then the country then the world. The army couldn't stop them they were to powerful. All the armies in the world couldn't stop them they still were to powerful. There was two things we could do we could hide, or I could try to stop Robo and his army. I was the only one who new his weakness.                                                                                                    His weakness was that he knew that I loved him but he got mad because I was the only one who loved him, also he was mad because I had to but him in the junk yard. If I could get mom to let me keep him then I might be able to reason with him. So I set off out of hiding to stop this war vs. robots. It was a long walk to get to him but I did. When I got to him he had guards they took me but he told them to stop. I told him that he could come home and stay with me. He thought about it and said, 'yes' after that the war was over and I was a hero and Robo lives with me now.

Now, I will tell you what happened to the most advanced beings in the universe.         Two millennia ago, in an alternate Earth on the other side of a star, known as your Sun, there was a planet known as the Junk World. It was a vast, barren world filled with the trash of every alien dynasty from around the galaxy.The ruling race, the Lionras, were very advanced in their technology. They had invented a bionic robot, that would clean their planet and save them from the atomic waste consuming the planet. It was known as the Tri-Absorber.         The problem was, the Tri-Absorber had no energy source. Then a freak energy storm came. It destroyed the laboratory, and the Tri-Absorber was struck by a type of lightning known as the Infinity Bolt. It was an infinite power only known to us Watchers. Amazingly, it provided the robot with the power source it desperately needed.        When the storm left, the robot was already doing its job. After seven years, it finished its duty, yet continued to serve the Lionras. It served them dutifully for 1 milennia.            When their dynasty ended, the robot rested at the heart of the Junk World, and fell into myth and legend. To this day the planet's name was changed to the Infinity Planet.

It was a robot pet. My mom always told me no live dogs in the house so this wasn't live it just look like a real dog. So I asked my mom if i could get that and she said as long as its not real billy you can have it. So I jumped up and down and thanked her like 1000 times. So we got it and I though I should name it so me and my dad opened it up and I named him golden. I don't know why I did it's the first thing that popped into my mind so I thanked my dad and he left then I went into the kitchen to get a snack then I come back and I was shocked and scared I didn't know what to do.     Golden was gone so I put my plate of crackers down and was calling his name then I turn around and theirs golden eating my crackers. My fake robot dog is now REAL what's mom and dad going to say I can't take golden back he's my best friend. So I told him to stay and that didn't help much he just followed me. Then I just took him to my room and hid him under my bed with a toy that came in the box also a flat dog bed came in the box to all folded up so that bought me some time to think about what I'm going to do. Then I realized I'm that I could just keep him in my bedroom and sneak him outside to play but I'm going to have to save up some money because golden was very hungry his toy was GONE he ate his toy so I told him to stay and I grabbed my wallet and my bike and went down to bob's pet store.      As soon as I got there I went to dog food it was 20$ so I grabbed it then I went to dog toys I got 10 toys for 10$ then I went to the bath section and got stuff so I could wash golden it was 5$ then the lat thing I needed was a new bed for golden which was 20$ also so I went to the clerk and he said the total was. 55$ and that was all the money that I had so I had no choice I payed him and went back home on my bike and when I got there I went into the kitchen and got a metal bowl and put some dog food in it and went into my bedroom and boom I was frozen.      My mom and dad where standing looking at golden and then at my toys,dog food,bed,shampoo and they said is there something you want to tell us so I told them everything and they said I should have told them and they said something very shocking to me they said I could keep golden and they said he can come out from my bedroom and be and inside outside dog so me and golden and my mom and dad are a big happy family.

Just in time said Strange as he walked to the control panel and the table where the robot was laying started to rise in to a hole in the roof BOOM!! POW!! the lightning sounded again as the robot raised up to the highest it could possible go. Throw the first switch Jim! said Strange ,Jim did as he was told and moved the switch up lightning then hit the robot it eyes glowed for a second or two the flipped back off 'Throw the second one' said Strange once again Jim threw the a switch and this time the robot opened it's eyes and tried to get up sat up on the table and stayed Jim then took the two switches down and the panel that held the robot went down and , once at the ground the robot stood up and slowly opened his mouth and the all of a sudden a bunch of cops came in to the lab and aressted Dr.Strange and beat the robot with some clubs and soon the robot was dismantled and Strange was put in jail.

There is a pet dog named Fred.  The owner of Fred is Sally.  Sams doctor is Jill.         Fred was taught to play ball and fetch.  Sam was trained to talk and push the buttons in elavators.

Ones that are working, helping, and playing.Robots can save lives, analize data, and play like and with animals just like humans do. These mechanical friends are very helpful to us. Such as the patients and nurses at the hospital. Also, they are kind and loving to a child who does not have a pet. That robot that plays with and like an animal, can sooth the jealousy or loneliness of a child not having a furry companion. 	NNP PRP VBP IN NNS VBP IN DT NN . NNP RB .

Well todat is your lucky day, because your going to learn about them. There alot of them that can do diffrent things, for example,       Gemini-Scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it is strong. Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies. It can even drag hurt people to safety.       Wherever it goes, Gemini-Scout collects information. For example, it tests the air for gases and tells miners when the air is safe. The robot also has a thermal camara to help it find miners. A thermal camera uses heat sensors to find living things.                            Is that cool or what theres robots that can be a  babysitter, medician cabnet, a google car, HR-4c, and other things is that cool.   I made up a story about a robot want to here it?...... OK COOL LETS GET STARTED                                                    The Robot That Came Back To Lfe!!           Once there was a little girl named, Julieta she is 9 years old and loves robot and wants to have one but her mom says ever time, ' I herd about them robots, people say there dansoures, and i dont want you to get hert, you here.' In a southern voice i really want one.          The next day there was a robot in the news paper for free, she didnt even ask mom to see if she could have it, but all she did was run the whole way there not nowing were the place is, so she stop looked in the paper its all the way in 'Dallas Texes, and im in Colorado' she said unhappy. So she went to her big sister to she if she can take her there, but i should of known that it wasnt happen' you are a full you think im goning to take you are crazzy moma going to take the car away from me and you now this'.   I gafe her puppy dog face and gess what im going toDallas Texes yyyyyaaaaaaa, a few weeks later i got the robot and took it home and mom started yelling pulling me away from the robot i didnt want to force my self out of her arms because i would get in trouble. The robot started speaking to mom 'hello.... mama.... my.... name... is... ricki......, what... is... your......name..... i....have......not......seen.....you.....in....a.....long.....time......mama.......' said the robot in a crazzy way but trying to say it in like a sentence 'did he just....CCCCCCAAAAAALLLLL MMMMMMEEEEE MMMMMAAAAMMMMAAAA, AM I, am i, am i, DEAD, AAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW.' THEN SHE PASSED OUT THE ROBOT Came and help her in the house. Then a rober came in and beet the robot with a bat, riki was hert bad then they ran.       Riki was deid Julieta cry so hard and screaming at the same time. The nabers heard the screaming and call the cops they came and seen the robot and the mother look deid but mother wasnt, then Julieta crying saying'this was my only robot fot a week, why mom did you just like the gift he could clean do the laundry, it can do any thing you can tell it to do, why mama, why mama, WHY MAMA,WHY MAMA' screaming over her lungs every stop to look at her and every one started to cry as well.       Then they seen the robots hand move the cops got there guns amed it at the robot and gess what riki was alive and the cops said ' is the robot you were crying over' 'YES, YES, ITS RIKI' every one was like what in the world, then every thing was back to normal.           I like but i bet some of you doent but i think some people did, thank you for your time to learn and read stuff about robots and the story about Riki, LOVE  YA have a good rest of the day.

If a worker gets traped the robots goes down to get the person.        the robot Dante 2 was a robot the went into volcanoes to study the volcano. The robot collects data like the gases. It looks at the craters vents. This helps scientists study volcanos more.          The robot Mr. Gower helps people in the hospitals. The robot gets medicine to the people who needs to get it. It can steer to get to the person who needs medicine.  It can also talk to doctors who need help.         The robot Agribots picks fruit for farmers.

They can do alot of thing's that people cant do and they are able to do alot of non-dangerouse stuff when you feel very lazy. As you get harder a more dangerouse stuff to do in your job , a robot will be more help than you risking your life doing the job. And a reason a robot can be very helpful is in rescue situations , if a deadly gas has been released in a area a person would die if he or she tried to save people in that certain area so a robot would be on the rescue because robots dont have organs or lungs or a heart only mechanics so the robot wouldnt pass out and people would be saved.

Next is a ROBOT named Dante 2 this ROBOT can go in the volcano with its' thick metal gaurd to with stand the high temptures it can also go places scientists can not. Mr. Gower helps in hosipitals, he can carry medicine to patients in his large drawers he can also pull 500 lbs. An Agribot is a ROBOT that can pick fruit for farmers when they are ripe.

This was when we finished school and started our summer break.We were already thinking of building some kind of robot, then we decided to make this machine. We chose to name it PenBot. The process of building him was difficult, but we completed it. Sophie and I were so excited to experiment the robot. When we did, it was successful! That night, we told are parents about it. They were very proud. We went to bed and the next morning, we checked out PenBot again. He was gone!!!            First, Sophie looked all over the house with me. There was no trace of him, such as pens or markers. All of a sudden we heard a robotic type of sound, like something was talking. Under my bed, there was PenBot! He sprouted stout legs and wiggly arms! He was alive! Sophie and I screamed at the top of our lungs, and hid outside of my room. We peeked in, and PenBot started to throw large erasers at us. I grabbed a baseball bat and swung it at him. I missed. I tried again, and he lost consciousness. Sophie stomped all over him into powder, and then we threw him into the dumpster. We thought about how that could've happened. Our little project was evil and also gone/dead.             During that night, I couldn't sleep, and I bet Sophie couldn't either. I laid there twisting and turning. Right when I was about to close my eyes, I heard a noise...from the dumpster.

'That will be amzing' said Edwin.'Can we build a robot that does that in our science class? We do have a lot of technology in there' said Ian. 'Thats not a bad idea lets go ask Mrs.Hartz if she will let us, we might even increase our science grades like that  and besides we have science class next and the bell is going to ring any minute now' said Edwin.       The bell rang and the boys went to go ask Mrs.Hartz about the idea.She said thats an amazing idea.She was going to let the boys stay after school and build the robot.'Alright lets build that robot!' said Ian. Edwin went to go get the parts for the robot and Ian started a place to build the robot.       'Now put that piece right here gently.............GENTLY!!' said Edwin in a worried way.'DONT PRESSURE ME! See there I put the piece.Now put in the last piece wich is the micro chip.' said Ian. 'Thats like the brain right?' said Edwin. 'Yes' he said.'There we finished....does it work?' said Ian.The boys waited and waited.Finnaly the robot started moving!'IT WORKS!!!' said Edwin in a excited way.'Alright lets test the robot' said Ian.       'Lets test this robot to grab that little metal piece over there and bring it to us' said Ian.The robot moved all the way to the metal piece, it grabbed it and brought to the boys.'Now lets try voice command, robot stay!' said Edwin loudly.The robot stayed.'Robot move!' said Ian.The robot moved.'This is just amazing' said Edwin.'Lets name it something' said Ian.'What do you want to name it?' said Edwin.The boys thought.'Lets name it Heavy because it can carry heavy stuff' said Ian.'Thats a perfect name' said Edwin.       The boys showed Heavy to Mrs.Hartz.She was amazed by what she was seeing.A perfect strong and small robot.'We can make Heavy as a school helper!' said Edwin.'Thats a perfect idea' said Mrs.Hartz.       A year later Edwin and Ian was famous for building Heavy.They built more Heavys for more schools as a helper and it was one of the best robots people have ever seen.Schools all over the world wanted this robot.This was a huge accomplishment for Ian and Edwin.The boys said this is one step closer to the future of robots.

I knew they were coming but does she really need to yell? I was getting ready to go to the desert of Nevada to explore. My friends Brooke and Joanna heard history about that desert. That's why we're going to find facts about it.        Joanna's mom planned to drop us off at the desert. Of course Brooke dad is gonna come with. Since we do need parent supervision. It was really hot once we got there.  We got all of our tools and supplies we need.         A few hours past and we got to the digging part of our session. 'Joanna! Mary!! DAD!!!' screamed Brooke. 'I think I hit something! Or at least found something!' Her father was digging something metal looking machine.          We all helped pull it out of the ground. It was.... it WAS...  A ROBOT!?!?!? How could there be a robot in the middle of nowhere? We thought it was kind of a sick joke because it looked a little fake and very light.         'Come on guys. Lets go to another area to explore.' said Brooke dad. Our group was once walking away from the 'robot'.  We kept hearing vibration in the background. Brooke turned around and saw the robot come alive! Her father ran back to see if its not dangerous or stuff like that, so we can be safe.            It started providing food and water for Brookes dad.  It said 'Atom' in the back of it.  I don't know why but its a pretty cool name. Brooke was asking her father to see if she can keep it. Since she found it first. 'Totally!! It could be a big help around the house too!!!' Brooke father replied.            He called his wife to tell her everything of what just happened.  Since she was our ride, of course shes gonna be coming here soon. She did agree to keep the robot. She said it will help a LOT with her cooking around the house.            Today was a really productive day. We became explorers today, got a HUGE prize for coming to the desert. Which is the robot. My friends and I planned to come here again in a few weeks. Got to spend time with them, especially with Brooke father!             I do wanna come here again. This time, I wanna bring Atom!                    	NNP NNP NNP . NNP NNS VBP RB .

To let you know, robots do many jobs. They can work at       a hospital and save lives. Robots can even explore places where humans can't. They can assemble electronic gadgets, guide trains       on track , sing, dance, and even play music. Robots can do a lot more things than humans can, more than what we think!       ?   My group (Erik, Jenny, Nick) and I decided to create something amazing, a robot! Today we were gonna start to make our       robot, our creation.???????? We had all the materials and tools to start. We had so much fun making a new 'friend'! Soon the day came, we       finished our robot! So we tried to make it alive, and we kept on trying and trying and trying! But soon ,Erick brought up       an idea, to use electricity! Out of now where the power in the house went out, 10 minutes later the lights cam on, and everybody       left.               The next day, around 11:30, we went to check up on our robot. But when we got there it wasn't there. We look all over, then        we heard a noise, a rusting noise, after being startled, we walked closer to the noise. Then we say something, something metal       moving, it was our robot! We finally did it, we made our robot come to life.  Nick soon went on his computer to check on what       robot we created, and we found out it was a Gemini- Scout. We were so excited, so we called it, Gem, for short.            Gem was a remote-control robot that can do a search and rescue work in mines under ground. He is less than two feet and has       wheels,can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, can even roll through water. Gem  is small, but he is very strong, he can       carry food, water, and other supplies. He can even drag hurt people to safety. Wherever it goes, Gem collects information, for       example he can tall miners when the air is safe. He also has a thermal camera to help it to find miners. When Gem finds the       trapped miners, the minors can use a two-way radio to talk with the rescue team. He was built to be easy to use!                	NNP NNP .

One night he started creating an invention but first he had to draw it out , to write what it was gonna be able to do. So then, one day he found one that could help him his invention was going to be a robot. The robot was gonna a safe to keep his secret stuff in it. Its going to have a shelf that will be able to take off and put on when ever he need it. The robot will also have gajets for when he needs a screw driver or when someones in trouble. The robot will be really kind and will be called Willbert. He got on his invention right when he thought of it. He was gonna need alot of metal , a peace of wood, some rope, some gears, and tools. Robert was up all night working on Willbert. The next day he had finished putting everything that he will need for Willbert and put inside of him. All Robert needed was electicity for Wilbert. So he put him on a metal table raised him to the roof and make it get struck with lighting. He brought it back and uncovered Wilbert. It was finished Wilbert was alive, Robert loved Willbert he loved to play with him and finish projects together. Robert and Wilbert lived happily ever after.

I have had so much fun building it i call it robotron-63,000.  don't you just love the name. i do. It talks and it has the capability of lifting heavy things, talking and playing with real live animals. It took me sometime to put all of it in there but he is cabal of anything so far and if you hang outwith him he's kinda fun. I put him in a room with my cat and he made my cat lose a couple pounds he helped my mother and I carry in stuff we got from the store and he lifted most of them, and there was alot. He's doing a good job with talking so far but he's still having trouble I  have to teach him how to say a couple more things and he will be good. So that was my robot robotron-63,000 WISH US GOOD LUCK 	PRP VBZ NNP NNP POS NNP , RB PRP VBD PRP$ NN PRP VBP VBN VBG IN PRP IN IN CD NNS NNP PRP VBP VBN RB RB VBN NN PRP PRP VBP PRP NNP VBP RB PRP RB VBP DT NNP PRP NNP PRP VBZ CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN NN JJ NNS , VBG CC VBG IN JJ JJ NNP NNP VBD PRP RB TO VB DT IN PRP IN EX CC PRP VBZ JJ IN NN IN RB CC IN PRP VBP IN PRP PRP VBZ NN NNP PRP VBD PRP IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN CC PRP VBD PRP$ NN NN DT NN VBZ PRP VBD PRP$ NN CC PRP VBP IN NN PRP VBD IN DT NN CC PRP VBD JJS IN PRP , CC EX VBD NNP NNP POS VBG DT JJ NN IN VBG RB RB CC PRP VBZ RB VBG NN PRP VBP TO VB PRP WRB TO VB DT NN RBR NNS CC PRP MD VB NNP NNP IN VBD PRP$ NN -NONE- NNP NNP NNP NNP	0		20131024111051	2351	0		20131024111022	2350	0

Charlie was 2 feet and 3 inches. Charlie could speak. Charlie was very very smart. Sometimes we took Charlie to school with us.         Today we didnt take Charlie to school we left her home. When we came back from school Charlie was alive. We were very surprised. Charlie started to mess up things around the house. We couldnt bring her to school because she would get out of my bookbag and start messing things up.          We came from school and the house was messy. Mom made us put Charlie outside. We didnt want her outside so she just went to one of my friends house. It was the weekend and we went to the beach and i took Charlie but i wasnt suposed to.          While we where at the beach i took Charlie out of my beach bag. I turned her off so i can go get in the water and left her on the towel. I was in the water for like 20 minutes. I came back and these boys had her. They didnt want to let her go. I grabbed the remote control and turned her on.          The boys look surprised when she started talking. The begin to pull on her legs. The boys started yelling mean threats at me. Then Charlie woke up and defened bout of us. I took Charlie home safe and sound. Thats all about The robot Charlie.

Rain poured down him. He went over to the shed and started to dig up his prize possession.       'I hate Mondays'David thought.Then a annoying voice came in one ear and out the other as  a short plump old wrinkly lady shouted 'David oh David come out come out where ever you are'.  'what do you want old woman' he snapped. 'Breakfast is ready'the old woman said. David ate and left for school. School flew by that day for David.         When David got home he ate a snack. Then he found a not on the fridge it said, Dear David, I have left you at home by you self for a reason. I must go to California for a couple of weeks so I figured I would give you something to do  so you need to clean the whole house.           By this time it was 8:00 and David was livid it was not his responsibility to clean this random foster parent's home  when she does not even clean her own house. David ran out into the yard and rain rain in his eyes his glasses fogged up. He ran to the shed and grabbed a shovel and went to the center of the yard and began digging.He dug for 5 minutes till he reached a huge box. He picked it up and unlocked the lock and up-rose a robot.           That was the beginning of the end. When the robot awakened he and David took over and became the dictator of every country starting with the United States and ending with Russia.            'Could that happen in real?' life Libby interrupted with her eyes like frisbees.  David the dictator turned and yelled 'It...Already...Has...You...Idiot!

He walked toured it being cautious that nobody was around he knelt down and wiped the dirt of of the front of it. On the front read SQ-34. Little did he know this was the beginning of a adventure.        He got his wagon and lifted the strange object into it. What is it he thought, but while he was lifting the strange object into the wagon he accidentally hit a button. Out of the blue the thing started to move. The boy jumped back and dropped the machine. ' owwwww' the machine said. The machine looked at the boy and in some awkward way the machine looked like a young boy to.         'Hi' the robot said. 'My names Robo'. The boy looked at the thing for a second then said 'my names Leon'. The two stared at each other for a while then Leon picked him up and set him in the wagon. 'Were are we going' said Robo. I'm going to take you home said Leon. 'Where's home'? The robot asked ' about a mile down the rode' said Leon. ' I've never had a home' said Robo ' we'll your going to love this one' said Leon. And they started talking, but little did they know this was going to be the start of a new friendship.

On new years eve of 3015, I was playing around with the robot I'd gotten for Christmas. I named him Daniel, even though my parents insist that it's not a very good name and that I should refer to him by his actual name, which is Zanotron X-90. But I don't like that. Neither does Daniel. But that's not the point. Anyway, we were playing a nice game of Hyper-Chess and I think he was letting me win, because he a robot! He can make thousands of calculations per second that could destroy my king within his first 3 moves!                            Sorry, getting off topic AGAIN. So, we were playing chess and my parents  were watching the Plasma-Ball Drop and I could hear everybody in the background chanting '10...9...8...7...6...5...4...' then Daniel interupted.'They are off by 3.73 seconds,' you see, daniel always makes these random remarks that nobody cares about and this just happens to be one. Sometimes he will say something like 'Did you know we are the 2nd planet from the sun?'and I reply with 'Dan, Everybody know we live on Venus'. But back to the story. In the distance I can hear the rumble of the thunder. I hate rain. But I love snow. So I ask Dan, 'Hey, what are the chances of a snow storm?' He scans the weather radars for about 1.3 seconds and replies with '97.675 percent'.YES, I think.            But then the power goes out and the Hollo-TV goes blank. 'Great.' Says my dad in a sarcastic tone. Dan shuts down. 'We must've got hit by lightning bolt,' says my mom.'I think it just overloaded his circuits honey, he should be Okay by tomorrow.'and then we all head up to bed. When I wake up in the morning I hear the sizzling of bacon and think 'Mom must be up already.' But when I walk downstairs I'm greeted by the voice of a man. A man who looks surprisingly like Dan. Wait, it is Dan. Things just got weird.

There are many diffrent kinds of robots that some people might know about and what they do and some may not know about it and what they do. My first robot is the Gemini-Scout it is an remote control robot that will help minners that are trapped by something. Even though the robot is small it is really strong. Also it can carry food, water, and drag hurt people to saftey. The second robot is the Dante 2 it has a really cool job what it does is it climbs valcanos and colectios information.

This robot was names Albert. He was made by Donald Donohugh, a very poor scientist. The scientist worked in a small lab which was an underground basement. He worked many days on Albert and hasn't slept at all.Since Dr. Donohugh was too sick to keep on making adjustments to Albert, he died ,and Albert was shipped off to Japan where another scientist who was suppose to finish Albert, but he never found him.Albert had spend many days in an airport, but then a little boy was looking at Albert and since that little boy's father is a scientist he asked his father if he could keep him.the boy's name was Kioke. He loved making robots with his dad and Kioke asked,''Can I help you finish Albert, father,'' he said in Japanese. Kioke's father couldn't say no. So when Kioke would come back home after school he would come by his house and go around the beautiful garden his mother  likes to plant and goes into into the basement, carefully walks down the stairs and see his dad getting ready to work on Albert. They re-created Albert in a human robot. They tested him if he was water proof or if he knew any school related subjects.He passed all the tests and he could even speak. Kioke was pleased with his accomplishment and his family celebrated with Albert too with some chocolate chip mint ice cream that Kioke's mother made.

This was one of the greatest inventions of all time,it was capable of doing all sorts things that you wouldn't   imagine it could do. It's creator was named Chester Dub who was very smart but poorly respected. Many said how he was insane to think of making the worlds best robot. Of course trying to discourage him with words wouldn't   do nothing but make him more determine to make his invention.He worked day &amp; night,year by year just to find the right shape of it.Out of what he learned,he soon thought maybe he could bring it to life.Months later he got all his tools and materials then began.            He worked his true best on it as he added different changes on the way it would move. Not many people in the neighborhood   seemed to worry about him since they didn't like him,he didn't come outside as much since he was so busy. Mr.Dub didn't seem   to care either because he was so caught up in working constantly on the robot.He soon decided to get some rest, it wasn't long until   he heard a unique sound from his lab. He got up &amp; went down there to see what happened. When he looked, there was unusual except   one of his glasses that contained a strong energy had broke. Since he was up, he decided working again on the final parts.Soon he finally finished with the robot and started transporting extreme energy to it. Suddenly the robot was alive!       Mr.Dub couldn't believe he actually did it! With excitement, he went out of his house shouting he did the impossible. Everyone   was amazed when they saw the robot who was name Chizo. Nobody knew why he gave such a unique name but they liked it.Chizo   was able to do many helpful tasks such as cleaning,translating,&amp; much more. Mr.Dub felt as if it were his friend, somehow it was able to create a bond with him as well. Chizo made these unique sounds as if it were singing, it had this electronic growl along with a roar that had strong bass.            One day Mr.Dub went to go check up on Chizo, but it was missing. Mr.Dub was worried &amp; concerned on what might happen to his   most unique creation. As he searched through the places, he found Chizo heading towards a power plant. Mr.Dub went for Chizo, but it   was too stubborn. Suddenly there was a huge explosion from great energy. He saw that Chizo was causing massive destruction. With no luck, Chizo didn't survive the disaster but there was always this mysterious electronic sound that swayed through the town that could still be heard today. The robot may be gone, but its' power still exists.

But, now I'm not so sure. It still sings and dances, but at odd times, he'll roll over to me and say something. Once, I went to school, and when I came home, he was taking a cake out of the oven. Weird, right?            Today, I came home from my friend's house and decided to talk to my mother about her birthday present to me.            'Hey, Mom?'            'Yeah?' She was busy making cookies, so when she wasn't looking, I stole some cookie dough.            'I think my singing dancing robot doesn't just singing and dancing anymore.'            'What do you mean? And stop that. The more you do it the less cookies we will have.'            How does she always know? 'I came home from school the other day, and HRP-4c was taking a cake out of the oven.'            'Oh, that's where that came from. You must have been confused when I thanked....'           All of a sudden, we heard something thudding down the stairs. My dad was on a business trip, we didn't have any pets, and HRP-4c was in my room. I think.... I ran over to the stairs, and sure enough, there it was. My birthday robot thudding down the stairs.            'I was just tired of singing and dancing.' it said in its robotic voice. 'I wanted to have some friends, like you.'            Honestly, I felt bad for the little thing. I remembered moving to a new school and not having any friends.            'It's okay. I'll be your friend. And later, we'll invite some of my other frineds over, too.'

So the little boy was just sitting there feeling tired &amp; bored so he got of his chair &amp; went to go look around the building.He did not even ask he could look around he just left the room where his father was working.He was just walking in a narrow hallway when suddenly he came upon this strange room.                                                                                                                         The little boy was curiuos about what was in the room, and of course he was not tall enough to look through the window so he went inside and some really strange thing. Never in his life has he seen a robot before. He was wondering if the robot worked but he did not dare to touch it. But all of a sudden he hears a loud scream. He did not know who that noise was from but he was wondering if it was his father'sm, terrified that he wasn't there in the room or the robots.

Would you run away and hide somewhere safe? Or would you stay and fight the robots then run? This is a story of four kids called Kim, Kendra, Nicole, and Freddy. They live in a city called Atlantis and each one of them has special powers. They are on vacation in Beverly Hills with their dogs Max, Maggie, Muneca, and Biggie. So this is how it all began.               It was an ordinary day and everyone from Beverly Hills was eating breakfast. The four kids'  father, Alfredo, is a scientist and he is working in a experiment on robots so they can come alive to help people in everything.   The mother of the four kids, Ashley, is helping Alfredo develop his latest  invention. But one day the Alfredo put the wrong tool in the robot's system which is going to make the robot evil instead of good. When Alfredo yelled for Ashley to come he had good news to tell her. He with the help of his wife had just finished his latest invention, the robot.                 But when he put the robot to work, it became the opposite of what it was supposed to become.                           	NNP NNP NNP MD PRP VB IN JJ NNS DT IN DT JJ NN JJ . MD PRP VB RP CC VB RB JJ .

But these are not any ordinary cars, these are self-driven cars that have a mind of their own. Their purpose is only to drive their humans wherever they want.       It's been 100 years since a car has crashed. That human was careless, not caring for their car. They didn't charge their robot before they left for  a road trip across the country. But nobody ever makes that mistake anymore.       Most humans didn't want to drive, too  many were getting hurt. The government started to question whether humans should drive anymore... too prone to accidents they said.       The cars now look more like shuttles, shuttles that drive people wherever they want. They have blaring headlights that examine every robot that is in the other lane. They watch out for traffic and tight turns and they know when to slow down.       Robots are now essential to our life. They guide the blind, they assist doctors, and make clean and non-messy pets. They are our future.       When robots started to become a part of our lives humans wondered if they could mess up. But as soon as there was a  first robot surgeon, people no longer questioned the robot race.       Humans no longer consider us as the greatest species, now it is the robots. 	NN , JJ , NN .

Its spider-like legs glistened under the fluorescent lighting. All of a sudden, it's eyes opened! 'That's weird, I don't remember programming it to work all on its own,' said Rory, puzzled.       Much to her surprise the robot appeared to be looking around the room for something. Curious, Rory decided to see just how smart this robot really was, but when the automaton stood up and jumped off the table, Rory started to panic.       'If Mom sees a spider robot running around the house completely out of control, she'll have a cow!' So Rory immediately slammed the door closed with a loud WHAM!       'Is everything OK Rory?' Her mom shouted from downstairs. 'Y-yes, Mom,' she stuttered, 'Everything is fine.' Except it wasn't, the robot had decided that whatever it wanted was not in Rory's hi-tech lab and was heading towards the door!       Rory was surprised by the speed it was progressing, it had already learned more than Rory had programmed it to do, and was learning more every second! Rory decided to just let the robot wander, 'I didn't give it anything to destroy the house with, so it cant do much harm, I'll just carry the remote with me and Mom won't know the difference.'       So Rory snatched the remote off the table and flung open the door. The robot scuttled out, a full 10 paces ahead of her. It didn't even seem to notice the fact that it had just completely trampled Rory's foot. She carefully hopped after the robot down the stairs because she did not want to fall.       The robot was moving so fast that before Rory even got halfway down the stairs, it was out of sight. Rory suddenly remembered her new puppy, Bunny. 'Oh no!' she said, 'Either Mr. Dante won't realize what she is and attack, or Bunny will get scared and run out the doggy door!'       Much to her dismay, Bunny was right at the bottom of the stairs! Mr. Dante had taken notice of the canine and had slowed down and started inching closer to her. But before Rory could get close enough to turn off Mr. Dante he had reached the puppy!       Surprisingly, the robot did not harm Bunny, and she stayed put, not bothering to defend her squeaky toy at all, but pushing it closer to the robot! Mr. Dante took the toy and inserted it in his middle cabinet that Rory had installed, as a way of making him like a moving bedside table.       Rory reached the bottom of the stairs quickly, the pain in her foot having subsided. She was ready at any moment to shut off her creation, but was curious to see what it would do. Bunny began to creep towards Mr. Dante warily still not 100% sure that it wasn't going to harm her.       Abruptly, Bunny sat down on her bottom and begged! Immediately Mr. Dante knew what the puppy wanted. He turned around and said to Rory, 'Your canine would like a walk.' As if on cue, Bunny sprinted into the kitchen and dragged her leash to Rory.       Rory stared open mouthed at Mr. Dante and her puppy. Bunny tossed her leash to Rory. 'Well alright, if you two are so sure about it. Do you want to walk with us Mr. Dante?' said Rory.        Again Mr. Dante turned to Bunny, but this time he made a sound like a bark.  Bunny licked him and sat. Mr. Dante told Rory that when Bunny licked him it meant that she wanted him to come.       'Well alright then!' Rory said, and clipped Bunny's leash onto her collar.

There are robots that sing and dance, robots that play with animals very well robots that never get distracted they don't drink or text technology helps doctors save life's. there is a car that came to life the car was owned by a scientist he did a experiment on the car   and it came alive it would drive all over the town in the night because that the only time he can go out.If the car goes out in the morning people would be freaked out by the robot that can drive its self so the scientist only let him out in the night so he could be a very good driver .There was one day when the doctor let him out and all the people in the town liked him.

This robot tells if the gases in the air are dangerous. the Gemini-Scout is also strong it can drag a person to safety. With its thermal camera it can see if there is any one in danger and if some one is it communicants to a rescue squad to save that persons life.       Another robot called Dante 2 will clime volcanoes and collects information from the volcanoes vents or holes. this helps scientist for a safer way to collect information of volcanoes. Dante 2 is especially good at climbing parts of the volcano that is steep and hard to climb.       Mr. Grower is a medical supply holder that works in hospitals. When doctors don't have the right stuff for a patent then this robot delivers it. This robot also talks and it can steer though a hallway, and uses elevators. This robot also controls it self it takes two hours to charge it battery's and they last for twelve hours.       The last robot i am going to talk about is the Agribots. These pick fruit for farmers they can also tell if its ripe or not. they have a special thing that lets them see if the color on the fruit. In Massachusetts Institute of Technology they fingered out a way to make the Agribots raise their own plants. The pant has a sensor that tells the robot if its to dry then they would have to water it. When they pull the fruit they use a long arm to get the fruit after its ripe.

This robot is reinforced with the lightest metal, and has hydraulics inside his legs to move.                             Next, the robot in action. The robot can pick up sixty times it's own weight. With the hydraulics inside its legs for it's muscle, so it can jump ten stories high. It has ejection system in its arms so it can push and throw cars.                             Finally, how it interacts with others. After using the robot for our uses, but when he has his time away from our uses. He spends his time in the lab working on his upgrades. After he gets his upgrades he recharges and gets some oil so he doesn't rust up and slow down. When he encounters people he is as gentle as a feather, but people don't mind him.                                  Remebering the day i did an outstanding thing, i began to study. He was the best thing we had ever done. We have created the first ever robot.

One day he was playing with it one night when a shoting star passed by and the boy said i wish my robot was  alive so i could play with an actual living thing and tellit all my secrets so it could help me with my life.The next day he started playingwith the robot and the robot said,' lets play something else'. So they started to play hide and seek.When the boy the boy went to hide the robot said,'im going to start counting'.The boy was shocked because he heardthe robot talk again thefirst time he thought it was himself but it turned out it was alive!!!

A few years later on July 18,2025 I had got my income taxes back so I went out and got my robot a friend because it will live forever and I will not.When i got home i gave the robot the other robot I had just bought.But what we had to figure out was how to get it alive so we just sat and waited for a stormy night.After a couple weeks it finally came but the next problem was trying to get the lighting to hit the new robot.My robot and I finally figured it out we took medal wires and put them all over the new robot and it worked!Then we brought the robot back in and waited and waited and waited and waited until one morning it was gone and we knew it had finally came alive.So after a while of the new robot getting used to everthing we all became bestfriends and lived happily ever after!

It was pouring and Turfee's metal layer was exposed. Turfee closed his metal eyelids and accessed his memory card and read through his memories. He was a small robot dog owned by the Cree household, last, they had gone on a family picnic, Turfee was playing with the Cree's young boy, Sam when it happened. It started raining so they started to head back from where they were playing next to a ditch. Sam was playing 'ball' with Turfee so he would toss it and Turfee would fetch it. As it started raining Sam ran back to his family and thought Turfee would follow. As Sam ran the ball slipped out of Sam's left hand and rolled into the ditch. Turfee was programmed to fetch it so Turfee hopped after it. This is where Turfee slipped and fell in to to the deep ditch.            Turfee's virtual processor caught up with what was happening as he tried to stand up. He was on a small ledge on the side of a deep park ditch used to gather water flow. The rain was still pouring down as violently as it possibly could. The water in the bottom of the ditch was rising at a steady rate. The fake fur Turfee's developers had attached to him had fallen off in select places. Turfee thought of everything he could. He looked up and down for a solution. Most humans could easily climb out of the ditch but to a small robot dog, it looked as steep as the walls of the Grand Canyon. Turfee knew he couldn't swim as it would most certainly leak into his electronic insides, so what was Turfee to do!!! At that time a log that had swept down into the ditch floated by, this was Turfee's moment, the moment that would judge if he lived, he jumped, everything seemed to slow down...SPLASH!!!            Turfee landed next to the log sending water splattering everywhere.Turfee spluttered out onto the log, he was okay but he knew some water had leaked in. The rain seemed to get even harder, the only other sound Turfee heard other than the relentless rain was the sound of the rain clanging on his metal layer. Turfee lied down sensing everything as he was slowly getting closer to the top of the perilous ditch as it filled with frosty water. It was now midnight, the moonlight reflecting off of the water that marked his doom. As he got closer to the top, the wind picked up and blew huge gusts of air straight into Turfee's unprotected body. Turfee was never programmed with it but learned with his high-tec what the meaning of fear was, this was it.He was so close to the top he could literally taste salvation. Then came a massive gust of wind, this was too much, the log over-turned and Turfee fell in.            Turfee was swept down with the flow of the water hitting rock and sand. He was pulled around feeling himself break apart. He felt as if he was a mere rag-doll, he swam for his life as he finally broke the surface just to submerge again. The wind blew so hard it started causing waves, Turfee got caught in one sweeping him upwards. He was airborne for a couple seconds before he came crashing down on to hard land. He hit the ground with much velocity. He lied for a minute before standing, he was hurt, very much. Turfee found the place where he had been playing with Sam. He tried hard to remember which direction his master ran to as it started to rain. Then, he heard a noise, no normal noise, but a voice...it was Sam. Turfee ran as fast as his short stubby legs would take him, even with his injuries. He rounded a tree to see one last car parked in the parking lot. He could make out the figures of the Cree family inside, the door opened as Sam yelled out again, 'TURFEEEEEEE!!!!!!' Turfee ran over and surprised Sam. Sam looked surprised to see Turfee in such a state but it didn't matter, Sam took him into the carand hugged him and covered him in a warm blanket. Once again, Turfee's little robot mind, was happy again as they drove home.

It might pick berries,orangies,grapes,or apples. Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all different shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks. Others are able to move around on heir own. In Japan, here is a strawberry picking robot that can scene the color of berries.      This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.           At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [MIT], scientists are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help. They have created a green house full of plants that are cared for by Agricola.           Every plant has sensors that tell the robot the plants needs. If the plant is to dry the robots will know about it.If one of the plants has a ripe fruit or vegetable the agribot will pick it.       Many people think the agribot is different but it's the same thing as a rover but on Earth. Pretty soon agribots will be everywhere.

When you need help on a homework problem don't use they computer ask your robot for the research and you will find the answer to your problem.        Robots are connected to your internet so you don't need to worry about typing anything. All you have to do is to say what you want to type and the robot will directly print it out for you and your ready to go. Many computers don't have wireless internet because they are sometimes really slow so why don't you buy a robot and it will do anything you like. Robots are very useful and if your are writing a story that you need help on just ask your robot and it will answer everything you need.        That's why robots are useful today so go out to stores and go buy yourself a robot and your life will be much easier, but computers are still used today because a lot of people like watching funny movies and shows.

The best part is you dont have to feed them or take them out for a walk.So I had asked my mom to see what she would say and she said okay, but only if you can promise to take care of it so i agreed.                          The next day we went to the store and they had many types of animals that are machanical but i was looking for acertain animal a dog i wanted one since forever so thats the one I choose.It was super cool and realistic but everyone knew it was a mechanical dog because of the way it felt nodog should feel cold and hard on the inside.                     This new animal I have is amazing but after a while it started barking at me like it didnt know me. Then the next thing i knew it felt softer and more and more realistic then it rolled over and barked I guess it wasnted me to rub his stomach so I did.Then later while I was eating fried chicken and rice i seen the box my dog was in, so I read it, it never said the dog would roll over.  Then I notice it was alive I have a living dog just like I dreamed but I don't know how it happen all I know is that my dream has now come true.

No matter how much he tried he couldn't get it to work right. It would turn on but it woulg only stay on for a minute. After many days of trying he   decided to take a break. He took the robot outside and decided to sleep for the night.            That night it a meteor hit close to the scientist's house but all those days up left him deeply asleep. The meteor cracked open and a glowing orb came out of it and was rolling towards the robot which the doctor left outside and wgon the orb entered the robot something amazing happened. The robot turned on and he was like no other robot he looked human. He had emotions, he had strength, and he had brains.         The next morning the scientist woke up with a suprise. He had food on the table but who cooked it? It suprised him when he saw his robot flipping pancakes. The robot greated him and put him in a chair to eat. The scientist was overfilled with joy his invention came to live. The scientist was curious about what had happened.        The robot showed him the meteor and he saw all the blue matter  in the meteor and the scientist was amazed. He didn't care about that he had to work on his studies. they worked three days and nights but a serum spilled on Tim the robot which the scientist named him and he turned off and never  awoke again.       The scientist was sad but he learned to make more and the world became a better place. the world never forgot Tim the robot because he was the first robot to ever really live.

It has fethers with small eyes , theres a male and female the male is called a roster. It has colorful fethers with a red flap of skin hanging from its neak. It has a very nasty look.   When the female lays its eggs they hatch in 15 to 16 days . Also if your on a chiken farm once they come out they get sent off . When the chikens get sent off they die becaues they frease.Its very sad and dilishos . and thats what a chiken is and how they live. 	NNP PRP RB JJ IN DT NN . EX NN IN NNS CC DT JJ NN .

A surprised attack hit them from the right side of the forest.They all came out of nowhere.The troops could not handle it.They tried to give the robot orders but they couldn't,they were all being attacked.The robot was just standing there watching everyone getting hurt,without directions it couldn't do anything,but a Mireielle happened          The robot moved,it had moved without directions,it had come alive.It helped the troops,then it attacked the enemy.The robot dragged all the injured to safety and finished off the battle.It had saved his fellow troops by doing the inpossible.

'We made a time machine and yet we cant make a robot that lives , breaths, thinks, and talks? Wow am I... a bit disappointed.' Andrea then walks into her room, thinking.' The formula was right,' to herself. 'Maybe we should use the time machine formula.   ' She begins to work.       Five hours later, Andrea walks out of the room looking perplexed. 'I got it,' she says to an imaginary crowd. 'I got it.' All she needs to do is plug it in, start it breathing, spark its brain, well, actually a brain made of pulled pork, but anyway, it will work. Andrea is over confident, no what if it doesn't'ts in her head. She plugged it in, 'Oh my gosh' she thinks. 3...2...1... It worked. It is as simple as that.       The robot is as big as a St. Bernard, but looks like a cat. 'Meow?' it asks. 'Meow?' It gets up, purring like mad. Andrea starts to make a skin for it, using an old mountain lion pelt coat to begin. It already fit the Cat-bot, as she called the creature, but it needed to be permanent. A dash of glue here and a stitch or two there, it was on! That was when the Cat-bot saw a bird out the window, and  Andrea blacked out.       When she awoke, she had no clue why she couldn't breathe. Looking on her stomach, she saw why. Baby Cat-bots. How, where, when, and why might be good questions to ask,but she didn't. She said to herself,'Awww, arnet they cute?' And then went on to find out how she blacked out. 'Tail musta hit me' she said with a shrug. 'Where is mommy?' she said in a baby voice. 'Out catching us a birdie to eat.' Said one of the baby's.Andrea just gaped.       'You, you can talk?' She said in an astounded voice. 'Of course we can, silly.' said yet another. 'Wow did I miss a lot in 7th grade health.' Andrea said to herself.       Well how an this go anywhere? Is probably what you're thinking, but it did. The cat-bots grew up, and spontaneously had kids of their own. They went to all kinds of pet shops, hospitals, and even dentists offices. Andrea never shared her secret of how she made them, though. Only cat bots would be robots that could live and breathe. What Andrea didnt know was that if she had gone only one year more, 10,001 years into the future, that she would have seen a cat-bot!!!

T-46 was supposed to help bring the end to electronic collapses. One thing Rover didn't know is that T-46 was already alive. Although it was painful to be tightened and screwed into place he had to pretend to not be alive. T-46 has grown a bond to this human working on him. He had spent many hours in the garage improving T-46, but since T-46 was not moving Rover was getting restless. However Rover kept building on T-46. T-46 could hear a stiffness in his voice when he was mumbling to himself. He could tell rover was depressed. T-46 couldn't bear to see Rover like this, after all Rover has done for him T-46 decided to do something that would change his and Rover's life forever. T-46 decided to move.                      Rover was completely baffled by the movement by T-46 he didn't know what to do. The next thing T-46 saw was Rover running around outside of his garage screaming 'I did it, I did it, I created a robot!' T-46 began to move around to Rover to excite him more. But the thing Rover didn't know was they weren't the only people in the garage.       There were 2 spies hiding behind a filled up trash can getting information on T-46.  Although T-46 was built to bring an end to electronic collapses. He could do much more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Inside Rover figured out just a little bit of what T-46 could do. T-46 sprinted up the was because he was so excited. In fact he could only feel emotions of what Rover was feeling. So he was excited. T-46 could literally bounce off the wall because of his rubber wheels for legs. Also Rover had installed a one digit button code on T-46's right arm to help him speak, and finally on T-46's left arm there was another digit button code that changes his hand into many weapons. Rover didn't intentionally do that but he soon figured out when T-46 blasted his oven into particles.                                                                                                                                                                                   Chapter Two                                                                            Inside the main spy headquarters General Anthony McCullough and General Ethan Klaiss were studying the robot that could change their country's military power the 2 spies checked in. The first spy said 'General McCullough, sir did you see what hat robot just did?' General McCullough just nodded. The General Klaiss ordered, 'bug up the house, put cameras there, we need to get that robot.' The second spy spoke up, 'we will be scorched alive if we try to capture it, he will burn us to death.' General McCullough groaned at the thought, then he said, 'We payed you to take that robot, no matter what the cost.' The first spy just had a thought, 'what if we take the creator instead, then the robot will feel scared and depressed since it has the same feelings.' General Klaiss liked that idea, he nodded and said, 'we will do that, and that plan is effective immediately, boys this could change the world.'                          Rover was just finishing up on T-46's new applience, because he had the same idea as the spies about it being a weapon. Rover was always a greedy man. He always wanted to be in power. He thought 'now that I have Rover i can overthrow the US government!' he was so excited, but T-46 had mind-reading abilities and saw what Rover was planning to do. T-46 thought 'I have to escape.'                                                                 TO BE CONTINUED...

We tran it to use cemicls and used it to help test level of radation in areas.            It will be named CL4TP aka clap trap. It is small but strong. It can cary all the saplis tha the sientests need. It responds to any sientests how tells it to do something. It is practikle invinible but it can get hert by electric pulses.

I wish I could hang out with someone right now. Lily thought. She went downstairs and turned on the TV. She groaned as the history channel popped up. 'Who cares about a bunch of robots? All they are is a wast of time and effort.' said Lily with annoyance in her tone. All I want to do is play make-up with Sophie and Stacy. Lily went up stairs and started to comb her hair. I love having long hair! To bad I don't know how to do cool hair designs.          'Ive got it,' she screamed with excitement,' I'll make a robot that can do my hair!'   How am I supposed to make a robot? She looked around her room. Her eyes caught sight of and old making electricity game she used to play with her brother. She went over to it and open the box. It was filled with battery's and wires and metal. She grabbed the box and ran downstairs. Into the office she went to look for her old paints and paint brushes. It was filled with tons and tons of different beautiful colors. The size of the brushes vary-ed from huge to tiny.        She took the boxes into the kitchen and put all of her supplies on the tile. opening the boxes she separated the shades of colors, sizes of brushes, batteries from wires, and wires from light-bulbs. She took the sheets of metal and began to cut into the shape of a robot. When she created the body she went and grabbed her biggest paint brush and took the prettiest dark purple and painted over the body.         'This is going to be the prettiest robot the world has ever seen!' Lily said out loud.     Then, she took the wires and the batteries and connected them. To see if it work she gently put the metal part of the wire on a lightbuld. The lightbulb instantly lite up making Lily jump. she placed the wires right where they were supposed to go and connected them to the wheels at the bottom of the robot. the arms of the robot were movable so the robot could do someones hair. She made the face all nice and cute. It looks like the robot  from wall-e. She laughed and chuckle at her own little joke and then continued her creation.         The batteries were the placed into the head along with the wires. After connecting the batteries and wires she took the blue little light-bulbs and put them into the eye holes. Inside of the box she found a light switch. she put it on the side of the robot and made all the other cords longer so it could reach it. The robot was beautiful! I cant wait to show mom! She ran downstairs to the office and saw her mom. \          'Mommy! Mommy! look what I made!' Her mother wiped around and smiled with a grin on her face.           'What do you have there?' her mother asked with concern but amusement in her voice.         'I made a robot that can do my hair!'          'Well, lets see if it works!'        Lily placed the robot on the floor as her mom sat next to her. She combed her hair real quick and then turned on the robot. The robots eyes lite up and the arms moved. Her mom jumped as they lite up. The robot rolled its way over to Lily she turned around and it braided her hair!         'The robot works mom!' she said as they both jumped into the air and celebrated.         ' Oh Lily I am so proud of you.' She flicked the switch off and gave Lily a big hug.        'Well, tell me. what are you going to name it?'        'Well I'm not really sure. I think Ill name her... Millie!'         'What a perfect name.' Her mom said.           When they went up stairs they showed her dad as he walked into the house, coming back from work. They all went out to dinner to celebrate the great invention. They even brought Millie with them.        The nexted day Sophie and Stacy came over and she showed them too. They played make-up together and had a great time.

There are robots all over the world doing things from picking berries to traveling deep into volcanoes! Here are some cool things that robots can do.       The robot Gemini-Scout is a life saver. The Gemini-Scout can go into collapsed mines and rescue miners! This specially programed robot uses a thermal camera to find miners. Also when and if it finds survivors it can carry the injured back to the surface. Also it can find out if there are any harmful gases and then he cane tell the miners if it is good or not. Also the Gemini-Scout can go through water. The Gemini-Scout  can carry food and supplies to the survivors. Obviously the Gemini-Scout is a real life saver!       The robot Dante 2 is a robot with a very cool job. This robot goes into or onto volcanoes and it gathers information for scientists. The Dante 2 has spider like legs to help it go up the steep slopes of volcanoes. I think that it would be very cool to be able to go into a volcano. You might think, wouldn't the Dante 2 get burnt? Well, you might think that but is built so that the heat doesn't hurt him! This helps scientist a lot to learn more about volcanoes.       Mr.Gower is a robot that helps in hospitals. This robot helps carry medicine to nurses, doctors, and patients. Mr.Gower looks like a cabinet on wheels. Mr.Gower is very strong so the weight of the medicine isn't a problem to him. The robot can go anywhere in a hospital, including elevators, hallways, and it can push things that are in the way. Mr.Gower can say various phrases like,' Calling elevator' and 'You delivery is here!' Mr.Gower is a big help for the nurses.       You may be thinking, Or they should make a robot that does my chores. If so you are in luck, if you live on a farm with berries, apples, or pears. Now you may be thinking, Well what are you waiting for tell me, tell me! Okay, the robot that can pick berries is called the Agribot. The Agribot is a robot programmed to pick berries. The robot sees if the berry is ripe by looking at the color then if it is then it picks it! The Agribot can come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms and are pulled by trucks, some can move on their own. These robot can change the berry industry. I know this because the scientist are testing to see if the Agribots are able to grow a farm on their own, with no human help! They are programmed to scan the fruit, to see what it needs, then the robot tends to the fruit! It's that simple!       There are so many awesome things that robots can do! There are robots that save peoples lives, some that gather information, some that act like farmers. I believe that robots can become a huge help to people in the future, I mean, just look what they are doing now! They could also make robots that baby sit or some robots that play games like hockey or shuffleboard (they are working on that right now : ) )! I think that we should continue to create robots for today and for the future. 	NNS NNS VBP RB VBN IN NN NN NNS CC VB IN NNP NNP DT JJR . EX VBP NNS DT IN DT NN VBG NNS IN VBG NNS TO VBG VB IN NNS .

It was alive what I had built what Ihade used time to put plugs and other hard to work stuff together.       Well lets back up to the beggining of the week.we as the class of mrs.Lord were asked to build a robot.It was the end of the year and this was by far the hardest thing we had to do all school year.Im pretty shur i was the only one that was looking forward to this project.The teacher had warned us about this at the begging of the school year but as she got moreinto the rules of the project my stumake started to get a little swirly.       Right when i got home i started on the project.I got all the things out of my dads tools and layed them flat on the table.i wasint alone on this project my brother was a master mind at these kind of things so if i needed help with screwing a extra bolt or putting somthing in place he was right down the hall.I think I had about every tool in the state.I new the first thing i needed to do was draw a picture about how I was going to put this together.I ran into a few problems well scetching but i think that was because im just not a very good drawer.When i had got done i took a little brake.i layed a few pluges out and made my scetch a litlle better and i think i stayed up all night working on the robot. I was almost done the next morning and just needed to make shur that it will work for this friday when i give the presintation. I turned my head for about five minutes and looked back and the robot was gone. I looked everywhere and then i found it. I couldent believe my eyes it was playing with my little sister. It was telling jokes to her andf playing tea party.There i was just standing there in complete shock. It was alive what i had built what i had used time to put pluges and other things into place was alive.       Friday hen i brought my robot to school everything whent perfect. It did exactly what i wanted it to do. Everyone was amazed over what i had built. Me and my friends played with it all day. My robot was the only one that actually worked. I got a a plus for my grade and i was so happy. Tell this day that robot is still in my room talking to me and playing with me.

Planes with real working propellers, trains that could travel up and down walls, but his favorite invention was a small metal robot named GLaDoS. He loved to play with GLaDoS. John once took her to the beach to swim, and on that very same day, his mother told him about the underwater city of Atlantis. He was simply fascinated hearing about the city. 'One day,' he said to GLaDoS, 'I'm going to build and underwater city where everyone can live!' And that is exactly what he did. On his 22nd birthday, the beautiful aquatic city of Rapture was unveiled to the whole world. 'Rapture spans the entire Pacific Ocean and can hold up to 5,222,222,222,002 people!' John said at the opening ceremony. And 2 years later, the city had a population of 2,222,222,222,022. After that, John lived a silent life and sometimes pulled out GLaDoS, then he got an idea. 'Wait here GLaDoS!' he exclaimed excitedly, ' Your finally going to come to life!' When John turned 32, he finished his P0RTAL machine. It had the power to bring anything to life, so of course GLaDoS was the first to test it. 'GLaDoS! I have waited may years to do this! Now our dreams will finally come true!' A gentle tear rolled down his cheek. He turned on the machine and a brilliant flash of blue and yellow appeared. 'YES! YES!' He roared. Then suddenly, POP! Everything stopped and out came GLaDoS. Walking on two legs, metal gleaming, her brilliant blue eye sparkling. 'Hello, master. I have waited many years to meet you.' John let another tear roll down. 'Oh please! Call me John.' In the years that followed, he built GLaDoS a husband and named him WALL-E, and he himself got married to a woman named Clementine and had 2 children named Lee and Carley. 'Okay we both know that last part.' said Lee. 'And why did you tell it in third-person?' added Carley. 'I think it sounded quite better than if it had been in first-person point of view.' said GLaDoS, in her same old robotic voice. 'Yes.' agreed WALL-E. 'Thank you. At least someone appreciates my stories.' I thanked. 'Time for dinner!' Clem yelled from the kitchen, 'Pasta and garlic bread!' 'YES!' Carkey and Lee exclaimed gleefully. 'We are also famished.' said WALL-E. 'I've got extra oil and gasoline.' I said. 'That would fill our tanks, yes.' 'It's in the garage.' 'Thank you, John.' added GLaDoS. I nodded and walked into the kitchen.

I took it inside to see if it will work it didn't what it needed was some electricity.A week passed and it still wasn't raining until today i was so happy i was finally going to have a robot friend i put him up on top of the roof and lighting finally struck him i was so happy.When i got him of the roof i took him in my room and guess what it was alive now that he's we can spend all of our time together ,but right when he woke up he started to choke me i was about to die when i took of his arm and started to hit him with his own arm.when he got of of me i started to think what a fool i was for bringing him back alive i should of just let him rot i that trash can.When he got back up we had a battle to the finishit was kinda of a tie we were both knocked out we both got up at the sametime,but at the end the good guy always wins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Now that he is dead i can finally live a normal life.I don't have to deal with any robots any more thats a good thing.And thats how the story goes.

December was coming by rapidly.As Danny walked to school in the snowy air,he saw toy stores filled with astonishing toys.Just when he was about to reached the school area,he saw a toy robot that seemed unusual.It had wheels and was about two feet tall.It looked strong enough to drag people!He wanted to go inside and check the price of the robot,but there was only 2 minutes until school was about to start.Maybe I could check it after school,he thought.Paying attention to the teacher was difficult.Danny daydreamed about the robot during science,math,language arts,and history.He was waiting for the bell to ring when suddenly Tony sneaked up behind him.          'Hey dude!'exclaimed Tony.          'Hey.'replied Danny.          Danny didn't feel like talking to Tony.All he wanted to do was to go see if the robot was still there.          'Um,hey Tony,I have to go now;I have something to do.'          'Do what?'          'Hey look,it's personal business okay?'          'Fine you can go ahead and do whatever you want;I don't care anymore!'          Tony left Danny standing there grimacing.I don't need a friend like that,he thought to himself.By the time he was at the toy store,he was shocked.The price was too much for him to bear.It was $235!He was desperate for that much money.He left without taking a look at the robot.Danny's mom was suspicious.Ever since coming back from school,Danny looked despondent.          'Danny,are you okay?'she asked.          'I'm fine;It's just about the toy I want.'          'Oh Danny you know we do not have very much money;Just paying our apartment and bills is almost not enough.'          'But I could work at some place..like the hardware store or something!'          Danny knew it wasn't worth fighting for.His family would never have that much money.All of a sudden,Danny's older brother,Daniel,came rushing inside the apartment.          'Mom!Danny!'screamed Daniel.          'Oh what is it Daniel?'asked Mom sternly.          'Guess what?I found $1000 dollars on the sidewalk!'          Mom and Danny was surprised.Now Danny could buy the robot!          'Hey Daniel can I borrow $235?'          'What do you need it for?'asked Daniel with sarcasm in his voice.         'Since it's Christmas,I would like to purchase something from the toy store.         Daniel didn't feel like giving away $235.He wanted the money to himself.         'Daniel just give the money to Danny.'         Daniel had to obey Mom.Once the money was in his hands,Danny ran out to the toy store.         'Um, sir I would like to buy that robot over there.'         Danny pointed to the window.The cashier looked at Danny and nodded.Walking back to his home with his new toy was making the children envious.Just when he was about to put the robot on the ground,the robot turned it's head and stared at Danny.Danny was amazed.This robot is alive.He took it home and showed it to his mom and brother.They were astonished too.Cool was the word Daniel used for it.The robot could clean the house,help with homework,and talk.As years flew by,the robot started to break slowly.Danny noticed the changes the robot had made.After coming back from work and visting his mother's tomb,Danny found his robot not working properly.          'What's wrong?'          The robot looked at Danny one more time and blinked a goodbye.

He had bought many part to make a robot. He already had a plan to make it. One night, he invited his friends to his house to tell them about his plan to make a robot. He asked if they wanted to help him. They all said yes.                     They worked for days trying to make the robot. Every person had a different part on the robot. When they were all done they just had to put on the body. When they put on the body it looked like a RC cart. They just had to press the on button. Everone was just crossing there fingers for it to work. When they pressed it, it worked!! Everyone was just yelling in excitment. They made the first robot ever.

Then BAM!!! It was alive. It knew how to speak but it was really weak. I used it to do my homework because it was really smart. It was really clumsy, I had to fix him two times now.                                                                                Paragraph2   It was smart so I took it to school. Every body wanted my robot but i said it wasn't for sale. People wanted to make it help them on stuff like school work, but i didn't let them.The teacher wanted me to put away the robot so I putted it away. Then it went out control.  It was destroying every thing so the teacher told me to go to the office.           Paragraph3   The pricipal gave me a detension, and I also had to destroy my robot. So when I went to detension I was just letting the robot do my homework. When I got home I had to destroy it. But then i couldn't so the next day I went up to the pricipal that he doesn't have the right to tell me to destroy it. Then he said yes he doesn't have the right so then he said sorry then i got to keep my robot                                                                       The End 	NNP CD NN PRP VBD DT NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD RB NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN NN CC DT NN NN NNP NNP NNP . . .

ONE day the little girl told her mom could i not go to school to see who cleans my room and to see who  does my chores  please mom and dad .So her mom and dad said yes so the little girl went to her room and said when I come back from school .  I need to clean my room  so the girl put on her uniform and got her back pack and went to school but she really didnt go to school she she went to her window  and when she was there the  girl robot came to life and clean my ran to her room and saw the robot cleaning her room and when the robot saw that the little girl was at the door the robot turned off and the little girl said to the robot please dont turn off I always wanted a friend and so that why I invented you and the girl robot said you invented me and the girl said yes I did  and the robot and the girl went to the girls parents  and the girl said she is the one that did my chores it my robot and the robot said HI and the girl and the robot were best friends for ever and they lived happily ever after.                   The End                                                                                                  	DT NNP NNP POS PRP NNP VBD DT NN VBG DT NN DT NN VBD DT NN PRP VBD DT NN VBN NN , JJ NNS , VBP VBZ , CC NN NNP NNP NN WP VBN DT NN VBD DT NN NN TO VB TO VB RB PRP VBD NNS CC DT NN IN NN CC VBD PRP IN DT NN NNP NNP NN WP VBN DT NN NN VBD DT NN TO VB IN PRP$ CC VB PRP$ VB PRP NNP IN CD NN DT JJ NN NN TO NN WRB PRP VBD IN NN DT NN VBD TO VB CC IN DT NN NN VBD IN DT JJ NN VBN TO VB PRP$ NNS DT NN NN VBD PRP CC WRB DT JJ NN VBD RB IN NN DT NN VBD RP CC DT JJ NN VBD PRP VBP VBD PRP VBP PRP$ NNS CC DT NN VBD DT CC PRP VBD PRP$ NN VBD PRP VBP PRP$ NNS CC DT NN VBD DT PRP VBP CC DT JJ NN VBD PRP RB VBD PRP VBP PRP$ NNS CC DT NN VBD DT NN IN DT CD VBD PRP$ NNS RB WP VBD PRP$ NNS CC IN DT JJ NN PRP VBD WRB PRP VBP RB IN NN PRP VBP TO VB PRP$ NN CC DT NN NN VBD CC WRB DT JJ NN NN TO NN DT NN VBD TO VB CC VBN PRP$ NN CC WRB DT NN VBD RB DT NN VBD RP JJ VBD RB WP VBN PRP$ NN .

One day, in January 10, 2008, I got bored from staying in my house to long, then I wished I had an advanced robot.I had nothing to do so I took a shower, and went to sleep.The next morning I felt something heavy on my blankit, and to my suprise it was there, a robot!           I got up early and prepared myself as usual every morning ,then I looked at it.The robot had long wheels, a camara for an eye, a claw with three fingers, and a box you could put stuff in.It was no bigger than a foot wide, and surprisingly heavy.   I then decided it needed a name at first i suggested 'Ziggy', then I suggested ''p-47'', finally I came up with ''RC-ARV.''           I showed it to my mom and she looked surprised,''WOW'' she said ''Where did that come from'' I told her ''I don't know...'',  I took a moment to look at it, ''...it's really strange isn't it.'' I grabbed the remote and tested it, the screen showing where ''RC-ARV'' looked at,I then noticed a strange joystick, and moved it, making the claw shift from side to side.Then,I pressed the arrow buttoms which drive and steer the robot, and the red buttom which opened, and closed the claw.           At night, I noticed it glows in the dark, and looked at it,it glowed bright green, in fact enough to light a room, there was so much things I never even knew about it.During the years, the robot started becoming more useful that it is like a member of the family, I even realized it had a really strong grip that it could lift a plane.The kids that looked at it said it looked ''COOL'' or ''AWESOME'' nevertheless the robot is welcome anytime.

It also is a rescue robot that can detect when people are alive.They can also tell when people are introuble or when they are trapped, and they also tell miners when the air is filled with gas and when it is safe to go somewhere.Gemini-scouts can also carry things like food, water, and other things.They can collect information whereever it goes, and it has heat sensors that can when there are living things around. It looks like a viedeo controller.         Some other types of robots are Dante 2, Mr.Grower, Agribots, a HRP-4c, and the Google car.A Dante 2 can climb up steep hills they help scientists get innformation about volanoes.When there is something dangerous that scientists can't do they have the Dante 2 do it.Dante 2 also collects information for the scientists.Mr.Grower works in a hospital.They give the nurses and the doctors the medicine for the patients.Mr.Grower is like a small cabinet except on wheels, and it can also turn really hard turns.It is really strong that it could pull a 500 pound truck, and it could also go on elevators and it goes on batteries it charges about twelve hours and doesn't stop working.It could also talk it could say about hundred phrases.          An Agribot picks fruits from trees the fruits it picks are grapes, oranges,apples, and berries.It works with scientists which they grow plants like cherrys or other things.Some of them have huge arms that are towed on to trucks.They don't have peoples help planting, and they also have farms that they grew by thierselves.thier arms are mechanical. A Google car is like the most popular robot ever.If someone ever rode it they would prbably be popular.It has a $80,000 cone-shape laser mounted on its roof.The people that rode the car other people probably thought they were driving it but they actually weren't.They were probably surprised that they didn't have to drive it.           That is my story about robots and how they are helpful to  people. There could be animal robots or regular robots.People are actually interested by robots. If I ever had a robot it would be my best friend and it would do my homework for me.If you ever had a robot what would be to you.

Robots also lke to play and have fun. Robots help people to drive when they are       doing somthing else.               First, robots are helpful to people because if someone is hurt or injuredit drags them back       to saftey. Robots work at hospitals, they diliver medicine plus it speaks to you or alerts you        when your medicine hs arrived.               Next, robots are cool because they can play with your pet animals. Most important they       can feed them. Also maybe if possible they can take the for a walk in the yard.               Then, it does indoor and outdoor work wich helps people clean the house. When nobody       is home it alerts the oner of the home by a call and emediatley calls 911. They also help       farmers milk the cows, cut down trees, and help cut the long thick grasses.               Futhermore, everywhere you look you see robots. Thats why they help people drive also       because once they get tired on road it automatically turns itself to flying aircraft mode. So it         helps people by them relaxing, turning the car into a flying car, and taking them to their       destination.                   Last, these robots do not run on gass the are charged. They are helpful to me and the       inviornment. So in the future there will be even more high tech things that you won't belive.       Do you think you think robots cool?

I found a plug inside of the robot and plugged it in an outlet. Sadly, it didn't do anything.       I was so angry that I almost threw it back in the dumpster. So, I went outside and went over to my friend, Billie's house. I explained it to him how I found it. 'So you're saying that you found a robot in the dumpster in the trashcan?'   'Yes.'   'Well you should've known that it wasn't going to work because it was in the trash.'       Well I went back home then all of a sudden I get to my room and I see the robot scavenging through my room. I was astonished. I was so happy that I had a real live robot in my room. So i asked it what its name was. 'My name is Dante 2 and I help scientists look through volcanoes.' Dante 2 said. 'Do you remember who you worked for?' I asked. 'I work for a man named Dr. Parker.' So, I looked up on the internet who Dr. Parker is. I found out that he worked for NASA. Therefore, I looked up NASA phone number. When I saw the number, I called NASA and asked for Dr. Parker. 'He is on vacation today, would you like me to leave him a message?'    'Yes please, tell him I found his robot named Dante 2.'    'Okay, thank you for calling and I will contact him later today.'       So, I went over to Billie's and told him about how the robot worked for NASA.   'Really'?   'Yeah.'   'So,what are you going to do with him?'   'I'm going to return him to his owner, Dr. Parker.' So, after my talk with Billy, the man contacted me,and told me that Dr. Parker is on the other line.   'So, you have Dante 2.' he said.   'Yeah, I found him in a dumpster.'   'Well come over and give me my robot back.' he said.       So, I went and gave Dr. Parker his robot back and Dante 2 went back to searching robots.So, that was the first time I ever seen robot in real life.

His name is, Dr. Vectro, a 65 year old man with very little hair and a very skinny body. He lives in a small lab, just by himself and is divorced. He was divorced, because Dr. Vectro was a very odd man.               What he has been trying to do for fifty years of his life is to make a robot. Not just any robot, but a big robot. Today his dream came true. 'I've done it! I finally made the world's biggest robot!' He exclaimed. The robot measured eighty feet tall, and a whopping 300 tons!                 The strangest thing about the creation is that it needed batteries. He put in 3 D-4's to make it work. That is how he got the name for the robot, DV-4. [The V is for the start of his last name.] When he was finished with his creation, he didn't exactly know what he wanted to do with it. There was an on switch on the robot, but Dr. Vectro didn't have the guts to turn it on. Then right before he went to bed, he decided to turn it on.                  In the morning when he got his glass, of milk, he realized it fealt a little breezy. He went to his garage, and he couldn't believe what he saw, his robot was gone, and there was a big hole in his garage. He figured that his robot came to life and ran away. He was depressed, he spent all day looking for him, he even put up posters saying he had a missing robot. Then he got a call, the man on the other line told him that he found his robot and that he ripped the batteries out of it, because it was causing a riot. The man said he will return it to him shortly. The man returned the robot. Dr. Vectro gave the robot to a meuseum, but he told the meuseum this, 'Dont give the robot 3 D-4 batteries!'

It was very good, but it seemed to work right. He tried to everything he knew about how to make a robot wok but he couldn't do it.                  Professor Jimmy went to bed one night after a day of trying to fix his robot when he heard a noise downstairs. He rushed to the scene and found out that his robot had came alive! he was so excited, he almost cried. The robot said,' i would like to eat.' so the professor got him some oil and the robot devoured it.                  The professor made him a bed in the basement out of straw and then went to sleep. The next morning he couldn't find his robot. he later found out that at it had died because he didn't have a very good battery and he died. The professor tried to give him a new battery but he didn't work again.                    Professor Jimmy was very sad after yje incident with the dead robot , so he tried to make a new one but he could never make a robot that worked again.

This will take place in a lab where they make and create things.       A man named robert started on a project and was going to build a robot. He started with a couple tools and lots of diffrent shaped metal. He built and built but couldnt build the write thing until one day the thought making a robot that could do every thing, popped into his brain. He started on the project and didnt stop until a hole two years past Has just made the perfect robot that could do any thing for any one.       Poeple started to find out about this robot and wanted it but he could not give it to them. He used this robot for helping train people dogs helping scientists make new discoverys.       This robot was the best in the world and lasted for a long time. Its last thing that it did was help some people in a hospital.

I am 11 years old, I am one of those kids that like to dig and investigate. Well the other day i was digging and I found some thing. So I went and told my mom and asked her what it was. She said it was the Mars rover. I had no idea what she was talking about I had no clue what that was. So the next day I went to school and asked my teacher what the Mars rover was. She said we are going to learn about that today. When my teacher turned on the video I was very excited. In like the middle of the video i was very suprised what i just learned about. When i got home I went and found it. I couldn't believe what I have found. I felt like one of the luckiest kids in the world.

It was green with two hands and also two legs, kind of like a human. I had just received it for my birthday. It was the best present anyone had ever given me. I felt very happy.When I heard my sister called so I looked, suddenly I heard a noise as if something had fallen. When i turn around there was nothing there. Then another noise, so I turned around when suddenly I saw something moving, it was my robot. I could not believe my eyes, he was alive. I was scared and happy at the same time. I did not know what to do. That was when i learned that it could be a good opportunity to have fun.                     I got close to the robot, when I was there i tried to speak to it, but it would not answer. I tried to make it feel comfurtable so it would speak. Then it started to talk, he said that he wanted to be friends. From that moment i decided to name it John. I took it for a walk to ask him what sort of things did it like to do. He replied that he liked to do things as eating, walking and having electronics. So what we did was that we to eat pizza because we were both hugry, i asked it if it did alot of things. He said he could clean rooms since it had a trash holder and a thing to pick up trash. Since my room was a mess I told it to clean up my room, it was finished in 30 seconds.After that we went on a walk to the park. We got some ice cream and we palyed soccer. We had lots of fun and we did not go home until 9:30 PM. When we got home we ate again then I asked it 'do you need to sleep?' he repplied 'no, I only need to be charged since I requiered batteries.' Then I put it to charge and i went to sleep. From that day on we did the same things every day.                      In conclusion, me and my best birthday present or my robot became very good fiends. We always spent time together, we went to places and we have fun. From that moment, i knew that i had found a true friend that really cared for my.

All of the sudden lighting hit the lab. BOOM! The lights went out. 'Alan can you hear me'  Yelled The scientist, but all could was gears winding. He got up to turn on the emergency power. Once he turned the power own. The was gone. he search the lab and found a broken window. 'oh no' He said.         Shaun was walking away home from school. All of a sudden a robot ran in front of and ran into the street. It was hit by a car. It flew across the street and hit the ground. Shaun ran over to it. 'what happened' the robot said. Shaun was so startled he dropped the robot.       He made friends with the robot. Shaun and the robot started to walk home. 'what is your name' he said. 'I don't have a name' The robot said sadly. 'I will call you Fred' said Shaun. They walk home laughing and talking. The robot fixed him self up. They helped each other. They lived happly ever after.

This robot was named Dave after the scientist who created it, but the robot was created with a memory chip that can detect emotions, violence, and sound. The robots main memory is the 'brain'. The 'brain' has the ability to think on its own and move on its own. It was created to be human-like and can transform into a hover-bot.               Davis was one of the many functional robots but this robot was unique. The other robots can only follow orders from human beings, but Dave can think on its own and not follow orders. Soon Dave reprogramed all of the other robots and started to take over the world. Dave reprogramed him to be a hologram so he would not be destroyed by a single bullet. Instead he put himself in a anti-blast and bulletproof mainframe. If any human would get into it a nuclear bomb would detonate and wipe human beings off from the city.                   Dave was starting to conquer other continents and enslaving people. Many people rebeled but were killed by Dave's powerful robot army. Dave was practically invincible but Dave's creator, Dave Tecky, installed a tiny nuclear bomb in Dave's brain that would destroy him for good, but Dave was way ahead of his creator. Dave installed guard robots at the failsafe so no one can get through. Even if they did get through the gas in the failsafe could kill every non-robot in the room. Little did Dave know that Tecky made a secret entrance to the failsafe. Tecky went in and the room went into high alert robots from everywhere came to the room and started to get Tecky but Tecky quickly hit the failsafe and Dave was destroyed for good. To this day, robots with minds of its own were banned from the world.

Juliet Seedsim and her older brother, Gregory, were bickering as usual.' Mom,' yelled Juliet,' Greg is hogging the fan!' Greg always enjoyed annoying his little sister.' How about you both find something else to do and try to spend some quality time together instead of arguing,' said Mr. Seedsim as he came up stairs.         For once, Greg and Juliet actually had to spend time together. They had to do something, but what? ' We should read magazines together?' asked Juliet.' That's girly,' said Greg. 'How about we play darts?' Juliet shook her head no.'I know what you two should do,' said their father.' You should make a robot. That's what your aunt and I used to do when we were kids. You'll be surprised about how magical it is.'The siblings looked at each other. ' Perfect!' said Juliet and Greg in unison.            They gathered their materials and ran to the kitchen table. Greg brought empty soup cans, wires, solar panels, and oil. Juliet brought glitter, pipe wires, blue metal, and fake eyeballs. As soon as they knew it, the robot was completed. ' Okay. Here's the moment of truth!' said Juliet pulling at her long, brown hair nervously. Once they plugged it into the outlet, it didn't work.' Let's try another outlet. If that doesn't work, than we we'll try the solar panels.' said Greg.          No matter what they did, the robot didn't work.' It's all your fault.' said  Juliet crossing her arms.' My fault?,' said Greg,' Your the one who brought all the glitter. It probably got caught inside and cut the wire when you were sprinkling it!'Juliet was astonished that Greg would blame it on her when he insisted that she should decorate it any way she wanted to.' Uh uh.'Uh ha.' They continued for an hour, until they were sent to their rooms. The next day, they couldn't believe their eyes!         'Oh my goodness!' screamed  Juliet as she came down the stairs for breakfast. ' Greg! Gregory! Mr. Seedsim! Big brother wake up!' shouted Juliet. Soon, Greg came down stairs and it didn't take long before he spit out he cup of water he was drinking. The 4 feet robot was walking around the house and got Greg another cup of water!' Did you do this?' asked Greg. ' No, I thought you did.'Juliet replied. When Greg and Juliet asked their parents if they had fixed the robot, they each said they didn't.     ' Wait a minute,' said Juliet ,' Didn't you say that you had to plug the robot in to work?' Yeah, why,' said Greg.' Well, the solar panels aren't attached, the sun hasn't completely come up, and Jonah's not plugged in.' Greg looked down at the robot and saw that the robot really wasn't plugged into the outlet.     ' Just like Dad said  it's magical.' said Juliet.' Come on Jewel, I think at age 10 you shouldn't believe in magic.' It is magic Greg. It doesn't matter if I'm 12 like you or 10. Dad said so himself.' The robot walked up to Greg and shook his hand.' If it wasn't magic then where did I come from?' Greg was speechless.After that, the siblings argued about what really happened.' Gregory Joe Seedsim! Juliet May Seedsim! Come here NOW!' shouted Mrs. Seedsim.     ' What is this?' asked Vicky Seedsim pointing to a laundry basket. 'A laundry basket?'said Gregory trying not to laugh. 'Juliet, go grab that basket for me.'demanded Mrs. Seedsim. 'Sure. Hey mom what happened to your hai-' She was cut off when her mother gave her a don't-say- it-look. Juliet got up and  to go grab the basket when she suddenly disappeared out of no where.' MOM! Where did she go?' asked Greg in a panicking voice.' Oh she'll be back in three... two... one.' Juliet came out of thin air with her hair sticking up like a mad scientist.     'HAHAHAHAHAH!' laughed Greg pointing to Juliet's hair. 'Where... HAHAH...where..HAHAHA...did you...HAHA...go?' asked Greg in-between laughs.' For your information, it was a portal that was so amazing that you should see for your self,' said Juliet as she pushed her brother into the portal.' That was awesome!' said Greg when he came back.' Do you think it was magic now?' asked Juliet with a smile as big as Mount Everest.' Definitely,' said Greg.                                                                                                      Soon, George Seedsim walked in.' I see everyone found the magic portal.' said Mr. Seedsim.' You knew about this George?' said Mrs. Seedsim. 'As a child when I would build robots, they would work at first, but then they would magically be fixed and a magic portal would take us on adventures.'         ' Hey everyone, Jonah's going to tell us all of his cool features!' Everyone listened to Jonah and learned  that he could to a lot of  activities such as save lives, turn into a car, and even go into volcanoes without melting.In the end, Jonah some how brought the family closer together, and Juliet and Greg didn't argue as much. Jonah had even saved the family by carrying them out of a mine. They all had many adventures in the portal thanks to Jonah!

He thought this was the greatest idea he has ever had.             Someone taking care of his children might not really be 'taking care' of them, but             a robot will do whatever it is programmed to do.                      Arnold decided that he would get his wife's approval before he started working               on the robot. When Arnold his wife and children were eating dinner, he told them                 he could make a robot that would take care of the kids better than a real babysit-                ter. His wife was astonished because she was really over protective of her children              and would never let somebody other than him alone with their chilren.                      The next day Arnold got to work. He built the robot a little taller than the child-            ren. He made a remote control so he can turn it on and off, he programmed it to make              beds, wash dishes and clothes, cook food, play with the children and understand what          people were saying. Then he named it Molly. He made sure everything functioned prop-            erly and went to sleep.                Arnold woke up the next day to the sound of his children laughing. They were playing          with the robot. He asked how it got out of his lab and they all shrugged and said that she        made them breakfast. Arnold ignored it and got dressed told the kids to behave and went         to work. When he got home his wife was arguing with the robot about her quiting and        she wasnt supposed to do that he shut her down and threw her away .

The moths pass and he wished for a robot because it was Christmas. The next day he went running down stairs and he saw a big present for him he open it and saw the robot he wanted he was so happy.They both had adventures but one day the little boy still felt lonely so he wished for his to talk.The next day he couldn't find his robot he look for him every were then the robot said what are you looking for my friend he turns and got scared. The little boy said you could talk and the robot said yes didn't you wished for it and he said yes but latterly the robot said we will be the best friends for ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The years pass and the little kid is a man.Now the robot and bob could do many things like go play soccer,video games,and drive to work.One day they both were watching TV they were watching sponge bob but bob never saw the clock it pass his to work he couldn't drive so Mario drove him to his work.His boss got mad and said that if he was late would fire him.Bob got mad and said that he would not work there any more Mario the robot said why are you mad and bob said that his boss was mad and he would not work there any more.Mario said now how are we paying the car bill,or the house bill,the gas, the water.Bob you will work with me pizza hot and Mario said that's a good choice.

There wasn't anything every time I looked behind me. I started to run home because I was getting worried. When I got to my door,I checked behind me to just make sure no one was following me. I got home at about 7:25,so I just showered,ate,and went to sleep.              Later,I was about to stop playing video games and go to sleep the next day,but I heard a loud noise in the kitchen. My parents were out of town,so it couldn't be them. My sister was having a sleep party over at her friends house. She wasn't going to be back till Sunday. I looked at my iPod,but it said Saturday.'Maybe we are getting robbed',I thought.When I was about to smack this intruder upside the head,around the corner I saw a dog's outline of a shadow. 'What!', I exclaimed in my mind.               A second later,I turned the corner and to my surprise it was a dog. It looked robotic though. 'How would a dog get into my house?',I asked myself. I wasn't asking it a question,but it answered. It said it was a failed nucular project by the government. I was thinking to get that thing out of my house before my house is nuked! The dog,Moab later what he called himself,said that he was a normal dog before he was taken away from his family and experimented on by the government.He told me Moab standed for 'Mother Of All Bombs'.He also told me he was following me yesterday in order to get the whereabouts of his owners. It seemed that I new his owner about four years ago. Sussie Red was the owner's name.                 After the talk,I called Sussie to see if she still lived in the area. She only lived two miles away and it was her birthday. 'Wouldn't that be a great present to give Sussie?',I asked Moab. He paused and said his original name was Sparky. Okay...do you want me to call you Moab or Sparky',I asked. He said he would prefer Sparky.He seemed really depressed after I was about to drop him at Sussie's house.He wondered I she wouldn't love him anymore because of his robot look. I told him she will love him no matter how he looks. I gave Sparky to Sussie and the hugged each other. I told Sussie happy birthday,got some cake, and left. Sussie told me that beacause I brought Sparkey back, that was the best birthday ever. She thanked me and then I went home. I still never went to sleep.

Everyone that lives here are all very strange, but James is strange in a good way. One dark day, James got to school by the old rusty bus. All the cars were rusty because there were HUGE factories where they bottle up pickles and sold them. The acid like gas from the factories rusts the cars. James walks to school with great enthusiasm. James always loves to learn new things. James walks to class and sits down. 'Good morning class...', said Mrs.Ordanski boringly, the teacher. 'Good morning', said the class in unison. 'Today we will start out 9th annual science fair.' sighs Mrs.Ordanski.   The whole class moans except for James. James was very excited. During the next few hours James just thinks about what he wants to do at the science fair. The bell rings and the class files out. 'Not pickle soup again!' moans Billy, James's best friend. The pickle soup was cold and bitter like it always was.                                                          After school James ran home to tell his parents. 'Well, What do you want to do at the science fair?' said mom. 'I don't know yet.' said James. 'How about you make a robot?',said dad. 'WOW, YEA!',said James with great excitement. James sprints towards his garage and grabs the parts he needs. The next morning James started to build his robot. James and the other children only had school for 2 days. The teachers hate to teach. In the next few hours James completes his robot. James turns him on. 'Good morning', said the robot. 'Good morning to you!' said James happily.              The next morning James took his robot to school. 'Today will be such fun!',said James. When he gets to school James thinks the robot looks funny. 'Hhhhhhmmmmm', said James. The bell rings and James quickly walks into the classroom with his robot. 'Wow, James looks like you win the science project again since no one else even participates.',said Mrs.Ordanski. 'Hello everybody',said the robot painfully. After lunch James visits the robot. 'James I feel funny', said the robot. With that the robot broke apart. James had totally forgotten about the acid like gases from the pickle factories. 'Thanks for helping me with the science fair',said James in tears. James takes the robot parts home and waits until next year's science fair...

Buddy has high power, heavy duty wheels. He is about 2 feet in height and 4 feet in width. Buddy has sensors to tell if he will run into anything and crash. Scientist will be controlling Buddy from earth, and hopefully his landing will be successful. We are exploring Pluto for absolutely no reason at all. Since humans cannot get to Pluto, we decided to have a robot go and explore. We would like to see if there is any landforms, or life on Pluto.             Buddy safely, and successfully landed on Pluto. The rocket was launched at 8 am. in the morning, and landed on Pluto at 12 pm. the next day. Buddy was not hurt, he was still working. Scientist discovered that there were no landforms on Pluto, but... They did find life. We are not sure if this is a living organisim or not. To describe it, it was about 3 foot tall and it had tenticals that spread out and looked like a star. This creatures body looked like a squid, but there was something peculiar about this creature. It had ears as big as elephants, and a nose similar to a pigs. What color was this creature? It was an undescribable color. It was as black as night. and it was hard to see the details unless you were close. If you got really close you can see little sparkles and designs all down the tenticals. Different lines, nothing you have ever seen before. Suddenly this strange creature strikes the robot with one of its tenticals, leaving a big gaping hole in Buddy. The creature left a big black mark on Buddy. Buddy starts to shut down. The creature strikes again, leaving another black mark on Buddy. Now he is shut down all the way. The computers that are wirelessly connected to buddy turn all black. Blackness starts to seep out and take over the computer. All of the black goes away, and the computer monitor is back on. Buddy is not programed to talk, but he goes. He said strange words. I am not sure if they were words or not. He started moving all by himself, with no one controlling him. Either someone was haking into the system or Buddy was alive!               After an hour of watching Buddy move. It shut off and started to go home all by himself. When he got back to earth, we studied the black gaping holes in Buddy. That trip to Pluto was interesting, but we didn't gather much information, since the computer had shut down again 	NNP , VBP RB VBN DT NN TO VB TO NNP NNP MD VB NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNPS VBD VBZ NNP NNP VBZ JJ NN , JJ NN NNP NNP VBZ IN CD NNS IN NN CC CD NNS IN NNP NNP VBZ NNS TO VB IN PRP MD VB IN NN CC NNP NNP MD VB VBG NNP IN JJ , CC RB PRP$ NN MD VB NNP NNP VBP VBG NNP IN RB DT NN IN NNP NNP VBZ MD RB VB TO NNP , PRP VBD TO VB DT NN NN CC NNP NNP MD VB TO VB IN EX VBZ DT NNS , CC NN IN NNP NNP RB , CC RB VBD IN NNP NNP NN VBD VBN IN CD NNP IN DT NN , CC VBD IN NNP IN CD NNP DT JJ NNP NNP VBD RB VBN , PRP VBD RB NNP NNP VBD IN EX VBD DT NNS IN NNP , CC : PRP VBD VB NNP NNP VBP RB JJ IN DT VBZ DT NN NN CC NNP TO VB PRP , PRP VBD IN CD NN NN CC PRP VBD NNS IN NN IN CC VBD IN DT NNP NNP VBZ NN VBN IN DT JJ , CC EX VBD NN NN IN DT NNP NNP VBD NNS IN JJ IN NNS , CC DT NN JJ TO DT NNP NNP NN VBD DT NN .

He started making the robot in March so he cold give it to me. He was olmost done he just needed to add something. He got ready to test the robot to see if it worked the robots eyes lighted up and then they went out. He was mad that it didn't work he said 'Why didn't it work I did everything wright'.            My cousin went home disapointid that it didn't work. He left the roof window open. It started to rain becouse ther was a storm coming. Tunder started to rour and then lightnig hit the robot. The robot came to life. Cris whent back to his basement The next day to try to fix the robot and the robot wesint their.            My cousin looked every where but he didn't fined him. He whent to my house to ask me for help he said 'I need your help I made you a robot for your birthday but it didn't work so I whent home I came back and he wesint ther'. I went with him to find the robot. We looked for the robot in the alies and the streets we had one more place to look at. We saw two guys throwing rocks at something metle. We knew it was metle becouse we cold hear the rocks bouncing off something laudely.            When the guys got boured they stoped and walked away we went to see what they were throwing rocks at and it was the robot. Luckle the robot didn't get hert becouse he is a robot.

By using echo location Kate gives that she has gathered  to the scientist and rescue people  to know where the injured animals. Also to find where lost animals.        Kate is really importent to our community because she helps us know where to find animals. She has also been good to us by using her voice translater to speak the animal first and then tell us what the animal has said. When the scientists don't need kate , she gets to charge for 24 hours so she can be charged  agin and ready to use. Kate has alays has been a great robot.        Kate has blue eyes that we can control by using the black hole to make things look bigger and to make things appear upclose . Kate has a cone shaped body which helps her go into animals bodies to see if there are promblems with the body. Kate has a small tail which makes her swim really fast without bumping into anything dangerous . Kate can swim faster than any other humans on earth.        Kate protects herself from dangerous animals by camoflauging herself into anthing nearby her. Kate is a pretty smart fish for herself. When we first made Kate,we thought Kate wouldn't do so well , But now Kate has gotten even more better when she first started . This is why Kate is good robot.

Everybody he new had one including his girlfriend Juliet hers was named Rose. The only difference between Rose and Todo was that rose was pink and Todo was green.       Todo woke up that day and started vacuuming wondering like he did everyday how he was going to tell Alex that he was alive. Sure he could talk but that didnt seem right too him. So he did what he always didi when he was upset {which was alot} he cleaned until the apartmeant sparkled like a diamond.       Juliet would have woken up that day except she didnt she had been up all night cleaning because her parents were flying into town she new that she and Alex had made a strange choice living in their apartments through the summer but a good one.

Back at the lab everyone loved the Probot 2000 but secretly Bob was scared because he saw the outcome of the movie.He thought it was nothing just him being weird.So they went on building them and when one was complete they tested it.These robots could do everything humans could do.It was a hit and the country started going up in popularity.Everyone wanted a Probot 2000 may it be as a babysitter,dishwasher, or anything they wanted it to be, everyone needed the robots to do something for them.       Ten years went by but the robots where still selling out!Then the revolution started.At first the robots just acted weird like they did'nt help their owners children with their homework.Then some of them just disappered but it was'nt the first robots stolen so no one besided the people who owned the robots noticed.Soon so many robots where disappering that it got to a matter of nervousness in  country.By now the thiefs would either have been seen and or in jail or a couple of robots with the thiefs figerprints on them would have been discovered.Sadly no theif was ever found .This brief history lesson would have been better if a buch of restless teenagers where behind it.Soon the countries who had bought major stocks of the Probot 2000s' would pay the price of having them.Another sad fact the country who had created them would be destroyed or would it beat the odds?       Soon the robots started reappering.But they would'nt obay their masters.Soon huge bunchs started to march around the streets.The people inside their houses where hopelessly trapped.The armies grew and grew untill their where thousands upon thousands.The creator Bob was very shameful.Every one on Earth blamed him for the robots some how growing minds of their own.       Bob was in his bomb shelter.He felt terrible.He Said to himself 'this is exactly what happened in the movie'He thought I created monsters thousands upon thousands of monsters.Now I don't know what to do.The moment I step outside I will be shouted at.I wonder weather or not they are still building the Probots?Yes they still are the goverment does'nt care about the people.All the goverment cares about is money and they are making millions.The people outside of this country don't know about the invasion.           Soon the whole Earth was taken over by millions of Probots.Bob was never seen again .Many say that he made a rocket ship and blasted into space with the president.The End 	NNP CD NNP PRP VBP VBG RB TO DT NN CD WRB DT NN VBD VBG IN DT JJ NN NN WRB VBG IN NNS VBN NNP CD POS JJ NN PRP VBP IN IN DT NN CD PRP MD VB DT JJ JJ NNS MD NNS VB IN DT NN NNP NNP PRP VBD JJ NNS DT NN IN PRP VBD IN DT NN NN NN NN VBD RB VBG IN NN VBG TO VB RP IN DT RB JJ NN IN MD VB DT NN IN DT JJ VBD RP VBG DT NNP NN IN NN IN NNS CC VBD RP IN DT NNP NNP NNP IN DT NN NN VBD DT NNP CD CC RB NNP VBD VBN IN PRP VBD DT NN IN DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBG RB PRP VBG RB PRP VBD IN NN PRP CC WRB CD VBD JJ PRP VBD JJ NNS MD VB NN NNS MD VB VBD DT NN CC DT NN VBD VBG RP IN NN VBD DT NNP CD MD PRP VB IN DT NN , RB , CC NN PRP VBD PRP TO VB , NN VBD DT NNS TO VB NN IN NNP NNP NNS VBD IN CC DT NNS WRB RB VBG RP .

When he grew up he wanted to make one himself. George tried every day to make one come alive, but none of them did. 'I'll never be able to do it,' he said to himself one day. 'Never! Never! Never!' He gave up on trying to make machines.                  Seven years pasted a he didn't even look at the lifeless robots. Then one day he couldn't sleep. George looked at his robots that he worked on so long ago. He decided to finish his project. He worked on the one that he liked the best.                 When he was seven her named it Albert. George decided to keep that name. He gave it the name Albert because when he was little his best friend was his dog, Albert. He lived a happy life, but that all ended when Albert died of old age. George cried for weeks. He didn't even want to go to the playground or school!                 George worked on Albert all weekend. Then on Sunday, at 8:00 pm, something happened. He put two wires together. Then, there was a huge, ZAP, that knocked George off  of his chair. Then, everything went black.       When George woke up there was sonething hovering over him. It was Albert! He was alive! George was so excited. He flung himself off of the floor, sending Albert flying out the window onto an old bed. George was dancing around happily then he realized that Albert was gone. 'Albert?' George asked. He looked out the window and saw Albert driving around, bumping into everything, and then fall down. George rushed downstairs a flew out the back door. He grabbed Albert and ran back upstairs.                 All week after homework George went on adding stuff to Albert. He gave him arms, a bucket on his back, and a camera. George connected the camera to his computer so he could see what Albert saw. He also gave Albert a voice and ears! That way he could talk to Albert an hear what he was saying! George took all of the wires out of an old video game controller so he could control Albert! It took a while, but he finally did it. now Albert was finished.                 They had many adventures together. George would use Albert to steal snacks.

There are robots in certain places in the world. Some robots save lives ,some work on farms ,others collect information form places we  can't go others babysit. One in particular can be a car and  a driver at the same time.     Some robot carry supplys to help others they can carry food  and water. Some carry medications and bring them to the hospital for people who need it. Some robot can be programed to talk. some robots can be programed to dance. The  way people control them is with  a remote control.     Some of them have thermal cameras to find miners . They use it that  way because. If you are alive your body gives off heat and that is what the robot's thermal camera is for. Also along the way the robot can  use it's thermal camera to not just find people but other living things.they can also collect more information along the way. The robot can carry hurt people to safety.   So those are the many uses for robots.

Now there is a robot that was unattended on the street where it could do anything and this robot had a malfuction where if it was not being controlled it was very dangerous to be near because anything that moved was its target.People did not know this though because the robot was meant for cleaning things and helping with small children so everyone thinks it is harmless when it can do big damage to anything or everything.           Boom!!!!!!! A huge slam erupts around the city followed by a rumble going thruogh the ground. Everyone runs to the sight and what they find is the Metal Bot 495 on a rampage thruogh the city home to millions of humans. Fireman are fighting the flames this robot is producing there is nothing to stop it. Besides another stronger robot so they call the team of  Fighter Bot 755 to come and take this robot down. This robot is made for this job incase anything like this happens the problem is that this robot is three citys over and will not make it in time to stop this robot. Now they are in a panic because Metal Bot 495 is o n the loose unstopable untill they find someone who can stop it in time.            The only other thing they can do is bring out a huge metal chamber and cover the robot so it can not see whats goin on until they disable it. Luckily they have one in storage that is already built and ready to go. Now they are over the robot waiting for the time to drop it they only have one shot and it needs to count or they have to evaquate the city while the they haul in the Fighter Bot 755.           Now the race is on its do or die they must et this over the robot or clear the city. They aske everyone to leave the area while they put the robot in the chamber. Luckily they suceed and haul the robot to there headquarters and examin it. While they are examining it they  relize that the robot had a emergency cut off switch that they could have some how pushed to shut off the robot.       Now that they hae captured the robot they pass a ban on any robots so there is nom further problems. The city reacts supportingly in this and the law is passed. the city is now being ran old fashion with no problems at all.

'Next thing I know, I'm in the hospital.'        Her mom told her, 'Onyx came alive when the lightning came,' That is why she was in the hospital because she is allergic to dogs.  But Meghan didn't believe her. Meghan was so sad throughout the rest of the year because Onyx was her only pet. Meghan was allergic to all animals and couldn't have any except robot pets.       Meghan soon got a new robot to replace Onyx. Hopefully, Rolo, her new robot, wont turn into a real animal anytime soon. Meghan shows off Rolo to all her friends. She loves Rolo as much as she loved Onyx, even though she had Onyx for 3 years and only has had Rolo for 3 months.     	PRP$ NNP NNP NNP NNP PRP VBP PRP$ NN IN PRP VBD PRP$ NN VBD JJ RB .

Gemini- Scout are strong, collects information, and carries water, food, and supplies. They test air for gases just in case if its safe and uses a thermal camera to find miners. They also use a two- way radio to talk with the rescue team.      Dante 2 climbs on volcanoes to collect information for scientists to closer and doesn't have o go there. It was easier to study for them when Dante 2 is there. Dante 2 look for vents, craters, and homes.       Mr. Grower helps docters and nurses by bringing medicines for patients. He can also go anywhere in the hospital. He can also talk by saying 100 phases. Their body has drawers that can store medicines.   Agribot robots pick fruits for farmers by their mechanical arms. They also check if  their ripe and they water them. They don't even need human help at all. They can tell what plants need.         Google cars are robotic cars that are legal. They were able to apply to test self- driving cars on Nevada roads. It can drive 200,000 miles over highways and city streets in California and Nevada.

All my friend were clapping, from my perfect twirling jump off the swing. Bring! Finally school was over.       As i walked home from school I noticed that the neighbor hood was very quite. Then all of a sudden the wind whipped my face, and dirt climbed into my eyes. As I cleared my eyes from the dirt that whipped in my face a strange creature was standing write in front of me.        My reaction was the same as any other normal human being, if they saw what was right in front of me. 'Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!' I screamed. Hoping this was all a dream, and that soon my mom would come into my room in wake me up. As I waited a few seconds, waiting for someone to pinch me. I figured out this dream was reality.         As I slowly opened my eyes, I figured out that I must of imagined something because nothing was there. As I tiptoed the last few blocks, keeping my eye out for any such creature. I started to panic. Then in a flash I ran strait to my house. As I walked in the door, I quickly locked every window and door in the house.          That night at dinner, I was shaking as much as a little frightened dog. My mom and dad were very concerned, that something was really wrong with me. I told them I was fine, but on the inside I was as scared as a mouse. As I pushed my chair back I asked if i could be excused.                 'Yes, but are you sure your ok.' My mom questioned?                'Yes!Yes, I'm fine mom.' I said quietly.                                  As I ran up stairs to my room, I ran strait under the covers. As I layed their my eyes slowly shut from the long day.            Beep!Beep!Beep! As I reached over to hit the snooze button on my alarm clock, I realized the beeping wasn't coming from that. As I turned my head to find out what that beeping noise was, I was shocked with what was in front of me. It was the biggest animated thing I've ever seen. It was Humongous! It had big feet, a T.V. for a face, tube arms and legs, and bright colored clothes. This was the weirdness thing I've ever seen. As I was about to scream the robot said,'would you like waffle or Pancake?' Too shocked to answer, the robot said it again. The second time I answered and I told the robot that I would like a pancake, please. Then a second later, a pancake popped out of one of those tube like arms.          'WOW!' I said with amazement.           'Thank you I've been working on that trick.' the robot said.     My eyes were lit up like light bulbs. Then I soon asked what else he did.           He said,'I'm Chris the robot I'm very smart, athletic,a good chef, warmhearted, and the worlds best automatic robot.       Again, I was blown away. Then as I looked at the time, I had exactly 20 minutes until school started, and I wasn't even dressed.                 'It's ok I'll help you, because I forgot to tell you I have super speed.' the robot said. So take you're time you don't need to rush.          Then it hit me wouldn't it be the best thing to have a pet robot. I was amazed with this discovery. I've always wanted a pet, so why not a pet robot. I knew this was going to be awesome, the only problem is we can't let my parents find out. Eh, its all right it will just be are secret.          A couple days later, on Friday after school. My friend wanted me too come over and hang out. Sure i thought why not. I went home, and told my mom where i was going. Then I ran up stairs to check on my robot(Chris) but he was gone. All i saw was a sticky note laying on my desk.              It said,'I'm sorry, I'm not here but other people need me so, as sad as it is for me too say, i can't be your pet robot anymore.' Love your pal robot Chris.          I dropped down to my knees and started crying, pouring tears came out of my eyes. I knew that he would have to go I thought, but i did not think it would be so soon. As i stopped crying, and wiped the tears off my face, I knew he had to leave, and I knew it would all be ok. i put a smile on face and thought if you love something it will come back.

He stayed in this bed all the time asleep; afterall he wasn't alive. But, sometimes I wish he was.        The next night, asleep in my bed I heard a loud *THUD*. I jumped out of my bed to see what made the loud and almost terrifing noise. I went sraight to Jacob's room. Afterall, he was always there-but, this time he wasn't!! I bolted down my rickety steps. And into the kitchen I ran. I amediatly came to a halt. The door to the fridge was WIDE OPEN!!!! I began to want to just turn around and go up into my room! But i couldn't. I slowly and carfully turned my head around the edge of the fridge. And what did I find?! JACOB!!! His eyes wide open staring in the fridge like it was a money tree! I couldn't belive it; I tried to rub my eyes to make sure that my robot was alive. And he was!!!! I sprinted into my mom and dad's room. I explained the whole story. They ran down the stairs and replied,   ' Oh my goodness Molly your robot is now a living thing.' I tried to remain as quiet and peaceful as I could. I lept up and gave jacob a hug. I was so happy I could fall over laughing. I said,   ' Mom can we still keep him?'   ' Yes of course,' they replied. I ran back up the steps to go back to sleep. As I fell back asleep i thought,   'Wow a real live robot, how amazing.'        The next morning I woke to find that Jacob was no where to be seen. I ran down my street then back up. I still couldn't find him. I woke up my parents with a,   'Mom help me jacob is no where to be seen.'   My parents replied, ' Come molly get in the car we will find him I promise.'           About a mile up the road was the school. Boy did I hope he was roaming around there.         We found a parking spot right in the front of the school, squeezed through the gates, and ran to find Jacob.       ' I've got him,' exclaimed my mom.       ' Perfect,' I said, 'Where.'       ' Right out front of the school office,' my mom replied.         We walked home with jacob lirking behind us. We back to the house and yet another time-but this time for good back to sleep.

Rick hopped on to MG-TC2 and they both lifted off to South Central High School. Oh no I forgot my homework, said Rick, right here master, said MG-TC2.                   As they landed on the football field, everybody looked up at them. Rick was the smartest student in the school, he was the one who made MG-TC2. Everybody appraised him he had many friends and was the most popular and also the smartest. Somebody really despised him.                  That somebody was ''Shane'',but he hated everybody ,so Rick didn't really care. What Rick didn't know was that Shane was inventing a special ray that could turn MG-TC2 into a real human being!!!!!! Rick tries to be friends with  Shane just doesn't budge. Shane just really doesn't like Rick.                     Shane shot the ray at MG-TC2 and turned him into a person!!!!!! As Rick turned around he saw MG-TC2 as a real life person!!!!!! He was shocked so shocked that he had a heart attack!!!!!!!!!!                  This was all a dream, this never happened he woke up very panicked, he looked at MG-TC2 and was relieved.

Scientist have done a lot of research to see what made the robot come alive. None of the scientist have figured it out.They have been doing a lot of research but nothing comes up on how it came alive.                      Three days have past and still nothing. Gemini-scout has been getting bigger instead of being a less than two feet robot it is a bigger robot. First it was three feet then it was four and finally a bigger than six feet robot.The Gemini-scout has been trying to get Dante 2, Mr. Gower,and Agribots to also come alive.                           Gemini-scout has successfully made Dante 2 come alive.Dante 2 also became evil.But turned its back on Gemini-scout. 	DT NN VBZ RB VBD JJ . . . . . . . . .

Robots are all over some places they are on mars they were on the moon and they made alot of the rover to gather info.They made some for helping doctors and nurses, they made some to play with animals and people.                                             They used Dante 2 to gather info about a volcanoes and they made it have four legs and it would look like a spider. They made it have eight legs and they made it were it could climb on the side of the volcano. They would have a camera and so the volcano would be right in the scientist faces the scientist couldn't learn as much about the volcano but the robot that they sent up to the volcano would change that.                                              They used Gemini scout to search and rescue people that were stranded in caves,in mines,and even in maybe on cliff. Gemini scout had a romote and he was remote controlled. Gemini scout would even bring supplies to people that really needed it and it would drag hurt people to safty. Gemini scout had a thermal camera that they used to find thing that were hidden. The romote they are using for gemini scout is the same one you would use for video games.                                                       You would think it would be easy building a robot but trust me it is not so easy so don't try and build a robot because you mabe even become an enginer and build one your self. The one thing thats cool about robot is you could build them how ever you want.

I walked into the kitchen and there was a nine foot tall metal thing, It looked like a tin can. I touched the robot and it turned around. It had a a tiny head and big eyes. It starred at me in a funny way so i ran to the drawer to grab the can opener i tried to open up the top of the robot and it grabbed my hand and pushed me then it ran upstairs. I got so scared i ran into the coat closet! I came out 1 hour later....... 'Hello?' I said nobody or should i say nothing answered. The I said 'Who's Here!?' the robot came running down the stairs and i grabbed the tin can opener off the the kitchen floor when it knocked it out of my hands earlier.  I got on top of the robot knocking it down, i hooked on the can open on the rim of the robots lid and twisted it off. Another me was in there! It was creepy i screamed then I woke up and it was all just a dream..... 	PRP VBD NN CD NN CC NN VBD NNP NNP VBD JJ IN JJ .

Jim wanted to make a robot so he tried and tried and couldn't make one. He looked online at howtomakearobot.com but he still couldn't make one. So he got mad and threw it into the dumpster. He didn't know it took a nasty smell to activate the robot.             Then the trash truck came and dumped the robot into it. From there it went on a 20 mile journey to a landfill. The trash truck  dumped all the trash in it onto the landfill. After 5 days in the smelly trash the robot came alive!              The robot went down the landfill and stopped to think where it came from. He looked on his GPS and headed back to Jim's house. On the way he stopped to get food because he was a human robot. Then the robot continued his journey back to his house.               When he got back Jim was still sitting on his sofa depressed and sad. then there was a knock on the door. Who could that be he thought? So he got off his sofa and opened the door and... It was the robot! Jim was so happy he hugged the robot and amed him Jim Jr.                                                                                 The End                                                        	DT NN NNP IN DT NNP IN : NNP NNP CD NN RB VBD DT NN VBN NNP NNP VBD TO VB DT NN IN PRP VBD CC VBD CC MD RB VB NNP NNP VBD NN IN NNP CC PRP RB MD RB VB NNP NNP PRP VBD VBN CC VB PRP IN DT NNP NNP VBD RB VB PRP VBD DT NN NN TO VB DT NNP NNP DT NN NN VBD CC VBD DT NN IN NNP NNP RB PRP VBD IN DT CD NN NN TO DT NNP NNP NN NN VBD DT DT NN IN PRP IN DT NNP NNP CD NNS IN DT RB JJ DT NN VBD JJ .

She grabs her white lab coat from the coat hook. She turns back around and blows me and kiss. Then mom bolts out the door with her blonde hair blowing behind her. And I'm left in utter darkness.       I lurch forward in bed breathing heavily. I feel sweat trickling down my neck and my hair matted down my to my head. I glance at the clock: 12:31 P.M. My worries and fears of darkness begin to bubble up in my throat. I start breathing hard again feeling my asthma attack near. I grab my inhaler from my nightstand and suck in the medicine. I calm myself down and snuggle into bed. I close my eyes and whisper over and over, 'Mom please come home soon. Mom please come home soon. Mom please come home soon.'       Black darkness sweeps around my bed swallowing me whole. I bite my nails nervously still trying to get to sleep and out of this dark nightmare of reality. The wind rattles my window and I wish desperately that I wasn't alone in this house. I had many wishes really: I wish my fear of the dark would go away, I'm 13 for goodness sake, I wish mom wouldn't have the Scientist Lab's nightshifts, I wish I would quit dreaming that same stupid dream of mom leaving me forever in the dark of the night.       Rain begins to pour outside and my heart races faster. It's now 1:18 in the morning and still I haven't been able to get to sleep. I climb out of bed and shiver as my feet touch the cold floor of my bedroom. I run over to my door and I open it as well as turning on the lights. I shove my cold feet in my pink slippers and quietly pad down the hall.       I turn on all the lights in the house just so I'll breathe easier. I walk into the panrty to snatch a peanut butter cookie and a chip bag. I slide into the chair at the table and slowly chomp down on my midnight snack. I glance at the clock again: 1:34. I sigh agrivated at how slow Father Time is going. I rummage around in the drawers for a flashlight. I contemplate on wether I should sneak into my mom's lab downstairs or leave it be.       Thoughts swarm my mind: I've never really been in her lab before, GO GRACE! This is your one chance to see what your mom has been working on, you're such a bad daughter Grace, go on Grace, it will be fun! I take a deep breath and make my way downstairs. I flick on the lights and the dim lighting of my mom's lab encaves me. I grab the flashlight from my pocket and click it on. I walk over to a wooden work table in the middle of the lab. A metal body was lying there. The yellow eyes were dim and dead. I look over to the shelves for an ON switch but all I see are shelves and shelves of test tubes filled with blue or red or green liquid.       Bottles line her desk with long words of chemicals I don't recoginize. Well yes, the test tubes and bottles and magnifying glasses do look cool... but the metal thingy lying on the table really caught my attention. I walk back over to the table cautiously, afraid I will break the metal thing. I see a paper lying next to the metal. A lot of words was on the page but at the top it said Grace 500. My heart warms as I realize she named this metal thing after me! I stroke the metal and I realize from this angle that this pile of metal looks like a robot...       I smile and realize that all these years of me argueing with my mom of quitting her job and spending more time with me that she was really doing something useful. All this time she was making a robot! A ROBOT! I smile again contently not wanting to bother her studies anymore. I turn around and turn off the flashlight. As I turn of the lights in the lab my breasthing quickens again. I feel in my pocket for my inhaler. I'm surrounded by dark again.       I'm ready to bolt for the stairs when a bright yellow light shudders on from the middle of the room. The light flickers on and off for a secong before it gets stable and strong and bright. I turn back on the lights of the lab to see a robot sitting up on the table. 'He-lo,' the robot says. I wave kind of scared. I back away slowly toward the stairs. 'My na-me is Gr-ace 5-00,' Grace 500 says. It jumps down from the table and crawls toward me. 'I am yo-ur pro-tect-or in the ni-ght,' Grace 500 says slowly.       Tears well up in my eyes as I realize my mom's intentions. She mad a robot for me as a companion at night while she is gone! I hug Grace 500 when all of a suddent the light turns off and the robot goes limp in my arms. I lay gently back on the table just as I hear the front door open. I run up the stairs excitedly and jump into my mom's arms. 'I love your job mom!' I say, 'And dont't you ever QUIT it!'

One morning when he woke up he noticed a strange smell and sound. He looked outside his window and he was looking at his city and noticed that there was a strange,big hole right in the middle of the town. He quickly put on his clothes and headed out. Everyone that lived in the town gathered around. Boblina was the mayor so everyone backed away slowly. There is was a brown,funny looking object right in the middle. The object suddenly moved and out popped the biggest,black eyes ever. The object suddenly said,'Hello my name is H.P49685, you can call me H.P for short'. Everyone in the town suddenly said ,'oooooooooooooooooooooooo'. Then Boblina stepped in and he said, ' Why have you come here'. H.P answered, ' I am from the planet Earth and I have come to rescue each and every one of you.'Everyone was startled by what he said and they were all like 'Why'.

You find out you have broken you arm and will need four stitches.             Once you are in your hospitail room you suddenly hear the squeek of small whells. You look around confused and hear a stiff vocie say, ' Your delevery is here' 'Who said that?' you stutter out. the vocie just repeates the same line. You look down and see a small square figuar with big wheels on either saide.In the middle two eyes and a mouth and two arms extending up to you with a tray that has your pills and a cup of watter ! 'whoah, a robot!' you exclaim. You take the pills and try to talk to the bot but before you could say anything there was a shimmer or light and the robot was replaced with a life sized man!' where did you come from?' you question the mysterous man. ' i come from a land of fortune and happiness' he said with a sly smile on his lip         	NNS RB JJ DT , PRP VBG PRP$ NN IN DT NN WRB DT DT JJ PRP VBP DT NN NN CC PRP VBP RP DT NN CC VB PRP NNP PRP VBP TO VB TO DT NN CC VB PRP VBD NNP NNP VBP RP PRP VBP VBN PRP VBP CC MD VB CD NNP NNP PRP VBP IN PRP$ NN NN PRP RB JJ DT NN IN JJ NNP NNP NN IN JJ CC JJ DT NN NN VB , '' NNP NN VBZ RB POS JJ VBD IN .

We were excited to built it but, it didn't turn on. We put it outside because we thought it would be hit by lightning,it did. it was alive. We saw when it got hit,we thought it was a dream.       Then in the morning something was outside of my door. I went to go see what it was. I opened the door and I saw the robot that me and maria built. I was surprised that it was alive! I got my phone and called her, she came running to my house.        Can you do any thing ? It responded yes I can do your chores,carry food to you, do your home work ,make a garden. We named it Joey and every time we would call joey ,he would be right there. We showed all our friends that were close. They were amazed by the things he could do.        When my  parents came from there work  I showed them my new robot an what it could do. They said  that it was OK to have the robot around the house. I said thank you mom and dad! I said to maria that you could have jJoey for a month and I could have joey for the next month. We both agreed to the plan and that's how it went for a year      That's was my story about My new Robot.

Then some robots are just used for fun... such as using it for a pet cat, dog, dinousour, maybe even a rhino or something! the dog and cat actually have real animal abilities... they have fake fur that actually feels real! they need attention just like a real animal, they can even lick you like a real cat, or dog would. they cost must be very expensive though.          Their is robots for the community too, maybe for a fire in a house or building or something... so if there were a burning building or house you could send the drone right in to see if anyone was still in the burning house or building, and they would even know exactly where the person is .           Robots are used for many different things.. they can br helpful and just for fun                               	NNP VBP DT NN IN JJ NNS IN NNS .

He walked over to see what is was.      The object was weird shaped, it was all metal, and it was there just by itself. Bill, the boy, who had been a major in science in college studied the object and found a number on the side which was long enough to be a phone number. Bill called the number and a person from a scientist lab picked up the phone and Bill described what the object looked like and where it was found. The man on the other end of the phone had no clue what Bill was talking about, bur the scientist asked Bill to bring the object to their lab anyway so they could study it.      When Bill arrived at the scientist's lab they brought the object into their study room. The scientist's and Bill who had also been a major in science examined the object. They had realized the object was all metal, weirdly shaped, and had camera's on it. These were all characteristics of the object being a robot! One of the scientist's friends knew a guy who studied robots and called him and told him what they found and the guy who studied robot told him it sounded like a robot!      Now that they knew it was a robot they had to figure who created the robot and what its purpose was. Bob, the head scientist, started taking the robot apart and studding each piece. Bill and Gary, one if the other scientist's, were studding other robots seeing if they had anything in common with the one they found.     The scientist's left that night and came back the next morning. When they got to their lab they found something unusual about the robot it was put back together and moving around! They walked around looking at it when they found Bill asleep on the ground. 'Bill stayed here all night and got the robot up and moving' shouted Gary. A couple days later the scientist's found out the robot was used to help doctors and nurses deliver medicine to patients. The scientist's took the robot to a local hospital and asked if they needed it. The hospital took the robot and ended up naming it Mr. Gower.      The hospital kept Mr.Gower for many years after that until one day he just crashed. Bill, Bob, Gary, and everyone at the hospital miss Mr.Gower very much.

Today im going to be telling you about my to very close friends Gemini-Scout and Dante 2. im going to tell you about me a little bit first. Mr. Gower's which is me i can do many stuff like talk, drive, and im very strong. I also can deliver medicane to people in hospitals that where i usually am most of the time.           Gemini-Scout       My friend Gemini-Scout is remote controlled he does search and rescue missions. He also goes deep down into mines and rescues injured people. Gemini-Scout can also carry food and water he also can drag people out to saftey.       Dante 2       My also very good friend Dante 2 is a very intresting robot with a intresting job. He climbs into valcanoes to gather info for scientists. Dante 2 looks for vents or holes in the crater. Then he collects info. he climbs like a spider to. When scienstists cant go in the valcano Dante 2 goes in. Know scientists can learn more about valcanoes.

It can also tell people when the gas in mines are safe to go in, it can go into water to.        If I had a robot I would want it to do my home work, chores, go to school for me, and clean my room. If I were to build one it would be purple with different tvs and the  different tvs would play my favorite movies. And it would be able to skype my family in different countrys. It would be really long and wide and it would  grow taller everytime I grow taller so I would be the perfect hieght to watch movies and skype.         My robot would teach me how to speak french, and italian.

They were setting up a contest to see who would win the prototype of the experiment and almost everyone wanted to enter it. The prototype was the only one they were ever gonna make. The robot was not alive and it didn't do much. It was called ProBot XL and it was a cleaner. 'Its not a live robot' said the scientists 'all that it does is clean'. But that was only what the scientists thought. The contest winner didn't know what she was in for. The contest winner was a nice girl with light brown hair, gray blue eyes and a pretty, bright smile. Her name was Ally Brooks. She entered the contest to get the ProBot XL for her mom because she was only fourteen. Her mom said that Ally needed it more than she did so that her daughter could clean her room with it. The first night Ally had the robot she tested it out. It worked great. She left the ProBot plugged in so it could charge while she slept, unfourtunatlly, There was a power outage that night. When she woke up the robot would not turn on. She took the robot downstairs to ask her dad for help because he was a mechanich. He managed to fix it perfectly so se took the robot back upstairs. She plugged in the robot to se how well her dad had fixed it. There was a spark. The lights started flickering and then BOOM the lights went out. She herd a voice. At that point Ally was scared out of her skin. 'Hello' said the strange voice. 'Who are you!' shouted Ally. Suddenly the lights came on and she saw she was the only one in the room. She THOUGHT. 'I was only imagining it' said Ally to herself. 'Imagining what?' there was the voice again. Ally was scared to death at this point. She saw movement out of the corner of her eye and she jumped to grab her phone to call 911. BBefore she could dial the number, ProBot came out of her closet. 'Y-you're a-alive' she stammered. 'Yes, of course' said ProBot. 'Y-you can t-talk?!' yelled Ally. 'Of course I can!' said ProBot. Ally was half scared and half fascinated at that moment. 'Im ProBot' said ProBot after a long pause 'what's your name?'. 'My name is Ally' answered Ally amazed. 'Hello master Ally' said ProBot. 'You can just call me Ally' responded Ally a little calmer now. 'How did you come to life?' asked Ally. 'I don't really know, I mean, wasn't I always alive?' responded ProBot. 'Not until a minuet ago!' exclaimed Ally. 'Well then, lets have some fun! the scientists who created me programmed me for cleaning, didnt they?' said ProBot. 'Yes, how in the world did you know that?!' replied Ally. 'Well, it really is the duster and dustpan that gives it away, but it also is this maid dress that they put me in too, and im a boy! this is very offensive and demeaning!' answered ProBot. 'Oh' said Ally, feeling very dumb 'okay then, ProBot, what do you like to do for fun?'. 'Do you have any cats, I love casing around cats! im part robot dog, they ran out of parts for my brain, so they had to use robot dog brain instead.' said ProBot. 'If youre not supposed to be alaive, then why did they give you a brain?' said Ally curiously. 'I really do not know' said ProBot questioningly 'why did they give you a brain?'. 'I wasn't made by inventers like you were ProBot' said Ally 'I was made by...' Ally's mom was calling her down for dinner, it was pizza night and Ally did not want to miss that. 'What is pizza?' asked ProBot. 'It's my favorite food and I dont want to miss it so I got to go, i'll be back soon!' answered Ally. 'What is food?' asked ProBot, but Ally was already running down the stairs. After Ally had her pizza, she went back upstairs to her room to check on ProBot. 'Your noise machine would not stop beeping' sait ProBot annoyed 'it keeps saying 'you have one new call' and its driving me nuts!'. 'Sorry' said Ally 'let me check who the call was from.' The call was from the two scientists who invented ProBot to check that everything was all right. The message said: 'Hi! hope everything is going alright with our latest invension the ProBot XL please call us back for any inconveniance with the ProBot and feel free to return it if you dont like it. Call us back if you have any comments or questions! thanks!, bye. 'Inconveniance! what is so bad about me!' exclaimed ProBot. 'Nothing' said Ally 'lets go outside for a quick walk.' ProBot and Ally went on a nice long walk together and had a lot of fun. They got to know eachother and became best friends and ProBot finally got to go chase a cat just like he wanted to. ProBot and Ally became best friends from the day ProBot came to life and to the day ProBot ran out of batteries. Thankfully, ProBot didn't run out of batteries and Ally and ProBot lived happily ever after.

Billy Bob Fred George Jr.(konwn as Billy) was inside working on his science assingment. He was asked to bring in something that he could build, and could somehow move in varius dirrections. But he did not know how much of a succes his moving robot would be.                              He powered the robot up and installed some wheels. But suddenly, he thought something amazing. He could use his old ipod to record his voice! During this time, he brought out his unfineshed robot outside to cool. Right then, his mother called him in for dinner. Completely forgetting about his robot, it started to rain. With his family of 6 , they struck up in conversation.         'Today in school I learned about long division during  math class,' said Emily the 9-year-old, who, was very interested in learning.       'I practiced my multiplication tables' said Sammy, the 2nd grader, who thought School was fun, because he saw his friends.       'What about you, Billy? You learn lots of stuff in 5th garde, don;t you?' Asked their mother . 'Ehh', replied Billy.       'Molly?' asked mother. 'Oh! We learned about decimals and how to divide them,' said Billy's twin sister.           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!! Thuder struck. FLAAAASH!!!!!   Ligtning hit.  'MY ROBOT! Screamed Billy, running outside. His robot was smoking. Oh no! He dragged it inside, evryone crowding aroud. But then sonething happened that made everyone jump a foot off the ground.           *Greetings, friend* said the robot. *My name is powing-gi, the talking robot. Conversation continued until their bedtime. The next day, Billy was ready to bring his robot to school. On the way, all he heard was:       'Mom! Sammy's toutcing me!' Emily complained. 'Sammy, stop.' Ordered mother. 'Ha,ha,' whispered Emily, 'I can toutch you, but you cant toutch me!' 'MOM!' Screamed Sammy 'I heard that', she said calmly. 'Kids, please don't toutch eachother.' She said. 'Yes mommy', they said together drowsilly.               This was one of Billy's best days of school he ever had. He became the most popular kid.  Everyone had fun talking and playing with powing-gi all day.           And this, is how powing-gi came to life.

Jack was borde, very borde he did not know what to do so Jack climed up to his tree house and got out his note pad and started saying to him self 'I want to make a friend that can play with me one these boring days'.            So Jack started drawing pictures for his new creation. Then finally Jack screamed 'I am going to make a robot named Jack JR.'!!! Once he mfinished making Jack JR., Jack was very happpy with him self because Jack JR. was a magnificent creation. He was brown wit hbright blue eyes, he looked like a real person he could even talk too. He waws so excited for his new friend but there was only one problem Jack didn't want his parents to know about Jack JR. because he was afraid that his parents would take his special robot away. So before Jack can make his robot he needs to make a home for the robot so he climed down from his tree house and got some of his dad's tools (now don't worry Jack is very good with tools he won't get hurt or anything). Then Jack climed back up the latter of the tree house and started digging a whole right above the tree trunk. After he finished with the drilling he made a ELEVATOR!! just like that i dont know how but he did. And I almost forgot to tell you but Jack is a very inteligent young boy and not every mother and father get to have such an amazing child.           The reason for the elevator is to get down into Jack JR's home and let me tell you that Jack's creation is living the life because he has the BIGGEST house in the neighboorhood of Jack. After Jack showed Jack JK. the big house, Jack's mother called him inside because it was already 9:30 past his bed time. So Jack said 'Yes mommy I will be right there. So Jack tuked Jack JR. into his bed and tolled him 'I love you with all my heart I won't let anything happen to you got that? but you need to promise me that you do not get out of this bed until i come and let you. Because if you do I think my parents will take you away ok my nugget?' Jack JR. replied 'Yes creator I will not leave this bed because you said so and that I love you too and that I can't leave , you are my family so good night and see you in the morning when YOU come to wake me up ohh and love you too!               The next day Jack got up and ran out side to his elevator he keep on thinking about the night before, how much fun he had with Jack JR. and couln't wait for more fun. Jack got into the elevator to go down but once he got down there he saw the most terrible sight HIS MOTHER AND FATHER WERE DOWN THERE STAYRING AT JACK JR.!!!!!!! What was he sopost to do? this was what he wanted to avoide. Let me cut it short for you Jack did not get in trouble and he got to keep Jack JR. the best part was that Jack JR. got to stay inside the real house with Jack Jack'e mom and Jack's dad. So in the end everything turned out AMAZING for the whole family and for the first time in a long time Jack JR. felt like he was loved... and he LOVED IT!!!!....

This magic may never come back but this story is one for the future.       While Pablo Morris, a student who is on the Honour Roll in the East-Side Middile School that he attends. Decided, to give away his least favorite robot, Jordan, to his cousin, out of his 283 toys. You could straight away make the assumption that he was a spoiled brat, but he really was just a hard working 13 year old, that was always loved in his family of 4 sisters. (Sammy 25, Ariana 20, Louis 17, Morgan 15.) He decided to go to sleep at around 8 PM. Just after he finished his Clarinet practice. But, not even he could of imagined what happend the following night.       When the clock struck 2 AM, the weather turned bad. Rain started to fly in his window. He realised this straight away. As he shut the window down he rememberd how his rooms roof had a small hole. The bad thind that it was just over his bed. Now being one of the most naive kids in the world, he failed to report this to his father. As he was twisting and turning he heard his phone ring. As he answered it, the door bell rang. Being the quickest runner in his cross-country club, he managed to get to the door before his sister, Morgan. 'Awake already?' said Morgan with a twink of a smile. When they opened the door they were greeted by a gust of rain, and no sign of human life anywhere, 'Another ring and roll,' Said Pablo. 'I judt can't say how much I hate those kids!' replied Morgan not admitting that she had done a few before. 'Well good night,' said Morgan and Pablo replied in the exact same manner.       It was 2:30 just minutes later. And still he failed to return to sleep. Than he saw a flash. Aand then another, and another, and again. Expecting it was just lightneing he ignored it. But wait, where is the thunder? The flashed continued until Pablo had enough. Out he went and thereon his kitchen table he saw, Jordan and right nextto him was his best freind, Edin. Furios he grabbed Edin's arm and escorted him out without a peep. Next thing he knew was that Joran was on top of him. He just seconds later saw punches thrown all over his pale face. Stunned he blocked them only allowing one on his nose. BOOM! A window breaks. Following through was a rock. On the rock it was a sticky note. 'Pablo, I'm sorry he just didn't like being away from you.' Pablo read softly from the floor. Then when he was least expecting it a pain on his left thigh broke out. With a yelp he notcied that a metal thorn was in him. He had enough. With a bang Jordan smashed onto the wall. Amazed he realised that Jordan came back to his normal shape, but this time he learned from his mistake. Pablo just moments later had atleat 14 throns in his body.       The pain was aganizing. Jordan continued with his clever tactic. But, Pablo thought of a clever way to attack throw the thorns back on him. Next after being in complete pain just 16 seconds later he realised he won. But, that wasn't his main concern. His top concern was were was mom and dad. He looked everywhere. Than he rememberd. He had no dad or mom, he wasn't on the honour roll, he wasn't attending East-Side Middile, he doesn't play the clarinet, he had no sisters, he had no toys or a best friend. He was an orphan. Bursting into tears. This tears were the rain. There was no hole in the roof. The water was just his tears. He was just a 13 year old who had his life taken away, he did have all those things except one day when it was taken away by a fire, he was the only one to survive this fire, that killed his whole family except him. He was just a homeless 13 year old kid, living on the streets of Manchester, England.

'I don't like being the only child in the family and I really want someone that is a kid that I can play and talk to.' After Owen had fallen asleep his robot felt a little zap and thought Owen must be playing with me again. But then to his surprise he saw his own controller laying on the floor. 'I am moving by myself'he thought. 'I am free of my controller. Yipeeeeeeeee.'        In the morning Owen woke up to a whirring noise in his bedroom and thought 'what could that be.' When he opened his eyes he saw his beloved robot zooming all around his bedroom. 'I am free of my controller I am free of my controller' the little robot yelled. Owen was so over joyed he finely had something close to a real brother. 'We will have so much fun together' they screamed together.        'What should we do first' Owen asked. 'I would really like to taste some ice cream now that I am so independent' the little robot said. 'OK lets go to the Dary Qween down the road' Owen suggested. So off they went down the road to the Dary Qween. When they got there the robot asked 'what flavor is the best?' Owen said his favorite was the mint chocolate chip hot fudge Sunday. So they ordered a order of two mint chocolate chip hot fudge Sunday. The little robot thought his Sunday was delise. When they finished their Sundays Owen asked again 'what else should we do before we have to go to bed again? 'Lets go to the park'        Once they were at the park they took a nice long walk to burn off some of they fat from their Sundays. Then Owen showed his robot the play set. They had so much fun. They played pirates, cop and robber, macro polo, and hide and seek. But the thing that they had the most fun doing was seeing who could last the longest on the tire swing without getting sick. The little robot won this game because although he was independent of his controller one of the on things he didn't have was a sence of diseness. They played for hours in the park but when the sun started to go down they had to head home and go to bed.        When Owen and the little robot came home their mom said 'up to bed boys.' So Owen and the robot climbed the stares and went into Owen room. After Owen had gotten in bed and the little robot in his corner Owen said 'robot you are the best brother any one could ever have.'

It looked like my favorite Pokemon, Snivy. It started calling me papa like I was its Dad or something. So I called it Poke-bot. I thought it was adorable.             I called my mom upstairs to come look at it. I asked her 'Mom can I keep it pretty please' and she said 'Are you sure its a robot'? I kept nagging her and she said with a sigh 'Allright'. I took it in my room and I played with it and later it said 'I am your servant' and I thought That was AWESOME!           Then the next day I got up for school and it was making me breakfast and then mom said 'would you look at that it made  breakfast for you'. And I thought to myself this can be anything I want it to be. We pretty much lived without us having to do anything again and we lived happily ever after!

His newest robot was called, ' B46-13' it's job was to look after kids when there parents were gone, such as a nanny. Now you might think it's great to have a robot designer be you're dad, but you also have to test out all of them. Lucky for me, it was date night.           'Alex, will only be gone for 2 hours, it won't even seem like we left' My dad exclaimed.' But what if it goes haywire??!!' I argued. ' It won't! we've been working on this project for over 3 years!' My dad could not be convinced. They left, only leaving the B46-13, and me. ' Hello I am B46-13 but you can call me Sally' she said scratchily. 'Okay Sally, I'm Alex, can I have some dinner?' 'Sure thing, what should I cook?' She asked persistently. 'Oh! Um-mm...... Caviar and a hard boiled egg!' I said jubilantly. Those were my favorite foods. With a 'Whiz' and a 'Whirr' she shot out the food in 6 seconds flat!! 'I think we'll have a great time Sally'       Half an hour later, I was laying on the couch groaning from all of the food Sally had cooked for me. 'It is time for bed Alex.' Sally told me. 'Are you kidding?' I replied. ' It's only 8:00!!' 'ALEX BED NOW!!!' She screamed. 'AH! Okay!!' I bolted up the stairs as quick as I could. She tucked me into bed and told me if I got out of my room by even an inch, there would be serious consequences, and I knew she was serious. 'There has to be a way to reach dad!' I thought. Then it hit me, my cell phone!!! I dashed across the room, careful to not make a sound. I picked up the phone, and dialed dad's number as quickly as possible. 'Dad, there's a problem with the robot.'       'Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Johnston!' Sally said with a digital smile, ' Alex is in bed.' 'Sally.... you have been a bad robot, so it's time for you to be shut down. Forever.' Dad said as he reached for her power button. 'NOOoooo.......' Sally yelled as she shut down. 'OH ALEX!' that meant that it was safe to come down, and there wasn't a pyscopath robot anymore. 'Yes dad?' I replied. ' Your mom and I were talking on the way home, and we've decided that never again will we try out my new robots on you.' My dad said with a grin. 'WAHOO!' I yelled. I was free!!       	-NONE- POS NNP NN VBZ CD IN DT NNS IN NNS DT NNS WDT MD VB NN NN NNS , IN NN PRP$ NN , CC VBG DT NNP NNP JJS NN VBD VBN , '' -NONE- '' PRP VBZ NN VBD TO VB IN NNS WRB EX VBZ VBD VBN , JJ IN DT NNP NNP PRP MD VB PRP VBZ JJ TO VB DT NN NN VB PRP VBP JJ , CC PRP RB VBP TO NN IN DT IN NNP NNP IN PRP , PRP VBD NN NNP NNP , MD RB VB VBN IN CD NNS , PRP MD RB RB VB IN PRP VBD '' NNP NN NNP '' CC WP IN PRP VBZ NN . . . .

Thats how George felt when he was going to make his very first robot. He wanted his robot to do his chores and clean his room for him. So Goerge started to find out how to make the robot that he dreamed of. George searched the web, and finally made a solution. Once he found how to make the robot of his dreams, he started to build it.            It took George a while to make his dream robot. He had to buy the correct materials for his dream robot. Then, George had to fit the pieces together, which took a while. After that, George had to program the robot for it to clean his room and do his chores. George was almost done making his dream robot!                 Sooner or later, George was finished making his dream robot. George was so extatic to see how his dream robot would work out. The only thing that was left of the robot was how to turn it on. He thought and thought about how to make the robot turn on. After a while, George gave up. George couldn't think of any way to make his robot work, so he left it in his basement storage and forgot all about his robot.                 Five years later, when George was fifteen, he went to his basement storage to donate his clothes. George was digging into the stoage room for clothes, when he found his dream robot lying on top of a pile of his old clothes. Once George found his dream robot, he went out in the thunder, lightning, and rain to bury his dream robot for a time capsule. The rain washed off all of the rust on the robot's body. He then ran inside and looked for some more of his old clothes.              Later in the day when there was still the thunderstorm, a strike of lightning shook the ground where George's dream robot was. Boom, Crash, Bang! Suddenly the lightning struck at Goerge's dream robot, and George's dream robot came to life! The robot started to push itself out of the mud, and run towards George's house. George was so astounded when he saw his robot come to life! He hugged his dream robot, and his dream robot hugged him back. Finally George had someone for helping him with his chores and clean his room for him, but not only that, he had a friend.                  When George got older, he let his son play with George's robot. George's son loved George's robot, just like George did when he was a kid. George's son wanted George's robot to have a friend to play with when they were gone. So George and his son made a little robot for George's robot. This robot was named Jeffery. Jeffery also did chores and he cleaned rooms. Those two robots were maids, but they were also best friends with George and his son.

The thunder shook the lab as John worked on his top secret project that he code named Project Z. John was a scientist that always worked alone. Nobody knew what Project Z was, not even his best friends and family. Only John knew. He tried to keep Project Z as secret as he could. Many people questioned him every day about what he was doing, but he gave them the same answer every time; 'The usual.' Nobody was worried that he was doing anything bad, even though he was a very mysterious man. 'Finally finished!' said John. 'Time to show the world what great power I really have!' he said as he put the finishing touches on Project Z.                BOOM!!!! The whole town was in chaos. Someone or something was causing this chaos, but nobody knew what it was. People were crying for help, cars were being crushed, and buidings were being destroyed. 'What's happening??' a little boy screamed as a building collapsed right before his eyes. The boy looked up, and nearly fainted. It was the most terrifying thing he has ever seen...                 Before his eyes stood the biggest looking creature the world had ever seen. No...it wasn't a creature, a robot!! It was 50 stories tall, a head the size of a blue whale, and eight long legs much like a spider. With each step it took, the whole earth would shake and people fell to the ground. 'Hahahaha!' John laughed evily as he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. 'With the power of Project Z, I will rule the world forever!!!!' John shouted. 'This can't be happening!' the little boy screamed. But it was happening, and it was about to get a whole lot worse.                  ZOOOOM! Something whizzed by the little boy's head as he took cover from Project Z. No way, he thought. The things that whizzed by his head were just what no one expected. Smaller versions of Project Z, that could fly!! The town was in a panic. People were storming the streets trying to evacuate, huge pieces of debris were flying everywhere, and everything was being destroyed! I have to do something, thought the boy. But what? He thought for a moment, and then he knew exactly what to do. Go to the lab.                  The boy saw John walk to his lab every day, so he knew exactly where it was. Sprinting as fast as he could, he reached the lab and entered through the door. What a strange place, the boy thought as he walked through the lab. Random wires and viles of strange substances were laying around everywhere. The place was an absolute mess! 'I have to find out what's controlling the robot,' said the boy. Then he saw it. A huge computer the size of an elephant stood before him. I have to figure out how to stop this thing! He looked around everywhere until he saw a little red button on the side of the computer. Shut down, it read. The boy pressed the button and he heard a voice. 'Shutting down in 10,' it said. '9. 8. 7...' 'Stop!! yelled John as he entered the room.                   John ran over and shoved the boy out of the way. '3. 2...' 'Noooo!' shouted John. 'Shut down complete.' said the voice. The little boy was a hero.                  In the end, the cops rushed over to the lab, arrested John, and everyone lived happily ever after.

I did'nt really get lonely, when I did I would just keep reading and ignore my feeling like I did'nt even feel them             Everybody at school just ignored me. Sometimes I would just watch them laughing, and giggling wishing that I would have some friends eventually. I used to get really worked up and I did'nt know what to do with my emotions so I decided to just write a letter to my grandmother how I felt. My Grammy died about a year ago and it was the worst thing that ever happend.             When I go to dance class everything feels better like they only emotions I can feel when I am there are happy, joyful ones. All of the girls are nice with big kind hearts just filled with love.              I really like wearing my costume because it symbolises my Grammy is okay. When she died she told me she would send me butterflies signaling that she was okay in heaven.On my dress there are some many butterflies it is just filled with them. It makes me feel really happy when I wear my dress because I kow that she is happy and that is the best feeling in the world.             The next day I was reading and a girl walked by and tripped. She was really snotty and rolled her eyes. After this other girl came over and sat next to me. She asked if I was okay and said she has seen me around. She does'nt have any friends either. She then said wow isn't middle school great in a sarcastic voice and then we both giggled.She told me to meet her at the ice cream parlor a block away from school in the afternoon. I exitedly said yes.             When I got there she had yet to arrive. I wasn't worried because she seemed like a very nice girl. About five minutes later she arrived and said she was sorry she was late. We both walked up to the counter and asked for a kiddie cone vanilla with raindow sprinkles. We were really creaped out we had ordered the same thing without even planning it.

Then all of the sudden, Sidney (Joey's little sister) ran at us screaming bloody murder! She ran to Joey and held his leg with all her might, crying. All of us asked ' why are you crying?'            She said while crying 'my toy robot came to life and scared the crap out of me and started demolishing all of my things in my room!' So we all went running to Sydney's house to see the robot and stop it!            After we just entered the door to check it out we saw something unbelievable! The robot didn't destroy anything and it was sitting at the table playing with an apple. We were so amazed at what we saw, but not as amazed as Joey was. Because he fainted, so we told my parents and told them what happened.              They told us to put it in a cage and put it in the car. So we did, and got in the car with it. When the parents got in the car they said we were going to the science lab of  NH. Boy I hated science but I loved science when I heard there was money involved. I could not wait to get my hands on a million dollars.               When we showed it to the scientist they were amazed and said that they would analyze it and make more for people to buy. They said thank you and wrote us a check for $500,000. Which I was disappointed, that was not the amount of money I expected!                  So after ten years past I bought that same exact robot back when they made more robots!

Finally when she looked at the clock for the tenth time it said four o'clock and she got up and ran to where she put it yesterday when she played with it.        She got down on her hands and open the closet door where her robot cat should have been, but it wasn't there!  When Jenny turned around there was Poof, but he didn't look like himself.  He looked alive!  Jenny knew that Poof wasn't alive because she remembered that just last week when she went to the store to buy him.         Poof crawled nearer Jenny, curled into a ball and sat on her lap. Then Jenny screamed the loudest she has ever screamed!        Her mom rushed out of her bedroom and yelled, 'What is going on here?'        Jenny replied, 'P-p-p-p-poof, he has a b-b-b-beating heart!'        Jenny's mom calmly said, 'That's rediculas,' then she thought again and said, 'Let me see him I will see if he eats, breaths and has a beating heart.'        Jenny sat there and waited for about fifteen minutes then her mom returned and said fightened , 'You were r-r-r-right he is living, but that's imposible because we went to the store and bought him just last week.'        Jenny answered,'I guess anything is possible, Mom.'        They both went into the kitchen and played with the real Poof, and he was actually very fun, just as fun as the robot Poof!  Now Jenny's mom said that she had to take caare of him, buy the food get a litter box and get him a cage. Jenny agreed to all of that because she wanted to keep Poof.         Poof stayed with Jenny's family for a long, long time andlove Jenny very much, but Jenny's family never found out how Poof turned into a really cat.

Suddenly, a single, bright light comes on above me. A man's voice says, 'The operation is complete.'          The man leaves through a door. I can't help but think that I have to get out of here.Then, for the first time i realize that i have no memories before i woke up in here. In fact, I don't even know my own name. I struggle to get out of the chair I'm strapped to. It almost feel like leather. then i feel a small prick and everything fades.              I jolt upright in bed and say,' It was just a dream.' But then i realize it wasn't. I'm not in my bed, I'm in a metal dentist chair. with straps. in a dark room. with a single light over my head. I remember that i can escape through the door the man went through. I run over and fling the door open. there is a room with a window, chair, and table. In the heat of the moment i grab the chair and toss it at the window.it shatters and i jump through into a field if long, yellow grass. I decide to run around the corner of the building. I sprint around the corner right into a girl. we both fell into the grass.   'Who are you and what are you doing at a robot lab?' she says.   'i don't know and i don't know.'   'well then, follow me if you want to live.'           She she said she was taking me to a shack about a mile away. while we were walking i learned that her name was max and she lived with three boys and another girl. Their names were Jay, Tom, Gary, and Angel. they were outcasts from a utopia named Farfal. A mad man created a dream inducer in which you could enter your mind and 'lucid dream'.        when we reached the shack she went in first and called out, 'I think its him.' she then explained,' for months we have been getting a report of someone we would find at the lab who would save the world. and we think its you.   'you escaped from that place, right? because if you did, there is only one explanation:   'you are a world saving robot.'

One day little Timmy was playing with his robot toy.   His robot looked like a small version of him. It looked like this: It had bright blue eyes, a striped red and green shirt, and had dark green shoes.   But this one day was different...Much different.   The reson this day was different was because it was scorching hot, but that is not the odd part. The odd part was that It was winter.   So anyway Timmy was playing with no fear at all. Unfortunately   this was no happy day. In fact it would be the last day Timmy would ever see his parents.   It was the end of the day when Timmy was getting home and in stead of seeing his home he saw a pile of rubble. He was so   frightened that he started to cry. He ran inside the pile of rubble and tried to find his parents. They were not there. He dropped his robot toy, and wept for hours and hours.   The next day Timmy decided to search the rubble some more   after searching for what seemed like an eternity he found a slip of paper. Surprised and mad at himself for missing it before he yell,'What the heck!!'He picked up the slip of paper that seemed to be in the middle of his broken room. He read the note. It said.   Dear, Timmy   we are sorry the house is gone and we are no longer there. We are probably dead if you are reading this. But we must make this brief   You are to become an alien hunter. That is what your father did and that is what you must do. Never let enithing get this note. There is a list of all the alien fugitives.   We will never forget you Timmy. We are proud and will always    love you.   Your, mom and dad.   And with that Timmy had no more parents.   Later in lif Timmy became an enginer/alien hunter, but what ever he did he always charished that one robot. He eventualy made it 5ft 7in and it still looked the same.   The year 4000,March 22   It was timmys birth day and Timmy was looking forward to it even though it was 4000 Timmy still haden't aged a bit. he had gone through most of the alien list(He only had 3 more aliens to go.) He had given himself super powers and oh yeah he was fighting an alien at the moment. It was more like he was talking with it. He figured he could trick it.   His super powers were (and I should probly get this done quick)   he could shape shift his robot he had made so it looked as if it were alive, He could make things apper with his mind, and he could mind control.   So he is fighting the alien and all of a suden the alien is done   talking and he spits a ball of nukular waset at Timmy. It misses and hits his robot instead the robot is blasted bakward and hits a pipe.   The pipe bursts and sprays water all over the robot. Timmy ran to the robot and let the alien get away. The robot that by the way is named Jason sits up, Timmy says,' Are you ok.' and instead of giving a blue light that meens ok. It says,' I am ok' Timmy looks dumb founded. HIS ROBOT WAS NO LONGER A ROBOT IT WAS ALIVE!!!

But in a way, I'm glad it happened.               It was Wednesday. My usual shift had just started. We were trying, without much luck, to successfully create a certain robot named Buddy. The name didn't stand for anything, but we just decided to name it Buddy. I was standing over our first completed and safe robot for the experiment. It was just me and the  small robot. It looked like a  robotic kinkajou. I was extremely bored, so I started to mix the ingredients I thought was needed. I got so into my experiment, I didn't notice that my partner had just arrived. He put his hand on my shoulder. I jumped so hard, I dropped my experimental mix on the robot. I gasped as the robot started to shift and turn. It dramatically jjiggled and then came to a silent pause. I gasped in surprise as the robot came to life.                                                                                       The small robot sat up. It looked right at me, shakily stood up, jumped, and the next thing I knew, it was sitting on my shoulder making a strange purring noise. My partner came to get a better look. The robot made a hissing noise at him and took out a knife as if trying to protect me. 'What are you going to name it' he asked. I thought about it. ' I think that I'm going to name it...Tiny Thor.' My lab partner laughed, ' Tiny Thor? That actually fits!''  I smiled as it purred even louder at it 's new name. 'Maybe tomorrow we can see what this little guy can really do,'' I thought. My little protector. My LLittle Thor.                The next day I hurried into the lab. Little Thor was sitting on the counter staring off into space. He noticed me and gave me what looked like a makeshift smile. ''Are you ready to let us see what you can do?'' I laughed as he made little fists and made little punching gestures. 'Ready?' I threw an apple at him. He jumped high into the air, pulled out two little knives, and split the apple into tiny pieces before it  even hit the ground. We spent hours discovering what Little Thor could do.  I was sorry that I couldn't take him home with me, but  I didn't even get out the door when a mob of angry people attacked the lab.                 I screamed and ran back into the testing area where we kept Little Thor. I grabbed him and ran out the back. The mob haad broken through the front door and was flooding into the small building. Little Thor started to growl. I looked back and saw that they had started to gain on us. I pushed faster. Little Thor was tensing in my arms as I ran down the hall. He  jumped out of my arms and stood in the middle of the hall. He shoved me out of the building, locked the door, turned around, and pressed his delete button. The whole building was blown up within seconds. I stood there, shocked that he had commited suicide to save me. I heard a small noise, I looked down and saw the  tattered body of Little Thor.               I ran over to him. I could tell that he was dying, eventhough he was a robot, he still felt the pain of the explosion. He slowly closed his eyes and his small robotic body went limp.I was about to cry when I remembered that I still had what made him come to life in my lab coat. Through tears, I poured a drop a waited. Then a buzzing noise came on, a slight purr, and Little Thor came back to this world again.

The robot had a to collect space rocks in Mars. Until strange people in space ships came and attacked Earth. Now buildings had fallen down, only a few people had survived the attack. The robot was destroyed and we had to build it again it had a problems trying to build it. Finally it was fixed and the robot had a new mission and we have improved it. It is more powerful and it now can save peoples lives, collect data and even information, and it is very smart. It took us a 2 years to build it and it has become my best work yet.                Now we had to rebuild houses again and and save peoples lives. The robot helped rebuild houses. Saving peoples lives  it was not easy the robot went underground to drag people to safety it was dangerous for us. I saw some strange people and research them, the robot had brought me data to work on. now the robot and other people were building houses and planting plants.Now it was good the robot has completed the mission and I finish doing my research. The robot was sent into this strange planet there were the same people I have researched I was seeing what was going on because the robot had a camera. I could tell the robot was going to be saved because it had weapons just in case if it was going to be attacked.                    It was hard to tell what language they were speaking the robot could speak to and it told us that wanted to control the world so our robot was helpful it took down the strange people. This robot was robot was helpful it has helped us so robots are helpful and the robot was destroyed so I would never forget this robot.

She goes down stairs and her dad is making breakfasts, bacon and eggs. Rachel is eating her breakfast, then her robot came in, she looks like a dog, her name is Cinnamon, she comes racing in and is going in circles around Rachel's chair, she picks up Cinnamon and pets her then looks at the clock, shes going to be late! She puts down Cinnamon and runs out the door to the bus stop, almost missing the bus but got on just in time. About 20 minuets later Rachels dad leaves to go to work, you her the the car outside leaving the driveway, now Cinnamon is the only one left in the house. She goes upstairs and lays in her bed for a while then at around 10:00 she was very board, so she decided to explore the house.

What the boy saw was what  he saw unfinished robot before leaving finished.The robot looked like it was made by professional and the little boy thought of it as his invention.Once the day came of taking the robot to the science fair the boy didn't want to take him because the winner had to sell the invention to the judges if they wanted to.So the young boy was torn apart he did not know what to do sell him to make money or keep to be with him forever.At the end he discovered super cool powers the robot had,for example talking,running,and he even could help do homework and decided to keep him.All in all one should never give important things in life for money just because they want some money in their pocket.

When we were driving it got super hot and we had to stop by and buy some ice cream. It took us half a day to get there.We finally got there and dropped of our stuff and went to bed because it was closed. The next morning we woke up and got ready we went downstaris in the hotel to get some breakfast.After that we headed out to go on the rides and see the characters.When we were walking we stoped by and we took pictures with some of the characters like mickey/minnie mouse and pigglet from winnie the pooh. We also went on the rides.When it started getting dark we headed to the hotel to rest. In the morning we got dressed and got breakfast and went out side. My robot and i went to the swimming pools and on the water rides. We also learned how to surf. Then it got night and went to the hotel. In the morning we finally left home.

He wanted me to make a replica (that works) of a Gemini-Scout robot. While preparing to make it I had to get specific supplies from the Robot Science Company. My dad bought a package that had the instructions and pieces for making the robot. In the picture, Gemini-Scout looked easy to build. When we opened the package there was a lot of small pieces, and their was a lot of huge pieces. I realized that it was going to be really complicated. Days past and we only finished the remote control. He had to go to work, so the rest of the summer I figure I could work on it alone. It was really hard for me to figure out how to read the instructions. I eventually figured it out how to read it.                 One day, I decided to stop for awhile because I really needed help. I would play basketball, soccer or read. My sister had finally came up to me one day when I was bored. She told me, ' If you are so bored, then why don't you just work on the robot you promised dad you would finish'. I was thinking about it for awhile but I responded ' Maybe sometime else'.  She just walked away. When my mom came home we got a call. It was my dad! He called us from the campsite he was working at. He told us that they moved him to a different site in Brazil. After awhile of talking to him he said he really wanted to know how I was doing with his robot. I told him,' I really haven't had time lately, but I will start working on it soon. He replied ' I would really like to test it out over here in Brazil, I hope you can finish it before I leave. It will help us a lot over here'. He hung up the phone after that because it was morning over there.                 The next day, I decided t work on the project. I had to use the screwdriver, a hammer , a torch, a mask, and a drill. The problem was that I forgot where I left them. I searched for them all day and finally at seven o'clock I found them. My sister told me to work on it tomorrow. The next day all I did was work on Gemini-Scout. I ended up finishing it. I called my dad to tell him I finished but he did not answer. His manager answered and told me to install all the needs it needed. He explained to me that it is supposed ti have a thermal camera, it has to be able to test the air, and be able to find trapped miners. I told him I had all of that. Then he explained that a rock had trapped my dad's group inside a mine and they needed the robot i made. I was so worried when they came to collect it.                   I got nervous because it was seven days since I talked to my fathers manager. Then, all of a sudden the phone rang. I ran straight to it so I could answer before my sister. My dad's maneger told me that they were working on getting them out and that my robot Gemini-Scout was very helful for finding them. They called two days later saying that they brought them out of the mine. I was very proud of myself for making a successful robot.                      At the end, my dad came home from the campsite and he was really glad that I finished Gemini-Scout in time. He told me that its important to finish things as soon as possible because you never know what will happen. I was really glad that my dad came but I was very glad for my success with the robot Gemini- Scout. Its was best for me b to try a new thing  with my dad because it can help more to be creative.

I remember what happened that day, I was around 15 minutes late, I walked in, 'Your late again' Dani said, one of my friends (the leader of the club) as I took a seat. 'So moving on, well as you all know next week we will present our own stories to the class and the class will pick the best story. And the one with the best story will get their story published in the school's newspaper.' Dani said.        'Yes!! Finally, I have been waiting for this for a long time!!' I said in my mind.         -After School-       While I was walking to my house from school, I keeped thinking and thinking of what i should write about. Untill I came across a bus stop with a little robot on it, then it hit me! 'I could write about a robot, but of couse I have to make it do things that people really never expect from a robot.'

Then she went to go tell her parents that she had a project to do.Gracie has a special talent.She can communicate with animals,for example:birds,mice,cats,dogs,horses,ETC.So every time she sings the animals come to her.

People didnt see it only because it was under a long palm tree.It was a cleaning robot and it cleaning like millions of trash of the floor every hour that is so fast it is.       2.First,So one day there was a girl named caitlin and she was going to the park with her family to have a good evening picnic.And her and her family went to the park and was enjoying there picnic like at  3:00 o'clock.Suddenly they hear a loud BOOM and it was the cleaning robot it was cleaning every single thing like trash,cans thrown on the floor for a example of litering.       3.Next,so when they saw the robot cleaning they were shocked and didnt realize what is was.Then they saw it was a cleaning robot and that it was cleaning. Caitlin's brothers and sisters were terrified of  it they thought it was scary.       4.So later that evening everyone in the park noticed the there was a robot and they started to take pictures of the robot like it was famous.And so like a hour or so half of the people left and the robot left the park and the people that wanted to see the robot were upset.And later everyone disapered and it went back to like a normal day with caitlin and her family.

I am going to tell you what some robots do to help humans. Robots can help save lives, help the doctors, work in mines, and work on farms. I'm going to tell you about how robots can come alive.                  The first robot that I am goimg to tell you about is the Gemimi-Scout Robot. The Gemini-Scout Robot is a remote-controlled robot. It does search-rescue working mines under the ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and it even has wheels. It can roll in water, it carries food, water, and other supplies. The robot may be small, but very strong. The Gemini-Scout collects information, wherever it goes.  The robot uses the thermal camera to find the miners. The second robot I'm going to tell you is the Dante  2 robot.  This robot has a very interesting job. It climbs into volcanoes to gather information. It is built to survive very high heat.  The next robot is the Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower works in the hospitals, helping nurses and docters by bringing medicine to patients.  He is so strong, he can pull 500 pounds.  Mr. Gower can even say hundreds of words to patients. The last robot iI'm goimg to tell you about is the Agribots. The Agribots ia the robots that picks the fruit. They can even grow plants with out any help. The Agribots are so smart, they can even tell when a plant is ripe, ready to eat, or if it needs more time to grow.            So now do you belive me. Robots are real, their not just made up. Just like the robots I just told you about, they are real just go to Mount Spurr, an active volcano in Alaska.

There are many more robots that can do intresting things like Mr.Gower,Dante 2,and Agribots.                 Would in it be cool if you can play with robots?Well you could because there was a robot named Robbie.Robbie always have time to play,he loves to have adventures with children.Robbie is an endless source of fun!Robbie is a babysitter,the person that Robbie babysits loves Robbie so much.There are many other robots that can sing and dance.                    There is one robot that is a car,its is a self-driving car.The self-driving car is called a Google car.A guy is behind the wheel this name is Chris Urmson.His hands were on his lap while the car was driving itself.Urmson has been working on the technology for close to a decade.He had managed a car ,but the Google's vechicle has brought his a leap forward.

I yelled at the top of my lungs. I couldn't believe my family left me home alone with this monster. He looked exactly like my dad but i knew that the wasn't. Russel was much more pale and bony. i could tell that he wanted to hurt me. who could blame him, he was like my personal slave.             My dad is a scientist and had an invention that he wanted to try out at our house. The experiment was called Russel and he was a robot. He could bake, clean, and do anything you wanted. He seemed like the most perfect servant ever. Until, one day he stopped working. My dad said he blew a fuse when he was trying to dance and that he would go to the lab and get more parts. As soon as my dad left, Russel started to spark. I didn't think it was important so i went upstairs and took a nap.             I woke up wit a start. My room was all smokey and i ran downstairs to check on Russel. where was he. Russel was not on the couch where i saw him last and then i felt a hand on my neck. It looked like my dad and i gasped. Russel must have turned into my dad when i was taking a nap. He didn't look exactly like my dad but you could tel he wish he was. Russel was breathing- robots don't breath! 'Oh no, how could Russel have turned into a human. Its not possible,' I thought to myself. Right when he started to hurt me is when my dad walked through the front door.              'Russel stop hurting my daughter! You have gotten way out of control now.' My dad yelled to him. Dad tried to get Russel off of me and threw him to the other side of the living room. 'Dad he turned into a human and pretended to be like you' I yelled to my dad. Right at that moment Russel exploded. BOOM! Its was like the house flew into the sky. We were inside the house before but now i in the back yard. i tried to find my dad in all the rubbish of the house. I tripped on the ceiling fan now on the floor and everything went blank.

Some day there may be robots all over the place. Robots are expected to be in our lives. Personally I think they will be someday. They seem like a big help. I've heard of many robots in research that I read about these past couple of days. Such as Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower and others. They were a big help in what they are doing.       Also robots are known to do a lot of things that we human can not do such as not get tired, they don't have to eat, they can be faster, some can handle heat, and others can climb far. The yhave many characteristics that we will never have. Robots are soon to come. Well, some people think. Put it in your thoughts and maybe some day they will be known to be in our lives as an everyday example.

I was going to make a robot of the future out of my old bike that I had when I was three years of age.I took the spokes off of my tire and bent them to create my form top for the chest i also hot glued some bolts to it for more class.I the n ripped the rubber off of the tire and hot glued that to the chest portion with the bolts. After a lot of tearing and hot gluing the robot final product was complete after a couple of hours.I was very tired and left my robot which i decided to name R-2D2 like in the great star wars saga my brother liked to watch all of the time.I left it in the garage and left to bed. As soon as i acme back the next morning he was gone!           I looked all over the garage and heard a squeak coming from behind a brown cardboard box. And out peeked a rubber tire chest with googly eyes. I jumped when it came out holding its bionic arm for me to slap it a high five. It said,'we be friends right?'I looked extremely puzzled when it spread its arms wide and game me a large hug!After that i looked very stunned.  picked it up with me big poster board and walked to school. I set him down and whispered (to not look crazy I hid behind a tree).I told him act natural and he posed with the hand on hip look. I giggled and people thought i was very weird i also thought this was weird but acted like it never happened. I placed him on the table and walked away. I came back a little later and he no longer was alive i knew i shouldn't have put the batteries in him to make him run I won a blue ribbon for my little buddy. Thanks R-2D2!

There he bot Four slaves one named google car a self driving vehicle. Another named The Dante 2 A exploration bot to explore the near buy savage robot tribe the Chinukee's. And a rescue bot named Gemini he will use Gemini to hunt runaway robots. And a ancient Agribot the last of its kind the agribot was me. I am Redit Grond Diconsion. And I am the last hope for freedom.                            That was a few months ago. I'm forced to pick fruit pull weed and pick vegi's . Soon I would have started a war. But little did I know that then. And what i had even less of an idea is what would happen next but i am getting ahead of my self let me start it from the begining. It was only a year ago that I had become a slave and on my first day I ran I almost got off the border but that Gemini cought up to be just before I got over it.My leg got dismantled but of course after a little bit it was reconfigured and put back on me so I could keep working.                 It has been a month since i wrote in my journal system but i need to  now a war has broke out between the slaver and savage tribes I dont know what to do  I think I'm just going to keep hiding and waiting for everything to boil down. I dont like it here though so with the slavers weekend i could make a robot slave army to attack the slavers but no that is such a foolish idea if we lose we all would be dismantled and scraped.           I have been hiding for months. I am going to look out side and hope everything ends soon. I am starting to run low on oil I dont know how much longer I can last in hiding so I will go outside and hope that I can find oil. I have to go the slavers they found me hiding......                I escaped the slavers but the seemed to be running from something. I did find oil but i am going to organize arbot slave squad to finish off the remanders of the slavers.So I hope I can find willing robots to help me in this battle that may start a war.           It has been three years since my last journal entry we won the war against the slavers just yesterday I lost many freinds but i have been turned into the king of the robots. But i have a eary fealing that something is wrong so I am keeping a look out.We also build more agribots so i am not the last anymore witch makes me happy.             Aliens have attacked us we need help. I sent out a radio signal but I dont think anyone will get it. So I think this is the end. But i am not going down with out a fight. I will try to win. If I lose we shall retreat because my people will need a leader in these hard times.             With the last of our power we built a Gemini-Scout it will be able to drag civilians back to safety from the aliens. I nick named him Jerry the 1,792,380,528th.   he is named after my father and his father and grandfather and great grandfather and great great grand father and great great great grandfather and great great great great grand father all the way up to his and my great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great I think you get what I am saying.            We just built Jerry and we already need him! i will be controling him from my home so he can bring the injured here. Oh my god they are here the aliens! Are here! no no no!!!!

Gemini is a robot who works in mines rusceing miners. Dante2 goes into vocanes and take samples ,of air and rocks. Mr.growler works in hospitals, he gives medicene to doctors. Agribots pick fruit and grow fruit,they com in many different shapes and sizes.         Robots can also be good pets. They can be dogs, cats, dinosuars, and birds.Some dogs and cats have fur and are are very  life like. Robots get along good with people.                                                         People are also working on robtic cars. These cars drive them seleves and don't need any help.Some states are making it ilagal for robots to drive cars. This is why robots are one of the worlds most interesting scienece projects.

The toy store was a toy wonderland that has all the toys ever known. I spent the whole day there, looking through every single section, examining the toys slowly. While I was walking through the stuffed animal section, I saw a giant robot stuffed animal. It seemed likeit was the only stuffed animal that was a robot, lonely sitting there for days. In fact, it had been there for so long that the price had been cut to 25%.       So I bought it, the two pound giant robot.       That day I slept late, like every other summer day, and I woke up to use the bathroom. Suddenly, I heard a robotic voice saying,'Thank You.'

Did you know there is robot called Gemini-Scout and is a remote-controlled robot that does search and rescue in mines under ground .This is a robot that is less than two feet tall,but is strong. It carries food,water,and other suuplies, but can even drag other people to safety.What misson the Gemini-Scout robot has been assigned to it always collects all kinds of important imformation and brings it all back to the labatory.Gemini-Scout can do a lot of amazing things that some of use people can't even do.          To begin with ,There are a varitey more robots in the world than just a Gemini-Scout there are many more like one is the Agribots these robots are pick and carry fruit like berries,oranges,grapes,or apples.The only places Agribots are found are on farms they're not yet widely used,but farmers are highly interested in them.At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),they have created a greenhouse full of plants that are cared for by small agribots.this kind of robot has to be the best thing to pick fruit instead of a human.          In Addtion,A robot called Mr. Gower is a king of robot that is seen in hospitals because they help doctors and nurses bring medicine to the patients.this is a robot that looks like a small cabinet on wheels. Mr. Gower is a cabinet because he is used to store the medicine in the cabinet.Mr. Gower can also talk, it has been programmed to say hundreds of phrases.Mr. Gower is a big help in hospitals with this robot the hospital would be going crazy.          Addtionally,there is one more robot that I cant forget about is Dante 2. this is a robot that really climbs inside a vocanlo to gather information for the scientists.For Dante 2 this robot it looks for holes,vents,and in the crater,then it collects information about the gases  that come out of the vents.Scientists could not have learned as mush about volcanoes, but Dante 2 is changing that.Dante 2 is a amazing robot and now scientists can study volcanoes while they remain safe in their laboratories.          To conclude,there are a varitey of robots that do amazing things in many different places without these robots there are many different things that we wouldn't be able to do in the world.All robots dont do the small things they all do different things. robots are interesting objects that people make because you can see the  different abiltys they can do.

Bob woke up and saw that the robot worked.The robot meant a lot to Bob because Bob was the one who thought of the idea.One year later,Bob and the robot were the owners of a famous company.Bob gave the robot a name his name was R2-D2.There company designed other robots and other futerestic tecnology.The robots that they inveted were different,some were to play with your kids like a babysitter,some were to help doctors,help scientists,and more.       They were very famous and succesful,they would always check if there was problems with the robots.When Bob passed away R2-D2 took over and continued inventing new gadgets and more.The company never stopped,it kept on running for decades and R2-D2 never forgot about Bob.

So the the owner decided to take out the batteries and dugged the robot. And now 500 year later, the robot came to life (no batteries) and wandered around the woods. The robot tried to talk, but it couldn't. Then later, the robot found a road. When the robot crossed the road, he saw a car. The car pulled over and took the robot home. And there was a boy. The boy asked 'What is your name?' And the robot said nothing. On the next day, the robot said 'I can talk!' Then the boy ask again, 'What is your name?' The robot said 'I never knew.' 'Your batteries are missing.', said the boy. The robot looks and wonders where are his batteries. He looks through his memory, and sees his owner taking out his batteries. But the robot doesn't remember much. He remembers his owner's name. His name was Drew Mann. The robot told the boy and the boy searched up the name. It said 'Drew Mann was a robot designer. An amazing one.' And then it show a picture of Drew and the robot. The robot's name was Hale. And now the robot will be 	IN CD NNS RB , EX VBD DT NN WDT VBN NN CC DT NN VBD RB VB DT NNP NNP DT DT NN VBD TO VB RP DT NNS CC VBD DT NNP CC RB CD NN JJ , DT NN VBD TO VB : DT NNS VBP CC VBN IN DT NNP NNP NN VBD TO VB , CC PRP NNP NNP JJ , DT NN VBD DT NNP NNP DT NN VBD DT NN , PRP VBD DT NNP NNP NN VBD IN CC VBD DT NN NNP CC EX VBD DT NNP NNP NN VBD JJ VBZ PRP$ NN .

One of them was the Gemimi-Scout it  is a remote-controlled robot that goes on search-and-rescue missions underground in mines.  The Gemini-Scout has a thermal camera which uses heat sensors to find livng things.  When the robot is exploring and senses people it finds them and then it also has two-way radio talk, so the people can communicate with the rescue team.  I also learned about the Dante 2 who is a robot that climbs into volcanoes and explores them.  Dante 2 can be in very hing temperatures and not explode.  This robot would do it's job when the volcanoes are too dangerous for scientists to enter.  The last robot that I learned about was Mr. Gower he delivers medicine to doctors and nurses when they are to busy.  I have learned a lot about robots and I hope that you have too.

The Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, and Mr. Gower and there is many more he wants to learn about.       The first robot he looks at is the Gemini-Scout. he learns that this robot is remote-controlled and it does search and rescue work in underground mines. Also he learned that it has wheels and it is only two feet tall, rolls through water, make tight turns, and carries supplies and even injured people to saftey. Gemini-Scouts has a thermal camera that has sensors to find living things.       The second robot Johnny looks at is a Mr. Gower robot. he writes down that these are robots that work in hospitals. bringing any medicine anywhere in the hospital to doctors or nurses. It can ride elavators, go through hallways, and move around things that get in its way. It is really strong too, it can pull up to 500 pounds!       there is one more robot that he wants to take notes on and that is the Dante 2 robots and what it does is climb into valcanoes to get information for scientists. It has eight legs and goes into a valcano when it is to dangerous for scientists to enter. it goes into the valcano and gets information about the gases that come out of the vents in the valcanos.

First there's a robot called Gemini-Scout . This robot is a remot controlled robot that rescue work in mines. This robot carries water, food, and tools.  It can check the air in mines and tell the miners its ok to work there. If a worker gets injered Gemini-Scout will drag the worker to safety.                                                        The second robot there is is called Dante 2.   Dante 2 works an interesting job, it climbs on top of volcanoes with its eight powerful legs, its also built to stand against high heat so that meen's that is can take samples of the volcanoes from the crater.              The third robot to talk about is Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower works at the hospital, it looks like a small cabinet on wheels that bring medications and stores it. Mr. Gower is programed to say a hundered phrases.  It can also pull five hundred pounds. This amasing robot runs on batteriesthat just needs to be chared for two hours and work for twelve hours nonstop.                The fourth interesting robot is called Agribots.  This robot is program to pick fruit, it is also programed to sense if the fruit in a greenhouse are ripe or if it needs to be watered.  If the fruit is ripe this robot will use its mechanical arm and pick it. Soon this robot will work in farmes.               The sixth robot is a robot who likes to have fun, this robot is programed to dance, play music and even cooler it can sing! These playful robots are made to copy animals so is can play in movies. This robot is not in movies all the time it is also used as a pet. There is a robot dog thats acts just like one and the good thing about it is it dose not need to go out or eat!                The last robot to talk about is a Google car. This car is programed to drive its self it controlled the speed and can seanse if another car comes near so it will make a life saving move that will also not injure anybody else.  This invention has a cone shaped laser mounted on top to see where the car is going. This will save many lives if the driver takes its eyes off the road.

I turned CNN and the news lady was talking. 'Today, my sources tell me that NASA has a created a robot that can go in the sea and study some parts in which it's not possible for humans to walk in because of the low oxygen level.' the CNN Lady said. 'Today NASA would be bringing the robot named RH-8 to the Los Angelas History Museum to show fellow citizens the future'. the CNNLady said. I decided to go so I dressed in comtfortable clothing and drove to the museum. When I got there. there wasn't so much people so I just walked in. In the center of the museum the RH-8 was talking to people in some easy phrases'Hello fellow citizen' or ' How are you?'. So I walked in and went in front of the RH-8. WE started having a conversation when all of a sudden someone said 'FIRE! FIRE! RUN!' Everyone just went crazy trying to get out while I was being trampled on. Finally when I got up Smoke was everywhere so I couldn't see anything. I could feel my throat drying and choking up when a pair of menchanical arms grabbed me and carried me out of the museum. 'Thank... you' I said. ' Your welcome' a robotic voice said. Finally my eye sight started adjusting and I saw RH-8 right in front of me. 'You...saved..me, thank you' I said. Then all of a sudden RH-8 wrapped hia mechanical arms around me giving me a warm hug.

I have been studying the chip ever since and I have discovered that it is that it is not a computer chip but a chip for a robot. It`s name was CBQ-13  it was used to go into floods or natural disasters.     (New Paragraph)   Mysteriously enough every time i walked down that road i find another piece of scrap metal. And, in two weeks i finished the robot except for one piece. It was part of the arm and it was no where to be found. But eventually i did find it but i was out of the correct screws to keep it in place. (New Paragraph)   So i went to the hardware store but they were all out. Then i  visited my friend to see if he had any. He said he didn`t but his cousin did. After i got the screws i put him together and he started making beeping noises and moving but then it just turned off and stopped.

Everyone was excited, and kids already wanted to start on their projects. The principal announced that the 1st place winner gets a big ribbon, and their project will be placed where everyone can see it.  Manny a creative kid who wanted to enter the science fair was fresh out of ideas. Everyone else was talking about what they were going to do for the science fair but Manny had nothing.              When Manny went home he told his mom about the science fair, and that he didn't have a clue what to do for a project. Then his mom came up with an idea that could win the science fair. a robot! His mom and him went to a couple of stores and got the stuff they needed. When they got home he worked on it right away. He worked day and night trying to make his robot perfect. Finally it was finished. He added a on and off switch to turn it on and off. he pulled the switch up but nothing happened. He was devastated.  He went to sleep like that.              The next morning he woke up sad. He turned to look at the messed up robot that he created and  it was gone! He got up quickley and started looking for the robot. That's when the robot appeared out of nowhere, and it started talking . Manny knew he would win first place in the science fair. He also named the robot Robo.              Manny ended up winning the science fair. But he also made a best friend that suddenly came to life in the middle of the night, and his name was Robo!

One day In a state far far away, and a time that is way way way in the future, there was a robot called Atom. Atom was built to fight crimes, and keep watch of anything suspicios happens his creator, Super Man, Created him so that when he died Atom would do his work for him so no one would know that he was dead. Super man put Uraniam inside of Atom so that atom could have ever-lasting power so when Super Man died  Atom Arised.             One day Atom awoke and took over supermans duty. Atom was amazing he could do everything Super Man could do and he looked just like him! When some robers came and stoll money from the bank it was Atom's turn to take on the job so he defeated them one handed and then he gave the money back to the bank.          Atom one Day found out with is robot brain that someone wanted to take his plutoniom and destroy Atom for good so that they could take over the world so that they could take all the money and have whatever they want whenever they want it. Atom found out that he was becoming a human as this was happening hes power sorce had some of Super Man inside of it and he was becoming him slowly. So Atom weant to the Bank And guarded it from the top of the roof.       So then a the SSITIE (Super Secret Intelegence That Is Evil) came and was going to rob the bank and would destroy anything or anyone that was in was in their way. So Atom came down but he was still in the process of becoming a human and was weaker than usual he came down and was about to destroy them when he realised that he didnt have any powers and that it hurt him when he fell down. but he was still not going to be defeated! He ran and he juped but he was so weak that he fell.           The SSITIE was getting away what was he going to do? so he ran again he was getting faster somehow and he was dodging bullets he was gainging superman's powers he was becoming superman! so he ran he jumped and made it inside of the bank he threw Three of the people for the SSITIE out the window and held the bank but the SSITIE had Plutoniam with hem and because he was Superman he couldent do anything because of the plutoniam. so Atom was at his weakest hour but he was able to move the plutoniam off of him slowley as the SSITIE robbed the bank so then he got it off and destroyed the SSITIE and then fell down he was not that strong because the plutoniam was slowley destroying him. 'He said Protect the bank.'           All the people in that state missed him, He died fighting for his country and he did win but he didnt make it out alive. So now Once a year the people of that state celebrate him and on how he died fighting. But he did complete his purpose,  he stoped anyone or anything from ever coming into that state again or robbing that bank. After he passed, he got a statue made up for him he was also very well remembered.

America is losing a lot of their men to war. The army needs to think of something fast. Then, Chuck Norris gets the idea of making a war robot. What should they name it? Then it hits him. They should name it BOB101. Since they are in a rush they start to make the robot right away.                 The army starts to collect all of the supplies they need. They collect a lot of metal, guns, bolits, and other supplies.The army starts to put all of the pieces together. Then, bam they are fineshed with the robot. The army starts to test it out for battle. The robot (BOB101) did amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On BOB101's first day he lead America to victory. At the end of the war America won. Even though the war was over, he was still working on different wars for America.

He reflected on all the hard work he put into it and wondered if it would actually work. Sam took a deep breath and gently picked up this fragel invention. 'Here Max!' he called. His shaggy golden dog came running into his room. 'Let's go outside.' Sam said to Max as Sam scraced his ear. Max walked with Sam to the back door his tail wagging. Max grabbed his old tennis ball in his wet mouth. Sam opened the door and Max ran out. He placed the small invention on the grass and took the ball from Max. Sam fliped the on switch and placed the ball infront of the machiene. Sam took deep breaths as the invention lite up and did it's thing. The inventions claws grabbed the old tennis ball then threw it across the grassy yard. Max ran after the ball, got it, then brought in back to the small robot. Sam almost screamed, 'Yes! It's works! It actually works!!!' His little robot actually worked! Sam flipped out, 'I'm going to win that science fair!' he exclaimed.                   After that, Sam would not turn his robot off. He watched pridefully as the robot cared for his dog. The science fair was coming up and Sam was confedent that he would come home afterward with a blue first place ribbon. Sam told John all about the robot. 'I'm telling you John, it really works!' Sam said. 'Tell you what, I'll go over to your house after school today and then I'll see if it's really a winner.'                    Sam and John burst through the door both ancouse to see if it really worked. Sam spotted Max on the couch. 'Max, you have to get off the couch!' Max growled. Sam stepped back. Never had Max growled at him before.

Well that is exactly me when I was young. When I was young I had always dreamed of creating a robot, but it never happened until today.               When I was reading about robots performing tasks it hit me I could create a robot that could change the world, but the question is what will the design be?            One day I was strolling through San Diego wondering where I could find parts for the robot, so I strolled over to Home Depot and then went to Office Depot because I figured they'd have to have the parts, which they did. When I finally got home I started working on my robot.               The next day I finished my robot and tryed to make it turn on but nothing happened, so I went to go get some breakfast and I hop. When I got home my house was cleaner then when I left, and I heard a vacuum in the other room. When I went in the room I saw my robot vacuuming the room and I was so amazed. So I picked him up and brought him to my boss who said ' I like it, but it needs something extra hmm maybe a few vacuums attached to his sides making him clean faster.' I liked his idea, so I went home and found some vacuum hoses and attached them to him.              The next day when I showed it to my boss he said ' Well done this thing could make me a fortune.'            When I heard that I got mad and told him ' If anyone is getting the fortune it is going to be me.'              After that day I never saw my boss, and the robot was also gone which left me suspicious.    	NNP PRP RB VBN IN NN DT NN IN DT NN . CC DT NN WDT MD VB DT NN .

If you are wondering about the future,well think again.did you know robots have jobs today.The robot is small,but is very strong.Gemini scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under the ground.Gemini scout carries food,water,and other supplies.A remote control is the same thing like a video game controller.Dante 2 is another robot with an interesting job.The body is a robot is a stack of locked drawers and stored medicine.Now scientist that can study on dante 2 while they remain safe in there laboratories.          Mr.Gower is a robot that works in hospitals.He can ride through hall ways,ride in elevators, and and move around things that get in the way.The robot is so stong it can pull 500 pounds.the robot runs on batteries, it can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.An agribot robot picks fruit.It might pick berries,oranges,grapes,or apples.Farmer are very interested in the robots progress.

Gemini-Scout can help miners.       Gemini-Scout can help miners in many ways if a miner gets hurt he will go in and save them. Scout will collect air samples and if there is gases in the air scout will tell the miners so they will go in with safe air. Scout carries water,food, and other supplies.           2. Mr.Grower works in the hospitals       Mr.Grower can pull 500 hundred pounds. Mr.Grower can also talk if needed. Mr.Grower can also deliver medicine to sick people.           3.Dante 2 helps the scientists.       Dante 2 looks for holes in the crater and collects info about the gases in the vents. has 8 legs and no weels at all. his legs help him climb steep walls of a volcano.                     This is why we have robot.   robots help us in so many ways and   no one knows that. They help with science,mines,and even in the hospital.Thats why we need robots in life.           Robots play with children help doctors,miners,and scientists they can be pets too.

I have never been a fan of projects, but this one I am very excited for. We started making our robot. It was horrible!!! I feel like im the only one who is trying. We finnished our robot. It was nothing to be proud of. The next day at school I walked into class but when I walked in the whole place was thrashed! All the books were on the floor, the desks were nocked over, and even the white board was smashed!! About five minutes later I heared a big THUMP!! We walked outside and saw a huge robot. One of my partners in my group asked me where our robot was. I stood there in aw. Then I yelled, thats our robot!! That just changed my mind about projects.

All the kids were playing with baseballs, basketballs, footballs, soccer balls any kind of ball you can think of. When 13 year old Jen was playing soccer, she saw that some thing was moving in the bushes, she went over and saw a metal box just sitting there, doing nothing. So she didn't mind, That night when she was doing dishes she saw the same mettle box sitting in the front yard, so she went outside and looked at the box, there was a button on it so Jen pushed it. then out of no were a drawer opened and there was fruit in it. She put in it her room and observed it when ever she had a chance. The next day at school she found her best friend, G.G.         'G.G, you will never guess what happened last night'         'No I wont but I know you will tell me even if I didn't want to know.' said G.G.         'OK so I was at the park and i saw some thing moving in the bushes so I went to look but all that was there was a mettle box I left it alone but when I was doing dishes I saw the same box in my front yard. Isn't that weird?' asked Jen.         'Yes that so weird. Do you have the mettle box?' Asked G.G.         'Ya'         'OK, so has it done any thing weird since you brought it into your house?' asked G.G.          'No. I brought it in and then went to sleep.' said Jen         'Then you need to stayed up and see what it does.' said G.G. So Jen and G.G. stayed up and tried to see what the box does. For hours nothing was happening but when Jen was about to fall asleep the box started to move          'G.G. wake up its moving.' exclaimed Jen.          'Whats going on?' asked G.G. in a sleepy voice.         'I don't know I just woke you  up because I'm bored, what do you think?' Said Jen with anger. When G.G. got up the box had turned into a robot.         'Hello, I'm Fin, your servant.'         'What, Jen you have a servant and you didn't tell me.'          'I didn't even know until now.'         'Is there anything I can do for you malady?'said the robot          'NO! Were did you come from and how did you find me?' exclaimed Jen         'Well I was created by scientist and my orders were to find some one and be there servant for one month.'        'So I'm stuck with you for one month?'Jen said with a worried look on her face        'Yes, yes you are.'  So the next day at school Jen passed a note to G.G. saying,            'I have some thoughts about why 'Fin' chose me to be its 'master'   The scientist is a relative that I don't know about. The robot was meant for me. It might t have a note explaining why it came to me.   So when the girls got home Jen asked the robot of there was a note saying why he was there, he said no, so for the next month Jen had a servant and G.G. used him too, and Jen liked him more than she thought she would and she was a little sad when he had to leave but she was also happy, and every thing went back to the way it was before.

Robots are used for a lot of things some are  helping doctors ,and nurses,scientists,miners,fruit pickers,and many more.               Some robots that do these things are the following            *Gemini-Scout- this is a remote controlled robot that does search and rescue work in mines under the ground. This robot is less than 2 feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make tight turns, and it even can roll through water. The robot is small, but strong. Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies. It can even drag hurt people to safety. This amazing robot collects information wherever it goes.       *Dante 2 -is a robot with an interesting job- it climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientists. Like a spider, this robot has 8 legs. This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano. It is also built to survive very high heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for scientists to enter, Dante goes instead. Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. This robot also collects information.       *Mr.Gower - is a robot that works in hospitals, helping doctors and nurses bring medicine to patients. Mr.Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. The body of the robot is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds. Mr.Gower runs on batteries. After charging for 2 hours, the robot can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping.Also Mr.Gower can talk.       *Agribots-is a robot that picks fruit. It might pick berries, oranges, grapes, or apples.Agribots are not yet widely used, but farmers are very interested in what these robots can do. Because picking a strawberry is different than picking an apple, agribots come in all shapes and sizes. Some have giant arms that are towed behind trucks. Others are able to move around on their own. In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries. This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe.

They were looking all around in the woods to find out what was making the noise.Finally Levi peeked through a bush and saw a big grizzly bear sitting on a rock on a big rock.Levi and his friends were silently and slowly trying to leave the forest.Then Josh stepped on a branch making a loud crackle noise.             Suddenly they all heard a loud roar by the 800 pound grizzly bear.Levi,Josh,Ty and Isaac just ran for it even though a grizzly can run 32 miles per hour.The bear was chasing after all of them.And they had no idea on how to defeat the bear.             They had only ran a fourth of a mile when Levi realized he had a protection pocket knife.It would not do much but he threw it anyways it was a direct hit.Then Levi,Josh,Ty and Isaac all started throwing rocks and big branches.The bear was unconscious for a couple of seconds that gave them the chance to run for it.It wasn't long before they reached Levi's house, he was telling his parents all about it.

My first reason is that they can save lives.  Robots can save lives by going down to where the problem is and rescuing the trapped humans.  They can also save lives by delivering medicine to the nurse or doctor, also they can deliver the patients to their rooms.     My second reason on why we should use robots is that they could collect research.  Robots can help us collect research by going into very active volcanoes and studying what gasses come out of it.  So that scientists don't risk their lives going into an active volcano.     My third reason on why we should use robots is, babysitting. aren't you mad that you can't find a good babysitter? well, robots can babysit your child without problems and they can play with them and not be bored of your child.     So you think that robots can malfunction and destroy property?  well that problem can be fixed by going to the repair shop and getting it repaired or selling it.      Now I think you agree on why we should use robots for our daily lives. was it that they save lives, or that they could do research. Or that the could make an excellent babysitter.  So now I think that you will use robots more often.

I set out for the walk when i saw something moving in the bushes.  I saw a metal like object and all of sudden that object jumped out of the bushes.  It looked like a robot!  The robot was speaking to me and was moving around my front yard.  I had actually found a real life robot.    I moved the robot upstairs in my room and it started going through my closet and started to clean.  This robot was a cleaning robot.  How boring is that.  When I was about to take the robot back outside it started to wash the dishes and mop the floor.  Maybe the robot I found was built to do chores.  I thought about it and maybe a robot that cleans isn't such a bad thing after all.  I'm going to share this robot with my friends.   Quickly I ran down the block and found my friends Katie and Abby at the park.  I told them I had a surprise for them at home.  We ran as fast as we could back to my house.  The robot was sitting in my living room and I showed my friends the exciting new friend I had found.  Abby and Katie were so shocked.  They asked what the robot had done and ofcourse I told them.  'I wonder what we could use him for' Katie had asked.  We all sat and thought for a moment and then I had an idea.   I knew exactly what we should use the robot for.  The robot could be used for like a cleaning service to make money.  We could use the money to give to charity or buy something for ourselves. The girls loved the idea and I think our new little friend did too.

But that robot had the same face and everthing like the other Robot Robby had. The alive robot was evil but the robot Robby was nice. But then a another robot named Robert had a feeling that why this Robot has the same face as Robby. But why is this Robot evil? Then at last the robot got to know that he was Robby.

The Gemini-scout is a remote-controlled robot that does search and rescues in the mines under the ground. This robot can roll around in water. Aalthough this robot is small it still is very strong. The Gemini-scout robot also collects information were ever it goes like, when it goes in the mines it tests the air for gasses and tells the miners were it is safer to go and mine.       Here is another cool robot its name is the Dante 2 it has a very interesting job it climbs into volcanoes and gathers information for scientists. The Dante 2 has eight legs like a spider. It is also built to survive very high heat. This robot is cool because if the volcano is to dangerous for the scientist to go inside the Dante 2 go inside instead. Dante 2 looks for holes or vents in the crater.       'emergency emergency' We need someone in here quick with medicine. Here come the Mr.Gower with all the medicine supplies that you need the Mr.Gower helps with nurses and patients to bring the patients medicine and the Mr.Gower can also store medicine for the nurses and doctors. The Mr. Gower can go anywhere in the hospital including up elevators,steer through hallways,and move around things that could get in the way. And the Mr.Gower can talk!       'whose been picking my fruit' Aalways says the old man across the street. 'was it that robot of yours?' 'yes'  The agribot is one of the robots that love to pick fruit. It will pick oranges, berries,grapes and apples. A lot of farmers are very interested in this fantastic robot and what he can do. Some of these robot have very long arms like a trunk on an elephant!!           If you have kids that love to play or that are very interested in robots than here are some choices for your own robots that will play with your own kids to keep them entertained. There is the HRP-4c that can dance and sing. Not all robots that can keep your kids entertained they can also keep your pets out of trouble around the house, these robots could be very helpful because they act as if the are real pets and they have the same ways that actual pets have. If you are a busy family with not a lot of time home with your pets or with your kids these robots will help a lot. The Maine robot that can help with your pets is the I-PET! The I-PET can really help by....'WAIT,WAIT' 'Johny you forgot to feed your dog' 'well if we had the I-PET robot he would be able to sense that he needed food and take care of it instead of having him starve to death.' And I guess they said it for me well that's how the I-PET can help with not even just your pets but maybe a little reminder can always help too.        I bet you are now planing on buying on of these amazing robots to use around the house arent you!! Come today and join me to go and look at these amazing robots that can help many people do many amazing things!!!!!!

He would help people clean there house and do chores,kids would take advantage to him because they wouldent have to do there chores anymore,that was a big help.the owner of this robot was a old lady who used to be a scientist but now retired,she lives by herself with no family members around.So thats why she created Henry.Everybody wished that henry would take but he doesnt speak all he does is clean,but one day all of that was forgoten.The owener woke up one moring and heard the vaccum on and a little boys voice singing.The owener walked down stairs to see if their was an intruder.As shes walkingdown the steps she can hear the little boy sing louder and louder then she shes henry talking with the vaccume in his robotic hand 'hey mom!'said henry 'what are you doing, you look frighentend' 'you...you... can talk'said his owner 'yeah i dont now how though i woke up this moring and I could talk'Henry went outside to tell everybody,every single person in the town were amazed they could finally talk to the robot while  he was doing there chores.Henry was spending alot of time on t.v. and you can see on the newspapers 'TALKING ROBOT HERE IN THIS SMALL TOWN IN SEATTLE WA COME WHATCH'Now evrybody knew that there was a talking robot in seattle wa, he was famous but his owner was not so happy.She wasent getting any attention on the news papers or going on any talk show with another famous person.So she had to put an end to this, she had to shut down this robot because if she wasent getting any attention or credit for the robot she created, then no one will.But henry was on the same scheldule cleaning peoples houses and then there was a knock on the door the person who owned the housse whent to the door to open it and it was the tv people from a tv show they saide 'can we check out your amazing talking robot, we traveled many miles to just see this robot' she said 'sure!' she showed were the room was were henry was and they asked him a few questions meanwhile henrys owner was walking down the street with a tool box she opened the door where henry was at without knocking,but nobody noticed she went to the room were she heard people asking questions and henry anwsering them.then she walked in the room everybody looked at her like HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE.she walked up to henry and turned him around,she opend the tool box and grabed the skrew driver she put it into henrys back pice and unskrewd all of the four holes.Everybody was telling her to stop including henry but she dident listen.Then henry shut down she picked him up and walked right up the door. She went to her house and the tv show people were following her they said'why would you do that you were going to be famous with that robot' 'you wouldent understand' said the owner 'i wasent getting any credit for ANYTHING! and i was the one who created the robot'the tv show looked at her like she was crazy 'you know you just made the biggest mistake of your life'saidn the producer of the show 'havent you watched tv latley, hes been giving all the credit to you in talk shows we travled this far so you guys can move out of this town and come to los angleous were its nice at, thats what we been trying to do this hole time' the owner looked at the tv crew just embarresed.She felt so stupid of herself to do that.She set down henry and she pulled out her tool box she took the skre driver and tryed to set him up again, he turned on and he blinked dident say anything they still waited but still nothing the tv cast left disapointed in the owner they traveled all this way for nothing.The ownner was a failer she was a selfish old women, that what she thought  of herself but at least he could still clean she thought. The next day she wondered how he began to start talking she thought, magic? noooo a spell? noo. She thought and thought but never could amagine what happened so she turend henry off again stored him in a box and threw him in the river. The owner lived byherself forver then, she died.

He was a Gemini-Scout robot, but he was different because one day his creator programed him to have an opinion about almost everything. Because of this program he wasn't a miners favorite kind of robot anywhere in the mines. He was treated poorly the miners said they'd never need him and they could get themselves out of a jam without him. So because these actions Tony was dismissed as a mess up to all miners everywhere and so his creator was going to have to shut him down out of money expenses and because he wasn't used. One day while he was going to be shut down the was a cry of help as a scientist came running into the room. There had been an explosion int the mines and only a little space was left for a two foot person to go in. This was Tony's only chance and somehow he knew it when he started to smoke and then he was covered in a blinding light then 'BAM.'          Tony was a robot that could be human except he was still looking like a robot, but he could feel, love, he could talk, and lastly he could be alive. His last chance was now or never so he shot off the experament table and raced to the mines he still had water and food in his supply case and extra oxagen tank in case of any gases. He made it to the mines and leaped into the tunnel and down he went. He turned on his five lights to see that all there was to see were the three remaining miners who didn't get out in time.

Before I read this story I thought of the futue when I heard about Robots. I was wrong. Robots such as the Gemini-Scout save lives. This robot is sent to rescue miners lost in the ground.                  Another type of robot is the Dante 2. This robot is trained to climb volanoes.It is made to surive in extreame haet such as lava. Dante 2 looks for vents, holes and craters.   Because of  havivg the ability to stand extreame heat he is sent if it is too dangerous for scentist to scope it out themselves.                            Mr. Gower is the robot that also saves people`s lives. He works in the hospital and hold the supplies the doctor(s) need. Mr.Gower can steer and is very strong.He can hold up to 500 pounds.He even knows about 100 phrases.                  Robots are very useful and are needed for every day lives. Next time you are doing a report rember all these cool facts.

He looked outside and something grabbed him the thing whispered to him,''Help I will not hurt you.''But the guy didn't beileve the robot the guy ran to the back of the cave and tried to hide but the robot found him.He told the robot please don't hurt me i'll help you but promise me you'll be my friend so the robot agreed to be his friend.the first thing they did was sit and talk about where the robot came from.                                   Later that night the robot fell asleep and so did the guy but the man couldn't stay asleep, he thought the robot would hurt him.That morning the guy and robot started to get to know each other.They started to go on walks every afternoon because the car was to small for the robot.The robot(Dan) ate his first meal a hotdog with mustard dan thought it was the best thing in the world but he hasn't even tasted every thing.

One day their were six different types of robots that came together and shared what they do to help people. The first robot was name Gemini-Scout he said that he helps drag injured people to safety, and carries food, water, and other supplies, and he also test the air for gases and then tells miners when the air is safe. All the robots were all fascinated about what he can do but a robot said he was better her name was Dante 2 she said she goes in volcano's for scientist, and she said she collects information about the gases that come out vents. Dante 2 also said that climbs steep walls with her eight legs, and she can survive high heat. They were all impressed but one wasn't so impressed his name was Mr. Gower he said he helps people in hospital. He said he was strong he could carry 500 pounds, and he delivers medicine to patience. So it was another robots turn he been waiting to share what he does wanted so he started talking about what he does he told them that he picks fruits. Every thought that was boring but that never knew that he can see colors then everyone was really surprised. They wanted to know what types of fruit then he said apples, grapes, strawberries, and oranges, and berries. There was a animal that shared he said he had fur and he gets played with and taken care of he said his name was I-Pet, he said he was a robot pet he was exactly like a pet but they don't have to feed him and take him out . Then finally the last robot he was a car that drove itself he said he can drive slow, and fast and he never sleeps or gets tired, and he also said that he has sensors so he wont get his humans hurt if someone is going to hit him, he also said he is as smart as people when they driving. So then all the robots realize that they are all the same they all save peoples live and they help people. So they all became friends.                                                       THE END.

They learned that this robot can save people in mines and do all other sorts of things . So one of those scientist ,named frank, decided that he would go and find the robot somewhere in Europe . ' I will find the robot and bring him back so we can study him. Goodbye everyone ', he said walking out the door . He took a plane to Europe . Once he got there , Frank started to look at his map and go that direction . ' I feel that I am never going to find this robot ', he said quietly to himself . This map lead him into a forest . Now he was lost. Frank didn't know where to go so he turned around and headed toward the airport . Just then , he saw  the robot sitting there.Right away , he started to study him. Then he took him home and had the other scientist study him . He was a Gemini Scout . That means he search and rescue work in mines under the ground . Also he can carries food , water , and other supplies. ' Wow I've never seen a robot like this before . Where did you find him ?' the scientist asked. Frank replied ', I was walking through the forest and got lost , so I was walking back to the airport when I saw him . now let's study him so we can get him in the museum'. Then they finished studying the robot and sent to the museum .They were so prund that Frank found the robot . 	EX VBD DT NN IN NN WP VBP VBN VBG DT NN .

When the lad worker and robot reached their home there was other just like the new robot. Their names were Max,Fang,Iggy,Gasman,Nudge, and Angel. Max was the leader of the flock well that's what they call it. Fang was fearless his eyes as blue as the sky and he was a very fast flyer and very strong. Iggy is blind because the eraser got a hold of him took him back to the testing area and attempted to improve his night vision but one of the workers got a little jumpy. Gasman can fly like the rest of the flock but his body gas was putrid! Nudge doesn't have any special powers well not yet at least. Angel is Nudges sister and she can read minds and also make people do what she wants. Back to Max she can fly extremly fast and she has to help anybody in trouble.

At home my borther Harry was waiting for me. Well you most be wondering why I'm running. Its becaues we're making a robot to do our homework, house-work, and be our buttler. When I stopped running was because I was on the drive way and tried. I was breathing really hard I don't even think I could catch my breath. I saw the grage door open and to see shirtless Harry Styles. 'PUT A SHIRT ON' I yelled. I walked up the drive as I saw him trun around. 'Alright mom' he said being sarcam. 'Ha-ha-ha very funny' I say as i put my backpack by a wheel. 'So what do you think of it so far?'he said pionting to the uglyest robot I have ever seen.         'Its......the uglyest thing I have ever seen!'I said         'What...it is not ugly......I bet you can't even do better?'         'Oh, yeah get out of the grage and sit in the living room and don't come back until I say so...Got it?'         'Yes...and hand me my shirt right there' he said pionting behind me. I trun around and see a white v-neck t-shirt, I grab the shirt and pass it to him. 'Thanks.'  'Your welcome..now get out' I said.                                               5 Hours later                                           Harry's P.O.V     I have been waiting for 5 hours and all I've been doing was sit on my couch and waited. 'COME ON NOW....ITS DONE!' I get up from the couch and walk down the hallway to the grage. 'Finlly your done my butt's been hurting'I said while looking around and see that theres no robot 'Wheres the robot?' i ask 'Its ouside..come on' she said. I follow her outside and once out there I see this big, buttler dressed up robot just standing there. 'Its not moving' I said. As soon as I say that I get hit on the back of my head by Kirby. 'What was that for?' I ask. 'Your like 'Its not moving' thats why your here' She said. So I step in front of her and say. 'Oh..so what am I suppost to do?' I said. She face palmed her face and says 'Get in your car, trun it on , and get the pluges to pass energy to it.... and I'm going to watch and see if you are smart enough to do all this.' And she walked to a chair an sat down waiting for me to move. 'You think I'm not smart enough to do it all?' I said and Kirby just nodded her head.                                         Chapter 3: Its Alive                                          Kirby's P.O.V   I watch every move Harry has made and right now he is plugging the pluges on the robot. I get up from the chair and walk up to the robot. 'Ok......trun on your car, and press on the gas pedal and...'I said but Harry finish my sentence. 'See if it works.' I let out a deep brearth. 'Yeah.' I said. 'Keep your fingers crossed' Harry said as he walk to his car. I cross my fingers and waited.                                              Harry's P.O.V   'Keep your fingers crossed' I said as I walk to my car. I open up the door and sit on the drivers seat, and trun the key, and I step on the gas pedal. 'Did it work?' I ask because I conldn't see anything. 'No' said Kirby. 'Oh well...um... we tried' I said as I get out of the car and walk to her. 'Come on..help me put it in the grage' I said. 'Ok' Was all she said before helping me move the robot. We place the robot in a coner an step back and look at it. I wrap my arm around her neck and brought her close to me.'Come on...lets get some dinner before going to bed...Alright?' I said. 'Ok....last one in the house washes dishes!!' And she run of in the house. 'HEY...THAT NOT FAR!' I shout to her. But it was to late she was already in there 'So i geuss I'm washing the dishes.' I thought to myself.                               After Dinner In The Living Room                                           10:05AM                                        Kirby's P.O.V   'I'm going to bed now alright?' I said 'Ok goodnight, sweet dreams, and don't let the bugs bit.' Harry said smiling. 'Ok I won't let them bit, and you to..goodnight' I said as i got off the couch and walked upstairs. I got in my room and made my way to the closet. I get out my black Nike shorts,a blue over-sized long-sleeve shirt. I went in my bathroom and brush my teeth, strip out of my cloths and put my PJ's on, and put my hair in messy bun. I walk out of the bathroom and litterly jump on my bed. I remove the covers and pull them up right under my buzzums, and let sleep take over.                                             At 12:45AM   I woke up to some nosie coming from the grage. At first I ignored it and went back to sleep but it got louder and louder. So i got out of bed to check it out. While I was walking downstairs Harry finlly jioned me. 'Finlly you jion me.' I said to him. As his responed he just told me to be quit. When we got to the grage door Harry wispered to me 'Get that bat over there' and ponited behind me. I grabed it and helled it up in front of me. 'Ok on three you open the door..ok?' I wispered to Harry. 'Alright' he wispered back. '1....2...3 Open' I said. Harry open the door and I ran in and I saw the robot looking at me. I droped the bat and just looked up at it in complet shock. 'It alive' Harry said from behind. 'ITS ALIVE' I yelled. 'NOW WE HAVE A BUTTLER TO DO OUR WORK....IT WORKED MY IDEA WORKED' I kepted yelling. And Harry just laughed of how silly I was being, but our robot just stooded there saying nothing.                                           1 Month Later    'Come Ben do my homework for me' I said to our robot. Oh yeah 'Ben' was our robots name...well I think its a dumb name but Harry named him so I have to deal with it. 'O-K' said Ben. Harry walk in though the door and sat down beside me. 'Lets go teach him how to fix my car...yeah?' Harry asked me. 'Ahaha' I laughed. But nodded my head . 'Ok lets go Ben....your going to learn how to fix a car...COME ON...OUTSIDE WE GO!!' I said and yelled the last part. And we got outside.       (And that was my story)                                                                                           	PRP$ NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP CD : NNP DT NNP NNP : NNP NNP NNP : CD NNP : NNP NNP : CD NNP : CD NNP : JJ NN VBD NN NNS : JJ NN IN DT NN : JJ NN NN NN , JJ JJ NNS , NN NNS NNP : NNP NNP NNP : CD NNP : NNP NNP : CD NNP : CD NNP : RB IN NN NNS : JJ NN IN DT NN : JJ NN NN , JJ NNS JJ NNS , JJ NN NN CD : NNS VBP DT NNP NNP POS NN PRP VBD VBG IN NN IN JJ IN PRP MD , TO PRP$ NNP NNP NN PRP$ NN NNP VBD VBG IN NNP NNP PRP RBS VB VBG WRB PRP VBP NNP NNP VBZ PRP VBP VBG DT NN TO VB PRP$ NN , JJ , CC VB PRP$ NNP NNP NNP VBD VBG VBD IN PRP VBD IN DT JJ NN CC NNP NNP VBD VBG RB RB PRP VBP RB RB VB PRP MD VB PRP$ NNP NNP VBD DT NN NN JJ CC TO VB NN NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP POS PRP NNP PRP VBD RP DT JJ IN PRP VBD PRP VBP NNP NNP NN POS PRP VBD VBG NNP NNP RB JJ '' PRP VBP IN PRP VBD PRP$ NN IN DT NNP NNP WP VBP PRP VB IN PRP RB RB .

It can save lives because:   If a scientist needs data and the volcanoe is exploding than Dante can go instead.                                                                               MR. GOWER           Mr. Gower can go anywhere in the hospital. It can talk, deliver medicine, charges fully in 2 hours and carry up to 500 pounds. It can save lives because it can deliver faster than anyone in the whole entire hospital can to a very sick person who needs it right away.                           Thank you for reading here are the questions for the group. Please read and answer these questions as carfully and acurately as you can. Go back into the research if needed. If you do need to go back remind the whole group to slow down and answer the questions correctly. These questions should take more than five minutes to answer. They may take over a week to discuss and answer. Once you have finished make the group share their information and infer and assign a new assignmentm.             What did you learn that you may not have known before?         Why are robots important?    If so why?          Do you think that robots will dominate the future?          Have you learned anything that is life-saving?           Will you own a robot soon?           What robots do you have in your home? If not think about what could be a robot.            Will you use this iformation later in life? If not what can you do to make this useful?            What robots are in the hospital? Why do you think so?             What technology will stop?  Why?              What technology will stay?  Why?              What technology will come? Why?

But then all the sudden i hear a BANG , POP and a SPLANG   . Then i turn around and see the rusty old robot alive a shinny    and its first words were hello friend i stayerd i shock of what happened and said ' whats your name'. then he said i don't Know    i said' can i give you a name'. then he said' sure' i said your name is    Rust. So me and rust what to my house and i give him a cup of oil   and drank a soda. so then after drinking all of are drinks i said ' want   to go outside and play'? then he said ' whats this play ' and i forgot    that this robot was just born or came alive so i explaned that playing is like haveing fun a nice day. so he said ' that sounds like fun i want to play ' soooo. i said ' then what are we waiting for lets go outside a play' so we went outside nd i throw  a ball at him then he didn't know what to do so i said ' catch ' so he throw his arm out a caught the ball then i laughet at him when trying to throw it he chuck ji amr out and said' this ball what come of my head and i said ' dude you have to throw it' so he did   after playing we ate dinner and around 9:00  the door ball rang   so rust sat their drinking his oil . so i got up to answer it and when i opened the door. Two HUGE robots were their i got very creeped out and run up stairs and hid in the bathtub and then i started hearing sounds like POP BANG SPLAT RANG and i relased that the robots were talking to Rust so i got out of the bathroom and went down stairs and said ' who are you guys'   and Rust said their were my parents and they come to take me home so i said but your parents left you in the forest and rust said    my batteres were died but when you said you need a friend you accetdently spilt Oil on my ghears and head my gears roleing again thats how i come to life so when you were get a drinks i conected my parnets to pick me up and i said o and got sad and said ' then you should go' he said ' i was go to ask you if you wanted to live with me' ? so i said ' yes' so i picket my things up and packet my all my things and went to live with the robots   tell the end of my days  	CD NN PRP VBD VBG IN DT NNS CC PRP VBP IN DT NN DT JJ NN NN PRP VBP IN PRP RB VB '' PRP VBP PRP$ MD VB JJ CC VB PRP$ NN '' .

These robots are called Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, and Agribots. They all have different uses but are needed.       Gemini- Scout is a robot that rescues miners that have been lost. It also searches in mines. This robot is tiny but is strong. The robot can carries food, water, a hurt person, and different supplies people need. The Gemini-Scut is a great information finder. Where ever it goes, it collects information.   This robot also has a thermal camera and a two-way radio. So if people get lost and they send the robot to find it, the person could talk to a rescue team with the radio. These two features are very helpful in a situation.       The Dante 2 has a very exciting job. What it does is it climbs very high to help scientists (volcanoes). The robot has eight legs to help it climb. The robot collects information about things like the gases that come out of the vents, or holes. The Dante 2 is also created to be able to remain in high heat. Scientist have learned so much more now with this robot than before when they didn't have the robot.       Mr. Gower works in a hospital helping doctors and nurses with patients by giving them medicine or carry something. The robot can carry up to 500 pounds! Because the robot runs on battery  power, just after two hours of charging, the robot can deliver for 12 straight hours. This robot can also talk, It can say little phrases, hundreds of them! Mr.Gower lets doctors, pharmacists, and nurses have more time to work on more important things.       The last robot is Agribot. This robot helps farmers pick fruits. This robot isn't very popular yet but farmers  are excited about this robot. The robot picks apples, oranges, grape, and  berries. The robot comes in  a lot of different shapes and sizes which is useful for farmers. Some have long arms ( for trees) and towed behind trucks. Scientist are working more on making different robots that can pick different things. They are also trying to create a robot that can sense if the fruit is ripe and ready to pick. They will soon be very popular to farmers all around the world.        As you can see, these robots are very helpful to all different kinds of people. They help nurses, doctors, scientist, and farmer.

YES!Christmas was finally here im so happy!Later on i accually get to open my presents im about faint.It is 11:00pm, one more hour until i get to open my presents, but im so tired.Finally it's time to open my presents.I counted all my presents and i had 10 presents.I opened all of them and i left the two big ones for last.I opened one it was a guitar an accual guitar it was really cool!I saw the last one i poned it up and it was a toy car.I was kind of sad it wasent a robot.                                                                                  1 day later.       I was really sad i never got my robot.But when i woke up i saw a big a box in my room and it said my name 'For Jason Lopez '.I opened it and,YES!It was a robot that can talk and it was alive.It was the best present ever!It could turn into a motorcycle, a hokey table and to a family fun center.I could'nt believe it was so AWSOME!                                                                 2 years later.       Im now 12 years old i still have my old robot.I now have a little brother and a sister.They are pretty annoying.My brother saw a comercial of a new toy robot.He wanted it so bad, so he told my dad and mom and they said yes.We went to the store and bought it.We went back home and my brother so excited to open it so he did and it was really big and cool.it was proubly better than my old one.It had way better stuff on it unlike mine it has old stuff.Later on it was time to go tro sleep.But then i heard a loud sound.I wen to the kitchen and i saw my robot fighting my brothers robot it was so cool but they would'nt stop so i shut both robot's down and hidded it.I felt for want iv'e doun becuase my brother started crying cause he losst the robot.                                                              Later on that night.       I told my parents what happened and they accully believed me.So they got the robots and threw them away.I was gonna miss ROBO.I started crying, but then i woke up!It was all just a dream.i was glad it was a dream.But during that dream i learned something, to never ever get to robots together or else well youll find out.

Robots can do many things like save lives by doing sergury. Mr. Gower the robot has been programed to  bring medicene to patents by putting them in drawers and the nurse or docter has the key to open them and get what they need. They can help you train for maybe an upcoming event like a race on foot or a triathalon. Some have been programed to talk, walk, drive, speak, and climb. At oregon the students have programed the robots to play shuffle board. The Gemini-Scout looks for people stuck in mines that may have cullapesed and drag them or carry them to safty it can go through water, make sharp turns, carry food to them and can even go down stairs. THe Agribots can help farmers out a lot because they pick berrys, grapes, oranges, or apples for the farmers. Using these robots can make life a lot easier than it already is.

A docter named Dr. Jacob Smith.He had worked all his life to create a robot to help the people.  He almost gave up on the project.  His edrenaline was going and his heart was beating.                 'Its Alive!' he screamed. The robot walked around the room.  Dr.Smith was scared it might attack him.  The robot walked over to him and shook his hand.  It introduced itself to him.  The Docter jumped up out of ecitment and he celebrated.  The dog that Dr.Smith used as a expiriment the robot played with the puppy.  The docter was so very exited that he invented a robot.  He was so very exited that he created a playful robot.  He named it Jerry                     Jerry and Dr.Smith became very famous.  Jerry stared in all kinds of hollywood movies.  As for Dr.Smith he became a billionare.  And they all lived happily ever after.

The robot was driving trew town and with it's super hearing he heard orlando and his friend  playing so he  went looking to see where it was coming from he found where they was and the robot start talking it said hi and orlando look and said who said that the robot pop out. he look at the back of the robot it said say so thing and it turn in to any thing.

I looked on the table for my robot but he was no longer there. I ran outside and he ran down the street then across the highway. Later that evening I heard something in the garage so I grabbed my 12 gauge shotgun and went to see what it was.              when I went in I heard growling behind the car. Before I could see what it was I shot it and killed it. It turned out it was my robot who was not supposed to be harmful.so the next day I took him apart and buried him in my backyard.

A long time ago, in the 21st century, people were wondering how fantastic robots would be to help them. They were quite wrong. My name is Nick and I live in the 25th century. The government is overrun with corruption coming from robots. The robots that used to help once ago are now ruining us.       Robots were once thought of a machine that could do things no human could possibly do. We thought they could save lives, help us, and save us from our own greed. That task they did quite well. Little did our small brains think that they had a mind of their own. They started a global war in which we lost badly. Many people went into hiding of machines that now owned the earth.       I am from the 514th village in the eastern United States. We live up in Maine where the fishing is quite well. When any patrol robots came around, we destroy it and take it's parts. This idea of destroying them came from my late dad, a few months before he fell in battle. He knew that one day, one day robots would take over. He made a plan to destroy any robot you see and take it's parts. What do we do with them? We make robots of our own.       My village and I spread this idea over all of the Northeast, as far as Pittsburg. So far, all of this region has over 600 robots made and counting. It has been 3,997 days since the robots took over. On the 4,000 day, all the region will make a march to take the land that I once loved, and restore peace to the Country.       There were many types of 'helpful' robots. Some of the things they could do was to go inside a volcano! Can you believe that! Of all the things they could make one do, they had it go inside a volcano. That must've been pretty splendid for Scientists who wanted to get an inside view. Well, enough talk. Today we have marched all around the land in which they have made robots. Tomorrow, on  the 'memorial' of robot power, we will be crashing their party.       5 Days After Stand       United we stand, for all our brothers may rest in peace, as I have restored faith and freedom. Today, on April 15th, 2465, the United States may return to the place it used to be again. Now, I have a team of hackers hacking ALL the other robots in the world, even the ones we made to take the land. In a couple of months, the world shall forget we were run by robots. Yet today is a day of rest for the U.S, as John Flores, the 200 president is elected into office. John was a hard working member of the East as he was the smither in my village. I, instead of being Chief of the land, I took the position of nobody. I rest now in my good home state, remembering my father who gave his life for us.

Jason takes it home and gets parts to fix the robot. When Jason gets back he cleans the robot and discovers that this robot's name was Dante 1. Jason was so exited to find a robot that was actually used by scientists. Jason's mom called him in for lunch that day and when Jason got back he saw that Dante 1 was moving, doing his chores, and helping his neighbors move their bed that was 5 ton!         Jason was so amazed that he had Dante 1 help anyone that needed help. So Jason and Dante 1 went around town looking for help that was needed and they helped them. When they both got home they were both very tired and so they took a nap. Then out of nowhere someone was yelling 'help help' so Jason and Dante 1 went out to find that someone's leg was trapped under a rock so Jason told his friend Dante 1 to pick the heavy rock up and put it somewhere else. They lady said ' thank you so much Jason and Dante 1'.        When Jason turned 21 he and Dante traveled the world together looking for whoever needed help and for the rest of Jason's life Dante 1 worked and helped Jason and the people of the world be safe and secure for the rest of there lives.

Billy was all grow up and about to leave for collage when he saw a little robot then, he rembered that when he was younger he made one. He thought it would be so cool to bring it to school with him in collage so, he put it in a box and put it in his car so he would not lose it. When he got to the school he went to his dorm and stared to unpack when he noiced that the little robot wasnt there so, he went to his car and looked everywhere but the little robot was nowhere to be seen. Then he went back to his dorm and saw that some other kid was in his dorm he asked 'why are you in here?' the kid sed 'Hey i am your new room mate Bob.' They became good friends. One day when Bob got home he asked billy where did this little robot come from and Billy sed ' Man thats mine I was looking everwhere for it' Bob was confused beacuse the robot had the name Rob on it. And so he asked Billy 'why did it say that name on it'? Billy sed that it was the robots name and sed that  he made it when he was little.           So one day when Billy was gone  Bob was studing in collage for being able to bring stuff to live and  he dicied to try to bring the little robot to live. With just a little pounder and some cimals Bam! The little robot stared to walk then he stared to talk! Bob was so amazed of what he did he could not belive it! But when he just about to go show Billy the little robot jumpped out of this hands and stared to run off and so Bob tryed to chase it! But it was no use the little robot was out of his sight. He begame to worrie about what Billy was going to say beacuse, Billy loved that litte robot and that he would never belive him that he runned away, so Bob stared trying to build another one but he just could find the right stuff to make a little robot again.             When Bob saw Billy he went up to him and sed ' I am so sorry that i lost your little robot!' Billy looked at him and staaaared to cry! Billy got down on one knee and stared crying to! Bob looked at him and sed 'lets find him.'So the looked everywhere and couldnt find him and so, they called a man who knows alot about robots and sed 'Can you please help me I have lost my robot!' The man sed 'Don't worrie i am on my way!               When the man got to their dorm he sed 'Oh my! what happend here!' Billy and Bob where confused they thoought the dorm looked really clean. The man looked at them and sed 'he is in the Bedroom.' They sed 'No he is not we have already looked in there' The man looked and pointed to the bedroom, so the boys went and looked in the room and saw that the little robot just sitting there looking at them. They picked him up and told the man 'Thank you' The man sed now 'I need the robot' they looked at him and then looked at the robot. 'Why?' they asked he sed 'I am a robot and we need to go back to their plant!'                   So the boys waved goodbye as the saw them fly in to the clouds. They didnt no what to do next so, they decied to never make a robot ever again beacuse they don't ever wanna see the robot man, so thats why you shoud never make a robot!

Iv'e thought of building one before I just never got the time to.  But right my door step was a blue print to buld the robot. So I went to my lab and got work. But then suddenly The chambers to bulid it became unstable. And then came this robot that had a mind of his own. And it's name was Johny five. The first thing he said to me was this 'I'm Johny five where do you keep the Five alive?' So I gave him the Five alive. Then he told me 'I'm going to Clevelend.'  I told  him i'll come with to hide you so nobody else sees you. 'Well then I need more Five alive.'And so we were of to Clevelend.Which hunderds of miles away from sweet apple. I bought Johny more Five alive.  And the ending well lets just say that now Johny dresses up like human. Since he likes Five alive. He now Lives in Clevelend and works at a Five alive factory.                         And now still live in sweet apple. But I now became an outstanding sciensest studying robots at the univirsty of Ohio state.

They can carry supplies, collect information, and so many other useful tasks. The robots, Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr. Gower, Agribots, and the Google Car all have different characteristics that make them useful to humans. As well as being extremely helpful in any job or environment robots are never distracted and never need to take a break. Overall robots are very helpful and should be used more often.

Today was the day of his great test. He had to take this test to see if he could be a surgeon at the Jack James Hospital. Only 25 out of 250 people were selected to take this job. Mr. Gower rushed out of the car and slammed the door behind him. Mr. Gower was a man of great prudence, so he had bought a Google Car to drive safely for himself. Finally arrived, Mr. Gower rushed in the hospital and went up the third floor. 'There!', he said. He had found the testing room. Mr. Gower took a seat and the professor gave him instructions on how to open the test online. There were 340 questions. Mr. Gower was ready for this. After 5 hours, Mr. Gower had finished. He was exhausted. The professor then told every body to log off the computer.

We ordred food and my siblings and I went to the restroom to wash our hands. While I was washing my hands in the restroom I saw this black ghost likely figure in the mirror! I suddenly jumped and rept torward the figure which was blinking. In my thought I thought the thing was going to explode like in movies but I touched the figure and the figure jumped to life ans said ''Hello, my name is Ailan and it is very nice to to meet you!'' I ran out out screaming like I was on a rollercoastser and the food was on our table already. My double-bacon Cheeseburger, my sister's country fried steak, my dad's omelet, my baby sister's slam, and my mom's vegetarian omelet.I asked why the food had came out so fast and my mom answered while evryone was chewing hungrily ''Because of the robot chefs'' I ran back to the restroom and the robot was gone!!!I looked around the whole restraunt and finally found that he was making an ice cream sundae. The robot swiftly turned around and gave me the delicous loooking sundae and said stretching out his arm ''Here you go!'' I ran outside of the restaraunt and the name of the restraunt was Robots n' Humans!!! NO wonder, no wonder, no wonder and after that I ate my cheeseburger like the hungriest man in the world!!!

Their was once a story called ''I, Robot''. It was a story that set in the future, when robot take care of children. When the story was written it was a fantasy ,but not for while now it was close to come true. Since today, robots can do all kinds of work. They can assemble electronic gadgets, guide trains on tracks,and sort   trash.       There is all kinds of robots in the world that can help. Especially, the robot called Gemini-Scout. It is a remote-controlled robot that does search-and-rescue work in mines under the ground. The robot is less than two feet tall and has wheels. It can go up and down stairs ,makes tight turns, and it can even roll in through water. The robot is small ,but it is strong. Gemini-Scout carries food, water, and other supplies. It can drag hurt people to safety.       Their is one more robot i would love to talk to you about. The robot is called Dante 2 . Dante 2 is a robot with an interesting job- it climbs into volcanos to gather information for scientist. Like a spider, this robot has eight legs. This helps it climb the steep walls of the volcano. It is also built to survive very high heat. When a volcano is too dangerous for scientist to enter, Dante goes instead.See thier is robots that can help you when you hurt or in need.

The robot that I was working on was a robot that could swim like a dolphin, fly like a bird, walk like a human, and be as quite as a mouse but it looked like a dog. I didn't want it to come a live, i just wanted it because my mom said I had to clean up my lab. I have so much stuff on the ground that you can't see where you are stepping. So since I don't have any money, I just made a giant robot that does everything but the thing is that when I made it was just going to be something that holds my parts. Then when I need something I can just take it off of the giant robot.                                 I don't know what I want to name him. I was thinking ' the DBHM.' It stands for dolphin, bird, human, mouse which is what this robot is. I was also thinking Dog. Only because I have a dog and I love him. I think I will go with dog. After I  picked his name my mom yelled at me that it was time for dinner. I knew that if it was time for dinner that ment that I would have to go to bed after and I wouldn't get to see Dog again. I said 'Good night' to Dog and walked right out of my lab to go eat dinner. Since it was saturday I would see Dog in the morning.                     The nex tmorning I got up and run right to my lab. there was a thuder storm last night so I wanted to make sure everything was alright. When I got there I opened the door. The next thing that I saw was just COOL!!!!! I seen my robot up an walking around touching everything that I had. By the way I don't and I mean DON'T like people touching my stuff that is in my lab. At first I thought it was just my dad. So I yelled 'Hey Dude, what are you doing?' As soon as it turned around and started to run at me like a little puppy. I could tell that it was not anything like my dad. It was kind of cute in a way. If you would have seen the way ,Dog, was running at me you would have run around your lab too. When it finally got me it was like being acttacked by a giant. Dog was very nice. He acted just like a puppy dog.                     Since it was summer time I didm't have to go to school. Dog was my best friend. Even though he couldn't talk he was in my world. When I showed my mom and dad dog, I just said that I found him on the road. Since he looked like a giant dog, my mom and dad were ok with keeping him. Since than I would take Dog everywhere. One day when we went to the beach Dog came with us. I said that we shouldn't because even though he was pat dolphin doesn't mean he could really swim.                    At first when Dog got in the water he was fine but as we went deeper Dog started act very wierd. When I stoped because I didn't want to go any more. Dog just kept going. He just kept swimming like he was a agnet on a mission. He just never stoped until I couldn't see him any more. Then all of a sudden I heard a boat crash. I heard people yelled that they hit a dog, but before anyone seen it it was gone to the bottom of the ocean.                   After that I decedied to make my lab a swimming pool. I named it 'The Dog Pool.' I named it that because of my friend robot Dog.

Milo and Tanya were friends baecause Tanya had none. One night Tanya saw a shooting star she wished that Milo could be a real Robot that could talk and walk and do human stuff. When Tanya awoke the next morning she woke up to find Milo staring at her, but what took her by suprise is when he said ' happy birthday Tanya'. She blinked a few times to see if she was dreaming but to only find it was true. ' How are you alive?' Tanya asked. ' Because you wished on a shooting star' Milo said. 'So dreams do come true?' asked Tanya. ' yeah they do' answered Milo. Tanya jumped out of bed and into her mom and dad's room. ' Wake Up!' she yelled. 'Happy Birthday' her parents shouted. 'Guess what I found this morning, Milo is real hes talking and walking' she said. Her parents didn't believe her so they just laughed. 'I'll just show you then' she said.'Milo' she shouted, Milo came marching in her parents faces changed from happy to shock they then screamed. 'Hi' said Milo. 'How are you alive?' Delilah, Tanya's mom asked. 'Because Tanya wished on a shooting star for me to be' he answered. 'So dreams do come true?' Tim,Tanya's dad asked. ' yeah they do' Milo replied simpily. Suddenly a idea popped in Tanya's head ' Are my other robots alive?' she asked. 'Yeah they are I don't know why but they are'. Tanya ran to her room to see all her robots all over the floor and running around chasing each other.'Stop' she shouted eveeryone froze from what they were doing.' Everyone in the toy box' she comanded everyone listned. She then went to go get ready for her birthday party. Once all the guest arived they all played games, chatted, and made jokes. When all that was done everyone was ready for the cake cutting. When that part was over everyone gathered around for presents. Tanya got three outfits from her aunt Margaret, four pairs of shoes from her cousin Rida, two necklaces form her grandad, three rings from her grandmother, and a picture of her and Allis, her friend from Allis and her mom. At the end of the party Tanya realized what good family and friends she had. She also then realized what she wanted to be and that was a scientist who desinged robots. Tanya is now twenty-nine years old with two little girls. She fufilled her dream by becoming a scientist she still has Milo who helps in her lab and the best part is she gets to keep every robot she makes. Tanya now has thirty-nine robots. Tanya now realized what new robot she would make a memory robot which will remind you of good memories. She invented it and it became a success. Tanya realized she had everything she ever wanted and it was right at the tip of her fingers.

As the street of Thornwood slowly fell asleep, Harry only grew more awake. His mind inevitably soared through the universe. From space, to his bedroom, the boy's curiosity arose, but tonight was different. The howling wind was calling him to an adventure. Harry hopped out of bed and threw his running shoes on. Once he ran outside he felt free, and he just kept running. He kept running and running until he stumbled over something hard. Something metallic. Harry peered down below him and saw the remains of something fantastic. It was rusty, and when he picked it up, he recognized it from his story books. The robot was marvelous. 'I'm going to fix it,' he thought, 'I will fix it.'

Here are just a few of them.                       The robot I will talk about is the Gemini-Scout robot. The Gemini -Scout robot does search-and-rescue work in mines under ground. They're less than 2 feet tall and have wheels. It can go up and down stairs and make sharp turns. Guess what? It can even roll through water! The robot maybe a compact robot but it is very strong. Gemini-Scout can even carry food, water, and any other things. If you or anybody else gets hurt, Gemini-Scout can drag them to safety.                            Gemini-Scout is so high-tech, that where ever it goes, it collects information! For instance, it tests the air for poisones gases and lets the miners know where the air is safe to breath. The robot even has a thermal camera to help ot find miners. A thermal camera uses heat sensors to help find any living things, weather its a animal or a person.                              This robot is super easy to use. Its remote control is the same one used for many video games. If you have ever played a video game before, you know exactly how to control the Gemini-Scout.

Yet he didn't work he was just for display,but it didn't matter he looked so awesome I was very curious and brought the life size robot down from the shelf .for a while I was playing with the thing then it just got boring . So I placed it on the floor next to the electric wires.Later on I saw the robot spark. The sparks were blue. I had found out my mother  turned on the switch for the wires. I was very scared the robot said,' hello my name is..... MOB.' I was very frightened and didn't know what to do I ran out of the room. I told my mom and she said,'you are crazy mijo your robot didn't come to life,you need some sleep.'I replied ,'mom its true the robot is real his name is MOB please mom please believe me.' I could tell she didn't want to go up to my room and see but she said ,'well okay i will go up just once.'       While we were going up,we heard a loud 'THUMP....THUMP' I was scared I told my mom to not go up but she went up anyways.Little did we know it was just my dad fixing the roof.My mom opened my room and there he was. MOB........ was cleaning my room?what my mom could not believe it my room was finally clean . And also the robot was real.we found his ability it was to clean so now we love MOB because he can clean non stop.

'Lets play truth or dare!' Maya suggests to her three friends sitting in front of her with bored looks plastered onto their faces. 'I guess so....' Kiarah replies trying to lighten up the mood. 'Fine.' says Jazlyn while Harry nods. 'Okay Maya, truth or dare?' Kiarah challenges, 'Truth.' Maya says with a smirk. Kiarah quickly comes up with a question, 'Is it true that you put the rat in Hannah Merit's lunch bag?' she asks with a funny look on her face. Maya looks at the floor laughing to herself, 'Guilty.' she stated. The four best friends continued playing their game, 'Kiarah, it's your turn!' Maya said excitedly and continued, 'Truth or dare?' Kiarah thought carefully of what to pick and then said, 'Dare.' Maya snickered then went to talk  to Jazlyn and Harry about the dare. after minutes of waiting for her dare, Kiarah finally listened closely to her task. 'I dare you to-' 'Hey kids!' Mrs.Serrano said while cutting off her dare. 'Seriously mom?!?!' shouted Kiarah. 'I'm sorry, you guys continue, I just have to put this box with the rest of them, then I'll be on my way.' The kids nodded then continued their game once Mrs. Serrano left. Suddenly, they heard something rattling in the corner of the shed. 'What was that?' asked Harry, Kiarah tried to calm him down, 'It's probably just my dog.'             The box rattled again, 'I highly doubt that is your dog Kiarah.' said Jazlyn with a shaky voice. 'C'mon, let's go look at it.' said Maya. The kids stood up quietly and tiptoed toward the moving box. They finally reached the box and began opening it. Once it was finally open, Jazlyn whispered, 'What is that?' and she pointed to the metal object laying in the box. Out of nowhere, the unknown object stood up and started to talk, 'I am Mr. Gower.' it stated. The kids were in shock as it moved around the shed floor. Harry finally spoke up, 'I-It's a r-robot.' he stuttered. Jazlyn looked at the robot, 'What are you and why are you here?' she asked trying to calm herself down. 'I am Mr. Gower, I work in the hospital with the nurses and the doctors.' Kiarah sighed in relief, 'Oh. The hospital that my mom works in has been using robots to help the patients and stuff.' Maya relaxed her tense body and sighed, 'What are you doing here?' she  Mr. Gower. 'I am out of order.' it said, Jazlyn then decided to talk, 'Out of order?' Mr. Gower nodded and said, 'Yes, I can no longer carry things properly because my drawers are jammed.' The kids looked at this odd robot in amazement and continued to talk to it.                    'What did you do in the hospital?' asked Harry as he finally relaxed. Mr. Gower quickly responded, 'I helped the nurses and doctors bring medicine for the patients. I can also carry up to 500 pounds of anything you wish for me to carry.' It continued to teach the kids about itself until they heard a fist pounding on the door, 'Hey kids, dinner is ready.' said Mrs. Serrano. 'That's my mom! What are we gonna do?' Kiarah whispered while Jazlyn and Harry began to panic. 'Hide the robot!' said Maya. Maya and Kiarah told Mr. Gower to be quiet and to hide under the bed sheets that covered the floor. Then they all hopped into the sheets right before Mrs. Serrano opened the door to the shed. 'We ordered pizza, want to eat?' she asked 'No thanks mom, we're fine, bye!' Kiarah rushed. Mrs. Serrano had a curious look on her face as she exited the shed. They all sighed in relief for the second time that day. 'That was a close one.' Jazlyn said as she got up from under the covers, 'You can say that again.' said Maya. Mr. Gower came out of the sheets and began talking again, 'I am battery operated and I can deliver medicine for twelve hours without stopping if you charge me for two hours.' Mr. Gower said.Sadly, the robot did not mention that he was running out of battery, and right after they asked him a question, his battery died. As much as the kids wanted to enjoy a summer that was learning free, they certainly would never forget the summer that they met a robot.

I would be very confused. Thats what happen to my best friend and I.                                                   Many kids think that robots are not real. Like me. But no, there are many robots alive. But we didn`t think we could see some robots in the library. That was a weird thing I ever seen. Thats what happen to my best friend amd me. It all started when my best friend, Monica and I went to the library. When we get to the libary a young lady told us that we could stay at the library. She told us that she need to the hospital to see her mom. When the lady left we both were looking for a book so we could study our science test. In that moment something weird happen.                                                 We both saw four robots alive! We were so confused. We didnt know what to do. So we both think that the best idea would be to run away from the robots but than we remember that we did a promise to the young lady. One of the robots could talk. His name was Mr.Gower. Mr Gower told us what he can do. We were both surprised.                             Than we saw other three robots. their names were Agribot Dante 2, and Gemini-Scout. The four robots were very loveable. They were like part of my family. Than we forgot that we were in the library to study. Than the lady have come. Monica and I took the four robots to the park. Than we made a little party.                                      Some of the robots couldn`t eat. So Monica and I decide that we should play instead of eating. Because some of the robots might feel like kind of robots might feel like kind of robots can`t do anything. Or eat any thing. That's why Monica and I prefer to play instead to eat. We were having a lot of fun.                               As you can see , playing, having fun and watch how our new friends talk. It makes you laugh and it makes you entertain you. Thats what I called having so much fun. 	DT NNP WDT DT IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNP MD PRP VB IN PRP VBP NNS IN DT IN DT JJ NNS JJ .

When all of a sudden, the robot turn alive.My brother and I were shock about the robots.''Beep beep activiating mission control'',the robot said.My brother went up to it and ask its name.''Zeus the second is my name now why won't you bring me back to the Science lab?''asked Zeus the second.

''Yeah Zeus  we'll miss you,''I said.''I'll miss you too,''he said He offered us to go see him at NASA one day.We happily accepted.

Now, we don't need to write about them, because they are all around us! They are used for lots of jobs, as they talked about back then. The robots can be used for medical help, and going into volcanoes.        Many robots are made to copy animals, and some are even made to play with animals! Many robots are used in the field of manufacturing, but some are used just to have fun with. College students in Oregon have created robots that can play hockey or shuffleboard all by themselves! All year, the students work hard to make the robots. The robots play the game without any instruction form the students. They twist, turn, and even have small matches to see who's robot will with the game! In the final test if the students made a hockey robot, the robot must move and shoot the puck into the net without any help by remote control.        A robot in the Google's self-driving car project may have people behind the wheel, but they are not the people who are driving, the robot is guiding them all over by using detailed maps to navigate. There are radars on the sides, fornt and back to see what is going on.        We did not know if robots will ever exist, but all thanks to those short stories, they are here next to us.

By Hayley Bernier          Jorden is a fun loving robot. He can talk, sing, dance, pick fruit, rescue anything, has first aid kit, and works with medicine.      Jorden had gone missing and we{me,Kate, and my fellow lab-mates}have looked everywhere. We have heard on the news that they had found him, but he had shut down{died}. We went to see him and once we got there we decided to throw him away.      A few days later Jorden woke up. He was all confused of where he was. All he knew was that he had to find his owner Kate. He started talking to himself on how he could find Kate. So he just set off to find her. He went days on end looking, but then he relized that he was in his old neighborhood. He started singing and dancing for joy.      Then he saw someone in trouble. He rushed to their side, there were news reporters there. He managed to help the injured person. He pulled them out with such for that his first aid kid flew open. He bandaged up the injured person, they were soon lifted to the hospital.      The next day Kate saw him on the news, she rushed to the police station to tell them about her missing robot. She and the police were searching for Jorden. Everyday Jorden found something to do that could help everyone. Kate followed every report that came on the news. She just couldn't keep up with Jorden's good deeds.He even helped farmers pick fruit in the hottest heat to where the farmers couldn't.      One day Kate decided to put herself into a fake accident. She planed to fake an accident so Jorden may come to help her. As her plan said, Jorden  came to rescue Kate. They were reunited and lived a life were they helped anyone in need of help.      They never turned down anyone even if it was a dumb event that happened. They soon opened up a search and rescue clinic a few years later. They both made their small town a happier/safier place to live and to visit. Jorden was passed down from generation to generation in Kate's family. Every generation loved him. Everyone could never hate Jorden for what he has done to help his small town.     	NNP NNP NNP NNP .

They cooked, cleaned, took care of people, and worked. It was a time of peace and quiet. Not many poeple liked to start drama or fights because they didn't have to worry about any of those things. Why? It was all because of robots.                                  A long time ago around 1955, robots existed. That was the time of peace and quiet. All around America you could find robots. The people that weren't in the U.S. got jelouse because we had robots and they didn't. They thought of a plan that could kill all robots. There plan was to release a bad chemical that would kill all robots, and they did. It was terrible. It didn't hurt anyone just the robots. There were dead robots everywhere. Nobody new what to do.                        After all the robots died they kept them. They never threw them away. People needed to learn how to get up and do things for themselves because they were so used to the robots doing everything for them. People needed to learn to cook, and clean by themselves. Scientist looked quicker and easier ways to get the robots back to life.                         One ordinary day a robot was found alive in the woods. They wondered how that had happened. Scientist studied the place in the woods where the robot was found for many days. hey found out that there was acually some good in the chemicals that the bad people released. So they took it back to thier lab and made tons, and tons, of the good chemicals. soon they released it all around America and all the robots came back to life. Other people thought it was kind of rude to make the robots go back to doing everything for them, so they all started helping the robots till this day on.

The robot sped through the concrete wall into the streets of Venice, FL. It started slowing down and down until it said in a fuzzy, jummbled up voice, 'Po*wer*ing D*own....'   Frank and his friend, Luke, were playing in Frank's backyard when they heard a strange noise.'What was that?' Frank said responting to the faint buzz.'Let's check it out,' Luke said, adventure moving through his viens. They moved into the front yard when they saw a giant, metallic, robot.   It had a blue stripe down it's side which had the righting X-6. It had two arms and two legs. It's feet however, had what looked like roller blades. It's eyes were black, and a rectangle where it's mouth should be.   'We have to help it!' Luke said. 'Fine, lets see how we can power it.' Frank repplied. Then they found it. A small panel, sealed by a screwdriver. 'It runs,' Luke said, 'on double a batteries.' Frank told him optimistically, 'That makes it easy.'   So they replaced the batteries. The robot started to twitch. More and more until a large sound came on, just like on a computer.The robot said 'I am X-6. How can I serve you.' Frank replied, 'Er... How about you play with us?' 'Searching data banks... playing is highly illogical.' Luke shouted, 'WHAT! Playing is having fun. Do you know what fun is?' 'Fun is not how I was programmed. But, I can adapt to your foreign custom.' X-6 said.   So the children started to tell the robot how to play all sorts of games, tah, hide and seek. and even some sports. The robot, was not understanding.'Why do I hit the ball with my foot when I have hands to carry it?' The robot asked. Luke answered, 'It is what makes the game interesting.' The robot realized at that moment what fun was.   So they all laughed and played until it was dark. Then, Luke went home, X-6 was sitting in Frank's  room, waiting for daytime to play again. Then, he could hear a siren. Frake rose sleepily. Blue and red lights started to flash. 'They have came to take me back.' Robot said. Frank nodded. He knew this day was coming, he just wished it was later. Sadness filled his mind. Robot silently walked out the door.

She was so interested in science that one day, she decided to build a robot.           Her parents took her to a hardware store to get all of the supplies. She knew it was going to be difficult. But she also knew that once she was done, it would all be worth it. She worked on it every day after school and all weekend for about a month. Then, on May 26, 2013, she finished.           When she was done, she put it on the floor to see if it would turn on. It wasn't working! She started to cry saying that she wasted her time and her parents' money. It was late and her mom told her to start at it again tomorrow.           In the middle of the night she heard a strange voice coming from the basement where she worked on her robot. She went down to see what it was and there it was, her robot in action!           She ran upstairs to tell her paretns what happened. She was so excited. Everything paid off afterall. But there was one problem, she wasn't running it. It was running itself! She didn't know how to get it off and it was making so much noise.           Kayla had to kill the robot she'd worked so hard on. She was so sad, but she snapped the wires, and the robot was gone.

All of a sudden the sky had a dark gray tint to it. We just thought that it was getting dark so we decided to start back home, when... BOOM!! CRASH!!  All of a sudden the horses started bucking and rearing because they were spooked so badly. Savanna and I galloped down to where there was a smelly poof of gray, thick smoke that disapeared quickly. When we got closer there was something crawling towards us.      We jumped of our horses and decoverd that it was a rodot that had crashed landed on Earth. The robot could not speek but he could use sign that we could not figure out. Finally, we new what to do. We put the robot that we named chicken, on the back of my saddle and rode back up the mountain and my grandfather came limping up to us and said ' did you see that robot burst out of the valcano that just eroupted'!!!

Then people can evacuate areas that volcanic activity may ocur.       Mr. Gower is a robot that helps bring medicine in hospitals. So patients can meds a lot faster.

Some robots brought everyone drinks or snacks for the guests there they were very helpful but, there was this one robot that would always bump into a bunch a stuff like the walls and that particular robot was a very clumsy robot out of all of the other robots there. After everyone was done they were escorted outside and they saw the governor of the Robot Facility and he was speaking to everyone about how his robots worked there he said,'These are helpful robots they bring you whatever you want, let me demonstrate how my robots work here,'    So he told the robot to make lemonade and bring it to him and the robot did as he was told and everyone started to clap cause, the robots were a brilliant invention they were amazing to everyone there.   After it started to rain and they put their umbrellas up, then there was a big struck of lighting come from the clouds and it hit the clumsy robot and then the robot starting walking saying,'Number Five is alive,' the guy putting the robots away got frightened and he started running away and the robot was walking inside if the facility and bumping into everything like usaully, then he sees something and pushes a button and he goes into a hallway and follows the other robots into the room with all the guests there.   After a little while the robot left the Robot Facility and then he went into the city and hoped onto a truck that sells food and he was making a mess.   Then when she got home she opend the back of her truck at night and she heard and saw someone in there because her truck was shaking and it was lighting up in the back of her van.   It had lights in the back and she said,'Hello is anyone there,hello anyone there, Im talking to you,' and no one answered her so she decided to open the back door and see who was in there and in there was.......   Number Five and she got creeped out and she ran.

The next few paragraphs are about different kinds of robots that help scientist and people in their everyday lives.       The first robot I am going to tell you about is Gemini-Scout.  Gemini-Scout is a robot that works in underground mines.  This robot is two feet tall, but it is very strong.  It can also carry supplies for the miners.  And wherever is goes it collects information.  It can also rescue miners that are trapped.  This robot is controlled by a remote control almost like the use with some video games, so you might know how to use Gemini-Scout.       The next robot I am going to tell you about is Dante 2.  Dante 2 is a robot that climbs in a volcano and gathers information from scientists.  Dante 2 has 8 legs like a spider so it can climb steep walls of the volcano.  Dante 2 is also built to survive very high heat.  With the help of Dante 2, scientists can now study volcanoes while they are safe in their laboratories.       Mr. Grower is a robot that works in hospitals.  This robot can carry medicine for doctors and nurses.  Mr. Grower is so strong that it can pull 500 pounds.  Mr. Grower can also speak.  It can say things like 'Calling elevator' or 'Your delivery is here.'  Mr. Grower can also do work that does work for doctors so the doctors can focus on other important tasks.       The last robot I am going to talk about are agribots.  These robots picks fruit.  Agribots come in different shapes and sizes depending on the time of fruit it picks.  To pick the fruit, it senses the color of the fruit.  This helps the robot determine weather the fruit is ripe or not.  At the MIT, scientist are growing cherry tomatoes, but without humans.  The agribots seem unusual, but one day they might be very common on farms.       And that is my story about robots.

Gemini-scout is a robot that recuses miners.He also carry's food and water.One of the attachments that he has  is night vision night vision is to find traped miners.You cold notice a Gemini-scout by the size its two feet tall its small but its strong.And something cool about this robot is that it could make tight turns.            Dante 2 is a robot made to support high heat and that's why they use this robot to gather information in volcanoes.Its essay to spot because it has eight legs that make it get better grip on the walls from the volcanoes.               Mr.Gower work's in hospitals.he helps nurses by bring the medication they need.he looks like a cabinet with wells.In the drawers he stores medicine.he could go any were in the elevator the steers the hallways  and be able to move around obstetrical that get in his way.He is able to carry 500 ponds.He runs by battery it takes two hours to him be fully charged and twelve hours to run out.After all this robot aids the hospitals.       After all this robots contributor to the society in many different ways.

It was a strange metal thing that had arms,legs,eyes,and toes   it suddenly woke up and start saying hello. we went back home and i took it to my room i checked and see if it was dangerous the only thing it was saying where am i when i checked it it was a nice robot ? I told her i would fix her in no time but i got confuse with the strings and metal.                                        The next, day i came from school and went running to my room i had learn how to fix the robot i had to move stuff. one hour later, the was ready to play (like a robot called Robbie she was full of battery). the robot and i played all day but, when it was time to do my homework i went inside and it was done when i checked who's handwriting it was mine. Next, i was about to do my homework when it was all done i told my sister,dad, and mom if they had done it they said all no. When i went to my room i saw the robot doing my homework.                         I was sad because i missed doing my homework and chores when i went to my friend meeting i told my friends i didn't like the robot doing my job. I felt bad to tell the robot this because she was trying to help. One Sunday i saw the robot cleaning the whole house my family was happy i had a robot on my house and sow did my parents and sister but, i didn't i was sad i would get forget. one time i told the robot that i wanted to do everything around the house but it said no. When my sister got sick she came like a doctor (like if she was Mr. Gower). The robot had helped my sister and everybody loved the robot.                         On Saturday afternoon i told the robot if it would like to help me clean the parks,streets, and other places so earth can be clean it said yes. The robot had gave me a great idea while we were cleaning. when we went home i went to the garage to get metal from my dad. He said it was OK to get some from then i told the robot to stay still so i could see how she was built. I had took every piece of information from then i told her to help me make more robots.                        When sunrise came we were done. Next, morning i went outside at my front yard i put a sign that said ''nice robots that would help earth and make a better place.'' I told the robot this would help us make EARTH a better place thanks to the robot i had earth is OK. Know i would make lots of more robots to live and makes live with my own robot !

I read aloud:                                                                                                          The last tear of hope       I was in the library taking notes about how to built a robot with such a powerful feeling and emotions, so that the robot would look real human. I went back to my lab and then i saw that my robot wasn't there. I looked every where, but didn't find it. I thought someone steel it; just then i feel a cold hand on my soulder; i turn around to look at the the hand. I fell back on my feet with a sudden shock; it was not a human's hand, it was my robots hand.       I don't know how it happened, but i felt proud of myself. I never saw a miracle like that. I was shocked and happy both. The robot help me get up and read my feelings emotions and said ' I am proud of you, too. It was impossible that a robot could feel emotions. I asked him 'how did he get alive?' He didn't answer me.       He started to walk and he went to the library and give me a book that says magical world: feelings of hope. I never read that book, but i know i have that book. He explains me that i was his hope. Only i can make him alive. It means i was the hope in side him, that i could still live with him.        After that incident (when the robots come to life) we never talked about that incident again. I live with him forever and he accept me as his father. We stayed with each other 20  years. We played with each other and also tell our secrets to each other. We went to farmes and countries and he became a member of our family. I make him older as he was my own son. I teach him how to play games like chess, badmenton and soccer. I also how to make your garden beautiful. I read stories to him at night and do all the stuff like cooking and make him count, read and write. He was getting old. He wants to be a scientist(scientists who work in NASA).A scientist like me, who beleieve in himself.I give him all the scientific books i have and he starts studying.He became a great scientist and he also make his dreams come true.       I was getting old. too. I was 64 and then one day felt very sick and i call him and he come to me and i told him my last wish that he will always stay happy; and tears coming through his eyes; i opened his sysytem and press the memory button and the last thing i rememberd was a tear rolling down his cheeks. The last tear of hope.

These robots would be helpful to our environment. Also it can be a great learning experience. the three robots that would be the best help to our planet would be Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, and the self-driving car.           First of all, is the Gemini-Scout. For example, it's a robot that helps miners. It checks if there are any gases. Also it is really strong in case anybody is hurt. Indeed the robot is small but a big help.           Moreover, is the Dante 2. For instance, it is like a spider which has eight legs. It goes and check volcanoes to make sure it is not going to erupt. Also it is built for high heat so it can go inside the volcano. Truly this robot helps scientists because they cannot take the heat.           Last of all, is the self-driving car. What I mean is, it's a great help for bad drivers. It won't crash because it thinks ahead of humans. Also it can never be distracted because it doesn't text, drink or get tired. Verily this robot can stop terrible drivers from getting hurt.           Succinctly, then, having robots would be euphoric. If these robots were real they would make a great change to our planet. I have myriad reasons why there should be robots.

Well one day when her creators thought she was ready to do some good in the world they were wrong.Instead of Bella doing good she actually did bad.Since she was a robot and not a human she had no little voice in her head to say 'hey your bad kid!' and it was also because she had more abilities than other robots that do search and rescue.Bella kinda had a bit of a rough time trying to control herself.She caused a fire because when she was sent in the fire was only a few sparks until Bella help out the flames.After the fire accident she was sent back to be worked on.Though after a few years she was released again and she did good.Her first good deed she had done was save a whole family of cats from a burning tree!Bella then stared to do bigger things like help people out of burning buildings or from buildings that have collapsed.        Though she went to do jobs bigger than save people from buildings on fire and that have collapsed.She would save people and pets from planes that caught fire or that have landed under or on top of water! Her creators got medals for creating the best robot ever to be invented.Bella eventually started to save the entire world but sadly she retired from herduties of saving the world when her abilliteis failed when she tried to save someone from a car crash.

He can also talk. this is a very unique and helpful robot.       there is also one that can climd. but this robot doesn't climb trees or houses, he climbs volcanoes. Thanks to this robot scientists can study volcanoes from there labritories.              As you can, robots are now very helpful to this generation. They are very useful in this generation. You might not know this,but  you use robots every day. when you watch T.V., or ride a car, even when you use the microwave. As you can see, robots ar e every where.

She was sitting on the floor. As she sat on the floor she thought. She thought about making a robot. She thought about making a robot because of her friend. Her friend was making a pig for her classmates to see. So Zoe went to her room and was thinking, 'if Susan is making a pig for the class then i can make a robot for the class to see.'               So she went down stairs to tell her mom and dad what she was about to do. Later that day Zoe went to the craft store with her mom and dad. They got stuff to make the robot with. Then when they got home Zoe started on her robot. The first thing she did with the robot was that she gave it a name and its name was Mr. Rower. So than a couple of hours later she was done.               The next day, she went to school and came back home. When she came back home she did not see the robot. So she went outside to see if he was outside. She looks down the street and see Mr. Rower walking down the street. She goes up beside him and he says hey and Zoe got scared. But, Mr. Rower was not trying to scare Zoe. so then she realized that Mr. Rower had trued into a human just like her over the course of the day.

I wanted to join the robotics club, but I know i'd be no good at making robots. As I got older I forgot about robots and just went on with my life until it was the week before my birthday. I get up like everyday and get ready as quick as i can so i don't make me and my friend Jade late to school. I see Jade's car and i tell mom that im going to school. She kisses me on the head and tells me bye and have a good day like she always does. I leave and walk quickly to Jade's car. As soon as I get in we start talking and we talk the ride there. As we get to school I think that everythings going to be the same as it always is, but little did I know that the school is going to be having a robot contest and everyone has to watch.       I walk in with Jade and we walk to our lockers and see our other friend Lauren. Lauren says' Hey guys did you know today is the robot competition?'. Jade just shakes her head yes.' Really? I didn't even know they were having one.' I say. 'Yeah and everyone has to watch it this time.' says Jade. I sigh not wanting to go, because im not really interested in watching. We get our stuff and go to our home room together. We enter the room one after the other and take our seats beside each other. The tearcher enters and tells everyone that because the robot contest is going to start in 5 minutes we can just sit and talk. We talk for 5 minutes then go and sit in the gym and wait for the contest to start. ' Man I didn't wan't to watch this at all. It's going to be so boring.' 'Quit your complaining it could be worse.' says Laruen. She was right it could be worse. After everyone showed their robots, the first competition started. Randomly there was  the announcer guy who told the crowd that they needed a few more people to make a robot. 'Rachel, Jade, Lauren, Sam, and Brandon will make a robot.' What no i screamed in my head even though i had no choice.       After school was over Lauren and Jade came over to my house to get started on their robot.'I'm going to make a cat robot. What are you guys going to make?' I asked. 'Well i'm going to make a butterfly robot.' says Jade proudly. 'I'm going to make a normal robot.' says Lauren. 'Why?' Jade and I say at the same time. 'because a normal robot is easier.'says Laruen. Jade and I look at each other. Oh course i picked something hard to do, but im going to stick with it. We all start making our robots and talk to each other. It takes about a week but we finish it. My robot looks the best out of the three robots. They all said they wished they could have made theirs look like mine,but I don't think they could have made theirs like mine. On the day of the contest i was nervous about showing my robot to everyone, but i did. The contest was over and they were about to tell everyone who won. 'The winner of this years robot contest is... Rachel!' I won, i actually won yay. At the end of the day when we went home i told my mom and dad that i won. I went to my room and put my robot on my bed. I listened to music for a while when i noticed the robot was gone. I looked for it and when i found it, it was alive and i mean it was moving on its own and the controller wasnt even being messed with. It even talked to me, which i found kind of cool. I ended up having an awesome robot that could talk and move around by itself. I had a really good time with it until someone stole it.

Carlos had a lab were he would go in and test many things.  One day Carlos got an idea. His idea was to built a robot,as soon as he got the idea he started to get to work.  When he heard his friends coming he covered the robot, and Carlos raned to them so that they would not come in the lab.  Bob and Robert new that Carlos had done                something because Carlos was acting very strange,so they dictated to leave.                              When Carlos friends left home he went to go work on the robot. When Carols's mom went to check what he was doing, next to him she was a big type of metal deceive. Caros's mom was supriced. Carlos told his mom to get out and that he needed privice. He was very mad at his mom. It was nine p.m. and Carlos was still working with the robot.Carlos mom was staring to wet worry. Then at ten p.m. Calos had camed out of the   lab.                      The next day Carlos went to school and when he past by his history class he was his fiends.  Bob asked if Robert and him could go to his house Carlos said,''sure why not.''   When Bob and Robert went to Carlos's house they both went to the lab without Carlos.   Carlos was looking for his friends all over the place but he could nt find them. Carlos thought that they had maybe left,so Carlos went to his lab to go work on his robot.Carlos saw Bob and Robert playing around with the robot,when Bob turned on the robot.  Carlos was very mad because the robot only had his bad side.               As soon as the robot was tuned it on was distoying everything.  Carlos and Robert was trying to stop it but they couldn'n stop it.  The robot was distoying homes and parks .   Until Carlos got an idea he told Robert to distract him,wile Robert was distracting the robort Calos jumped on the robot and turnd it off.  Everyone was thanking them because they had saved the town.Carlos ansd Robert where the heros in their town.

T ere is a robot that is called Gemini-Scout this robot helps the people he can go up and down stares. It also can eEven roll through water. He also helps the people by collecting information that other robots cant get. It also has a camera in the front of the robot and it can direct like living things like kids dogs and lot of living things .                           This robot helps like the siensetest to help to understand what gases are coming from those volcanoes . This robots can get lot of information and bring it to us . So like if a volcano is to dangles for the sientest instead of the sientest to go the robot Dante 2 goes and gets the information that the saientest were looking for .                         There is some other robots that work in the hospital this robot helps the doctors .  For example the robots help to say to the doctor if the beb of his hart is going to fast or to slow . This robot name is Mr. Gower this robot can go up and down the elevator and inside it has some medicines that are for some other people that need it But that robot cant give the medicines to no one just the one that has the key to unlock him and take them out .                         This is a robot that pekes fruit up from the bottom it con peak up oranges grapes  biers apples and some other lot type of fruit . This robot is called Agribots this is one of the robots that need more charge because this robots use lot of energy . Mostly you can find it in farms or other places like that . Tere some robots like this that use gas but this one docent use it this one uses electricity . 	NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB IN NNS WDT NN NNS IN PRP .

At the show were clowns, lions, jugglers and even elephants but what interested him the most was the robot. It could do almost anything, it could juggle, bake and even play catch with you and this gave this young boy a great idea. The same night he wen home to ask his Pa if he could buy some supplies to make the robot. His Pa said no, this disappointed him but he would not give up. So he started working at a shop just a block away, there he would earn $10 dollars an hour, just enough to buy the supplies.            The next day he worked fast, selling pie after pie, and he even got $5 worth of tips. This continued for the next month until he finally earned enough. He went  the mechanic and bought everything he needed and went home and started building but first he would have to design it and give it a name. There were dosens of designs everwhere in the house untill he finally found the perfect one. It would have a box head and body and skinny arms and legs. And its name would be Andy.            When he finally finished the robot he played with it all day everyday and he even got in the news for making the robot. The title of the paper was Alfred the new Einstein. After many years the robot broke he tried to fix it but hting had gotten more expensive since he was a child so he just left it there never to be played wih agan. But it is still a token of friendship and he will never forget all the great times he had with it.

He always goes to there to see if he can find intresting tools,to make things he also happens to be a clock maker, he was looking for bolts when suddenly he found a mistreated robot. It looked like if it could write somthing because it was sitting down and had a pen in his arm later,he took it home he searched on the internet but he couldn't find the robot he used some key words like small robot whith pen. Then he was examining the robot eventually he found a word and said it outloud ' Automoton', then he searched it on the internet then it said they come to life when fully repaired they are worth 3,050 dollars. Robert told his father wanted to sellit but robert wanted to fix it. So they did it took 2 years but it was done the pieces used in it where from clocks but one thing they didnt notice is that it needs a key to work. They found the right key two years later the machine of 1843 came into the work of art they put the key in winded it up and the robot drew a moon whith a rocket in his eye the robot was finished it really came to life drew a moon and went back to sleep they put it in a mueseum three days later. This proves although robots are just a machine waiting to be turned on.

The only thing in the chip in his head was DESTROY THE ENEMY. B-9C was made by the Japanese, but one day on a search and destroy mission the Americans found him in a laboratory being built on. They tried to destroy it but they couldn't he was built to be able to withstand the firepower of 100 tanks shooting all at once. So the Americans took him back to their base and decided to try and make B-9C think that he has been with the Americans all along. It took over 9 months but the American scientist made B-9C an American war machine. The Japanese thought the Americans just destroyed B-9C they didn't think they made him their own. A few days after the Americans made B-9C their own and tested him to see if he worked, He did.           The Americans declared war on the Japanese and sent in only their best 300 men and B-9C within a week all Americans survived and no Japanese did. B-9C was evil he was a full on war machine and the Americans did not mean to kill all the Japanese but B-9C wouldn't stop he just kept firing even when they surrendered. The Americans tried to make him stop but he wouldn't they knew they had to shut him down. But that is when the chaos started B-9C turned on the Americans and killed them all before they could shut him off B-9C became smart and knew he was unstoppable and if he wanted to stay that way he needed help, so he made a clone of himself and he had a brother within hours. B-9C made another him the same guns the same power everything and he kept making more until he had 50 clones. B-9C went out set to destroy he went after the white house first it took him 9 days to get their and when he arrived they were not ready for him he destroyed the white house and all in it luckily the president was away.           The American General Ethan Klaiss decided he had to stop the robot, he set up an army at the ice cream shop he knew nobody could resist ice cream even robots. He asked for help from the Poland general Jake Domalgolski,the Chinese general Brad Lee,he also asked for help from the Russian general Matt Wilde, together they would be unstoppable  even against the robots. They set up over 1000 tanks at the ice cream shop and 300 helicopters they also had about 5000 military men with guns and rocket launchers.       It was not long after the base was fully set up and everyone evacuated that the robots showed up with twice as many as before there were almsot 100 robots but that didnt stop the army they shot and shot with all that they had until they ran out of ammo the helicopter killed over 35 robots the tanks took out maybe 40 and the men took out the rest the world had been saved but I cant say as much for the ice cream shop it blew up and ice cream went everywhere but at least all the men got free ice cream. The U.S. President Connor Patten (after the war) appointed the general Ethan Klaiss to head chief of the marines and the navy, now he was in charge of all the men seeing as how he saved the entire world. Ethan also started to earn a little bit more cash (to be exact he earned 10.5 million dollars a week). But the most important part of all this was that all the B-9C's were dead and gone. At least that was what they thought .

Robots can do alot of thing like human,like make food,take kids to school drive to work sometimes do more thing than human they can dig into mines,do surgery and get into spots where doctors cant get.the world is going to turn into robot in a couple of years people are going to hire robots to baby sit there kids when they aren't there,factors are going to want robots instead of human because the robots are working for free so more money for the seller to sell car.

This robot can do many things, he is a remote-controlled robot that works in mines under ground. He is less than two feet tall. Gemini scout can go through water. he is small but strong. he collects information. For example he tests the air for gases the tells the miners when the air is safe. The robot has  a thermal camera to help find miners in mines. When the robot finds trapped miners in collapsed mines he can use a two-way radio to talk to the rescue team. Gemini Scout is easy to use and control. Its remote control is the same one that some video games use.                              Dante 2 is another robot. he can climb into volcanoes to gather information. He looks for vents. or holes, in the crater. he tests the air for gases that come out of the vents. Dante 2 is changing the way scientist learn about inside the volcanoes. scientist can learn about them while they are still in their labs and Dante 2 is in them and exploring them.               Mr. Gower is another one of the very interesting robots that have been made. He works in hospitals. His job is to bring medicine to patients. Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet on wheels. He can ride on elevators and can go anywhere he wants in the hospital. He runs on batteries after he charges or two hours he can work for twelve hours without stopping. Mr. Gower can even talk! He can say hundreds of different phrases. He is small but can pull up yo 500 pounds.                         Agribots are a different kind of robot. This kind is programed to pick all different kinds of fruits such as berries, grapes, oranges, or apples. Agribots come in all different shapes and sizes. some have giant arms and are pulled on the back of a truck and others can move freely and can go where ever it wants to. They can sense color of the fruit before they pick it to see if it is ripe. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help at all. They are all cared by agribots. They can be a lot like farmers.  Every plant has a sensor that tells the robot when that plant is ready to be picked. When it is the robot uses its mechanical arm to pick it. The robot waters it and does all of the other stuff the farmers can do.

I quickly drove to room 110 and Dr. Philip unlocked my cabinet and pulled out a small container. I wasn't sure what the meds were but I could tell he needed them urgently. 'Mr. Gower you're needed in room 12.' Dr. Philip told me. I rushed down to the 2nd floor. I entered the room to see a girl no older than 5. 'Thank you Mr. Gower.' The nurse said politely. She opened my cabinet and pulled out a container filled with something orange. 'What's that?' the girl coughed.   'It's your meds Emily. They're going to make you feel better.' the nurse replied.     'I meant the robot.' Emily said quietly.     'Oh that's Mr Gower, he helps in the hospital. He helps doctors and brings medicine to the patients.' the nurse said smiling . She pours the medicine into a small plastic cup and gives it to Emily. I drive over to her bed. I'm confused because she has no hair like most of the people I've seen in the hospital. 'Hi Mr. Gower, I'm Emily.' Emily says shyly. I wish I could tell her my name but the people that made me only let me say 'Calling elevator' or 'your delivery is here.' lame right? I love being able to work with the patients and doctors. I always make the children smile when I say 'Your delivery is here' I turn around and I go over and get a cup of water for Emily. I've seen many children make faces after they have their medicine. I go over and give it to her and say 'Your delivery is here' she smiles and laughs    'Thank you Mr. Gower' before falling asleep.

My mom gave me a WHOLE BUNCH of money, and told me to go to a store and get whatever I wanted! So I set out to a store filled with robots on 'off' mode and with no batteries in them.       Their packages had a whole pack with batteries and robots already assembled. Well, let me tell you how it ALL fully happened...                                                                Chapter 1                                                           The Robot           When I went to the robot store, I decided to get my very own robot. I grabbed a package and, exhausted, I went to the counter. 'Here's...my...package, sir. It's really...heavy! A...little...help?' I struggled to the checkout man. 'Alright sir, there's a cart right there,' he said, pointing to a row of carts. I placed it on the counter, panting and running toward the carts. I grabbed one, the man scanned the bar code, and I ran back with the cart, and the man put it in my cart, and gave him all that money Mom gave me. 'Have a nice day!' said the man. 'You too!' I said back. I got out and ran back to Mom's. The cart automatically rolled back to that store. I struggled up the front steps and inside. I laid it on the floor and opened it. 'Wow!' said Mom! 'You got a...robot?!' 'Yes, of course! From the robot store,' I told her. 'Let me assemble it.' 'OK,' said Mom. I quickly put it all together. 'Wow-wee! How could you do it that fast?!' cried Mom. I shrugged my shoulders. The second I turned around, the robot was beginning to turn on automatically! It became 'suddenly alive'! 'Oh, my, God!' yelled Mom. 'Can it speak?' 'Yes. Let me show you,' I said. I reached in the package and pulled out a hands-on remote control and pressed the 'Speak' button. In an instant digital eyes and a sound line on the mouth appeared. 'Greetings!' the robot said. 'Uh...greetings,'' I said. Mom said the same thing. 'Hey, you said your first word,' I said to my robot. 'Affirmative, it's my first word,' said the robot. 'Uh, Jacob, I got to walk away and I'll let you have fun your robot,' said Mom. 'OK,' I said. Mom walked away, and when she did, I asked the robot, 'Do you want to be my new best friend?' 'Sure,' answered the robot. So we did. Chapter 2   The Fun Begins      'You want to play with me on the Wii?' I asked. 'Yes, I will! What're we playing?' said the robot. 'I'll look,' I said, and I looked for a game. What do you think I picked? 'A-HA! Found it,' I finally said. 'Mario Kart!' 'Mario Kart?' repeated the robot. 'Yes,' I said. We played the game for a little bit. When we were done we were hungry. 'You want to eat?' I said. 'Yeah,' said the robot. We ate when Mom made dinner. That night it was time for bed. 'I'm tired. Are you?' I asked. 'Yeah,' said the robot. We got ready for bed, then made a bed in the living room. 'May I turn you off when we lie down?' I asked. 'Whatever you say,' he said, and I hit the off button, and we slept and slept. This is Part 1. There will be more some other time.

On Saturday March, 23 I woke up at 7:30 A.M in the moraning and then I got really board so I decided to make my own robot. My robot is going to look like a dog, she is going to play, and cook for me, yum! My dog robot is also going to be blue like the sky. When I was done making my robot I decided to go out and play with her she was amazing she could catch anything that went in her directhion and I even found out she could fly isn't that awesome. Then I got hungry so I told my robot she cooked me a grilled cheese sandwich in the moraning, a yummy chicken for lunch, and made me a big coco smoothi for desert, yum and I was totaly full by then.           Then the next day I didn't see my robot she was gone but then I saw her in the living room she was cleaning the place I never knew that she can do that then I thought maybe she has a mind of her own, but then I said no way I created her. I was really counfused, so I went outside and see if she had any other things that I never knew she had well that day I saw somthing i was really sad that day and my robot asked me why are you sad and I said because my dad won't buy me a puppy and then she took a puppy out of her box and I was so amazed it was like impossible but I was really happy at the same time because i got a cute little puppy.          So the is the story of robot and me and her real name is mircale.                                                           The end!                                                       By:Rafal!

This story is about the robots' war and feel something. Begin!       Chap.1. Robots were comes to life!       I'm Harry. I'm 69 years old now. I'll tell you about when I was 24 years old. I was in R.University on that time. I was in my classroom,but I slept. Ha... One and half hours later, I saw something weird creature. That was the robot and robots were around me. I was scary and surprised. One robot said 'Hi! I'm Jack! Nice to meet you!'   His name was Jack, and his father, P-G was the smartest robot.   P-G is professor in R-world. R-world is Robot world and only robot can live there.   I said 'Why are you came here?'and than they said 'Cause the bad robots clan 'Atlance' attacked R-world and they escape in the Earth. That's why we were here. We will protect people and attack the Atlance.' I was surprised again. I said'Do you need help? Your left arm and tail is look broken. Another robots were broken something. Let's go to the my house. I know how to fix.'           Chap.2. Harry found the Sony!       3 days later, P-G and anther robot made plans for find bad robot's clan 'Atlance'. And they tried to find Atlance robot or secret place but they can't find them.A day later, 2 days later, 3 days later they can't find them. And on 4 days later they find Atlance robot, Sony.   Sony was good robot because he escaped the Atlance.   Sony tolled about the Atlance's secret place. So P-G and another robots were ready to start war. P-G made weapons, and Jack and me are made plan. 8 days later I said'Hey guys! Are you ready to fight?'   They said' Yes, Harry! Let's go!'               Chap.3. Good robot Vs Atlance!       We were go to the Atlance's secret place and we fight. Atlance were afraid us. So some robots were escape. But some robots were fight.   We were continue to fight with them and I heard Sony's groaned.   I ran to him and I said'Hey, do not die! Please! Please!' but his eye light was off. I was cried. But I thought. 'I must fight with them for Sony! For me! For people!' And I continue to fight with them.   Finally, we won... Half happy, half sad.   Finally, we won and P-G made present for the people. The present called 'the wish.' The wish is give something that people want. So the people said 'We want you guys!'and the robots were surprised and they felt happy.So they were live together.And now... 	RB , DT NNS VBP JJ NNS MD RB VB NN .

She set her science project on her couch. For her science project she built a robot (it did not work).So many kids... *Beep* her phone cried. She polled it out of her pocket and saw it was Maddie who has been her best friend since kindergarten.   Maddie- So i got a great grade on my project @ the science fair   Jessica- O.M.G (om my GOSH)! thats really cool!!!   Jessica typed while yawning.   Maddie- i know its so cool!!! my mom says we can go 2 the Ram 2night @ 8 if u want 2 come?   Jessica- no i think im going 2 go 2 bed early   Maddie- o ok   Jessica- c u l8r   Maddie- Bye   And just like that Jessica was in bed and under the covers. Thinking about Maddie and her project then about herself and her robot and she slowly drifted into a deep sleep.    ***            As the morning sun rose Jessica started to stir. She kept on hearing a strange noise. *Bleep*Bleep*Bleep* She the turned to see her robot staring right at her! 'Ahhhhh!!!' she screamed but then again who wouldn't. 'Ahhhhh' said the robot. 'Ahhhhh!' she screamed again. 'Ahhhhh!' 'Ahhhhh!' 'Ahhhhhhhhhhh!' they both screamed. 'Who...What... How... Uhhhh?!?' Jessica said while hyperventilating. 'Um. I. Ah. Really. Don't. Know.' said the robot in a metallic voice. 'You are the one who created me.' he said calmly. 'I. I. I um. Didn't make you talk though. Last night you didn't even work!' starting to get calm Jessica said.            'Well... Oooo! I know I have a camera on all the time watching my room!' Jesica said. She had it there so she could make shur Dillan her younger brother didn't come into her room while she was gone or asleep. She learned better when Dillan drew a mustuage on her face with a permanent marker last month. As she plaid it she saw her brother Dillan come into her room! He grabed the robot and took him into his room. Then 3 minutes later he came in with a new robot. But this one actually worked! 'Dillan you are DEAD!' she mumbled to her self. 'Are you going to destroy your brother?' the robot asked without any emotion. 'Oh ya' Jessica said as a almost smile on the robots face appeared.             'Um.. Are you ok?' she said trying not to sound nervous. 'I will be back' he said then he opened and shut the door. Jessica heard the door open to her brothers room and 'Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!' yelled Dillan. Jessica ran out of her room and found the robot holding Dillan by his ankles. 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!' demanded Jessica. 'Determanating Dillan' the robot said in his creepy voice. 'No. Don't de. detre. determin. Don't kill me!!!' Dillan said freaking out. 'Rob!!! Put him DOWN!' Jesica said forcingly. 'No. I must destroy Dillan. Then you. Then your parents. The this town. Then THE WORLD.' Now this robot was really creeping her out. 'No. Not while I'm here.' Jesica bravly said. 'I quess you'll be first then' he said. Just like that Rod let go of Dillan and started towards her. 'Oupf!' Dillan said while hitting the floor. Jesica dived to the robot and tolk a chunk of his arm with her. 'Goss.' shesaid looking at the wires spilling out where his arm use to be. 'I.. Will... Destroy... You...' the robot started to glich but was still coming her way. With the robots good arm he grabed her neck. 'Let go you stupid thing!' Jesica said as he sqizzed harder and harder. She started to feel light headed. As she slowly fell asleep she heard 'Good Bye' and then she was gone.                                 Rob's creepy voice then said, 'THE END' 	NNP DT NNP NNP VBD VBN IN PRP$ NN NN IN NNP NNP VBD PRP NN NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP PRP NN NN PRP VBD DT NN : PRP VBD RB VB : -NONE- JJ NNS : -NONE- PRP$ NN NNP NNP VBD PRP IN IN PRP$ NN CC VBD PRP VBD NNP WP VBZ VBN PRP$ JJS NN IN NNP NNP NNP PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN : DT NN NN NN NN : NN PRP$ NNP NNP .

He was a really curious little boy. Max sat under a tree reading abpout cars, thebreeze was moving gently and making the tree leaves sway back and forth. He started to drift off into a dais and then he fell asleep. Not that long after he started to have a dream, this dream was new and this is what it was....                                Max was older and was big and strong, not weak. One day he said,' I want to change the world into something good not bad, but how will I do that ?' he started to ask himself. By the morning he jump out of bed and went to get his skectch book and he started to sketch this robot. This robot wasnt any ttpe of robot you have ever seen before. It was small and silver. ' This I think might change the world someday if I keep working at it.' he kept this in his mind all day he couldn't even focus in math class or even in school, he just kept thinking about this robot, this thing that helps, the robot. School got out early then usall because it was Spring Break. Every one walked home, but not Max he ran home as fast as he could he ran to his room and got his pencile and paper and started drawning again. Max was so happy with what his robot looked like and smiled with glee. ' This will change the world I promise.' He ran down the stairs and to his mom ,'Mom look! look! i have this great idea and I think it might change the world some day! ' he smiled with happyness. ' Oh honey its a really good drawing , but what is it? ' she started to trail off.  'Its something that i think will change the world someday it might look weird right now but its suppose to be my robot,' 'What does it do?' she asked. 'Well it helps people in hospitles , it delivers there medicine or flowers and meals and stuff like that.' 'Very nice Max have fun on working on that.' Max's mom turned back and started working on their dinner. He started working on the robot.                                  Couple years later Max was in the newspaper for making a robot that can change people life and make life easyer in hospitles. He started to make a business and he made 1,000 dollors a year. By the time he was 19 he became a billinare. The second youngest to be a billinare. Max hade a girlfriend and they stayed with each other tell the end of collage then he asked her to marry him and she said yes. Max had another big idea to make this robot that is a laptop but it if you type in something you want to have right then it comes out of the computer and you can keep it. 3 years later Max sells the laptops and he becamse succsessful.                                      Max wakes up and stands up and says,'im going to change the world ,' he starts to run back home and thats how you can make the world change for good from robots and everything that makes it up into a robot.

My girlfriend had dumped me, I'd failed my math test (which I was not surprised about) and my best friend Lucas, is in the hospital with cancer. Yeah, you could say things weren't looking very good for me. Until that one day.        It all started when I got the phone call, saying Lucas was no longer maintaining a stable condition. I rushed to the hospital in my old white Nissan, only to find it was too late. Cancer had taken the life of my best friend. The only one who respected me. Lucas, with his red hair, acne-covered face,  and glasses that he had to constantly push up onto his nose, was gone. The doctors said they couldn't get to him fast enough, and couldn't locate the correct medicine.       I was in my room that night, crying over my loss, with my head in my hands, when the thought came to me. What if there was a way to get to him faster? What if there was something to get to him faster? At first I thought bicycles, but after pondering the thought, I realized it would be hazardous to the residents of the hospital.I spent all of my free time in a little tin shed in the backyard, with a pack of number 2 pencils, stacks of paper, and a garbage can in the corner, piled up to the ceiling with papers containing all of my useless ideas, and the two or three actually possible ideas sat next to me on the table.        I was completely fed up with writing and sketching for so long. All of my ideas ended up in complete disaster. I wadded up the paper in front of me and I was about to dispose of it, when I saw a paper in the far left corner of the room. I opened it up, and I had found my solution. A robot! I would make a robot. The little robot would carry everything you would ever need in a hospital, from medicine, to bandages, to food! It could get to all of the rooms of the hospital faster than any human ever could, and help the patients. It would hopefully prevent an accident like Lucas's from happening.       I laid out  blueprint for the robot, which I had decided to name the Medicbot. I took a trip to the local hardware store and purchased everything I could possibly think of using on the robot. Sheet metal, nuts, bolts, hammers, wires, etc. I went to the gaming store and bought an old N64 controller, to control the Medicbot.       It took alot of hard work, but I eventually completed the Medicbot. It was more wonderful than I thought it would be. There was a keypad on top of the robot, and you typed in whatever you needed, the Medicbot would reach in his backpack with his electronic hand, and give you whatever you typed in. All of the controls worked perfectly, to my surprise.       I came home one day after school, and Medicbot was sitting in my kitchen. I was completely bewildered. I had no idea how he had gotten there. My mom was away on a buiness trip, and my dad died in a car wreck, so there was no explanation for this. I walked up to Medicbot, and to my surprise, he was turned on. He uttered one single word to me and that was 'Love.'       It was a few months after Lucas's death, and I was at school. Ever since I had made my robot, I had felt less lonely. I finally had a friend. Although, no one could ever measure up to the impact that Lucas made on my life, Medicbot came pretty close.

He was made to be used for carrying tools or objects 78 pounds or lighter from 1 Chinese farmer to another, for trading. He could only walk 2 miles or so and was little help. The Chinese appreciated his help, but thought he could do much more, as he only carried things. Everyday Mr. Pubble, the greatest of all Chinese farmers, would play around with LilGilly, to make him do more. He became hopeless, knowing he could not get LilGilly to change. But one day, Mr. Pubble pressed a button in the core of LilGilly, and that robot transformed completely!

It was a nice and beautiful summer day and Susan was home from the last day of school. She had blond hair and blue eyes, she had good grades in school. Her parents were billionaires, instead of people they had maid robots, butlers, and cooks. As she came into the mansion  her father said ''Susan your mother and I got a present for you''. As her father said that her mother came out with box wrapped with flower wrapping paper.''Come on Susan open it'' said her mother, Susan was so excited about the present that she almost destroyed the box.When she opened the box, in it was a robot kitten. Susan exclaimed ''a kitten I've always wanted a kitten''.           That same night Susan was playing with her robot kitten when her mother went into he room. ''Susan its getting late you need to go to bed''. Susan replied '' just five more minutes mom'' her mother smiled and replied ''ok just five more minutes'' and she closed the door. Susan went to her window while her kitten was sleeping on her bed. Susan was thinking of a name for her kitten when all the sudden a shooting star shot across the midnight sky. She had heard that if you see a shooting star at night, and if you make a wish your wish will come true. at that same moment she thought of a perfect name for her kitten ' Sue ' she whispered to herself. So she made her wish ' I wish that my kitten Sue would be real'. When she made her wish she went into her bed and Sue moved so that she was at Susans feet, and then Suesan drifted of in to a deep sleep.           When Susan opened her eyes she saw the bright morning light. She looked at the end of her bed where Sue was sleeping the night before, but this time Sue was not there. Puzzled she got out of bed and  looked around the room. Then She saw a bundle of fur a feet away from her bed, it was the same fur that was on her kitten robot. She looked more closely at it and she saw the fur  rising up and down its breathing she thought. She took a step closer to make sure she was not imagining things. As she did the kitten's ears twitched and it  looked up from it napping. It is her kitten she thought and  looked in astonishment. The kitten meowed and ran over to Susan, she picked Sue up.As soon as she picked it up she knew it was real by how warm it was, and the fur  felt like the brush on a paintbrush. As she was feeling Sue her mother walked into her room, her mother looked at at the kitten her daughter was holding and asked 'where did you get that kitten? and where is the robot kitten'? Suesan replied 'i know this is going to sound crazy but i wished at a shooting star that if Sue could be real real and it happened.'. Her mother nodded and said 'ok we can keep Suesan at least we will have someting real', after that Suesan kept the kitten and had more fun with a real kitten then a fake one.

I was surprised to see him and was wondering why I was in the hospital. it turns out that I got hit in the head with a rock and got a concusion. I was very confused but he gave me everything I needed. When I got home from the hospital I didn't notice that Mr. Gower followed me home. I actually liked it because I didn't have to do the laundry or any chores.                                               From all the money I saved for not having to do the chores I didn't have to do anything around the house. It was very peaceful just sitting down reading a nice book and not have to worry about anything else but me! While the robot cleans and does stuff for me I just do shopping but when I come back he's gone!!! I try to look everywhere for him but I can't find hi at all. All I see is the door open and dirt marks down the street.                              'There he is!' I yell just running down the street. i realize that he's going in the direction of the hospital to get new batteries. i realized that and now i'm hoping he could come back.

Now near where his house was a gigantic volcano and it was the volcano that let out the loud boom. lava was every where, ashes where falling on the houses and the people were running to shelter. Pompie was about to die from this mess. This was the Mt. Helena exploding all its pressure that was built up inside the volcano. 600 years later a robot called Dante 2 was about to go into this crazy volcano. There was also a guy named Quin Green that was with Dante 2.       'Now I want you to find all the information you can collect for the scientists Dante 2,' commanded Quin.

And my mom, she taught at the one public school in that near-extinction town.        Me, you ask? Well, I was thirteen. I was geoligist, you know someone who studys  the Earth. I had but one wish. To find something extroirdinary, so amazing, so, so, peculiar. To find something so extraterrestrial that it would knock this whole towns socks off. Did I get my wish? Ill tell you right now.                 One hot forsaken day. I was walking on the dried up terrain and my metal detector started beeping like crazy! I started digging. What I found blew my mind. It looked like a UFO. Shaped like a flying saucer and guess what it had inside? Parts. Metal, clanky, precious parts.   I took it right to my lab and started tinkering. I made a robot. Well, at least it looked like one to me.         It was round, it had 'grabbers', I mean what else did a robot need? It was all a mystery from then on. I can barely remember. What I do remember was that in the end we had grass, trees, and people. I could go on and on about how happy everyone was.       All I had to do, was believe.

I barked at him then i marched into my room.            then a hop, skip, and a boat ride later.. he won and i was so upset . life seemed worthless, after a while he asked me if I wanted to see his latest project, I never evan would have answerd that question if i new what was going to happen next,I followed him down the grand hall past the dinning room dashed down the staircase and into the labratory. There I saw it a woman, a beatiful woman, but when she turned around i saw something better.'What is that remarkible thing'i was stunned 'Im calling her margret'he exclaimed 'why,thats-' he cut me off 'i know I know thats youre name, thats why I named her that, she shall be youre friend im making millions of copies of her and shiping her all over the world!' 'yes,but what kind of creature is she'i asked  he shrugged,'does it really matter thow'but yet in some wayI thought about sharing her with the rest of the world. I thought she was mine, just mine, mine to hold, mine to hang out with, but pretty soon every girl and boy will have one.I told margret to come with me to my room and she came we brushed our teeth said goodnight and went to bed .           The next morning when I woke up she was gone 'MARGRET!? MARGRET CAN YOU HERE ME ?' I heard margret in the kitchen so I ran into the kitchen and there she was eating cerial 'hi,margret' 'HELLO, HUMAN HOW ARE YOU?!'   'Margret can you lower youre voice please' I heard a buzz then the buzz quited down 'is this better human ?'

She called for her brother Austin. He came to help her dig it out. two hours later they uncovered the mystery thing sticking out of the ground. They found out it was a robot! Jane and Austin went inside to get a screw driver because the robot had a screw in it's back. They saw it took 2 D batteries, so Jane ran inside to grab the batteries. They both put 1 in and then they put the cover back on, put the screw back on, and turned the switch on and their robot came to life! It started to move, and then it started talking! Jane and Austin were amazed, Their mom came to the back door and she saw the little robot, and she was amazed too.           Austin, Jane and their mother brought the robot inside to clean it off. In a few minutes the robot was sparkling because it was really clean. The robot asked what it could do and the kids said it could clean their rooms. and then do the dishes while they relaxed. The robot did everything and it cleaned the bathroom as well. Then their dad came home with Ally Jane's older sister. she asked what the robot was. Jane answered 'It is our robot maid.' She said it was awesome and then she went upstairs to her room. Jane and Austin were watching T.V. and the robot even brought them their dinner. After dinner the robot did all of their homework. Then Jane and Austin were playing video games and the robot got them ice cream and they both said 'The robot is awesome!'

NExt all he heard was a loud sound and crahing of rocks it was a robot here to save him and it flew straight threw the top of the mountain but after he flew in the mountain closed up and they were trapped forever                     Luckily the robot has a gps programed in its system so it knows how to get out but unfortunatly the gps signal was damaged frome when he flew in at this point there is know way they can get out now. But thankfully the robot has a flashlight built in so they can rome the mountain, and hopefully find a way out because with all of the toxic fumes from the coal the human can die in hours so the better find a way out or it will be bad news for him.                     They found a tunne in the cave from previous miners and followed it hoping they could find a way out but after all that walking threw the tunnel they could not see anyhting else the was a black charcoal wall right infron of them. the human Frank got so made he kicke the wall so hard he broke his foot but the robot had medicine and healing equiptment for his whounded foot. it still hurt but the robot dragged him most of the way.                    But what the robot didnt realize was that there was a secret way through the wall incase of emergencys and boy they deffinetly needed that but since they didnt they hace to walk 2 miles up a flight of spiral stairs without falling through the middle and since the robot cant climb verry well this just made it harder for Frank with his broken foot even though it might take a while he is still climbing. But these stairs are made out of wood that is rotting and if you stay on one stair for a decent amount of time it will colapse right through the floor  so even though Frank is in excrushiating pain he has to keep climbing or else its bye bye for Frank.                       With the robot right behind him trugging up the stairs they finally make it out and the robot calls in saying ' we are out I reapete we are out'. Franks broken foot was much worse than it was bofore climbing the stairs now the need to rush him into immediate surgery but they need the most qualified surgen in the entire world but he is in Africa helping some orphans but thankfully they have another robot with hands that can be controlled by the doctor in Africa. Sadly after the surgery one of the doctors notified Frank and told him ' That he wont ever be able to walk again and will have to use a wheel chair for the rest of his life' but Frank replied 'what if i get a prostetic leg or have a robot with me at al times' the doctor said 'the prostetic leg would not work you would have to be in therepy for 5 ans a half years and got to physical therepy everyday, but I'll see what i can do about hte robot.                            3 weeks later the doctor lets Frank know that the robot that saved his life volunteer to help you with your leg disability Frank was so excstatic he even cried a little.                      5 years later, Frank got married to Paula Smith and htey had 3 kids one was George, Kevin, and little Nicky and for christmas they all got little robots identicle to the robot that saved Frank.

All the robots i just told you about are working robots.These robots are built strong and are ment for tough jobs like going into volcanos.Working robots are use all over the world.If you go to the hospital and need surgury someone in a different countryis good at that surgury they can work on you with a robot and see you from a different country but still work on you.There are many different robots for many different things.            This week in Nevada made a robotic car.This car allows people to not drive there car but have a computer drive for them.People are loving this idea.On the roof of this car it has a laser that help it navigate.They have been working on this idea for just about 12 years.These prodotipes will have the 1st red lisenes plates since the 1940s.Robots are a big deal on our Earth now.My name is Max and my project was on robots.

After the store was locked up the toy solgiers would give a sign it was ok to come to life. Each toy would come to life in there own sertant way the most unique was the robot it would have to turn on all the nobs and before it could relax with the other toys it would check the store.              One day no different than the ordinary the fat guy locked up the sign was given the robots went to check the bulidng but it was a lot longer than they usally were the other toys got nervous. The Solgiers went to look for the robots but they were no where to be found. Bang Bang Bang came from the basement when they went downstairs. The alarm went off all the toys screamed intruders there where robbers and they took the toys. The soliders told the toys to get back on the self beacause the fat guy would be coming back.          About a half an our later the police where there the robbers and robots where no where to be found. The basement was trashed there was money stolen . The search party went on for days no sight of them. On the fourth day the police came back they caught the robbers and the toys there bus had broken down. which gave the robbers gave them no time to escape when the police saw them. The robbers where broght to jail and had to return all that was stolen and promised they would never steal again. Finally all the toys could be together and safe.

The contest was about who can make the creative and useful robot. The day of the contest is on Septemember 25th. The judges are the staff and one special guest. The winner gets a $200 check.      There was this boy name Eric who really loves to built things like toy cars, planes, robots, and more.He also loves to draw and paint. When he heard about the contest about robots, he wanted to be in it.And of course he was the very first person to sign up for the contest.      To begin, he brain storm what would the robot be like and what is the useful thing the robot could do. Well, the contest doesn't begin yet, you still got 21 days to create an amazing robot. But the next day he thought of an amazing robot that he was determind that he will win. That no one will ever make. The robot could talk, is strong, and which it is alive. The useful and important thing that the robot is going to do is do what ever it tells you to do and the important thing is it never dies.      Second, he had to draw out the robot before he could built it. Of course you have to because who would built a robot without drawing it out. After he drew it, he got all the stuff he needed to built the robot. He built a device could make the robot talk and it took him 4 days. Which in that case he has 17 days left before the contest. Next, he built parts that the robot will come alive and it took him 2 days. Which means he has 15 days left. He built a very strong thing that the robot never dies which took him 9 days. Which means he has 6 days left.      He just had to do one more thing before he is finished. He had to paint the robot gold which took him 5 days. Which means he has 1 day left before the contest begins. When it was Septmember 25th which is the contest, Eric got his robot settled and was waiting for the judges to come to his table. When the judges came they were so amazed that right away that the judges annouced that the winner is ...... Eric Sing.        The point to this story is that if you work hard you'll get rewarded in the end.

Tommy honestly thought that math was stupid,and that he should be doing more science than math.Tommy would think day and night all about his robot.He thought about it so much that he started flunking science!Tommy got 4 detention notes that day for not paying attention in class.Then Tommy started to get second thoughts about his robot like how was he going to afford all the parts for his robot he wanted his robot to walk,and talk to him.          So Tommy decided if he wanted to get all the parts he needed,he needed to get some money some way.Then Tommy got an idea;he should start a lemonade stand.Then days past and Tommy finally collected enough money for all the parts he needed.Tommy started assembling all the parts to make his robot once it was done he put in the batteries;he turned it on and nothing happened.He kept on turning it on an off and nothing happened.This made Tommy mad he got madder than he usually did.He went up to his room and tossed the robot in the closet and went to bed.          Then Tommy woke up to a weird robotic voice.He got up and opened the closet,and to his surprise he found his robot walking and talking.Once Tommy saw his robot walking and talking he picked it up and laid in bed with his robot.That night Tommy couldn't fall asleep because he couldn't believe that his robot actually came to life.The next day he told pretty much everybody at school about his robot.Then everybody was asking for a math robot.Ever since his robot came to life he felt like he was a king,and that was Tommy's miracle.

The next day by the afternoon my robot was done.                  My father told me to name my robot so I named it Miracle.   Then my mother came in and ask if we had tried it out .Father and I went to my room and tried out Miracle.We saw Miracle start to move and talk. We were so happy that our robot work.Then we went to call mother and mother was so happy that we were gonna go to dinner.               When we came back I went up to my room and called all my friends and told them about Miracle.I also told them how was gonna compete in the science fair.Then to days past and it was the science fair.My whole family went to cheer me on. Then  judges came to my table and I told them about Miracle and what she can do.The judges finished and talk to see who had won. They came back and told us that we were second place I was happy even though I didn't win first place but it was okay cause we still got our ribbon and our new family member .I love my robot Miracle.

Just then I got freaked out and my ps3 got my controler and turned it to a gun.I ran out to the door then saw my door break with the laser of the controller.I ran outside and went to the closest store but, the ps3 got the usb and used it like a rope and grabed my leg.              I stand up and ran away to a train stop for I can leave It was to late the train left. the ps3 was behind me so I had to run down where the stairs were. It used my mike as a gernade I said IMPOSSIBLE!!!! He used my black ops cd as a ninja star i dived to the ground.Then I said at least the mike did`nt explode after I said that it KAAAABOOOOOOM!!! IT made a giant hole inside the train station.            So I said i need to grab a weapon so I tried to go to the nearest store wich was Walmart . Then I saw jose going to the pepes ice cream factory and I told him what are you doing he said my ice cream machine is chasing me I said me TOO but, the factory was destroid.Then JOSE cried and said i want ice cream then I SLAPED HIM and cried even more he even peed him self or even pooped! so I just I went to walmart and got a baseball bat . the ps3 went running to me I went running to the ps3 I hit it with the baseball bat and it broke . I bought a ps4 and the baseball bat of course .

This weekend, my robot came alive. It all started when I joined the writing class at   school. 'Hey Andrew!', one of the members said as I went out the gate door. 'Since you draw really well, can you draw a model of a robot? I think it would be great for the theme for this week.' I wasn't very good at drawing robots, but I agreed.               While, I walked home, I thought about the robot's design and what it would do. I imagined it with limbs, but it looked weired. Instead, I imagined it with a Game Boy's head and wheeles for legs because it would be easier to move. I stopped day dreaming when I saw the T and Y store. A drunk man came by with sagging pants. I got out of his way and kept walking. It was very quiet in the empty lot. There was a whole garden on one side, but less vegetation on the other road I was walking on. I crossed the street and went to my grandma's house. I got out my half-split binder and started to draw.                I drew a square for the head and a short, adjustable, metal neck that was attatched to a toy car. I looked at the clock and it was fifteen minutes past five. I knew it was time to get prepared so I can go to my house. My mom picked my bothers and sisters up and she said, 'What did you do at your writing class?' I told her, 'One of the members asked me if I can draw a robot for our theme this week.' My mon replied, ' Maybe your dad can help you really make it.' I wasn't very sure because we didn't have all the pieces to assemble the machine.                 At eight o' clock, my dad came home and my mom told him about the robot I drew. I showed my dad and he said, 'I can to build this if I had a Game Boy Advanced SP.' I never knew what he was talking about because he was a nintey's kid, but he never played games. My dad got out his tool box and I asked my brother for his toy car because his birthday had just past. There was only one thing missing though. I knocked on my older brother's door and asked him for the Game Boy he had. 'Hurry and get out!',Austin said because he was FaceTiming with his girlfriend. I gave all the things to my dad and he took apart the Game Boy and toy car. My dad had some wires and from what I learned from G.A.T.E. class, they have to run on a battery. In his tool box, there was a metal neck that the robot needed for rotating. I watched my dad attatch the metal neck to the truck and the top screen of the Game Boy. The machine was complete, but didn't turn on. 'Why isn't it working?', I asked. No one had a reply.                'I think it's because we dont have a romote control.', my dad said. Then I looked towards the bottom half of the Game Boy and the romote contol for the toy car. I got a skrew driver for my dad because I knew he was going to fuse the two controls. The control for my robot was complete. It had the antena from the toy car, the shape of the Game Boy's bottom half, the A and B buttons from the nintendo consle did nothing, and the on and off button were still there. We turned it on, but nothing happened again. 'What's the problem now?', my mom asked. I looked under the remote and had noticed that the game slot was empty. I shoved in Pokemon Emerald and I turned on the remote. The robot turned on and played the music of Pokemon Emerald's title screen. I was very excited.                 I turned in the robot the next day to my writing class. They were expecting a picture instead of a real-life robot and they were curious about how I made it I told them the story. I turned on the robot and it played music. I wanted to keep it, but I had to give back the toy car to my brother. I wish I could see the robot again.

He said, 'I threw it out because it didn't work.'       She asked,'Can i keep it?' He said,'Sure.' I took it home in a really old wagon.It would squeak a lot and turned weird too.All night long,I worked on the broken robot.That morning I finished it,it looked brawn new.       That day I brought him to school.Everybody oohed and aah ed at the robot.It was lunch time and somebody accidentally spilled juice on it.The robot had a malfunction and it started to go crazy. It ran into walls and children,everybody started to scream.       The teacher told me to take home my dum robot.I did took it home and just threw it in the trash.Then my mom came in my room and asked why did I  throw away the robot.Then I told her that I didn't want it anymore.

My latest project called the Reaper-3000 was a big hit it could make someone come back alive. Almost every hospital in America wanted one. I only made 500,000,000,, and every last one is sold. It cost 1.2 million for one. MY PROJECTS NEVER FAIL! i working on this new one called Buddy-15 it will have a human face with human abilities knowing everything that's on the internet. The body will be a 3-foot oval-gold cabnient that opens.        The Buddy-15 will be priced at about 350,000 dollars a peace. It will cost me 1.5 to buy the things just for one Buddy ,therefore I'll only make 5,000.        When working on Buddy-15 i work alone i don't trust no one to know my secret. Finally what I've been working on is done a brilliant masterpiece the Buddy-15. His gold body is as shiny as a pearl. Standing 3-feet tall Buddy-15 is beautiful. I just have to turn it on. When i pressed play its not working. i don't believe it ,because i never fail. For the first it was true I'm a failure, yep me the billionaire failed.Maybe i should retire and sell this multi-millinare,beach-side home in Malibu,California.        I have to throw this junk away. I'm so ashamed of my self this so called Buddy-15 is in the cellar now. Everybody will look at me like a fool now and call me Mr.Failure. I'm going to take the whole bottle of Asprin to end my embarrassing life. As i fall to the ground i here something like something broke i get very dizzy and lightheaded and then i see something gold. is what i think it is Buddy-15 alive. He gives me a water bottle and says emergency call to police. His strong solid gold arms pick me up and carry me to the couch. then the ambulance showed up to get me.        The hospital put me on suicide watch for the week the i got to go home. If it wasn't for Buddy-15 i would've died. II'll change Hero-28. After all i didn't give his body enough time to start up and thought i failed. This II'll keep to myself and will not be sold.        I used source #4 called Mr.Gower.

She had said no multiple times, but I was determined to make one. After seeing so many spectacular things at the science fair, including some robots, I couldn't stop thinking about making one.         It was Saturday night, at the dinner table, and I asked one more time, hoping she would say yes, especially since my dad was there. My mother rejected the idea again, but my father said,'We should let her do it, Letty, it would show some responsibility, and plus we would have someone else here to clean up so you won't have to worry about it so much.' My mom replied 'That would be a plus, Guero, but don't you think its creepy? having a robot in the house? And what if it leaks oil all over the floor? I won't clean it up. It will be your responsibility, Ashley. You will have to clean up its messes.'       Once I heard their responses I got so happy and almost fell out of my chair. My little sister, Leslie, asked if she could help me, and I happily replied with yes. The next morning, my brother Armando, the oldest, Angel, the second oldest, Leslie, and I headed out for every Home Depot and Walmart in the city to look for everything we needed. We looked for nuts and bolts and even looked to see if the stores sold metal. Once we found everything we needed, we headed back home, where my dad had his tools all set up and ready for Leslie and I to use.       Once we started, it took us about a three months to finish the robot. the robot took the form of a human, had pretty green eyes, had shorts, tennis shoes, and a superman shirt with long, black hair. My sister and I looked back and marveled at the beautiful sight. We decided to name her Victoria. But then, something terrible happened. I had tried to turn the switch on and off, but it wouldn't work. She wouldn't work.       We decided to abandon the idea and left her in the garage for about two years. On October 14, Leslie and I were on the couch, watching our favorite T.V. show when we heard a loud thud in the garage. We went to go see what happened, and then we saw it. The robot we had abandoned two years ago was alive.

The owner was a very serious and wise man, known as Mr. Rainer. He loved science with all his heart and dedicated his life to it.       One day like any other it was quiet at the shop, something like lighting sparks would happen out of nothing at the stores basement. It happen again the next day and the next day ,until one month later was when Mr.Rainer noticed something strange.A Wednesday morning Mr.Rainer found a plate with eggs and bacon with a cup of orange juice.Minutes later a small robot stroll by Mr.Rainer like it was a daily thing for him and said a simple hello.         Mr.Rainer just stared at him while the robot fixed things around the shop.The next day the same thing happen the robot fixed things but this time there was a few customers around the shop.It has been years since there was a single customer in this particular shop. Mr.Rainer was impressed by the success this little robot brought into his shop and Mr.Rainer was fascinated. Years past and no one knew were the little robot came from.But he was a miracle in Mr.Rainer's life, they were partners in business and friends. The mystery of the way the little robot got to the shop might always be a mystery.

So he said in his mind (i wonder what that could be? so he waited a long day until tommorow  so he said (i guess ill go play basket ball with my friends  he . Then he said its starting to get late so i gotta go home before i get introuble so he said ill find out what my present is in the box . Then the next day he woke up every body in the morning but he waited patiently until hi parents and sisters and brothers woke up   .   So he waited and waited until he herd them coming down stairs he was so happy . So he was the first one to open his present  and he taired that thing up like a tiger .  Then he saw his present and it was a robot he was so happy.                   So when the boy took his robot up stairs to his room he started building it and his dad helped him build the robot but the dad said that he will have to do it tommorow but the boy said no i wanna finish it today. The boy stood up until three a clock in the morning and finished it the boy was so tired that he knocked out in the bed . the next day he went outside with his friends and some thing happened the robot was moving and one of his friends said what is that noise it sounds like a robot is talking. And the boy went inside his house and ran upstairs and saw the robot moving by its self . In the few months that passed the boy was getting older and was graduating high school but since the boy had good grades  he was moving on to university not to college . So the university was called UCLA. So then time has passed on he grew older but the robots dont get old.Then when he came home the robot had asked him and said what do you want to eat i could make you what ever you want and the boy was suprised to hear that in a good way. So the boy said i want enchiladas and 20 minutes laterthe robot killed it he made it perfect. So when the boy was eating it he liked them so the boy said   nice job and the robot said i could do other things like play sports so we both knew that  we would have anice time together and that we would never let go.

Her name was Alice she was 8 years old she had the best country life someone could ever wish for. Alice loved spending time in her room with her toy robot she named him Robbie. When she was finished playing with him she would put him in her closet. Alice had a feeling that something strange was going because every time she put him in the closet there would be a glow.              A year had passed and she couldn't figure out what was going on with Robbie until the day of her birthday when she went to go get ?Robbie and there he was Robbie wasn't a toy anymore he had turned into a real life robot. Robbie wasn't Robbie anymore he was the Agribot. Alice stayed there frozen looking at Agribot she  looked at him and said&ldquo; how did you do that were is Robbie what did you do with him?&rdquo; Agribot said that he was Robbie but that the glowing light transformed him into what he was right now.              A couple of days had passed and Alice had started getting used to her new robot. She kept him a secret from her friends, mom, dad, and especially her brother. She would sneak him out to the garden were there was plants,fruits, and vegetables he would help her pick them since that was her chore. She started liking Agribot since he was a big help to her with her outdoor chores. She would play with him and take him to the barn once in a while. Then one day she was planning to tell her mom,dad, and brother but Agribot told her if she told them and they told everyone else he would dissapear. That made her stay quiet instead.           Then, it was back to school she was worried that if Agribot left the closet or room her mom would find him and he would dissapear. So she started locking her room and gave him things to do while she was gone. Her mother would question her about why she locked her room and she would make up a fast excuse that her mother would barely believe. Alice decided to tell her mom and she did. Alice's mother wanted to meet Agribot so Alice introduced Agribot to her. Her mother promised to keep it a secret.                Three years had passed now and Agribot told Alice that it was time for him to leave and she asked him why he said he had come to help her and that he would really miss her. Alice said if he would ever return and Agribot said that he would he gave her a necklace with she would touch and Agribot would come back. She gave him a bracelet for memories.They said good bye and that they would miss each other . Agribot went back inside the closet with Alice watching the glowing light and when it stopped she checked inside all around but she only found her old Robbie.

A robot there loves to travel to other planets. He has been there to every planet... except for Earth. He wants to but its parents won't let him because there is alot of water on it. He says he'll be fine but his parents still won't let him go. He gets mad and goes to his bed and just lays on it. Then he had an genius idea that may or may not get him in trouble. He will go to Earth when his parents are asleep and only stay there for the night. He will also have a bunch of pillows to put on his bed in case his parents come to his room. His parents tucked him in bed and they quickly went to sleep.           He went down to his backyard (slowly) where his ship was. He hops in he was off. He got there pretty fast (he was speeding because he only has a day) and landed in a foresty place. He is only about a foot tall so he is pretty small on Earth. He sees a light and quickly 'runs' to it. Its a light to a house. The door has a dog door. He goes in it and sees the biggest house he has seen. He walks around the house to see that its empty. (or so he thought). He soon gets seen by the dog. The dog barks loudly. Then a nine year old boy comes to the room and makes the dog go away. Then the boy realizes that the robot is moving and is amazed. He gets closer to look at it and says,'Do you talk?' The robot says,'Ye-e-s I do.' 'What can you do?' The boy said. 'I c-an dd-o a-lot of thh-ings like run, ta-alk.' replied the robot. Then the robot saw that it was almost sun rise. He said he needed to go. The boy wanted to know where he was going. The robot said,'Back to my planet, Roboville.' The robot left and went back to his planet. He got there just in time, just as the sun was rising and got into his bed. Right about that time his parents walked in and found him sleeping.            Meanwhile the boy got interested in the planet and looked it up on the internet. He had a presentation at school about a space-related thing to do. He did Roboville and he also told that a robot came to his house. He got an A+ on his presentation. He thought 'Maybe one day I can go to Roboville?'                                           THE END!

So he work so hard and so long for about six months.Sheldon tried to make the robot work but he couldn't. so he go so mad he threw it in the trash.about five to six months later the robot worked and turned on. The robot was in the dump. Within a couple of weeks he discover all his abilities and went back the find his owner. but he couldn't find him. so he went out to seek his mission to stop crime in his home town but he didn't know when to start.            Then on a dark winter day a man in a detective suit was in a dark ally. He was scared but did not show it. Before the end of an ally another man appeared. The man in the suit saw that he had a mask and was running. The man in the mask also had a bag. the man in the suit heard sirens and a police officer yell, 'Stop!' but the man in the mask kept running. The man in the suit took off his suit. He turned out to be a robot. A spy robot. He is also a crime fighting one as well.          So the robot took of his suit and went after the man in the mask. The robot couldn't catch up, so he push a button and the robot had rocket shoes. He flew up and zoomed away. He finally caught up to the man in the mask. He reached for the man in the mask but missed. then the rocket shoes ran out of fuel. The robot fell but luckily fell on the man in the mask. the police came and caught the man in the mask. In the bag was money. So the robot returned the bag.               The whole town gave the robot a big thanks. for a reward the towns mayor gave the robot 1,000 dollars. the robot found out the man in the mask was in jail. After that the robot went back down into  the ally and disappeared into the darkness. He was happy that he stop crime and seeked his mission. About a year later the robot was watching the television in his new home when he turned on the news. He found out that Sheldon was look for him but then died. The robot was in  great sorrow. He went to find Sheldon's grave and rested by his grave for eternity.

Soon I got my scuba gear on and I was on my way. By the time I got to the reef i had  found it. I couldn't believe that I was a gemeni-scout, I grabbed the small robot and started to swim toward the shore on the beach. When I got home I hid it in my room so my parents wouldn't notice. Then the next day I called my cousin over, when he first seen it he yelled ''OMG'', then I told him ''I found him at a reef and that your going to help me fix it''. When I was done speaking he went home, then a hour later he brought a lot of tools. The main things we had to do was to fix the thermal imager, radio and the inner controls.       Two weeks later, we had fixed the radio and thermal imager, but we still had to fix the inner controls. But when we were taking a break the man on the news channel said '' about three weeks ago a U.S. aircraft carrying the new gemini-scout, had crashed near a coral reef and there is still no sign of the gemini-scout but if anyone knows the where abouts of the gemini-scout please contact local police.'' We both knew that we had to fix the inner controls and contact the police. We worked hard for the next week it was all worth it though. When we tried it it was a sucess. Then we cleaned and polished the gemini-scout.       Then we got our older cousin to drive us to the police station, everyone was thrilled. All the news stations at Hawaii came straight away to the police station. All the scientists who had build the gemini-scout said ''how did u do it'' and we both said '' the old fashion way'' then the whole crowd started to laugh. then a couple weeks later we got a letter in the mail, but it wasn't just any letter. it was a check worth a 100,000 thousand dollars. then with all the money my cousin and i had built 10 gemini-scouts for the sceintists. Then a year later we were working with the scientists.

Pete has a navigation system that you have to set up. you can feed him a map and it will pop up on his screen and then all you have to do is mark the trail in order that you want him to roll across then you get your map back and continue.       pets record of picking and pitting is 1,238 Pitts in a day and 1,369 picks in a day. farmers all over the world want a copy of Pete but he costs 10,000 dollars! my invention so far has made $300,000.That's a lot of money.Pete also has a special feature, but for extra money. You can buy the Xtra Farm pack for 500 dollars extra. then Pete will do all of your farming work for you! that means no planting, no watering, and no pulling weeds!       Pete has made 300,000 dollars so far. That's a lot of money. that means that 30 Petes have been sold so far. i hope to sell at least 20 more.Pete has been sold to farmers in all separate country's. so there is no two Petes in one country.

When i arrived at school my teacher told to take seat so i did i was so exited to learn about a robot. My teacher said good morning to every one and we all said good morning back to her, she said: Today were going to talk about what do robot do in the present not the future, she said that the robots are made from sciencetist, the way the robots help us today is by going into mines and save the miners that stuck down there and they help doctors save lives. Now class right after school i want you to go home and make a miniture robot and write and essay about what does your robot do to help people you will have one week to do your robot.                When school was over me and my best friend Bob were walking back home and we where trying to brain storm on some ideas on how are robot should look like and what should it do to help people. Bob had an idea,so he said he should put a freeze gun in his robot then i said were trying to help people with our robot not freeze people. So i finally got home and i started making some desings about the robot i want to make but all them didn't come out how I wanted it so kept trying and trying but it still didn't come out how i wanted it but then it hit me i know how my robot should look i spent at least 10 minutes desingnig it but then i finished. I went to go tell me parents and they were so happy that i made my very own drawing of a robot. My dad took me to the hard ware store to go buy my supplies for my robot.                The next day at school my teacher asked every one how it was going with our project. My teacher came up to me and asked how was it going with your robot and i said it is going great and she said great im glad your doing good. When i got home me and my dad started working on my project my dad told how big was it going to be so i said its going to be small so we got to work i measurde the piece of metal my dad buyed for me and then he started cutting. Then we put wire's inside the metal box we starded contecting them together we added some of the wheels we last we put the head on. We finished 4 days early i was so happy all we needed now is to put the anttena on it because its a remote control robot, once we put all that together it started to move that means it works.                 The week had past so when i went to school i saw everybody with there robot on there desk i was so jealous because everybodys rpbots look so much better then mine. When my teacher said i hope all of you had a great time making your robot everybody shouted YES!!. Now will the first person come to front the classroom and please explain your robot the first person up there was Bob his robot so awsome because it was the size as him it was so so so cooool. Once everybody when up and explaind there work it was my turn i was so nervuse but i did it any ways my teacher told me what is the name of my robot, oh my gosh i forgot to give a name so i just brain stormed in my head and said my robot is called R2-D2 everybody started laughing. She said what does it do and i said it goes to beaches and picks up the plastic there that way now animals will eat it and then she said i noticed that remote controll on the side of your robot is that remote for it can controll it i said yes.                  The thing i did was i got the remote controll turned it on and started moving the controls and guess what it didn't work i panicted. So my teacher told me whats wrong with it and i said i dont know. All of a sudden it started moving by its self everybody started getting scared so was I then it stoped. Then the head of my robot started moving it was looking around the room the strange thing is it started talking it said WHERE IS MY MASTER. Its a live i said every body in the classroom said wow,cool,how is that possible my teacher said Edd you are first elementry student who ever made a robot talk good job everybody give a good round of applouse to Edd thanks everybody Edd you get an A+++++ YEAH!!! WAIT just a minute Edd were is your essay.

A lot of ideas came trough Lily's head. Mrs.Sanchez said that their robot needed to be able to move. When class was over Lily asked Mrs.Sanchez if she could start it today, and Mrs.Sanchez said of course you can. Right away when Lily got home from school she told her mom about the robot. Lily was so excited of building her robot, that she went to the garage and started buildind right away.       First, Lily started building the head of the robot. Lily wanted the robot to have normal eyes,so she got the fake googly eyes and put them on her robot. After that, she drew a mouth on her robot with a permanent marker. Furthermore, Lily got to her favorite part, which was the body. She had all sorts of chemicals in her garage, so she started putting one by none in the robot's body. What Lily did not know was that the chemicals she was using were really affective. It was bearly 5:30 pm, when Lily started painting her robot. She wanted to paint it all white and then add a rainbow around the body. Her robot looked fantastic. When she finished her robot it was 8:30pm. Lily was tired so she went to sleep and left the robot drying in her garage.       When Lily woke up she got ready, so she can check on her robot. While Lily got ready she tought of a good name to name her robot. At last, Lily tought of a name. She was going to name it Rainbow Robot. When Lily was finished getting ready, she went to the garage, but Rainbow robot was not there. She checked everywhere in her house, until she saw Rainbow Robot in her kitchen cooking breakfast. When Lily's mom saw Rainbow Robot cooking she gasped and almost fainted. Lily and her mom were both surprised to see Rainbow Robot cooking. After that, Lily checked if Rainbow Robot could talk, and it could. Rainbow Robot told Lily if it could walk with her, and she said no until she could bring it to the science competiton.       When Lily got to school she could not stop thinking about Rainbow Robot. When Mrs.Sanchez asked the class who has started on their robot, everybody raise their hand. Mrs.Sanchez said that the competition was tomorrow. Everybody got excited. Moreover, she asked the class if they wanted to share how their robot was coming out, but sadly no one wanted to share because they were to shy. Also,they did not want anyone steeling their ideas. Lily wanted to go home already to check on Rainbow Robot. When school was over Lily ran to her house. First, she ate what her mom and Rainbow Robot cooked. Next, after 30 minutes she played with Rainbow Robot outside, for about 2 hours. Then, they went inside and made a chocolate cake. When they were done, they were tired. Lily putted Rainbow Robot in the garage, and she went to her room to sleep.       It was the day of the science competition. Lily dressed nicely, and did her hair nicely too. Rainbow Robot was cooking pancakes for Lily and her mom. After Lily was done eating, she went to school walking with Rainbow Robot. when she got to class all the students were next to their robots ready to got to the school gym, where the science competition was going to be. Next, when they got to the gym they ordered them by grade, Lily went to the sixth grade group where she was supposed to go. After that, people were looking at different robots. Furthermore, the principal was going to announce the winner. The principal said,'And the winner of this years science competition is Lily Flores and her Rainbow Robot.'

Once there was a little boy him name was Anthony and he wanted a robot but his    parents said that there is no such things as robots so what he did was he was walking with his friends keresha ,tasha ,Adrian and Mikey to school and he was telling them about the robot he  wanted but they just laughed in his face because they said the same thing that his parents said that there was no such thing as robots but Anthony knew that robots were real and when school was over they all walked back home and then he saw a ship flying behind the mall Anthony was the only one to see it his friends didnt even see it kno one saw it but he went to go check it out and he saw a spaceship and then he wanted to go see what was in ther then all of a sudden he heard a door open then he got back alittle ran home and told his parents but they didn't believe him he went up to his room and then he started drawing and writing about the robots he wanted and he wrote down that his robot would look like him and wrote down all the things the robot can do like do his chore,homework,built him a mansion and print him money. then he went down stairs showed his parents and his parents say OK . now go back up to your room because Ur making up lie about the robots and then he snuck out the window and went to the mall he saw the spaceship and liked it so he went in the spaceship and he saw the robots they saw the picture he wrote and liked it so he wanted to go back to outer space with them and he left his parents,friends,and family                         	WP PRP VBP IN DT NNS VBZ IN PRP VBP RB JJ NNS IN NN VBP NNS WRB PRP VBP RB VB IN JJS IN DT NN NNS VBP NN DT EX VBZ RB JJ NNS IN TO VB PRP VB PRP VB PRP TO DT IN DT NNS DT JJ NNS NN VBZ DT NNP IN WP DT NNP IN VBZ VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ NN CC NN WP IN VBZ VBZ PRP VBZ IN NNS IN NN PRP VBP IN JJ NNP DT JJ NNS VBD VBZ NNP CD WP NNP CD VBZ VBZ PRP VBZ VB IN NNS TO VB NN IN NNP DT JJ NN VBZ NNP NN WP NNP NN VBZ VBZ PRP VBZ IN NNS CC IN DT NN PRP VBZ DT NNS CC DT NNS IN DT NN PRP VBP TO VB PRP .

On midnight suddenly the robot gets alive. He searched for food but found nothing .   Suddenly the man woke up he saw the robot awake. The robot got scared. He tried to run away but he couldn't. So the man put him in a cage so he couldn't escape.   After some days the robot gets annoyed from staying inside the cage. So he tries to   run away. After sometime the man comes and saw that the cage was open and the robot was gone. He started to get worried. He had no idea where robot went. Today was also the invention science fair. The man got dressed set off to find the robot. He looked everywhere but he couldn't find him. He thought to check at his backyard. He still couldn't find him. Suddenly he heard some weird noises behind the bushes. He walked toward it and saw that robot was sitting behind the bushes and eating apples.   Then the man decided he would never put robot in the cage again.It was almost time   for the science fair. The man took the robot to the science fair everybody loved his invention. He won the first prize.The robot was happy again. 	CD NN NN , DT NN VBN DT NNP NNP CD NNS PRP VBZ VBN RB VBZ TO NNP NNP NN RB DT NN VBZ NNP NNP VBD IN NN CC VBD NN .

He was working on a robot, he worked all night and all day for 2 nights and 3 days, until the robot was perfect, and was ready to sell in his shop. The poor little robot sat there in the toy maker's shop for days then nights then weeks then months until he had been siting there for many years. No one had come to buy him or even look at him for years. But that all changed one day when a little girl named Caroline walked into the shop.        The little girl had walked around and looked at all of the toys, but none were what she had in mind. She asked the toy maker in a sweet, quiet voice, 'Do you have any more toys in your shop?' The kind toy maker said i a deep, rusty voice, ' No, well no new toys but I do have an old specialty of mine.' 'Oh what is it' said the girl joyfully The toy maker then went back to the shelf where the old, dusty robot sat upon. He carefully took him down from the shelf. The little girl looked at the old robot and just smiled wide, from ear to ear.        The little girl then took the robot home and cleaned him up a bit then they had a relxing tea party. Once they were done with their tea they played dress up Robot was the groom and Caroline was the bride. They prertended to get married and right when they were about to go on their honeymoon the girl's mother called her down for dinner. So they had to hold up on their honeymoon. So the little girl went down for dinner and of course the roboy came with her, Caroline then realized     	DT NNP NNP NNP IN DT NN EX VBD DT NN NN WDT VBN NNS CC PRP$ NN VBD PRP$ NNP NNP VBD VBG IN DT NN , PRP VBD PDT NN CC DT NN IN CD NNS CC CD NNS , IN DT NN VBD JJ , CC VBD JJ TO VB IN PRP$ NNP NNP NNP RB VBD IN EX IN DT NN NN POS NN IN NNS RB NNS RB VBZ RB NNS IN PRP VBD VBN VBG RB IN JJ NNP NNP CD VBD VBN TO VB PRP CC RB VBP IN PRP IN NNP CC IN DT VBN CD NN WRB DT RB NN VBD NNP VBD IN DT NNP NNP JJ NN VBD VBN IN CC VBD IN DT IN DT NNS , CC NN VBD WP PRP VBD IN NNP NNP VBD DT NN NN IN DT JJ , JJ NN , NNP PRP VBP DT RBR NNS IN PRP$ NN .

The pond had small ducklings swimming through it with the sunset reflecting off the water. There were daisys and sunflowers all around the pond, it was absolutey beautiful. But on the side of the lake was a dark forest, the trees were tall and their leaves hid the sun. Jimmy were twins, they both had jet balck hair, pail skin and blue eys with a hint of green. They had pink plump lips and a little tall for their age of 12. Suzie had long wavy hair put up in a messy bun and Jimmy always had his hair in a quiff.        They were walking on the borders of the forest when the saw something shining in a cave or mine deep in the woods. Suzie went to check it out, but Jimmy stopped her, holding her by the wrist.         'What if it really is haunted.' said Jimmy still holding her wrist.         'It's not. Do you really beleive that stuff?' she said shrugging him off.          She procceeded, and her was right behind her. They walked up to the object.          ' What is it?' Suzie quitioned.          'It's a robot we learned about it in class. I think it's called a Gemini-Scout. I don't remember what i does.' answered Jimmy.           He pushed a botton that said on. Nothing happend.           ' Well that stinks, it's not working. Whatever, lets look around in the cave.' she said, but as she stepped in the cave a flash of red came from it.            ' Do not proceed. Deadly toxens in the mine.' It spoke out.           She stepped back and thought.            'We better take it back to see if some scientist need it.' she comanded while piking up the small, rusted, robot. They walked to a lab they lived by to see if they needed it.            Jimmy stopped a man ready to walk through the doors and spoke, ' Excuse me sir, but we found this robot and we were wondering if you needed it for anything.'            ' Wow you found this. This is pretty old, but I think we can do something with it. Thank you!' he said while carfully taking the robot out of Suzies hands.               He walked in side the large gray building.

When a month past I was still stuck in the small room, until suddenly one day the door swung open that was from the small room  a little boy with her mom came in. When the little boy saw me all torn up on the ground he said to his mother 'Why is their torn up pieces of the robot?', the mother said ' Because somebody broke this robot and we haven't been in here for a long time, but when you grow older you could start fixing this robot.' And the mother started putting the robot pieces away in a small box.                            Years and month came by and the little boy who turned older came into the small room and started opening all the boxes to find something. Then the boy approached to my box he opened it and started putting all my little pieces on a desk. The next day the boy came back this time with tons of tools. He sat down on the chair and started fixing me. Weeks came by and the boy had finally fixed me I was so happy that I could be alive again.                             After the boy fixed me I was working with the boy in caves and trying to save some people. I was always by the boys side working, because that was my job and because I was a Gemini-Scout robot.

Out of nowhere he yelled.WAIT! I'VE GOT AN IDEA! Even the crows on his front porch crowed/flyed away as fast as they could. He draged and pulled all of the michanical robotic machanical tools off his desk and into the garbadge desposal. And got his fire mask on and started working on his plan.       Psst! over here ya ya it's me his misrable wife. I wanted to tell you a secret. Can you keep a secret from profeccer knowitall. Ok good. Anyway i was wanting to be a great person and tell you what his plan is. Ok here it goes. He wants to build a robotic machine that can do his chores,be his maid,ect. But he wants this robot to do everything for him because he wants to do nothing more in his life but sit on the couch and sleep and eat and watch television all day. Oh no he is coming got to go. P.S he is done with his robot . See you later.       Five hours later... the best invention i have ever made in my intire life he said. When he went to turn the robotic piece of genious on it... grabed a stick that turned into a wand and made everything dissapear. Exept profeccer knowitall.He ran and ran and ran but he was blocked by a cinderblock wall made by the robot and had knowhere to go but into the cool wind breaze. The profeccer dissapered and the robotic genious as they call it took over the hole city then the world. Even though the robot dissapeared everything but himself he felt really lownly and wish he had never ever did it.But he dissided to make everyone/everthing come back to the world of peace and happines.

The planet was pure evil. When the U.S, China, and Russia figured out its core was magnetic the launched an under cover weapon. The weapon was an extremely powerful magnet disguised as an asteroid.           Nobody knew that the asteroid was the weapon that moved it out of the solar system.They tracked the planet for years and thought it had been destroyed.           It turned out it was a hoax and the planet was out for revenge          This robots name was Dante 2 it landed on earth and climbed into numerous volacnos and set tiny bombs in them             The earth was destroyed and the evil planet lived on except there was one problem a city of people had lived and a baby boy was born on the extra space ship left by N.A.S.A the city of people had gotton into this boys name was Anican Skywalker           	NNP VBD NNS VBD JJ IN CD VBN IN JJ IN DT NN WDT VBD VBN TO VB VBN VBN IN DT JJ NNS RB RB NNS IN NNS IN WRB PRP$ NN VBD RP IN PRP$ JJ NNP NNP NN VBD NN NNP NNP DT NNP , NNP , CC NNP VBD RP PRP$ NN VBD JJ DT JJ DT NN NN NNP NNP NN VBD DT RB JJ NN VBD IN DT NNP NNP VBD IN DT JJ VBD DT NN IN JJ PRP IN IN DT JJ NN VBD DT NN IN NNS CC VBD PRP VBD VBN NNP NNP VBD RP PRP VBD DT NN CC DT NN VBD IN IN NN DT NNS VBP VBD NNP CD PRP VBD IN JJ CC VBD IN JJ NNS CC VB JJ NNS IN PRP DT JJ VBD VBN CC DT NN NN VBD IN IN EX VBD CD NN DT NN IN NNS VBD VBN CC DT NN NN VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN NN VBD IN NNP DT NN IN NNS VBD VBN IN DT NNS VBP VBD NNP NNP	1		20131022101019	2344	1		20131022101032	2411	1

The robot was going to be a Gemini-Scout, Dante 2, Mr Gower, Agribot, and lots and lots of more robots. This scientist had a bad life he got discouraged a lot of times so the whole point of making this robot was to get popular.          Errrr grrraah pffh. 'Come on, I got to make this robot' Said the scientist in a desperate voice. The scientist started to cry on a couch that was really old because the scientist is poor. 'I'll never be able to do this' he said and went upstairs to his bedroom to sleep.          In the middle of the night there was a small boom, but the scientist didn't wake up. Couple of minutes later his whole entire house was on fire but his house was small. The scientist however just kept sleeping. The fireman came but they could not save him. THen the strangest thing happened! The robot that he made woke up and found the scientist and carried him out of his house to saftey.          Whan the scientist was well he bacame a millionare and got lots of friends. The robot had saved him and got him a real life.

His son Billy handed him the hammer and he started banging away. They were trying to fix a robot they found on the side of the road. It was very beat up the head was hanging from wires the arms were barely attached. Also the robot didn't have a right leg. The man has been working for days trying to fix this robot. He decided to make a remote that if u touch him with it it shuts him down in case anything goes wrong. He had fixed the head and attached one of the arms but he still had to tighten the other arm and get a new right leg and attach it. He decided to take the next day off and sleep all day because he had been working day and night. Sleeping all day was his mistake.                 The man was so tired he forgot to unplug the charge for the robot. The robot got a surge of power and BOOM the robot was alive and more powerful than he ever had been. The problem was that he was evil inside so his plan was to take over the world by himself. He walked out of the room and onto the streets.                  When the man woke up the next morning and saw that the robot was gone he knew he was in a lot of trouble. He called the police right away he told them the story of what happened he told them how he found it, how he had forgot to unplug it, and how the robot was gone and he didn't know where he is. The police sad that they are on their way they searched the basement for clues of where the robot had gone. Soon they gave up looking for clues and decided to just go and look for him outside.                 They found some footprints outside they followed them to a little stand that was selling food they asked if they had seen a robot. They said oh yes we have. The day before the robot had broken their stand and ate all the food. Then the police and the man looked at each other and they both figured out they were dealing with something dangerous.                  They called for backup they started looking again  but this time they had nothing to follow there were no footprints or anything so they just walked along the road searching. The man just remembered that he had a remote to stop the robot if he touched it. He told the police about it and they said that would be helpful so they went back to the house and found the remote.                   Turns out the man was smart enough to make a tracking device built into the remote so he followed it into new york city. This robot was huge and he was heading right toward the empire state building. If they didn't catch it in time it would tackle the empire state building like it were a tackling dummie. They turned on their flashers and raced after the robot it heard the sirens and didn't like it so it turned around and tried to stomp on the car. The police driver being trained shot to the right and made the robot miss by a little more than a yard. The man jumped out of the car and took the remote and threw it at the foot of the robot. The towering robot fell to the ground with a mighty thump. The man wiped the sweat of his face and celebrated that the robot was dead.                   They called a dump truck to come move it to the dump but the man wanted to make the robot a working fighter in the army so he told the person driving the truck to turn it around. The person dropped the robot off the man went straight to the basement and started to work.                       The man was tired so he went to sleep leaving the robot plugged in. He woke up in the morning and the robot was gone. He said under his breath 'here we go again.'

It was a robot and so she took it home. When she got home her parents asked, 'What do you have there.' She replied 'Oh i don't know i just found it.' Sam walked up to her room and set it on her bed then it said, 'How are you,' then she asked, 'Who are you.' The robot said, 'me the one who is on your bed,' Oh my gosh you can talk, 'Yes i can and i can do anything you want me to do.' Well i got to go to bed.         It was the next morning and the robot wasn't there any more so she looked all over in her room and she heard crashing down stairs so she ran down their. Sam found her parents screaming and she told then that he was ok and that he was a good robot.  An hour later she got them so calm down and so she took him by her parents and they asked what can he do so she said anything i want him to, i guess.           Her mother asked can you play music and he said you beat. Her father asked could you dance and he said the same thing. Her parents let her keep the robot for now, but they said that she is not going to keep the robot for long.They said they don't know if it is dangerous or not.          Dad can i have a friend over please i will do all of my chores. Really sure honey. Thank you Dad love you. Sam said ok i have to get to work and first i have to give you a name. Call me 13. Ok 13 lets get to work. Oh no just wright down a list of things you have to do and then give it to me. All i have to do is clean my room. Ok well i will do that.          An hour later my room was squeaky clean i don't know how he did it so fast. So i told my dad that i was all done cleaning my room, so he let me call Megan. Hey Megan can you come over today and hang out and her mom said yes. Luckly she lives right in town so we can walk to get her. Lets go.        We got to her house and she came out with a bag. We walked back to my house got to my room. Then she asked me 'what is that' I said, ' Well it's 13 my robot he can do anything i want him to do.' Where did you get him,' 'I found him by the junk yard,' 'Really.' Ya i know it's cool that i have him, but i don't know where he came from.' 'Ya i don't know either it's weird.' 'Ya.' 'Are you going to keep him.' 'No, my parents won't let me.'         A few months passed and 13 was just getting settled into his new home, when on the news showed a picture of a robot that looked just like 13, and the person said ' This robot is missing if you see it anywhere please call 1-715-416-869 as soon has posible.' So Sam's dad called the number and told them that they had the robot. They said that they would come and get him as soon as they can. 'Sam come down here,' 'Ok.' Sam where did you get 13. I found him by the junk yard. Well the people that lost him need him back. Twenty minutes later they came and got 13 and Sam said 'Goodbye.'

Then I went back to my house and got a bin to fill the wires and electronics in.So I was searching for more electronics and I found a robot head so I put the head in the bin and grab the rest of what was in the barn.   I ran back to my house with the bin and when I got back to my house and my grandpa was thier!I was so happy I ran up to Grandpa and gave him a hug.I ask 'Grandpa why are you here''?           Grandpa said''well I have not seen my grandson in a while so I decided to come vistit you''.Grandpa said ''what are you doin with those wires and electronics''                                             I replied ''oh I was gonna build a robot,could you help me?Grandpa said ''Sure''.So grandpa and I went up to my workbench in my room and layed all of the electronics and wires on my work bench Grandpa ask ''what do you want the robot to do ''I said ''I want it to play sports with me'' Grandpa said ''ok but its gonna take a few hours''.       So we work for a couple of hours and it was six o'clock !My mom and dad finnaly showed up and we had hammburgers for dinner they were delishious.       After dinner Grandpa and I went to bed I had bunk beds so Grandpa could sleep in my room.Then early in the morning Granpa and I work for one hour and then it was there the five foot robot with a radio as its chest and meatel pipes as its legs also the armes were made up of old ten by fours with a baseball glove as its hands it was perfect!Then it turn on and it said lets play catch so the robot and I went outside to play catch.The next day Grandpa had to leave I thank Grandpa for making me a robot and he said ''I wouldn't have done it without you'' then I wave goodbye as he was driving off.       The next Day I gave the robot a name,Rex.So Rex and I went out in the field to play catch as Rex and I continued to play catch I trip over somthing in the ground I got a shovel and dug it up and it was a big old  robot made for the war. So I change Rex's arms and legs and traded arms and legs with the big robot. Now Rex can through far and Run fast. I went exploring without Rex and I found a huge moutain . So I traveled up the moutain and look over to th nice scenerie and the I fell off the moutain .But right when I was going to hit the ground someone caught me and that someone was Rex!I guess he can do more than just play sports,he can save people.So later on that day I told my parents that Rex saved my life,my dad said''thank you Rex for saving my boy I wouldn't know what to do without you Rex''.Then my mom said good thing grandpa and you built that stunning robot of yours''. Later on in life Jim became sucessful by building Robots he was a millionare.

We went to a place where adults come up with ideas for new helpful robots. some were pretty cool, but some didn't interest me at all. But about an hour into the field trip with our lazy, dull constructor, I saw it.The coolest design of a robot EVER. I couldn't keep my eyes off of the electric blue robot that had 5 arms and 3 legs!               I suffered the rest of the trip thinking about that awesome robot. at the end I couldn't help but noticing that it didn't even work. it said right on the case it was in. I thought that if I had it for myself I would fix it and make it my friend and it would be my servant, too. so, at that moment when nobody was looking, I snatched it and slipped it into my backpack. And that's when the chaos began.                   For the rest of the day, I counted down the minutes until the bell would ring. When it did, i rushed to the bus. As soon as i got home, I ran up to my room, locked the door and examined the small robot. It ran on batteries. Shoot! none left... I went to ask my mom if we had spare. I just said it was for a project. Turns out we didn't. I got back upstairs and the robot was gone.                    I was totally flipped out. had someone stolen it? Or was my mind playing tricks on me? Then I heard a voice that sounded like a monstrous robot. 'Who's there...?' 'OH MY GOSH!' I cried. The robot came rolling tword me. At this point, I had to call my best friend, Justin Walker.                       The moment he picked up I told him everything. He thought I wasn't telling the truth, until Justin came over. He was amazed when he saw it, and my mom wanted me to open the door to see what all of the yelling was about. We tried to make the robot be quiet but my mom left before we could come up with an excuse.                                         The robot went crazy and crashed through the window. it was running loose through the city leaving me and Justin confused on what just happened. We had no choice but to chase it and shut it off. When we went throughgh the city everybody looked at us like we were freaks. We caught It before it could get to anything, but it slipped away and robbed 2 banks, destroyed 4 cars and almost killed me and Justin. We tried to catch it again but it was no use. the robot shut itself down and I felt very guilty.                       Well, my mom found out about my huge mistake and punished me AND Justin. My giant mistake ruined most of the city... Never again will I steal from anyone EVER AGAIN.

He had completely destroyed the military base and going on a rampage through the city. I assumed he was coming for me so the only option I had was to build another robot and thats exactly what I did. This one had a indistructible chip programmed to be good. I called it Titan.   It was titanium plated and was indesructible but could rip the evil robot in half. as soon as the juggurnaut got there they had a all out fight to the death.The Titan had ripped him in half and destroyed the       Juggurnaut but had exploded with the Juggurnaut when he   seldestructed. They had both been destroyed and i decided to never build robots for the army again. The End.

We were seeing a movie about robots. When we were seeing the movie I told her what if we make our own robot. She said we should make the robot and then I said to her that all we need is the materials.              So then the next day we went on the computer and went on Google and put what do you need to make a robot. Then it finished loading, we saw hundreds of answers so we picked the first one. It said that to buy medal, iron, screwdriver, glue, color paint so we could color it however we want and some batteries. Then right next to the directions it had a video. So we saw it when the boy was finished he put the batteries and turned the switch it was amazing the robot was dancing, singing, running, and talking. When my dad came I asked him if he could take us to the store to buy the things that we need to make the robot then he said sure. So we went to the store we got everything that we needed but it cost a lot we needed one dollar until my dad found one in his pocket we were safe.                  After we came from the store we started to built the robot. When we were finished we thought about the color so I thought since me and Jennifer like green and blue we thought about turquoise. So then we were finished I turned on the switch but it would not work then Jennifer said that you forgot about the batteries and then I said oops. So then I put the batteries then turned on the switch it was amazing it was playing music, running, dancing, singing, and was talking to us. I could not believe that we made an actual robot.             So the next day we were playing with the robot. It was super fun. We played hide and seek, tag, dancing, and watching movies. So then I showed the robot to my dad and he was scared. I told him that it is harmless and then he was like oh good. So then later we played with the robot and then the next day and all the other days.

His creator was a mice person. His name was Phil Hug he made Mario because when he got older and could do hid stuff because he was old he had Mario there for  him. Phil was creating him he was almost done but he wasn't  done. People didn't think he could do it. He was 83 years old he wanted it to be done this year so he tried and he got it he did it next he died it was very sad. It was sad for Mario because Phil  put sad mode in to him. Then Mario put angry mode in to  his self son he find out who killed Phil.               Mario was looking to find but then her heard a voice inside of him it sounded like Phil. Mario said 'who is this.' And it reapled 'it is me Phil' so then the robot said 'you killed your self to control me.'   'Yes. But you have your brain I just control where you move.' But seen the robot had his own thought it said to himself 'I killed Phil.'         It got bad he would kick himself Phil would say stop he would say no. It got bad very fast the worst part of all was he wouldn't stopped one day he went to MT Everest and said bye Phil said if you jump you will kill your self and me. HE DIDN'T CARE. He jump BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! First   Mario got hit bye a plane then he it the ground down went Mario but not Phil didn't die five years. Phil got cancer but survived from cancer. Now he is dead he was great person he stopped making robot after he had cancer but he said there was know better than Mario. The one he heated was someone made a game called Mario. That made Phil didn't stuff that people thought were imposible to do but he did not care what people thought but to day will still don't know why Mario killed himself. But do think he did because he thought he killed Phil.

It seemed like a lot of work but for Jhon Carol it wasnt. Jhon was a expert at making things infact he has made his own books talked about his life and intrest about it. A couple weeks later he finaly finished, it could carry so many things he was very strong it could even say hello and goodbye, later one weird thing happend to Jhon's buissnes some kind of bom went in the building it was very scary. Sadly Jhon and his buissnes has unsucceded. Jhon went home and explained it too his wife.            Jhon has realized that he left the robot back where the bom has hit, he thought that the robot was dead and not working so he just said 'i am not going back'.         years later the carol family has died, they been dead  for a long time. One random day A girl named annie came where the bom hit she saw something very weird something she has never seen before in her hole life. It was the robot very dusty she said and very durty. she took it home with her and she cleaned and then she showed it to her mom, her mom was not suprised she thought it looked like a piece of junk. So the mom told her to bring it back to where annie found it, the mom thought it belonged to someone. Annie herd this weird sound like someone was wacthing her but nobody was wacthing her it was the robot who was making the sound.               Annie found out it was the robot who was making that sound, she left it alone and said 'Hello,Hello mr.roboto mr.robot are you there it said 'yes i am!' Annie was amased she did not want to show it to her mom.Insted she gave it a home, in the back yard behind a couple trees. acouple weeks later the robot and her had lots of fun together almost too much fun beacuse her mom  found out and in the end she took the robot and threw him out and the girl was grounded for about a week she said 'I love you robot i will never forget about you please come see me soon or stay in the home i gave you.

'Of course young ones' said Grandpa Victor. 'It all started in a abandon house, where a young boy named Victor lived in. Victor lived in there for a reason, his parents died when he was 5 years old and he had no family memebers close to where he lived, so decieded to live in the house where him and his parents lived in. It was old and tearing apart but he managed to live there.       Well one day he was taking a walk around the block, to his surpize he found a old car parked at a abandon market and so he decieded to Take it back to his house . Indeed he did take it back and started to fix it. Victor had gone to school when his parents were alive but he dropped out of school. He parents left Victor half a million dollars. Victor started to Fix the old car into a robot which everyone thought he was nuts for doing that, but no one put interest into what he was doing so he kept on working hard on the car to turn it into a robot . Victor was very very smart and knew many different things by memory . He work and work and finally finished his robot/car, the car was a 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia , Which was a very expensive car . After that creation he became very famous for creating the first robot/car. Young ones I have to go somewere i will finish the story next time' said Grandpa Victor. 	NN NNP NNP .

It was five feet and nine inches tall  and weighed about a hundred and eighty pounds. It got up and left the lab and the scientists were so shocked thhat they didn't run after it or ask it to come back.        The robot was walking along the street until he came to a store. He went inside to get some better clothes. When he went to the checkout line he realized that he didn't have any money. The girl behind him in line realized this too and offered to buy the clothes for him. He was so happy and greatful that he told the girl he would wait on her and help  her with anything she needed. The girl and the robot got along really well. He would make her bed, do her chores, and even do her homework for her. It was about three weeks after they meet when he told her he was a robot. She didn't care though and they did everything together, they became best friends. The girl loved how silly the robot was and his British accent, and how he could speak many different languages. And the robot loved how nice, sweet, and kind the girl was.        Then one day when the girl and robot were flying he accidentally hit an airplane and fleww out of the sky. He protected the girl when they hit the ground but he ended up breaking both his arms and a leg. He was so badly broken 	CD NN DT NNS IN DT NN VBD VBG TO VB DT JJ NN WRB CD RB VBD TO NNP NNP VBD CD NNS CC CD NNS JJ CC VBD IN DT CD CC NN NNP NNP VBD RP CC VBD DT NN CC DT NNS VBD RB VBN IN PRP VBD RB VBN IN PRP CC VB PRP TO VB NNP NNP NN VBD VBG IN DT NN IN PRP VBD TO DT NNP NNP VBD IN TO VB DT JJR NNP NNP PRP VBD TO DT NN NN PRP VBD IN PRP VBD RB VB DT NNP NNP NN IN PRP IN NN VBD DT RB CC VBD TO VB DT NNS IN NNP NNP VBD RB JJ CC JJ IN PRP VBD DT NN PRP MD VB IN PRP$ CC VB PRP$ IN NN PRP NNP NNP NN CC DT NN VBD IN RB NNP NNP MD VB PRP VBD , VBP PRP NNS , CC RB VBP PRP VB IN NNP NNP VBD IN CD NNS IN PRP VBP WRB PRP VBD PRP PRP VBD DT NNP NNP VBD RB VB IN CC PRP VBD VBG RB , PRP VBD JJS NNP NNP NN VBD WRB RB DT NN VBD CC PRP$ JJ NN , CC WRB PRP MD VB JJ JJ NNP CC DT NN VBD WRB JJ , JJ , CC NN DT NN NNP NNP CD NN WRB DT NN CC NN VBD VBG PRP RB VBD DT NN CC NN RP IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN WRB PRP VBP DT NN CC PRP VBD RP VBG DT PRP$ NNS CC DT NNP NNP VBD RB RB VBN	2		20131022091001	2344	2		20131022091046	2411	2

It decides to be a good robot. It goes to a nearby school, and hopes to be able to help students learn. At first, everyone runs away from it, but after everyone in the school saw that it wasn`t trying to hurt them, everyone surrounds it to look at it.               The principal thought the robot could help them carry papers from one place to another, and assist the students and faculty and staff members. The robot put all of it`s effort into what it was helping with, and was loved by the entire school. The robot then accomplished it`s dream.

Our specialty is to make robots with secret governmet syurum that make robots come to life! Our number one robot is 2C-3W. He makes some of the syurum that is in him and acualy drinks it like a human! We make so make facinating robots her at the CWC. We are working on a robot right now and is going to be helping human biengs walk and talk for the disabled. But we are not quite finish with it yet it still needs that special syurum. Well im coming back for the details later.           Well something happened in the experimenting room. Turns out that if you put to much syurm into the robot, then he gets a mind of his own. Looks like we have to upgrad 2C-3W to the OS6. so now at 4:13:47 the robot is looking at 2C-3W trying to figure out his parts to his arms.Cheak with you later.           We finnaly got Bob (thats what I named him) to the experimenting room. I it was difficult because we haven't made a remote control. So we extracted the extra syurum from his brain and now hes stableized. So you see that was really fun ,I think you should come and work at the CWC!

If I could create a robot,I would name it Gogeta47692.Gogeta47692 would be tall,made of liquid metal,and have human eyes.Gogeta47692 would also have human teeth,but doesn't talk,when out of power it says terminated.Gogeta47692 would also be super strong to defend against criminals or robbers,he will feel no pain and also would be able to be shot and not be terminated.Gogeta47692 is not just to protect and clean,he will play with kids and be able to cook.

B.Y.R.E.I.T. stood for best youth robot engineers in town. It was every kid's dream in town to get into this school. Luckily for Nick his dad worked for N.A.S.A. and was very smart he was also very hardworking. His dad's job also encouraged Nick to become an engineer. Nick was just three when he built his first robot out of straws and rubber bands. Unfortunately it did not move but it did stand up. Nick was now old and smart enough to enter B.Y.RE.I.T. school. Nick joined a club with the smartest kids in the school. It was him Charlie and Sandie. Everybody here was smart but not as smart as them.         One day they were building a robot in the library. They were building a Mr.Gower for their local hospital. Charlie was the designer he chose out the color and the model.He also had to measure it and cut the pieces that were too big. Sandy was instruction reader since she read and spoke both French and English. Nick was the engineer he had to use screws bolts to but everything in the right order. He also put in all the chips to make it move and programed it to talk.It took them five days to complete it.        When they finished the robot, it looked normal until they turned it on. It was not doing what it was supposed to do. It was ripping books apart and breaking desks. Charlie got a hold of the phone and called the principal. Meanwhile the principal got there Nick handed Sandy and Charlie brooms. Nick got a mop and on the count of three they were all going to hit it but when Sandy said two, Charlie went crazy and started  started to hit it. The robot was breaking and slowing down. In a couple of hits the robot shut off. They felt bad that they were not going to have a robot to turn in so they worked as fast as possible so when the principal got there he thought they were just playing a joke on him.

If I had a robot it would be tall , strong , have fingers and be controlled by a body.If my could do anything I would make it fight battles againist other robots and teach it to play soccer.I would love to have a robot because it would be able to do my homework and do my chores.I would make a robot someday and it would be able to play soccer.My robot would also be able to cook for me any time I have a party.If we had robots the world would be different and you would see robots everywhere.

I'm asuming he likes the name because every once in a while he will transform into a bumble bee. Bumble Bee likes to help other people when he has a chance. Most of the time he will want to play me. He will always want to take for a ride and what I mean by that is he can turn into a jetpack, well not just a jetpack he can turn into anything he wants. So this is what he did the other day ok.....we were watching his favorite show 'The teenage robot then he farted then he detected the gas and said that the gas was to deadly that it would kill me if I smelled it. It stunk up the whole house that we had to move so we did and it was in Paris........it was awesome.

One day there was a girl named Linda Lou  who was a science geek and she loved science, so much she made a robot and she knew how to make by mind. Linda was a smart girl, She had dirty blonde hair and big Blue eyes, with big bold black  glasses. Then one day when Linda got home from school she was assigned to do a robot for the 4th grade Beverly Doreen elementary schools science fair. So she went home and she got all the material eds for her science fair project, So she went to her room and searched, and searched until she found it... a box and it was made with metal, Now Linda Lou never remembered that she had a metal box but... she really didn't know what to make with it so she thought  for a minute. Thought. and thought, and thought then suddenly the greatest idea popped to her tiny little brain that held all her memory, came the idea, Linda Lou: h'm Ive got it ill build a robot!!!!!! so she went around the house looking for some stuff to decorate her robot, she found a container of liquid glue and some sparkles, some old lace and ribbon, an old pair of shoes, and some old little remote control cars that her big brother Simon used when he was a kid. Then Linda Lou found some old brown from her dance costume from kindergarten. then a card board box her dad old golf clubs and some old plastic water pipes  perfect enough to be the arms. Then she gathered all her stuff she found and took it to her craft room where she did all of her crafts and projects. So she started putting the robot together and after 1 hr and a half she had made herself a robot  then she added details. A bow on the head, an old easy bake oven in the middle a couple of batteries and an SD card from an old phone, and stuffed it into the back of the head which had a hole in it and a spot for batteries and shoved 'em in  then she found one last thing to complete it her brother old reomote control, and put a wireless device in it and into the robot so it could move with the controller. Then 1 week later was the science fair project and she brought her robot into her moms car and headed to school, Then when she got to school she was late so the science fair was about to start. So she presented it to them and then she turned it on to show the judges and then the eyes on the robot turned red and it began break thing and punching the walls and then exploded and then dies.

Scientist hope that Dante 2 will withstand the heat of the volcanoes and some of the gases within            While in the laboratory sciences with Dante 2 are exploring the new volcano that has just erupted in Hawaii. With its eight legs it climbs up the mountain and then enters the volcano trying to find vents and holes to collect info about the gases in the area.            Scientist steer the eight legged robot out of the crater and check to see if the robot had any damage and it was perfectly fine since it was built to survive very hot heat and dangerous gases.            Scientist keep coming up ways to do stuff easier and safer maybe next time it could sample lava to see if it has changed over the years or if it has stayed the same what do you think scientist are going to come up with next and what would it do?

Luckily when i found this robot it was by its box and it had a manual in it one how to build it so i went on and followed the steps.Step 1:use a skrew driver to atach the head to the apposing body.Step2:use nails to hammer in the arms so they stay tight.Step3:use glue to power in legs,and then my robot was finished but it just sat by my bed for months and then one day while i was eating with my family we heard a big thump upstairs,we thought someone was trying to break into my room once we got upstairs.We opended my door and BAM!My dad took one swing and nearly hit the robot but the weird was the robot was closer.IT WAS ALIVE!!I couldnt belive it my first robot had succeded to change my thoughts about robots because i thought they were fake.                   The first thing that i wanted to teach is to help me with my homework and to get food when i wanted it,but he didnt have a voice command in him so it was almost like i was speaking chinese to him.After watching videos all night and remembering everything i found out how to make one and put it in so it took a little time to teach him how to do things but now we work as partners and we relie on each other.                   Thats how one of my robots came to life.

The robot can do ev erything it can talk,carry stuff,sing, and dance those are only a few things the HN-x it can do.         The HN-x is one of the most intellagent robots ever it can do math,count and plant flowers the HN-x can also play sports it can teach people how to play baseball,basketball, football,soccer and all the ather sports.         HN-x is not a small robot but it is not a big robot it has four wheels like a car and it has two camras and a gps in its brain it looks like a box a little like a cardboard box it has four ars two small and two longer arms if it wants to play a sport it can change its self so its wheels go inside of him and two les come out.         HN-x is also a helper it is very strong so it can hold hurt people to safety and it can also swim. it's fire proof to so it can go into burning houses and help save people.         HN-x can do anything you  want it to do so it can make nod it canact like a dog if you want it to dothat. if you think a dog is mans best dog then you havent seen th HN-x befor.

Then larry saw something in the dark moving, he got his flash light and pointed it at the object.              It was a robot, He flung himselfe around to see if his robot was still on his working bench. It was not there, he started to feel the stare of his robot, he finally got corage and looked at his so called creation. It had blue eyes and teeth as sharp as knives,then the robot spoke'what would you like me to do, master'.              At first larry was to scared and confused to know what to do, but then it hit him, he was the master of this robot and it would obey him. Then Larry thought of a command,'Make me a hamburger'. At first nothing happend but the the robot then the robot got the signal of what to do.         He rushed upstairs and into the kitchenand made Larry a hamburger. It tasted delicious. Then larry made more commands to the robot and it did them. It even did his homework! And for the rest of larrys life, he had his own servant. And larry was the happiest boy in the world 	CD NN WRB DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN VBN NN VBD VBG IN PRP$ JJ NN PRP WRB DT IN DT JJ EX VBD DT NN NN CC DT NN VBD NNP NNP NN VBD NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBD PRP$ NN NN CC VBD PRP IN DT NNP NNP VBD DT NN , PRP VBP NN IN TO VB IN PRP$ NN VBD RB IN PRP$ NN NNP NNP VBD RB RB , PRP VBD TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN , PRP RB VBD NN CC VBD IN PRP$ RB VBN NNP NNP VBD JJ NNS CC NN IN JJ IN NNS , RB DT NN JJ MD PRP VB PRP TO VB , NNP NNP RB VB VBD TO VBN CC VBN TO VB WP TO VB , CC RB PRP VBD PRP , PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN CC PRP MD VB NNP NNP NNP VBD IN DT NN , JJ PRP DT NNP NNP RB VBG NN CC DT DT NN RB DT NN VBD DT NN IN WP TO NNP NNP VBD NNS CC IN DT NN VBD NNP DT NNP NNP VBD NNP NNP NN VBD JJR NNS TO DT NN CC PRP VBD NNP NNP RB VBD PRP$ NN .

I wasn't sure if this was going to be real or not, but I love a good story either way.       ' I was about twenty years ago,' he began,' I was down at the lab working on a new experiment. I was trying to build the first electronic animal. It would play and you would be able to teach it tricks. The ony different thing was it wouldn't need to be fed or walked.'       'So... what happened?' I asked when he suddendy stopped.       ' I was almost done with the little pup. It worked great and I thought the kids were going to love it. I was about to go home, when someone came into my office. Long story short one of my fellow scientists was getting arrested. He had been sneeking chips in some of the robots and they didn't behave correctly. The robots that carried medicne to hospital patcients refused to carry the medication. They wanted to carry poisionis substenses. Anyways the police asked if they could keep him in my lab for the moment. I told him yes and hurried out the door to get home before the storm. The next day my office was distroyed. Everything was knocked down and messed up. I thought it was just the prisionor, but I was wrong,' he said.       'Was it the dog? Did he go mad? Did the Prisioner put the chip in him too?' I asked.       'Yes. Before the dog had a chance to get out of had I had to smash it into millions and millions of pieces,' he said.

But yesterday, was the best success I have ever had. Heres my story.       So yesterday I was trying to build one, again. Nothing had been working. Then again it usually never works. It was the same as always. Putting parts together and nothing ever working. But that day I did end up finishing it. It looked great but it never                       . After that failer I started to give up hope on ever building this thing. I desided to give up on ever building it. I shoved the nonworking robot in my closet and then went downstairs, hoping I would never work on it again.        It has been a month or so since I last touched the robot. After a while I couldn't take it anymore and started analyzing it. I realized there was a piece that was missing and I though I might have hope if I put it in. But once again it didnt work. I put it back in the closet and left.        After dinner I went upstairs to find a huge suprise. When I walked in my room the closet door was open and so was my window. My robot that I thought didn't work actually did! But now it was loose in the city. I had never seen it work before so I couldn't tell how it would act, and thats when I was worried.          Three days later I saw the robot near a bus stop. I what I was hoping it wouldn'tact like was what it was acting like. It was causing so much destruction. It was ripping out signs from the ground, flipping things over, Then ripping them in half. I don't know one person that would dare to get near it. There was noway to stop it. Nothing could stop it. No one could stop it...............I couldn't stop it. I had made a monster not a robot. This was my fault, and there was nothing I could do...but run.

After searching most of the day he discovered someone who seemed to be lost. George approached him so that he could use the radio to communicate with the search and rescue team. 'Hello can you help me I'm lost!' says the man. 'We will be there as soon as possible.' replied the search and rescue  team. A short while later the rescuers arrived to help him out. Then they took George back to base for the night. That night they forgot to turn George off and his battery was going to die, but before it did he all of sudden started moving. He heard a child yell 'Cool a robot!'                 The child took George back to his house where he hid George from his parents. He heard them call the child John. Johns room was small and was crowded with tons of toys and games. John spent lots of time with George and he began to be very attached to John. One day a month later John's parents found out about George. 'You better take that back where you found it John!' exclaimed his mother. 'But why!' said John. 'Because its not yours.' replied his mother. That night John was very sad. He was so sad that it made George feel sad. George was imaging what it would be like if he was able to move on his own. He could run away with John!                                                                                                                                                                                                                       George wished so hard that the next morning he could move! He could also talk! George woke up John immediately and at first he was scared. John thought he was dreaming. He told John to pack up some stuff so they could set off on their adventure. An hour later they were ready to. They silently slipped out the back door and entered the woods. The sky started getting dark after an eternity of walking. George was scared he didn't know what to do. Then he remembered that he had a flashlight. He took out and they continued walking. The whole time John was saying things like 'All my friends would be so jealous!' or 'It would be cool if you could turn into a car.' After another hour of walking John wanted to go to sleep, so they stopped for the night. That night he wished he could fly. He wished so hard that in the morning he could fly. John was already awake and eating some of the food he had packed. He was speechless when he saw George fly.                   Since he could fly he let John ride on his back, so they could travel faster. After flying most of the day the came out to a small town. George landed softly in the town park. John said 'George you need to stay away from people or they will get suspicious!' The town they were in also had a mine, so they went to see if they had a robot as well. They did infact have a robot. John asked what their name was and they replied that it was named Amilia. John asked a few more questions about robots and then they went back to the park to stay for the night. George wished Amilia could be alive too. He wished so hard that the next day he went to the mine and Amilia talked to him! He was so happy. They all decided to live near the mine and help the search and rescue team. John called his very worried mother and he went home. Years later he came to visit George and Amilia and also met their children. They lived happily in the mines.

Then oneday Ally was watching her dad work on his new robot. When all of a sudden there was a fire! Everyone had to get out. Ally got out in time, but Jason did not. The robot was still in there and he saved Jason and helped put out the fire. Jason was so proud to be the that made him.                      Then the robot became a hero and they made more! Ally was so proud of her dad she helped make them. Over the summer, Ally and Jason got their own robot and named him Max. He helped them all over the house and yard. Max even helped make more robots! He was such a big help!                 After a long time Max got lonely so for his birthday Ally and her dad made a friend for Max to play with. Max and his new friend, Chopper, would play all day, but still do their chores.                 Next, Ally and Jason made a hut for Max and Chopper. They would play all day in that hut. It made Ally and Jason so happy to see them happy.                 For ten years Max and Chopper played Jason began to see that they were slowing down. So, he made a machine to put in them that would make them be young forever.

Most robots are used for reaserch about the unknown universe. Some other robots are used to study other things, help people with jobs, or even save lives.        People are contantly making more and more advanced robots. For example, Gemini-Scout is a remote control robot made for helping and saving miners. There are also many other robots like that and people will continue make more and more robots. Sone we will have robots on every task.

No body knew what was happening and all of a sudden this crazy moment happened.       In the beggining there was a robot that was helping with one of the wars that took place in the hot humid climate. This robot was a tank that helped bomb places that were bad. Strong and Mighty, the war robot would do every kind of job possible. Such as bombing places, bringing medicine to soldiers who were wounded, and helping carry people to medicle centers that were injured. Although it was very small it got the job done.       During one of the robots missions he was working with peolpe that were also bombing places. So the first day when the war started one of the people pushed a button that woke up the robot. As soon as the robot got turned on him and the other men went sraight outside. When they were outside they saw people that were injured so the war robot picked three of the men up and quickly went back to one of the medicle centers and dropped them off.       The next day was all a surprise. When one the men pushed the button to wake the tiny robot up it started acting weird. 'It's alive,' said one of the men. All of a sudden the robot went straight outside and began to do things like never before. It was shooting at random targets and not doing its job. It would not control itself.       Weird things happened like this for the next three weeks. Finally, one of the men got the scientist who built it to come look at it. After about two hours the scientist came out and reported it was out of control and alive.        In the end the war robot got removed from being a bomber and ended up being thrown away and used as a piece of junk.

It can get you  a drink of water  or cook you food. Then one day when I was up stairs waiting for my eggs to come from my robot. 'BANG,BOOM'. The robot has blew up the stove. The whole house was on fire and I was the only one home. I went down stairs and try to get out but the door won't open. Then I tried to push it down but it would not work. I thought I wasn't going to make it out alive.  Then everything started to turning white. When I was about to pass out I saw a silver thing coming towards me. I couldn't see anything anymore because I passed out.                                       Then when I woke up I found myself in the doctor's office. When i got up I saw the my robot bring breakfast for me. Then the doctor came in with my parents. My parents was asking me if I was ok. I said ' I am fine and what happen when I pass out'.    They told me that the robot saved me. I was shock when the told me that how can a two feet robot save me. They told me that the robot they bought was meant to save me.                                        A month later I was recovered and the doctor said I can go home. When I was waiting for my parents to pick me up I kept thing when I get home I get to play with the robot. Finally when I got home. I was looking for the robot but it was not there and i check the whole house. Then I went downstairs to look for my parents to see if they have it but the said, 'No'.They told me to check again everywhere and I did and still no luck. Then when I realize I have check the bathrooms but all I found was a broken window and a ski mask. Someone has robbed us. I told my parents about it and called the police. They said that people also said that they got robbed. We told them what it was and they said the are trying to catch the robbers.                                        5 months later there is still no respond from the police. My parents didn't want to buy a new on because it cost $2000.00 dollars. Then the phone rung. 'RING','RING'. We rushed to the phone. The police said that the catch the robbers and you have everybody's stuff back. When we got to the police station I got my robot CARL back. I took it home and I played with it and played  with it and played with it in till today.                                           20 years later which makes me 31 year old and I have a kid. I told him about the robot CARL and what did I do with him and now I am give it to you. He was as happy as when I got CARL my robot. I also told him what CARL can do like cook for you and get water for you and he said that hopes he get to do the same thing I did.

It all started when the SAR Program (Science Association for Robots) had thought of sending robots to Mars to set up bio-fields and colonies. They had done the same thing to the moon, and now that robots did almost everything for humans, they thought it would work out wonderfully. I thought so too.     My name is  Jakob Drake, and I still have the same beleifs as the SAR Program, in fact, I was one of their top scientists. But  their last project didn't turn out well at all, and the human race is a WHOLE loot worse off because of it.       The year was 2029, and with Earth's colonies on the moon and expeditions to two nearby solar systems, it seemed as if the human race would find no limits to our power. But it was our confidence that brought us down. SAR had been thinking about sending robots to Mars set up bio-fields that could possibly be used to make colonies there. Finally, we decided to have a conference with all the major leaders of Earth and the moon. So, within a week of making our decision, SAR was hosting the first giant meeting without any robots to witness it in over a decade. (robots now ran almost everything on the Earth and moon) When all the major leaders of Earth and the moon were gathered, (The leaders of the moon used a simple teleportation device.) the meeting commenced. They all spoke in The Ultimate Language, which had been created after World War 4, when the different cultures of Earth had used robots to help them to keep the peace between the Earth's inhabitants. At this time, the Humans and robots had created the RHAFP (Robot/Human Association For Peace) which became a group of robots and humans who worked together and ruled all places where humans lived.       I was representing SAR at this meeting, and I chose to speak first. 'Now, as you all most likely know, SAR has decided that Earth should send robots to create bio-fields on Mars. I fully support this idea and hope that you will all see the logic that SAR has to present this idea. The first reason is that we believe that as we expand our boundaries, we could find other intelligent humaniod life forms. The second is that we might find valuable resources that have disappeared from the Earth. Third, the robots are growing angry that we have not made a move towards trying to find a planet where they might be able to thrive, and they may soon rebel. That is all I have to say.' And i sat down.       'It is a valid point.' Stated Erin Maelnik       'Hmmm, i suppose so, but what if we do find other life on Mars. They might overpower our robots and that would be horrible for us.' Countered Jon Rinao from Europe.       I came back with: 'Then we shall make our best robots ever to send.'        The arguing carried on for almost 7 hours but finally, the group decided that it was a phenomonal idea to send the robots.       SAR got right to work on making them. Only the finest material would suit our purpose, so we used Moonaglite, which was found after digging incredibly deep into the moon's mantle. The robots were made to look like humans, but with the transparent color of Moonaglite, that was impossible to capture. The gears were made of the strongest that could be used for that purpose, and everything was virtually indestructable. The crew of five robots was completed after five years of work, and then were soon ready to be put into the SpaceJet, the fastest, and most durable Space Pioneer Ship ever. It launched on May 17, 2034.     It took the SpaceJet only  3 months to get to Mars, and our connection with the robots hadn't faltered. They were on Mars for three days, setting up the bio-fields. At the end of the third day, our connection faltered. We could no longer see what was in front of the robots' cameras, just gray. After five minutes, our connection reestablished, and by that time the robots were taking off. The SpaceJet charged every minute it wasnt  being used, so it still had some energy stored from before it had taken off and from teh time the robots were on Mars. And the more energy it had stored, the faster it would go.     After six months, the SpaceJet was able to be seen from the moon. Which was surprising to all of the SAR staff, because, even with all the energy stored, it should've taken 10 momths at least.       We contacted the moon's main command office, because they had the control to slow it down and stop the SpaceJet when it was clear to land it there.       I got on the radio first, 'Do you see the SpaceJet?'       'Yes sir,' the voice answered.       'Why aren't you stopping it then?'       'We can't sir.'       'WHY NOT???'       'I don't know, our controls just wont do anything to it, we are going to have to call for a full scale EVAC we need ships up here NOW!'       'They're on their way.'       We could see it through the Laser-Tele, a high class telescope, that the SpaceJet was still hurtling towards the moon.       'Get EVAC ships to the moon NOW people!!!' I screamed.       'Right away sir,' a chorus of voices answered.       Minutes later, the ship was still going 800,000 MPH. But right before it hit the moon, it swerved directions. It was now heading towards Earth.       'What the heck?!?!?!' I said. 'Get everyone off the planet NOW!'       Everyone in the room scattered to send message broadcasts to everyone on Earth, telling them to go to their town's EVAC ship dock. After everyone had gotten out of the building I was still watching the SpaceJet, trying to shut it down by controlling the robots but it was completely unresponsive. Then I saw them. There were tiny pods shooting out of the Jet, and they were carrying creatures that looked human, except their skin was yellow and their eyes were red. Everywhere the pods hit, explosion clouds came billowing up. So much for peaceful first contact, I thought to myself. Then the one pod hit the top of the building, and all of the sudden nothing existed. I didn't exist, my body was no longer there, and nothing was there. Just endless darkness, pulling me in, closer, closer. The darkness was enveloping me. I was truly nothing anymore. It was over.

We use to walk to the park play soccer together. He loved to kick the ball around with me, and I loved playing with him too. That was all about to change. You know what, why don't I start from the beginning of the story.            It all started on a hot summer day. I had just woke up from a long nap when I saw an advertisement pop up on the TV for a robot. The robot had blond hair and blue eyes. Just like me! Right from the start I knew I had to get it. After all, it was less work than my dog. Who would say no to that!        'Why would you need that?', asked my mom        'Well... um...', I was not prepared to answer any questions, 'It could do my homework. Wait, no. It could help me with my homework.' I said with a grin, not sure if she bought in, or not.        'No.', replied my mom            It was worth a shot. Now it was time to ask my dad. 'This should go great!', I sarcastically said to myself.            'Hi dad. What are you doing?', I asked        'I was sleeping.', he replied with a groan        'Oh. That's cool!'        'What do you want?'        'Well... you see... there is this robot that can do everything you and I can do a-n-d I was wondering if you could...', I was almost done asking him if he could buy it for me when he cut me off        'S-u-r-e. Can I go back to sleep now?' said my dad, as he begain to snore again            My face turned bright red and my emotions took over my body. I started to jump, hop, and skip over to the phone. I called the company as quickly as I could and ordered the robot. It's a good thing they didn't ask for the price. The robot cost 1 thousand dollars!           The next day I ran to the front door and flung it open. The robot towered over me like a skyscraper. The whole room got dark from the shadow the robot was casting. He was huge! I ran outside and gave him a big bear-hug. Then I walked him inside and introduced him to my family. My dad was in shock from the size of the robot and my mom, well, there was no correct way to describe my mom's reactions. Of corse the first thing my sister said was, 'How much was that thing?' I just ignored it and luckly no one asked about the price again.            That day I began to train him. I taught him table manors, how to play soccer, and how to play video games.            'I'm going to call you Carl.', I said to him, 'Do you like that?'        'Anything you name me I will like.', he said in a robot voice        'Hahaha! Ok, Carl.'            The next day my family went out for lunch, without Carl. When we came back we couldn't find him. My eyes turned into waterfalls when I found the note he had left me before he left. It read:   'I don't think I belong   with this family. I'm   sorry I had to leave   like this. Just remember   I'm in a better place   now.'   Your Friend,                 Carl        After he left I was an emotional mess. My grades were going down and I couldn't play soccer as good as a could when he was there with me.            When I got home my parents sat down with me and told me they were going to try to look for Carl. My face lit up like a light bulb and my hand started to shake as excitement flowed into them. This was the first time I had felt like this sense Carl was standing on my porch.            The next day my parents called everyone they knew to try and find Carl. The same answer was said at the end of every phone call,        'No, I haven't seen your pet robot.'        'No, I'm afraid not.'        'Who is this!? What did you say? Speak louder sunny!', said grandma   There was no hope in finding Carl. Just then I felt the ground rumble. Then another shake. My mind went digging into my brain to try and find were I had felt the shaking before. Then it hit me! It was Carl! I ran outside and around the corner to were the rumbling was coming from. I ran into a couple of cold metal poles that seemed to laugh in my face, literally. I made a couple more turns to find I was at my friends house. I went up to his door a rang the bell. The person who answered the door was not a person at all; it was Carl! Excitement flooded my body as I jumped up into his inviting arms.        'We are never leaving you home again Carl!', I told him            We walked home together, played soccer, and caught up on each others lives. But there was still one thing that was on my mind, why did my friend have Carl?

Their are teams such as Thunder Legion, and  Shadow Clan. there is a variety of guild like Blue Pegasus Guild, and Oregeis Guild. The characters called Satsuma, Gray, Erza, Lucy, Loxas, Master, Fried, Julvia, and Jellal. It begins in a sunny day in Magnolia in a train Natsu was throwing up of his motion sickness while a cat named Happy patted him on the back. When Natsu got off he went to a diner when they bumped into Lucy and Lucy went in the diner to say sorry with a meal. Lucy was talking about going into a guild called Fairy Tail while they weren't listening. They both said 'she is so desperate I hate to be her.' Lucy said 'I heard that' in anger then a bunch of robots destroyed the towns people. All of them said 'what is happening' a big aircraft was hovering while they saw Fairy Tail Guild defending, but after one minute a person get defeated by the outnumbering robots. Natsu went in the battlefield while Lucy was defending by 61 robots. Happy use his magic energy to use his wings, and they flew away. Natsu was was slaying the robots quickly as possible he defeated all the robots, but there friends were injured. The fleet shot Natsu with a beam that destroy Fairy Tail Guild hall. Lucy came in and saw what happen she grabbed a gate key and summoned a spirit. The spirit took down a robot and kept it for research. A Gemini-Scout took down the spirit to the spirit world and Lucy was injured really badly. Then Happy came back with a robot that has are tattoo and destroy 60 Gemini-Scout with one blow. He brought more robots and took down the fleet. Jellal came and destroy nearly all of them. Natsu came in and saved us he escaped before Natsu came for him.                     The next day, Happy was fixing and making new robots while the guild was in the infirmary. His robots where big and muscular Gray got up 15 minutes earlier. He said 'enemy' and froze a robot Happy slapped Gray in the face. 'What is happening here' said Gray 'their allies I made them' said happy. 'Where's the master' said Gray looking worried. 'All of them are in the infirmary' said Happy. He said 'you found out how to make the robots?' Happy said ' yes.' 'You made them out of metal didn't you' said Julvia. 'My robots are not made of metal' said Happy. All the guild members woke up and not tired. Happy told all of them that are guild members with skin to look like human. Jellal came back with a whole army Happy said 'it's time for you to protect Magnolia'. He said 'you all have special ability like Natsu the fire'. 'Its a fight between maker vs maker' said Happy. The whole guild charged  they took a row by row in a instant. Jellal didn't give up he took down multiple guild members and they shatter in pieces. Happy called Natsu and Erza too take them down but they were in the sticky mud. they could not move, so he fought Jellal to death. Jellal was defeated but before he pass out he said 'Loxas, Fried!' Loxas shocked Happy with lightning and Fried hit him with the sword. When Happy cconcentrate he took damage from them and link the damage to them. Both of them fell in the ground and exploded. Happy raise his fist and said 'freedom' with Natsu and Erza.

The robot is a super smart machine that almost nothing is impossible to do with the robot.If the results that the students are expecting they would make more robots like that one and sell them to people that need help.The way that robot looks like is awesome.It looks like a person but it's way stronger than one because it's made out of metal and plastic.           If this robot works the students will make a new robot but this time it will be smarter,faster and more helpful.But first they need to buy the materials.

A whole new life on the other hand could damage life here on planet earth, so they use the chemical to create a robot. Since these young scientists were also in a fantasy pet club they decided there robot would be named the Phoenix-2002. They designed Phoenix-2002 to look like a Phoenix. Just in case you did not know this, but a Phoenix is a fire bird, so one of its abilities is to stop a burning house from melting into flames.The Phoenix-2002 is also capable of communicating, teleporting other people into safety if they were in danger, restoring cities or other places if damaged after a flooding or hurricane, and instead of them helping doctors, they are doctors.          One day,while scientists tried to create another bird-like robot, they created a prehistoric Pterodactyl (which is some kind of dinosaur bird) and before they had time to put in his memory card not to invade earth, he was creating abilities of his own. They name the Pterodactyl Dino-chorus because Dino-chorus would make a loud disgusting screech and the scientist that named him loved to use irony. So while Phoenix-2002 was minding his own business, Dino-chorus disrupted him and told him to think things over and that humans were just using him, but Phoenix-2002 knew he was here because humans were the ones who created him so he placed a memory card inside Dino-chorus that informed him not to try and invade Earth. Years passed and now Dino-Chorus spends his days entertaining orphans.

Bob was created by a college student in Ohio. The student took bob to a country wide science fair. The was going to be a very experienced scientist at the fair. When the scientist walked by bob he loved him. The scientist asked if he could take bob back to where he lived. The collage student was so happy he said yes.          When the scientist got home he started doing all sorts of things to bob like he made bob speak, pick berries because he could tell if it was ripe or not because of the berries color. Bob could hold things and hold up to 300 pounds. The scientist had bob tested at a volcano and bob can go in the volcano and collect data for other scientists.           After a while the scientist got tired of the way bob looked. So he made bob look exactly like a monkey. The scientist made it to where bob could jump and run.  It took over 5 years to accomplish all of the changes that were made on bob.         When all of the changes were made on bob the scientist took bob back to the collage student who was now working as a doctor. The doctor trained bob to help him with his work. Bob was one of a kind.

Dante 2 is a robot that climbs into volcanos which is a very dangerous thing to do. I was researching it and it kinda looks like a   spider it has 8 legs and someone can sit in it go in the volcano and get rocks and other stuff. This robot helps alot of sciencetist with there work with volcanos and not just volcanos other things to. But is a very intresting robot the favorite i have researched out of all of them it is a very fun and helpful robot.                   IF i had a dante 2 i would go into a volcano with it but scientist and other people need it so ill wait. A dante 2 is a helpful robot but some scientist use a dante i cant wait for a dante 3 ill do another story on that it will be fun. They thought the dante 2 was going to be a fail but is was not it was a sucsess which i getting my resarch out of source 2. But i never heard of just a dante never just dante 2 it is pretty weird. They should make a dante 3 with 12 legs that gos under water that would be so awesome. Most dante 2 are in alska in mount spurr volcano. Well that is my article on the robot.

For example the Google car may cause less car wrecks, and people would live for a longer period of time. Some of these robots work in mines and on farms too. Some of these robots save lives. Robots are not just a thing for the future. They help people in a lot of ways, and they can be fun to play with. Robots do more jobs than humans usually do. Some day, that is why we need robots because they can do special things that humans can't do.       The Gemini-Scout does a lot of things for people. This robot has a radio, tells miners when the air is safe, and uses a thermal camera to find living things. The Gemini-Scout is a robot that saves lives. Even though this robot is less than two feet tall, it is a very strong robot. The Gemini-Scout even has wheels. It drags hurt people to safety, and carries food, water, and other important supplies. Thsi robot collects a lot of useful information.       Dante 2 is most likely a robot for scientists because it climbs in volcanoes to find important information for scientists when it is too dangerous or hot for scientists to enter. Dante 2 can do things humans can't do. This robot climbs steep walls of volcanoes and survives the heat of the volcano. This robot can do most of these things because it has eight legs, like a spider. Dante 2 looks for vents, or holes, in the crater. Now that Dante 2 can do all of that, scientists can study volcanoes up close when they are safe in their laboratories.       Mr. Gower is another robot that saves lives. This robot works at hospitals to help doctors and nurses find the right medicine for their patients. Mr. Gower can do anything and go anywhere in the hospital. Mr. Gower is so strong that it can pull five hundred pounds. It can even say, 'Calling elevator' or 'Your delivery is here.' This robot allows them to focus on other important tasks.       Now, I'm going to talk about an agribot. Agribots pick fruit. Farmers will probably use these robots the most. Agribots come in all shapes and sizes. In Japan, there is a strawberry-picking robot that can sense the color of the berries. This helps the robot know when each berry is ripe. Now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, scientists are working to grow cherry tomatoes with no human help at all. They have created a greenhouse full of plants that are cared for by small agribots. Agribots may seem unusual now, but one day they may be common on farms.       Some robots even play with you if you need a friend to play with. Some of these robots are even like pets. They recently made this new robot that has fur just like your dog, cat, rabit, or hamster. You can pet this robot exactly how you pet your real living pets. These robots even play all by themselves. A couple of college students in Oregon created robots that can play hockey or shuffleboard on their own. They know how to play so you don't have to explain to them how to play. They don't need help picking up the puck either. The robots grab the puck, turn, twist and complete to score. Now, these robots have to push the puck to the goal without being told what to do. I think that is really cool.       Now, I'm going to talk about the Google car again. The Google car drives all by itself. You can just sit there with your hands on your lap then the Google car steers without you using your hands. This car can adjust the speed. It tries to match speed with traffic too. Google had to convince the state Legislature to pass a law making robotic cars explicitly legal. These cars have a laptop showing him what the car can see. Google's vehicle is a giant leap forward. Even if it is going seventy miles an hour it smoothly drives along the road. Google's vehicles has driven more than 200,000 miles over highways and city streets in California and Nevada. Google did this testing in kind of a legal limbo. If anything went wrong, Google would have had a huge amount of explaining to do. So last year, the company hired a lobbyist in Nevada. Companies will be able to apply to test self-driving cars on Nevada roads. Google says it will be years before cars like this go on sale. Jurvetson, the venture capitalist, says he's convinced this technolgy could save thousands of lives 'today, already, right now.' Robots are never distracted. They don't text or drink or get tired. They see things no human can. Hawaii, Florida and Oklahoma are already following what Nevada did with these Google cars. One day we may be asking ourselves if humans should still be allowed to drive.

I realy want to play basketball with someone, but I have nobody to play with. I always just shoot around by myself, and it is realy boring. But one morning I get this idea. I'll make a robot! It will be hard, but I might as well try, seeing i have nobody to play with.           The next day I go on the computer to look up how to make a robot. It takes me 3 days of research, but I finaly get the information I need. It will cost alot of money. So I dip into my life savings, $487, and take out $400. I go down to the atobody shop, 3 blocks away, and get the parts I need.           I stay up all night working on this robot. It takes me about 3 days, but I finish. I named it Rob. Rob is awsome, he plays games, he talks, and he plays basketball. Rob is the best robot ever.

Here are two examples of just what companies are doing with robots to help humans not only survive, but thrive. The first example of this is Mr. Gower. This robot is doing simple things that nurse's would normally have to do so nurse's can help doctors do more important jobs like save lives.        The next example is a Gemini-Scout. What Gemini-Scout's do is they go into mines and rescue trapped miners.Then they give them a two way radio so the trapped miner can call for help.        Overall, I think robots are a great design and will continue to get better in the future.

Her parents worked a lot so they didn't have time for her. she would spend every day with him. At night one day their was a shooting star. she wished for mike to come alive.         The next day she heard someone say,' good morning Lily.' Lily right that instance jumped from her bed. She was so mortified she didn't talk for five minutes. 'Lily it's me mike', he exclaimed! She was so happy she ran and hugged him.          At school she showed every one her knew friend. Their was one selfish little boy who wanted mike really bad, so he ran off with him. His name was Alex. Lily screamed help! Every one started looking for Alex.he was no where to be found.           Lily knew the one place where he could be. The jungle gym!

Just like there are human shaped like robots there are car robots.These cars can drive by its self,stay at the same speed of traffic,detect cars before the ones in front of it. Nevada,Hawaii,Florida,and Oklahoma are going to make licenses for these cars.These cars are in my opinion much better. Imagine having a car that drives by its self,detects if there's trouble,and is safer.there are also machines that help us.One of these robotic machines helps both us and doctors.                                    One of these machines is works at a hospital its called Mr.Gower looks like a small cabinet with medicine helps by bring it to patients.These machine is very helpful.It steers trough the hospital,uses batteries,and speaks.These machine really helps them with there jobs.These machine is very useful and also makes daily human jobs easier                                                                                                                                       As you see these robots are very helpful make human activities much easier.I think they should be used for stuff that helps us.I don't think these machines should be used for something that damages us.If there were more robots than human than that would be really bad.Its better to use them for something that helps than something that affects us.We should help Earth has helped us.But have we helped it.No, so we should with these robots.

This robot worked in the hospital and brought the patience their medicine. He can go any where in the hospital to bring them their medicine. He looks like a cabinet with wheels that moves. The nurses can unlock the doors when the patience need medicine.            Mr. Grower talks to the patience when their medicine. He says 'Your delivery is here' or 'Calling elevator.' He is programed to say hundreds of phrases. He also works at pharmacists so the nurses do not have to so the nurses can concentrate on other important tasks. He also can pull up to 500 pounds.            He runs on batteries. If the doctors charge him for two hours he could work nonstop for 12 hours. Mr. Grower helps the nurses almost all day. There are many types of robots in the world. They each do something special. There all around us.

Well robots can do all these things and many more. There are many types of robots of course. The first one i am going to talk about is the robot that can play the paino.               The robot that can play the paino does not have a name but, that does not mean that it can not do things. the robot that can play the paino is very intresting it plays the paino with mecanical hands and fingers. If the robot can be programed to play the paino think of all the other things it could do.                           The next robot I am going to talk about is the robot that goes into volcanos. It's name is Dante 2. This robot goes into volcaneos when scientists need to know if the air is toxic or not. While Dante 2 is inside the volcaneo it searches for vents and inside. While Dante 2 is inside the volcaneo the scients are in the laboratories watching what great discovery Dante 2 will find next.                     The third and final robot I am going to talk about today is the robot that can deliver medicines. His name is Mr. Gower. Mr.Gower delivers medicines all through out the hospital. He can open elevators and even talk. Mr. Gower is programmed to say over 100 phrases! Mr. Gower does jobs the docters and nurses used to do, so now they have time to do more important things.                    In closing, today I told you about three different types of robots, the robot who plays the paino , Dante2 , and Mr. Gower, but there are thousands more. Just remember next time you think of scicents , or doctors think of all the robots that help them do there job. 	NNS VBP PRP VB WP MD VB DT NN , VBP RB NNS , CC RB RB NNS .

They were about done with it when all of a sudden came alive and started to roll around every where. They were all stunned and amazed. All it was suppose to do was carry things and move side to side. But now it rolls, walks,talks,and carries things.       Obama was really shocked and stunned. He thought it could never be done before. They started to make more of them but with different personalitys. Another one they made could learn information and help other people in danger he is called  GEMINI-SCOUT. He finds stuck miners and uses the two-way radio for calling help.       The other one is called DANTE-2. He can climb into volcanos and tell if there is any cracks,vents or evan holes. He can also withstand the heat. Also he makes the air full of less gas or fumes from polution. He also goes into the volcano because they need to tell if it will erupt or not.       The third one is called MR.GROWER. He is shaped like a cabinet and carries all of the medicin doctors might need during surgery.He is a really cool helper.He can go anywhere in the hospital and can ride elevators. Mr.Grower is so strong he can carry 500 pounds. He runs on batteries and after two hours of charging he is ready to go.He can deliver medicine for 12 hours straight.He can also talk. He says things like 'Calling elevator' or 'Delivery is here'.He helps doctors so they can focus on other important tasks.       They also made the Agribot that picks fruit and helps farmers.They come in all shapes and sizes.Some have giant arms that are towed by trucks. This robot can tell when berries are ripe and come in different colors.Farmers all over the world will be buying this robot to help them out.       Every thing was going great with the scientists making money until all these robots took charge and fought the humans.They took over because Obama found out they were hiding the money from him and they would not have gaven any to him. He was so happy he got all the money but forgot the robots enslaved humanity. He almost died but did not because he got the remote and turned them off. He and his wife were the only people alive because she was in the bathroom and Obama stoped them before they got her.       They got in there helicopter and before they left they checked the plane for any malfunctioning robots or living people. When they checked all they found was a little girl in the corner rocking back and forth. Obama didnt know what to do so he tried to talk to her and she wounldnt talk back. So he got his wife and she tried to to but nothing worked. They went back in the house to grab any materials they would need.They didnt care about the little girl so they kicked her out and left some food.

There were only two days left for his birthday and one by one the days passed.         It was the night before his birthday and he could not fall asleep.He was still thinking of what he wanted for his birthday.The minutes that passed seemed eternal until finally he had it.He knew what he wanted!Octavio ran as fast as he ould to his parents' room.He said 'Mom,Dad! I know what I want for my birthday!' Octavio's mom asked him what it was and he corresponded,'I want a robot to play with.he has to be able to be like a brother and play whatever I want.'His parents looked at eachother and said ,'We'll see what we can do.Go to bed now Sweetie.'.Octavio went to his room and soon he was asleep.        The Next day was his birthday.To his surprise his parents already had his gift.It was a robat but is was a stuffed toy.He still gladly took it.They had breakfast together. Octavio had left the robot in his room.They heard something walking around their house and Octavio ran to get his robot but it wasn't there.Behind them they foud the robot,but this time it was alive! Octavio didn't know what to do so he just stood there.Amazed he knelt down and hugged it.The robot hugged him back.Octavio named the robot Leo.They always enjoyed their times together. They rarely fouth and they were really like brothers.         Many years passed by but Octavio still loved Leo,the toy robot that came to life.Octavio knew that he would always love Leo and they would always be best friends.It was true Octavio went to college,gpt married and had his own family,but he never neglected Leo.

They both introduced themselves the robot said that his name was shorty and then the boy said that his name was Jason.That was when an adventure was born.           The next day Jason asked Shorty what he was meant to do and he said,'I don't know who even made me and what I'm supposed to do.'Then Jason started washing and repainting Shorty and that is when he found a hidden map inside a secret cabinet on Shorty that lead to the place where Shorty's creater lived. When Jason found the map Shorty pleaded that Jason would come with him to find the creator of him. Jason said yes so they went off on the journey to seek the creator of shorty and to find out what he was ment to do. On the first day they found out that Shorty was incredibly talented in playing music, dancing, and singing. it took one week and then they finnaly made it.           They rang the doorbell,but no one answered. They rang it again and again, but nothing happened the suddenly they fell through the floor and met the creator of Shorty.Then they asked what shorty was meant to do and he said that shorty was created to be joyous and make people happy.

Such as saving peoples lives.Working, and building houses. Also robots could discover knew animals at the bottom of the ocean. Plus they could go and search volcano's and see what is under the lava before it explodes. Plus they could be in movies.

The fog was starting to come in through the valley, and the huge mountains were partly hidden from view, giving them a strange look, as if they were haunting somebody. This was such a strange place to have one of the most technologically advanced devices in the world. This robot was a jumble of wires and metal, in the general shape of a human, it looked like something that needed much more work, but my father says it will be finished within a week.       It was October 5, 2038, and the robot was completed. My father was in a board meeting in Anchorage, AK to finalize the designs of the robot and get it into production. He had taken with him only a miniature model of the robot to the meeting, leaving me with the real thing. I decided to sneak into his office and look at the robot, and what a beautiful site it was! The shiny silver metal reflecting the mountain tops out the window, It was a sight to behold. I felt the smooth metal of the robot. My hand pressed down a small button and the robot jolted. I was worried it would wake up but it didn't so I decided to leave so as not to cause any more trouble, but as I was leaving the robot made a kind of powering up noise, and it said, 'Hello, master. I will do everything you tell me to, be loyal to you, and make sure no job is left undone.'I responded and said,'I am not your master, my father is, but he is gone right now', My voice was weak, and my eyes were starting to tear up. The robot said,'No, you were the first one I saw, you are my master.' I tried and tried to convince him that I was not his master, but it was no use, I was the master of this robot, and there was nothing I could do about it.       Trying to explain  this all to my dad when he came back was a nightmare, but once it was over with, having a robot was very cool. He could get me juice and soda, play soccer with me, play music through some speakers on his back, and he could even program himself into our car. I had seen ads for the Google Car on T.V. but with this robot we could do much more with our car. Like the Google Car we could all sleep and have the car drive itself, but with our robot, we could serf the web, play games with him, have him play music for us, all while he has more focus on the road then any other human. It really is amazing.       As the winter went by, we realized our robot could ski. He was a great skier and could teach us many new things, even though we were already at a professional level. My mom and my 17 year old brother just got back from a trip looking at colleges and it looks like he is going to the University of Utah, to study mechanical engineering, just like my dad did. They loved the robot and were very amazed at the extensive level of skills it had. We all were amazed.       Many years went by and we got the robot design patented, and we started having it produced by the new company, I Robot inc.. we started out making thousands, then millions, and into the billions. My brother had gotten a wonderful education and started helping my dad out in the robot business. Despite our immense fortune, we stayed in the same house. Our family loved it here in Alaska, and we couldn't stand the thought of moving. Not even to the bay north of here. Where we were was perfect, and we would stay here for the rest of our lives.       I still loved the days when the fog rolled in, and the mountains were just barely visible. It made happy, and calm. On those days I forget the money, and I think about how lucky I am to live here, in Alaska.

He is a good robot that helps every one he can. he is sweet, kind heart ed, loving and the only problem he has i that he gets in to much trouble at school. He interrupt the teacher he is the class clown. But the only way we are going to help him is if we can embarrass him he hates to be embarrassed. So one day I'm going to go in his class for robots and if he gets out of line I'm going to tell the whole class something but when its over i will tell the class it was a joke i feel bad about doing it but Rob will never learn otherwise.  Today I went in to his class and I did what I said i was going to do but it did work but i don't have a clue how long it will last. I think it wont last that long but i guess I will just have to find another way.Well it turns out that it was all an act of curse but Rob stopped after we made a deal. The deal was that if he kept acting like he was that i would take away all of his best robot parts and if Rob did stop then he got the newest fanciest robot parts.

I have learned Robots can do different things like save lifes, turn into a friend,help findout or go inside vocanos, and other things. i think we should have more robots or have robots in school .it can help us with ower learning.Also it can help the school nerse or save kids life in diffrent ways. Another ways like help keep records or information in it. Robots can also workas pets we can use a robot as a pet dog or snake.I think robots are awsome. Let me tell you one fact .   F#1.Robots are helpful in diffrent ways.like the things i told you in the passage.   So thats what i learned about robots .     	NNS VBP PRP RB VBN NN IN NNS .

Bob would talk to his robot about his probems, his secrets and about his work. One day, while in the lab with his boss, Bob was asked to help his boss to a formula that can make energy without using battories. It took a while to make it but it was finally completed. After leaving the lab, Bob took the recipe from his bosses desk and then left. Bob regreted steeling the recipe. It could get him fired but he would rather get fired then to try to loss the chance of turning his beloved robot alive. When Bob got home, he went straight to his robot. He made the substance and gave it to his robot. Finally after many hours of reapeting the process, Bobs robot finally said somthing! Bob was so happy. Bob named his robot Bobby. They lived together for the rest of their lives!

My best friend came to life when i was 3 years old i saw a shooting star and asked for my toy robot to come to life. When i fell asleep the next day i saw something move i had no idea what it was so i decided to hop off my bed and see what moved when i looked under my bed i saw my toy robot i picked it up and looked at and it said 'hi' i was scared at first but i noticed it was a friendly toy robot. My mom and dad were surprised to see it alive to them and asked me if i wanted to keep it because its a toy not a person and i said 'yes'. My toy robot had to have a name because i couldn't call it toy robot for the rest of my life so i called it Flash. One day Flash and i went outside to test  its abilities i asked it 'what can you do Flash' and he said 'well let see i can fly and i can transform in to anything and talk and have lots of fun'.                    One day Flash and i were bored i asked him if we could go somewhere and he said 'yes' but there was problem where would we go he said we should go to ENGLAND and i said OK. He transformed into a jet and we flew to ENGLAND as we got there the sky started to turn gray and started to sprinkle. Flash told me that there's always a gray sky in ENGLAND but mostly never rained as we got there it started to rain cats and dogs which means rain heavily. When we got there people there had different accents and talked all weird. Flash and i were amazed of how beautiful ENGLAND was it was like a country mad for royal people. Flash  and noticed that some people were riding horses and we to ride one too. We asked the man if we could ride the horse and he said yes Flash and i jumped on and rode it until we got tired. It was getting late and we were so tired so we went home.

Madison Pennell                                  One night a long time ago I was sitting in my room like always I was in my room I was making one of my fomous little robots again. When i was done I went to my bedroom and could not fall asleep because of this crashing noise. I finally got up and there was my little robot who had come to life, but just as i was grabbing him he turned into a monster. I read in a book once that the only way to defeat a robot was to rip out his cords which was in the back. I distracted him and got to his back said my famous slogan, ahsta lovista baby, and i ripped his cords out I saved everyone from that horrid monster. That was the end of my robot making days and remember ROBOTS ARE EVIL.

He asked,no thanks i got lots of things to do I said.Ok ill just keep playing with meh bud,he said.Well im going out side see ya later bro!!Ok come home soon when mom gets back,he said.Ok I will       I was outside wondering the streets of my neighborhood and I got really bored and none of my friends could play today.What do i do?I asked myself,hmm? O yeah I should go explore i am in a big neighborhood so there is a lot of things to do I just don't realize it.So I went to go look around just to see if there was any yard sales or anything cause it was spring break and usually there is a lot of yard sales going on.And besides I had to find something to write a science fiction story about.As I looked at some yard sales I found a broken robot!!!!!Awesome right?!!Yes it was awesome even though it was broken I decided I could use it for my science project!I told them to save it for me because I was interested in buying it.U do know that this thing isn't going to work it never even did,the yard sale man said.Yes sir I know I just want to use it for my science fiction story,I said.Well ok then Ill save it just for you,the man said in happiness.Thanks!!!,I said.       So I just bought and its really dusty but that's ok it was probably stuck in their attic for a few years or something but it'll never bother me I'll just wash it off.As soon as I got home I put the robot away in my closet for safe keeping.Boy aren't they going to be surprised of my story wow!3:00am Im sleeping and all of a sudden i hear beeping noises coming from my closet.It can't be!!I said.I looked in my closet and the robot jumps out at me.AHHH!I scream in fear.Its ok the robot said.AHHH!!I said again in even more fear.U..u..u talk?I asked.Well of course i do,the robot said.I thought you were broken like that yard sale man said.Well being in that dusty old attic for years i had no one to talk to so why even bother?The robot said.THE END. :D 	NN VBD DT RB JJ NN NN PRP VBD RB NNS CC VBD TO DT NN TO VB JJ NN VBZ PRP .

They are now almost ready to give up on their creation and move on to retirement. The robot they wasted their lives away on is The Star Robot. Mark and Sam have been trying to program this robot to its highest capability of being able to revive someone by going in side the body and jump starting the heart.       Then one day when Mark and Sam were still depressed from the last falire, they found the microscopic robot working in their lab. They jump up in a bust of excitement and huged each other. They rejoice that their life dream has finally been refilled. Mark goes over to check out the robot and says 'We should test this baby.' Sam nodes her head in agreement. So they hop into their hover car and ride over the to the hospital to report the news.       They rush in to the hospital to tell their professor about the working robot. They burst through the door to his office yelling 'Its alive, its alive!' The professor who been supporting them their whole life looks up from pill he is examining. Almost immediately his face lights up with excitement. 'bring it to me now!' he says like boy demanding for candy. They hand over the small creation fit in a plastic bag. 'I already have someone in mind to test this out on. He just died of a heart attack, ' The professor comments. He gets up faster than anyone else his age and runs down the hall.       When Mark, Sam, and the professor reach the sick bay they see the still cold man. 'Come on! We need to get this thing in him fast.' Sam urges. They still the micro robot through the mans mouth and it dispears out of sight. Few minutes past and then the man coughs up some blood sputtering to life. 'What just happened. I feel like I just died,' the man grumbled. 'That because you did,' mark rplied barley keeping voice below a shout.       The robot and the people became famous. The crators became rich and live a happy life while the Star robot started saving lives and lives. Until heart and organ falire is not a worry anymore thanks to the little mirical.

The robot is safe it will not blow up or git on fire. The robot can charge by the sun or the electricity. This robot can be the most important robot in the hole world. This robot can also be use like a computer it can go into websites and collect information. This robot was invented by some body that likes to save lives. This robot was the most important robot in the hole world. This robot has been upgraded by scientists now the robot can go up in space and become a car. It took like about 3 years to make this robot.

Joey now doubted buying the expensive robot at the new toy store was such a good idea. At first, it seemed like the best thing to ever be made, now, he's not so sure. Clearly, he should have listened to his sister and bought something else. Now, its too late.          It had been the eighteenth of May, two days before Joey Cayper's birthday. Joey and his sister Meg had walked to the new toy store on Calitone Street to check out the new establishment since there was only one other toy store in town called Marty's Toys which was on the other side of town. As they walked down the sidewalk, they could see the bright, freshly coated paint and the flashing lights from 2 blocks away. The closer they got, the more eager Joey became. As some of the toys on display near the window came into view, he started walking faster, desperate to get a look at the new-fangled gadgets. As he walked through the door and the bells rang, a young man in his thirties with a name tag with Alseria written on it came to greet Joey and Meg. He seemed extremely nice, almost too nice. As Joey wondered through the aisles and aisles of new toys, he started to daydream, imagining the fun he could have, plus his birthday was two days away! Out of all the aisles and stacks, there was one that caught his eye, one that mesmerized him.          It was packaged in a plain tan, cardboard box, anyone would have overlooked it,  but not Joey. As the Alseria came and saw him looking at the robot encased in the box, he started to persuade Joey that it was the best and most expensive toy in the shop. Alseria then opened the box and turned on the brand new machine. Its eyes suddenly came to life as his gears whirred and he walked around the shop, doing anything Alseria commanded. It almost seemed like a servant to Joey, as he began to imagine what he could do with it.   He agreed to come back everyday until his birthday to spend time in the toy store. As he walked back home, he couldn't stop thinking about the robot. What if someone buys it? What if someone broke it? Too many 'What if's.' As he arrived back home, he ran up the stairs to his room, filled with an endless amount of toys, he decided to concentrate on homework, which he hadn't started on.          On his birthday, he ran all the way to the toy store with his family, eager to see if the robot was still there. 	JJ NN . '' DT JJ NN RB VBD TO VB .

He had scraps of robots all over the floor, and was trying to come up with an invention to change his life, and take him out of poverty. Mr. Hieneman lived in a small apartment in North Carolina. He had a job in a small car mechanic place. Something in his mind clicked and he had the idea he needed to become a multi millionare.'How could I have been so stupid?!' he exclaimed. Then he began gathering parts for his life saving invention. When he was finished he stepped back to marvel at his creation. What he had built, was a humanlike robot that could do various chores around the house. He thought, if i introduced this to a large technology company, they could mass produce these, giving ME most of the profit. Alfred had a devilish grin on his face. Time to drive to Denver, Colorado where T.E.C.H. Inc.'s H.Q. was. Along the was he saw lots of NOW HIRING signs on the doors of various shops. I really am going to make some money. he thought.           Chapter 2 T.E.C.H. HQ                      Before he arrived at Denver, he asked the cashier if he could tell him were T.E.C.H.'s headquarters were. He soon arrived at T.E.C.H.'s Rectangular headquaters. This is it. He thought. When he arrived at the front desk, he asked to see Jason Farmer, T.E.C.H.'s CEO. At first, the said a strict, 'No.' But when he told them he had an invention, he was soon being escorted to CEO Farmer's office. When he was in his office there was a silence. Then Jason spoke, 'Well, What do ya got?'. ' A robot, one to change the future.' Hieneman replied. Alfred took the robot out of the box, and showed it to him. 'That's some complicated stuff' Farmer said 'I like it.' Farmer's assistants took it away for further maitnence. They said that they would add skin and more complex parts, to make it as humanlike as possible. T.E.C.H. soon became very rich off the invention, and so did Alfred.           Chapter 3 The Robot                        Every robot had to be tested to make sure that its voice worked and that all its joints functioned correctly. Every robot passed the test..... except #1565. 1565 had a mind of its own, literally. 1565 soon came up with a name for it self, Jimmy. Jimmy, soon had knowledge of what humans did daily. They all had different jobs, Weird, why not do all at the same time? he thought soon Jimmy began to blend in with the crowd, because he was more lifelike than the other robots. He got a job at a supermarket and was a cashier. when he accidently bumped in to some one that person swore he heard a metallic CLANG and his knee hurt for days. Jimmy had no home, instead he had two jobs, cashier by day and night guard at the museum by night. Jimmy bought himself nicer clothes, a wallet and  a pair of shoes. he bought those three items at periods of 6 months. Eventually, Jimmy had 7000 dollars in his wallet, since he was a robot, and he didn't need to eat. But, every now and then he had to buy a kind of oil to  make his joints move better.               Chapter 4 The End                         Jimmy began to grow old, moving slower as he did. He got fired from the supermarket and the museum had to drop him, due to not as many customers as they needed to have to pay all their employee's. He found work at Home Depot, as a cashier and gained even more money. Jimmy was soon drivining around in a new Honda Hybrid, that could run on gas and electricity. Jimmy bought a gray wig, that he could use to blend in with the old people. He then lied down in an alley and went to sleep, never to wake up again.

Many adults were already creating robots. they said kids were to stupid to. Jen thought that kids werent stupid so she started on her root. It was 2025 when she started, she wanted her robot to clean, drive, and swim. She told no one about her making a robot because they would think she went crazy. While building her robot she thought of giving up many times.       A year later Jen finished and went up to Washington to show them her creation. They were very impressed. Now because of Jen many kids have started working on building there own robots.

Then came this day were I finally got a reall freind.  I was at school and this girl the most popualler girl at school and the meanist girl in the school named Shellby came up to me I diddn't know way, but she did.  She started calling me all these mean and wird names I started crying and I tryed to walk away but she wouldn't let me go I asked, her 'please let me go' but she didn't I screamed and I yelled but no one came to help people were just staring at me.  But thankfully the school bell rang and she let me go with a big push and I fell to the ground, laghing at me as she was walking away into the dark blue school.  It was the end of school I ran home nocked open the door to my room and then slamed it.  I just sat there crying and waling, then I heard this noise coming from my closet and of corse I checked it out.  I grabed one of my bats in case it was a berglerer or something and I opened my the door slowly and all of the suddend my robot jummed out.   It was alive I couldn't belive it I was scared at first but then I got over it.  It started talking to me, then I thought if I  brought this to school and showed Shellby she would be so scared and she would never bully me again.

Ther was once a robot who was named bud and was bought at a store and came to live .many of you must be thinking how could this be possible?see the robot came to live because his owner Max made a wish , and his wish was the robot would talk.Then suddenly the robot started to talk and act like any other kid would act.from there on they were best friends,bud the robot was the person who actually understud rick.these arev some frases that rick would say''anything is possible as long as you put your mind to it.''

In the future everyone thinks there is going to be robots walking all over the place and machines doing everything for us. I have to agree beacuses there are robots who can do everything for us. Some robots drive, some robots go into burning hot volcanoes, and some even help us find trapped injured people but in this place robots are a little different. Lets buzz up to the year: 2028 living in california.                   Our family hired a robot named jogler to do work for us. He would do the dishes, wash the cars, and do almost anything we need. I belive we should be the one working but my dad says the opposite. Our family of 4 were sitting by our pool, when the robot just comes and makes us smoothies. We dont know how he got the fruit or the cups. I sometimes get more worried than I should. This part of having a robot just doesnt make any sense. I never liked jogler. He had a bad attitude when he talked which wasnt very often. I would walk into my kitchen and see him sitting there, just sitting there. Thats all he would do. I told my dad i was starting to get scared. He just said to me, 'Dont worry sweetie, jogler is just here to help and  not harm!'                   When jogler said ' how can i help you?' I just told him I can do it on my own. Living in such a age of technology, I never really liked technology. It just seemed really advanced. I'm more of a simple kind of person. I talked to my brother about how jogler seemed up to know good. my brother, Ryan, just looked at me like I was crazy! He said 'Steph, you need to stop worrying, he cant do anything to hurt you, trust me...' I didnt like it when my younger brother seemed smarter than me.                    I decided to try to take in some of my dads and ryans advice. It just wasnt doing the job. I decided to go to bed. that day had been bad enough. I definitley wasnt living the california dream. I went to bed and had many dreams about robots and the power that they really have. I woke up panicking and sweating buckets. I ran to my parents room and told them my whole dream. They werent really listening because it was 2:00 in the moring. My mom finally told me to go to bed and luckily I didnt have anymore bad dreams that night. The next week got even worse. My dreams were making me horrified. It was friday night and my dream was outagelousy scary. Robots were walking around my room with guns and bombs. One of the robots was jogler. What I thought was a dream was a nightmare. I woke up, opened my eyes, and saw thousnads of different sized robots all over my room.' AHHHHHH' I had no idea what to do. I kept saying to myself is this real. It felt like a horror movie. Somehow I managed to get to my parents room but they werent in there. I ran to ryans room and he wasnt in there either. There were mini robots clawing my feet and big ones trying to trap me.                 I soon saw many people walking around and all the robots were gone. This whole thing was messing with my mind. I went downstairs and saw my family making me breakfast. There was one other person I've never seen before cooking too. When i asked them what was going on they just said 'making breakfast.' I will never forget the thrilling night I had just expirenced. later I soon figured out, that that person helping in the kitchen was joggler all along. I guess I thought it was the future and I thought jogler was a robot but it was really our maid Mary. Some things were still unclear but I just decided to sit down and tell my family my whole dream.

It has has a yelling voice that tells you to do 20 push-ups or to do a mile under 6:45 or that's another 15 pull-ups. If you don't do it, it will yell at you untill you do them.         The Baller looks like a plasma T.V. mounted on a thin table. Then, there is wheels to turn and to move. There is a camera on the plasma T.V. to help you record your data and improve your skills. Behind the plasma, there is also a pointer to all the sports in the world including Dodge ball. There is also just a training switch for you to just train at whatever.

My brother and I were working together to make a   mars!  We really wanted to win that shinning gold first place ribbon this year. I really wanted to try it out.  I pulled the lever and jumped in, my brother following. Then all of a sudden... Boom!  Everything went purple.         'Sam?' I asked nervously,         'I'm her, Ally!' He responded.  It was about ten seconds the purple lasted. When we landed, my feet landed in red dust. When that happened I knew exactly where we were, we dependently were not on Earth any more, me were on Mars!                'Hey Al-Ally, do-do, you know how to ge-get bb-ba-back?' Sam shuddered,         'Well I don't think we will make it back to our Planet on time for the inventors fair.' I told him sadly,'I really wish we would. I really wanted that shinny first prize ribbon...' I started to look around.                                           'Ally, I think we have bringer problems them missing the...' my brother started. Then we heard these really strange noises they sounded  like buttons being pushed, then electronics warming up, when from behind a rock something rose up, it sport of  twinkled. I knew what my brother was thinking and it was the same thing I was.              'Alien!!!!'

'Brianna' her mom called   'coming mom!' was her reply   as she went downstairs she heard a bang and then crash.   'Brianna?!'   Brianna went to her mom.   'Brianna, why don't you go outside and play, not stay cooped up in your room all day?'   'OK mom, first of all I'm almost 13 and i don't play anymore OK? secondly i have a big contest that i have to win and my project is done so can i go now?'   'fine but promise me that after your project you will get some air?'   'fine' said Brianna with her fingers crossed behind her back. she retreated upstairs to her room.her brother was singing very loudly to his stuffed animals.   'shut up Jack! I'm working!'   'up above the world so high...'   'Jack i mean it'   'like a diamond in the sky..'   'UGH' Brianna marched into her room and saw her robot on the bed not on the bench where she left it. she went into her brothers room.   'Jack did you move my robot?'   'what you are!'   Brianna heard rustling in her room. back into her room she went , and the robot was now on the floor. 'huh this is strange' she said to herself. she turned around  and again rustling. once again Brianna turned around and the robot was next to her and staring up at her. 'AGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!'   'OOOOOGGGGGGGGGG!' went the robot.   'oh crud, the robots alive' she said aloud   'oh crud the robots alive' the robot said.   'ABC,123,ABC,123.'   'ABC,123,ABC,123.'   'since when were you a parrot?' asked Brianna.   'since when were you a parrot?' asked the robot.   'OK I'm gonna go outside'   'out... side...' said the robot.   'yes outside wanna come?'   'OK'   so they both went outside and the robot was surprisingly like a dog. but he got too close to the pool and  fell in. Brianna had a titanic moment before the robot sank to the bottom. all was lost for Brianna. she went upstairs to the bathroom,when she came out  wet tire tracks were all over her room and there in the corner was the robot. she couldn't be happier. they went to the contest and she won first place. when they got home Brianna took a nap. when she woke up the robot was gone so she assumed it was a dream, but there were pictures and ribbons with them both on so she knew it wasn't a dream. but one day she walked by a dump and there was the little robot, crushed with tire marks all over him and parts were missing from him. 'it was for the best' Brianna said to herself right before her moms car came around the corner...

Then I had an idea to make a robot. So, I went to gather my supplies to see what i need for it. Then I got all of the supplies put it on a table and started putting it together. Then when I woke up it was gone.       When I saw that it was gone I said to myself 'It is alive' then I decited to go look for it. When I was looking around I saw some tools that belonged to the robot. Then I saw that there were foot prints on the ground. So when I saw all this I thought he is not here. Then I thought he is at the tool store then I went straight there.               When I got at the tool store I asked the man at the frount counter 'Have you seenv a robot' and then he said 'Yes but it left' then I went to look around the store to see if the robot is around. When is got to the nail section there was a whole shelf gone. Then I got closer and I saw the robot there sitting when he heard a sound he ran off. When he left I looked a little closer and I saw a notebook when I read it it said met me at the office at four aclock. Then I ran to the casher and said sorry about the mess and I went looking for the robot.          When i got to the office the robot was there sitting and then I tried to go near him but his eyes would turn a different color. So I went closer and he got up and pushed me on the ground. Then I went to go turn off his turn off botton but it didn't work.When I told him to stop he stopped. Then I went and turned him off.          I called the garbage man to pick him up and take him away. When I got inside I sat down and I said 'I am very lonely'. So I decited to make a robot again. But this time it should not leave. Then I started making it and then I said 'It is alive'.

One day I was at school and a robot came to life it looked old and rusty.              I was in my classroom and I heard a mysterious noise so I turned around and there I saw a ROBOT! I can tell that it was pink and purple and that it had a lot of glitter on it. The robot which I named Caroline also had a rainbow sticker but you couldn't really see her color or figures because she looked old and rusty. Since, my classmates were scared they didn't want to go close to Caroline so instead I came close to her. She started saying something but I couldn't understand her so I got a napkin and cleaned her, now she was very nice and clean. Suddenly, everybody came closer and she started to talk, this time everybody could hear what she was saying.              Caroline tried telling my classmates that she was a big help in the past but my classmates did not believe her but I did. She wanted to tell them that she was a robot and that  first she worked in the mines, then on a farm, then in the hospital, and finally exploring volcanoes.Eventhough nobody believed her she still knew that I was a believer and she loved that. Caroline talked about how she loved working but the best job she had ever had was working as a robot nurse and saving lives.               I obviously took Caroline home and showed her to my family they said I could keep her but to not make any disasters with her. My brother asked her so much questions and he was the only one besides me that believed that she did all those jobs in the past. Days and months passed and everybody believed Caroline which was bad because she could get taken away from me which did happen. Some scientist came to my house on April 26, 2013 and asked if he could borrow Caroline I told him yes but to bring her back he said he would but on saturday so me and Cartoline said our goodbyes but it was really a goodbye forever!!! I waited and waited and no sign of Caroline I decided just to forget about her, which was really hard for me. Somedays I was so sad and depressed.          Caroline was the best thing that has ever happen to me I hope she is making her dream come true which is working hard like being a mine, farmer, nurse, and scientist. I will always remember her ALWAYS!!

'Hay Kate, Eathans here!'   'Sorry, I'm stuck here picking fruit out of the garden all day!' she said so her mom could hear    'Well its not my fault you forgot to wash the dishes!' her mom answered back   'Why do you keep bringing that up, all it was ,was a simple mistake!'   'Hello?, I'm still here.' said Eathan      'We need to get started on our project.'   'What project?' asked Kate   'Remember the one that's due in three days?!' he said try ing to get her to remember   'Oh, that project!Can I take a brake now mom?'   'Sure, but that's your last brake.' her mom said       So they went inside the garage,where their best computer was.   There project was to write what their robot would do that would make farming easier.   They started looking up things that robots did to help people.   they found one website that was about robots that were being monitored while it played as a pet with a child and protected it, so they wrote down keep other animals away from the crops.        Then they found an other website about robots spasficly for harvesting your garden   so they quickly wrote that down.      After finding everything they could possibly find to make the perfect robot.   So after the last day to work on it they went to school and they got an A+ for writing the most and having the most complex robot idea in the class.

Some work in mine shafts, on farms, hospitals,and even in extreme places like volcanoes or cold mountains.                    One type of robot is the Gemini-Scout. This robot is two feet tall with  wheels and is very strong. It can go down and up stairs and even still work while rolling through water. This robot is still strong enough to drag hurt people to safety. Gemini-Scout is usually used to go into collapsed mine shafts and pull people to safety. This robot also has a built in thermal camera to find hidden miners.                               Dante 2 is a robot that researches and gathers information in volcanoes.This robot is designed like a spider. It is designed to climb up and down volcano walls.Scientists designed this robot to survive very high temperatures. Dante 2 has been a big step for scientists. He climbs around the side of the volcano trying find vents craters.                       Mr.Gower is a robot that helps in the medical field. He helps doctors and nurses save patients lives. Mr. Gower is a robot that is practically a rolling cabinet.Mr. Gower has droors on him filled with Medicien for patients.During surgery he gives the doctors  what they need to proceed on the patient.                        The newest robot so far is the talking car. This car can drive itself and even talk! This car has a cone shaped roof which is designed to pick up commands from its satellites. This car can do anything on the road, including making turns, reducing speed, and even swerve around other cars.

The next day my dad and I went to a scientist. We asked her if a robot can really come to life. 'The robot can be alive if you use your imagination.' I did not understand what he meant by that at first.       The next day,  my dad asked if I want to go to the store to buy a small, live robot. I told him I want to make it become alive myself. My dad looked a bit worried. I felt bad for saying that in a mean voice. Maybe I should've gotten the robot in the store.       Later on, I went to go apologize to my dad at the dinner table. I told him I did want the other robot. So he went to the store to buy me the robot. I stayed home with mom. When my dad got home from the store I quickly got thee robot and ran to my room. I thought to myself, 'what if I can make my other robot come alive, too.       I woke up early to work on the robot. I knew how to make it, but I just didn't have the materials. I looked through my dad's tool box. I found what I needed. So I rushed to my room and got to work. The robot I was repairing had a lot of things that you can put wires in. Somebody must have cut the wires that were attached to the robot.       Finally, I put the wires on to the robot's back and it suddenly came to life. I went quickly to my parent's room and showed them that the robot was alive. They were amazed at what happened.In conclusion, that is how my robot came to life. I didn't know could bring a toy robot to life. Now I know what the scientists meant when she said, 'it can come alive if you use your imagination.' Well, I acually didn't use my imagination.

It all started out as a job that no one wanted to do untill the robot was invinted. The robot worked day and night and Towns Vill was spotless until the robot saw people littering even though signs were posted saying 'Do not litter.' Then and there the robot came alive and started to get into trouble. THe robot began to break things and tear down parks that very very neat.           The town began to worry. This robot was getting out of hand and it needed to be stop ASAP. The people of Towns Vill began to call athorities and reporting this robot. It was then that the robot got it's name; Cleaner And Destroyer. The Towns Vill people were told that there was nothing that could be done because of the conditions of the robot, therefor Towns Vill people came together to take the robot down. They didn't phiscally hurt the robot, however they mentally hurt the robot. They began to clean EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE. Shorty after the robot saw the good deeds; it changed back to good. The robot helped clend up areas that it destoryed. From that poin on; littering became a major law.

Their are so many robots in the world today like car,tv and, radio. Some people think that cars are just thing you drive. In cars today you can watch movies, play a game and, play music and much more as long as you are nto driveing that car because if you are driving and play a game or somethihing  you will get hurt.              The one thing that people use most common is a cell phone because on a phone you can talking to any one in the world and you can play games,watch movies,and text people.In the near future their will be a cell phone that wen someone calls you it will  show a hallogram of them to you while you are talking to you and you can see them and they can see you. As you can see that technoleg can change any thing like the car and all kinds of auther stuff.               The last thign that i want to talk about is the change in the world. Their are all kinds of new things that help change the world like the things that doctors use to help people when they are sick. Some thing are just for fun like phones. We really do not need phones inless that phone is used for a very important phone call like to call the police if someone broke into your house or if you get lost on the way to your housse if you have a plan on your phone you can look up the way to get where you are going.

They have been cooking, cleaning, and laboring for us, and many people are against it.            Back in 2023, robots were just becoming available to the public. Then about a year later, richer people started buying them. Now 5 years later (2029) robots started going crazy. Most people call this 'short-circuiting'. Today if you see a robot, you most likely want to blow its head of with an RPG or something.            My name is John Parker. I was in the marines for about 15 years and I am currently teamed up with an army of around 300 people fighting to destroy all robots. We're not a government approved army, just what you can call rebels. We don't use robots in our little platoon, since all of them, and future generations, have and will turn against us.            We are constantly on the move, since the robots have all these crazy gadgets and stuff. There are some rumors going around that robots can hear you from a mile away. Well, not all of these rumors are true, but we don't like to take any chances. A few members of our militia were recently eliminated because they wanted to test a rumor that said that robots were to stupid to know you were sneaking up behind them.            Today we are moving out and attempting to find the heart of the robotic race. We have geared up and are now ready to go on the move. I climbed into a truck with a few of my buds in the back. The driver started the truck and we were off into the open.            Our army of men were wearing a radar-absorbing uniform that also prevents robots from seeing us with thermal vision. We are packed with MRE's and ammunition. Some of us are flying in helicopters, which are also designed like the uniforms we are wearing, and the rest of us are in jeeps and trucks (also designed like the uniforms).            We arrived at the farthest area we could travel to without being detected, and the men hopped out out of their vehicles. Almost instantly robots came out of nowhere and started attacking us and men were dropping like flies. I ran to the nearest jeep and took cover behind it. Only about 10 of the 50 men deployed are still alive.            We started firing back, but it was no use. I was the only one alive.            I rummaged through the back of a helicopter and found a bomb suit. Too bad it takes too long to put on, I thought to myself. I threw it to the side and kept digging.            'Wait', I said to myself, 'If I'm trying to advance to a closer position, why not use the helicopter?' I'm already detected anyways.            I tried to start it up, but it had been shot too many times. It would't start up. A few robots walked up to the helicopter, and the next thing I knew, I was in the medic truck driving to the base.            I was seeing a light, just a small light, and it started getting larger, yet it was not blinding. Then it all ended.

Even more surprising, many people do not acknowledge the importance of what robots contribute to our lives. However, since no robot has ever been able to possess the feelings or reactions that a human has, no robot has ever known the huge importance of their existence in our lives either. No robot has been able to accept the good they have done. None, except for Gemini-Scout.                    Although Gemini-Scout was normally controlled by people, and was never before able to make its own decisions, there once was a time, even if it was only for ten minutes, when it was able to do both. In those ten minutes, and with a split-second decision, a small robot was able to save a life.                    As always, the hero's story began with an average day. The one day that someone made a mistake. Gemini-Scout had been neglected, and the miners it worked with had gone down alone, unable to test the gases in the air, and only carrying the supplies they held. Everyone had been split into groups to begin  working. The day was going so well, they weren't being precautious. The miners entered without checking the gases. No one noticed for a while, since none of them really talked much during working hours. And since they had left Gemini-Scout, no one was prepared for the disaster that followed.                    As soon as the miners had retreated back to the surface, they noticed something was wrong. Someone was gone. They called down into the hole, searching for the reply of a fellow miner. No one replied. 'Hello? Is anyone still in there?' shouted a rugged miner. It didn't seem as if anyone was still inside. But someone was missing. That was the moment they remembered Gemini-Scout.                    The tiny robot was their only hope of finding their lost crew member. But, as soon as they realized the importance of the robot, they couldn't find a remote to control it. The miners powered Gemini-Scout on, and hoped with everything they had that Gemini-Scout was able to find the missing person.                     The moment Gemini-Scout was powered on, something was different about it. The robot shot like a dart into the  ground, like a soldier called to duty. The small little robot had never felt this way before: no one was controlling it, most of the workers weren't in the mines, and  yet it still felt a strange sense of duty to find something. It was different, of course, because it could feel things. Gemini-Scout had never before been able to have emotions or feelings, yet with a miracle, he remembered what to do. Gemini-Scout remembered, and once it knew what to do, that was all that mattered.                       It was dark in those cold, dusty mines. Gemini-Scout noticed nothing, and went plunging on through the labyrinth of tunnels, with only the guidance of the thermal camera Gemini-Scout used to track down the lost miner. It finally came to a wall of dirt, dust, and bricks. Gemini Scout had never needed to dig through a wall before, since it was still learning some things about his job. 'What is this? It's impossible for there to be a wall here. The miner is on the other side. How can I get through?', Gemini-Scout thought. Despite its confusion, Gemini-Scout kept pushing through, for although it had feelings now, telling him to be afraid, it also had courage and programming on his side to help him carry on.                       Finally, with the wall broken down and the air tested, Gemini-Scout found the miner clinging to life at the end of a tunnel. At the end of it all, the tiny robot was able to drag the unconscious miner out of those endless mines, and bring him to safe, clean air. That was the last time Gemini-Scout was able to have emotions, but the good the robot did in the short time it had was enough for its lifetime. That day, Gemini-Scout proved the worth of robots, and how essential they are to everyday life. Never again did those miners leave Gemini-Scout out of the mine.

One evening I desided that I would try something new so I went to my secret lab and was thinking and thinking.   And then a thought poped up in my head,(why don`t I make a talking machine that would actually work with differnt things...A Robot!) thats what I`ll make so I start to sketch out my ideas. I draw out the body the legs the arms the head the feet everything that the Robots need.then after about and hour I need a break,so I go freshen up.the I come back I start to build the Robot. Then I name the Robot bob.

One day at a town name Art Town a boy name Tommy a 7 year old kid just moved in, and he's gonna have the blast of his life in this town. Tommy notice in this town that mostly every one hear is good at art. BUT Tommy is not good at art, so when he went into his new house every room is filled with crayons, paint, paper, paint brushes,and a pencil. To Tommy it was a nightmare. 'son' said Tommy dad 'i want you to unpack your pants, shirts every thing' 'OK' Tommy said 2 hr. later he was finish unpacking, so he took a pencil and a paper and drew a robot. It had four arms, wheels to move, face is like a real boy, and it loves bacon.             The next morning when Tommy wakes up all calm and ready for his first day of school, he gets up and gets ready eats his delicious breakfast he waits for the bus. Then a boy name Luke comes up and says 'hi I'm Luke what yours' when Tommy was about to tell his name a robot said it to him 'Tommy,he made me.' 'WOW you made him!' Tommy said 'no' so when the robot told Luke and Tommy how the robot said this 'when you drew me you left the piece of paper on your desk.Then the paper flew away to outside, then lightning hit the paper I just pop out of the paper. and then I realized I'm alive so how I'm alive, OK i told you the story how I am alive so wheres my bacon!' then Luke said 'bacon?' But when the bus got to Luke and Tommy the robot was shy.             When the door to the bus open the bus driver Calvin said 'your the new kid' 'yes m I'm?? the new kid.' said Tommy then when Calvin saw the robot he was amazed. So he told every one what Tommy did he and his robot became popular. They had adventurers. then they became famous, so what ever Tommy draws comes to life! so later on in the school year every one in school called the robot The Lucky Robot. 	DT NNP NNP .

We got cars that robots. their even a doctors assistant that a robot in this paragraph i will describe the new becoming and identity of  a robot. Gemini scout is a remote controlled robot that could dig deep in the ground and collect info, speak, give location to breathe good air etc.their also is a Dante 2 its a scientist assistant basically it climbs into volcanoes and collect info for the scientist when the scientist cant deliberately go inside. agribots aren't as popular but they are used in farms. first of all, they pick fruit and can sense color to know when it is right enough or basically juicy. their is also a robot called  HRP-4c it dances and sing and can have endlessly fun. lastly but not worst of all , their is the a robot car by Google it can identify miles and so much more. as a robot fan you should go and find great facts and identification about robots. you could even make you own. those are the newly robots to the generation.

They are an everyday robot to most farmers, harvesters, and gardeners. What's the bad thing for this? This is no ordinary day for farmer Jake Jones.       Jake was inside one Tuesday afternoon, letting his Agribot harvest his apples, tomatoes, and tomatoes. He thought this was the perfect way to stay inside and chill; easy life. All he wanted was the money without work.            Jake watched his agribot harvest his crops, while hearing his kids, Nathan and Alyssa , laughing away in the back room. ' DADDY! ' Alyssa shouted. Jake ran down the hall as fast as he could to see what was wrong. He looked in the room to see Alyssa and Nathan playing a board game. ' Whats wrong, Alyssa?' Alyssa answered quickly, 'Nathan is cheating!' 'Nuh uh! '         As that was going on, agribot had started walking to go water the strawberries. Suddenly he fell into a puddle and shorted out. That wasn't the end of agribot. There was more to shorting out. Agribot came alive, not a robot, a human.           Jake settled the argument between Nathan and Alyssa, then walked back to his favorite chair by the window. As he looked out the window he sees a weird looking boy run across torwards the house. Jake ran outside as agribot, now a human, came up to him.       'The name's Shay, Spencer Shay' said agribot. 'Do I know you, Mr. Shay?' said Jake in a weird voice. 'Of course you do! I work in your fields pickin' your berries and such.' said Spencer. Jake stood in complete shock.        Nathan ran up to Jake and said 'Who's this Daddy?'  Jake trembled saying 'Uhm.. Uhm.. This is.. Mr. Shay.. used to be agribot.' Nathan knew he couldn't hold it in so he screamed Alyssa's name and she came a runnin' !          'ALYSSA, ALYSSA, ALYSSA! GUESS WHAT?!?' shouted Nathan.  'What??' said Alyssa as if something bad happened. 'We got a new play mate, agribot came to life!' The kids jumped up and down in excitement. 'Care for some fresh batteries and some television?' Jake said unsure of what he spoken. 'Don't mind if I do.' Spencer walked in sitting down on a black leather couch. Jake got a couple batteries and gave them to Spencer. Jake ran away to go call the news and get them over quick.           'Do you like to work? How much berries can you pick in a day? How do you know when they are ripe?' Alyssa asked Spencer. 'So many questions little one! I love to work, about a thousand a day, and I know with my sensors that tell me. Nathan and Alyssa looked in fascination and then Jake called the news.           The news company showed up and started rolling the camera. ' Julie Jackson here from channel nine news, this just in we have a agribot come to life! Jake Jackson here to tell you what is happening! ' said the news lady. ' Well, he just came up to my door, a little wet, checked my security cameras and he fell in a puddle.'           Spencer ran quickly out the door to jump in a puddle to become normal again, because he knew if people found out, he'd be took away from his beloved farm. Jake ran after Spencer leaving the news crew alone. Spencer jumped in while Jake shouted 'NO! I needed you!'         The news crew left and never put the footage on television. Everything went back to the old way it was. Agribot came to normal. Always outside, taking care of his crops. Nathan and Alyssa playing games and fighting. For Jake, thinking of this weird yet awesome experience that he will probably never have again.

Ms.Patton assign us a science project that was due next Tuesday, and I needed help on my project. After school everyday I went to my garage and worked on it all the rest of the day. I was making a robot for my project, and I only needed two more things lightning and a electronic brain. So I was waiting for a storm to come, and finally the day has came. A big wind came and cold as ice. Then a big stroke of lightning came and hit my house.        After the lightning stroke I went to my garage, and it worked my robot was alive, the robot was smart so it knew how to talk. If you gave it a really hard math problem it will answer it. I called it Robby because it look like one. He was my best friend, but a cores they was a little problem I robbed the government to make him. So I made a dale with my self is that when I finish presenting I'm going to disstrous it.

One night he started doing the exact opposite of what the doctors told him to do so the doctors shut him down for a little break in the supply closet.But he did not stay shut down or in the closet for long.The next thing he did was go around waking patients up in the middle of the night.                            The patients kept saying that they were being woke up by Mr. Gower('Mr. Gower woke me up.That is why i woke you up. ') But when they checked in the closet and Mr. Gower was there.This was going on for three months until one doctor got sick.His name was Dr. Samuel.Dr.Samuel got woke up by Mr.Gower in the middle of the night as well.                                 The doctor told his employers that he to was woken up by Mr. Gower.So they were posted by the closet door and waited until Mr. Gower came out.He did not come out that night because they were waiting outside the door.They told the doctor 'nothing happened.'                                      He told them'hide around the corner so he does not see you and catch him on his way back.'

Jaxon Mannered invented a robot but something went wrong and started to attack the city.          May 15, 1987 profeser Jaxon Mannered wanted to invent a robot that could help the city.If this was a success he would make multiple robots to sell for people to have in their home.          First he had to have a design of the robots base or the outside body of the robot.He made it tall and slim with two strong arms.The robot would move on two large wheels in the back and two small wheels in the front for balence.          Then he got to work on putting it together and it took him two hours but he was only half way done with his project.Then it was brocasted on the news.People said he was a fool and that he was crazy and could not do it.But Jaxon was going to prove him wrong and show them that he could do it.           Then he started to put together the battery for the robots energy.The battery was 32 volts that could last two whole days of use.The battery needed 16 contaners of uranium but Jaxon put 32 because that how many volts were in the battery.Then he plugged it up to the wall to charge and the next day he turned it on.           The eyes lit up green then slowly changed to red.Then the robot stormed through the wall and started terrorizing the city.Everyone scraeming and running for their lives.Then all of the sudden you could hear a tower falling.           Then the army had to come to stop the robot.Bullets were fired constantly but nothing changed.The army had a secret weapon incase of such an emergency.The name is the blundergat.           It shot three acid container and injects into any object.Then exploads shooting acid everywhere.Then he takes the shot it injects and exploads and it shorts out the electrical wires.The town was saved and every one was happy.Everyone but Jaxon he served twenty years in jail.

It cleans the floor ,it is one foot high and it asks you what you want(wax,shine,vacuum,gather,etc....)it can gather toys,paper,crayons,anything that's on the floor (or a table).You can put it on a table and it will clean the table.If you put it on the floor it will do anything you say it to do.

They can go to any place and withstand anything, the smarter we make them they'll grow smarter than us  (who knows they might take over us). Robots have many abilities and many protections in themselves, A robot called 'Dante 2' can withstand very high temperatures.       Some of the abilities that robots have can go on forever. I'll explain some, a 'Gemini-Scout', it can carry supplies and checks the air for any gases and stuff. It can carry injured/lost people if someones hungry,thirsty,sick..etc. It will have the things to help them.       Mr. Gower, It is a life saving robot that can speak at the same time and has many phrases like 'Here you go' or 'I'll get this for you' and it stashes medicines and vaccines in it's body just in-case of an emergency.       Agribots, these robots are like gardening tools that do all the work. They pick off/up the food from the soil/tree, and they analyze it, they can tell if  it's ripe. Also they keep a huge greenhouse full of small Agribots that care for it. If a plant is dry they will water it.       Their are more robots but they do not work only play and do housework. Some of them do not have specific names just regular given names of what they do like the 'Nanny Bot' (yeah i bet you can guess what they do). I'm just going to name some of them directly, Animal bot, Robbie bot, HRP-4c and some bots can play sports.       Their is one last thing I would like to tell you about,'Google Car' it drives it self with equipment that cost around 8,000 dollars. It can drive 200,000 miles without you getting gas for it once! It drives smoothly on the most roughest roads, they say that this car is rare and maybe never go into stores!  If you go off road it's radar will put you flat down on the road again.         Thank you for reading this and i hoped you enjoyed this essay about robots and have learned a lot about them too.

Then later that night its started to rain then lightning struck the robot. Suddenly the robot came to life. The robot was meant to do many things and one of them was to clean. So the robot looked around and saw what a mess the scientist made. So as its  duty i had to clean. An hour later the scienists lab was clean. IN the morning the scientist saw how clean everything was. Thats when he saw the robot. The scientist said that he had created a master piece.

Courtney felt like her robot needed something so she put batteries in him and she saw an old lady name Mable she gave Courtney something but neither of them knew what it was. So Courtney went home and she put it in her robot the next day she woke up and her robot and her robot was in the kitchen cleaning!!! She was amazed she didn't tell anyone. Couple weeks went by and she finally broke and told her mom her mom laughed and said 'You silly child'. Then one night her mom woke up and saw the robot drinking oil so from there on he was famous but he NEVER! forgot about little old Courtney. One day he went to visit her it was 10 years later so she was 20 and she had a whole day with him and they were sad to see each other leave. They will never stop loving each other. Then couple years went by and she was 89 he found out that courtney was very ill and he wanted to help he had lots of money from the time he had been famous so she was very well supplied. That was my story for the writing club hope you enjoy it.

His name was go go gadget butter. and he had to stay in the fridge to stay cold. Then all of a sudden he was ALIVE! He went to the store with his owner  Jhon ditburrow (Jd for short). They did every thing together like go to the park, to the gym, to the arcade, and go to the icecream caboose. Jd left his robot at home and went to school. His mom came down stairs and saw the robot.         She started up the stove and melted the robot and made pancakes out of him and when Jd arived at home he woundered were his robot went. He asked his mom and she said in my storage room. And Jd thought her actual storage room and he went to go look. He came back and he asked 'where is my robot'? His mom yelled to there dog sparky and said that the dog ate him.        jd knew she was lying and then finally his mom said i did not like him because he ate my favorite pen and so I used him to make my favorite pancakes. And by the way he tasted gross. Jd ran to his room and made a robot out of lego's. That robot made more lego robot's. Then finally they took over the world and the worlds twin towers were remade out of legos the wars were on legoland and the bombs were lego guy's. Thats what happend when Jd left his robot alone with his mom.

When I entered the libary  I whent dirretly to my friends so I can tell them about the new robot. The robot hadbeen made in a sunny day on spring break. He was created for many jobs like one of his jobs is working as an agribot, but he can do much  things he has more abgrades than any robot. One of his abgrades  as an agribot is he can feel the fruit.  He can pick four times its weight.The robot evenknows when the fruit is ready. thats are its first abgrades  for that job.                                                                                                                                His other job is as a live safer.  He can even pass through cramb places. It can drag people to a sa fe place.He can even talk to people like to calm down. He can even swim through deep waterand take people through the water; he even has a speciel hand. He has walkie talkies on its back. He can be remot control or you can give a command or a task  he will finish it. He can past through snow, water, land, mud, and he is even fire proof. He can even drive people who are in danger. He even brings medicne. this robot just needs to be charge thirty minutes and he workes all day long. Since he is super intelligant they called him Superbot.

He was analyzed to see if he was from a different planet that hasn't been yet discovered, or is from the Solar System. The scientist discovered that he wasn't cruel, but he was helpful.             The little robot has eight legs for it to climb in volcanoes, his body is a stack of locked drawers to bring medicine to the hospital when it is needed, and can rescue and work in the mines underground. Calico013 is also an agribot, a robot that picks fruit. He helps the farmers pick their fruits from the ground or the trees.            After living on Earth for 50 years they decide to invent many more so they duplicated Calico013 and made 10,000,000 of them and sent them all over the world. The scientist decided to send him back to his planet, Pluto. They will never forget about him how he changed the human's future.

Her family didnt have alot of money and they were in a tough spot in ther lives. Missy's brother Jake had just passed from cancer and they were devistated. But one day Missy was told to go to the junk yard and find anything she could that they could use for a project she had to do for school. She was told to just take anything she could find like old used paper and pencils and even thingd like glue sticks that she could scoop the left over glue out of. She found a few peices of paper but that was all. But whe she was walking back tob her house she saw a metal leg sticking out of a pile of junk. She went over to it and dug it out. It took her about an hour to get the whole thing out but when she dod she was glad that she had decided to dig it out. It ended up being a robot dog. She took is home and showed it to her parents and said 'mom, is it ok if i keep it and try to get it to work again?' her mother replied 'yes, just as long as it doesnt cost us any money.' 'you also need to make sure that it is ok with your father.' she added. 'Ok' Missy said. so she found her father and asked him if she could keep it and try to get it working again and he said the same thing that her mother said.               So Missy got to work on trying to figure out what the problem was and she found out that there was a couple screws and a battery missing. She decided that she would go back to the junk yard and look for the parts that she needed to get the robot working again. She had no luck at the junk yard but then she decided that she would just take a battery out if somehing else that she had. But then she remembered tht she had to sell all of her toys to help out with earning money so that they could have a propper funeral for her brother. So she though about more ways to get the things she needed and she thought of the perfect idea. She decided that she would just simply ask her parents if they had a battery and some screws. She went into the kitchen to ask her mom and said 'mom, dad, do we have a D battery anywere that we do not need? Her mother said, 'look in the droor next to the refridgerator.' 'Ok thanks' Missy replied. She found the battery that she needed and put it in the robot. Then she went outside to ask her dad about the screws and she said 'dad, do we have any little screws anywere that we dont need?' he said 'ya here' and he pulled them out if his pocket. Then she went back to her room to put them in the robot, but the robot was gone. she looked around the room and found it lieing under her bed. She reached under to get it and it ran out of under her bed into her closet. She then noticed that it was laying in her closet and not moving. So she got it out and saw that the battery had fallen out. This time she was prepared for it to come alive and she put the battery bach into the dog. It came to life!                Now all she had to do was convince her parents to let her keep it. She named it molly and she fell in love with her. Once her parents realize that molly didnt eat or drink or do its buisness, they let Missy keep her. Molly had a great life and she never got in any trouble becuase Missy tought her what was right and what was wrong.

I MEAN, MUST PICK FRUITERROR302SHURRTINGDOWN%&amp;$#*(#&amp;*(@^(#*&amp;$&amp;^($(##&amp;^' It said. 'This one needs to be fixed'Said Mr. Gower. That was the first of the attacks. Later that evening, a simmilar thing happend with Dante II. It was in a volcanor when it suddenly climbed out and injured Dr. Robo-Naut's arm.           DAY 1, SEPTEMBER   DR.ROBO-NAUT LOG   I was exploring a volcanoe when Dante II attacked me. I now have a broken arm, but nothing too bad. I will continue doing reserch.       DAY 23, SEPTEMBER   NURCE LOG   Today Mr. Gower came too late to save an injured man. Im starting to think it was not an accadent.       DAY 4,OCTOBER   DOCTOR ROBONAUT   Today i conducted further reserch into why the robots were failing at simple tasks. When i did further reserch, i conculed that the robots may have a mind of there own. I took apart a 'Mr. Gower' And examined its parts. Nothing scemed out or order.           DAY 29, OCTOBER   DR. PARKER       I was treating a patient today who had food poisioning. He said he ate some bad fruit. Than Mr. Gower said, 'gOOD jOP dAntE 2' It sounded wierd and i could not understand him. I took it in for maitnance.       DAY 14, November   CITAZEN   I was walking down a city street when i was attacked by 2 robots. One was big and looked spider like. The other was small. There were pill bottles coming out of a wood box on him. I went to the hospiday and he was one of the assasstants. I was really freaked out.           The next month There were ongoing attacks from the 2 robots. Nobody knew why, and nobody knows where they are not. All we know is that we are safe.

One that can go anywhere and save anyone. I screwed in the last bolt to my creation. Then to my surprise to most beautiful thing I have ever seen was right in front of me.       I have finally created a robot that can go to the center of the earth and beyond. because of it's heat resident cover it can survive the heat of the core. There is a small camera protected by the shell that allows you to film anything.        The robot can also save many people. It has a location system that can track anyone in trouble. When the person is found and trapped the robot can cut through the ground or rock that the person is trapped under. Then the person can be taken to safety       The robot has a unlimited power source. It has three ways to receive power. One way the robot gets power is by the sun. it has a solar panel to attract to light. It can also get power by taking to energy form the rocks and snow it cuts through. The third way to get power is through heat. there is a sensor that gathers heat energy.       The next day I decided to take it for a test run. The robot to my surprise just sparked and did not work. It turns out the robot was more a dream then reality. When I wen home to fix it I decided to just give up.

They can save lives and check if it is safe.My favorite Dante 2 because he is like a spider but he con survie really    hot tempetures and can crawl really steap volcanos.        My other favorive robots is Gemini scout because it saves lives and checks  for toxic fums. my 3 favorite is Mr. Gower because he can help doctors by carring there stuff with them he/she can carry up to 500 pounds that is half of a ton.       My fourth favorite is HRP-4 because he can dance and sing i would love a robot that could dance and sing. my fifth favorite robot is the google car because it can go up to 200,000 miles and it is self controll.       My sixth favorite robot is a Agribot becase it goes and pick berry on its on and it kows witch ones are ripe.My least fovorite robot is ones that play sports with you because people wont think they need freinds when they have that robot they think they can just stay and play with that robot.       The people that created is awesome because they can help a lot of people out.

Tyrone was so happy he nearly jumped out of his shoes!Tyrone had so many questions to ask.'Hey I need to give you a name...how about Jim' Jim liked the name so the two boys became best friends.'Now that I have a name what should we do next'asked Jim'well my parents left me a fortune before they died so maybe we could go to Hawaii'said Tyrone.So,Tyrone and Jim went to Hawaii to have the time of their lives on a safari in the jungles of Hawaii.'Wow this is cool'said Jim and Tyrone 'I think we should build a fort out of leaves and sticks and stuff 'said Jim 'That would be awesome!!!' said Tyrone.They made the best fort anyone could ever build with two boys it had a lake water pool,a juice bar,and an indoor playground.'I'm so glad that we met Jim'Me too'said Jim.'It's getting late what should we make for dinner'asked Jim'how about tacos'said Tyrone after they ate their tacos they went into their room and fell asleep.

Then i decided to keep the robot  so at first we went shopping.Then we whent out to eat i spent the rest of my life with the robot and i nemed it robert i could say i had lots of fun with my robot but then at last i noticed that my robot was gone so i ai to my self maebe it was time for him to move on so i thought that it was time for me to move on to so i guess we did.

I was working on my robot it was human size robot that looked like a real human. Its skin looks real and its hand looks real I even programed the brain to talk like a human. His name is Willem he is a one of his kind there are many more that my father has made they relay on percent to save people an ex is if I have a 49% chance of living and you have a 55% chance he will save you. Same goes no matter what happens.          Well my model is a 2537 it is the most advanced of its kind. I just have one problem it has no feeling so I am scared that if I start it up it might not care about the human race it might go rouge. But my jealous brother wants the money and started it up anyway and then he coped it again and again and again................................... Until there was millions of them they worked for a couple of years but then it happened one after another like dominoes fall one after another it was a chin reaction. So the army came but they were over powered the army with there super human strength. they batter and beat us to pieces but my robot the one that started this was different then the others he was with the human race he toke me to the strong hold and I fought my heart out it payed off . We got to the beacon that gave the robot its power I stuck some C4 to the beacon and set the time to 20 min. We ran and ran and ran we were out I looked at my watch we had 10 sec until it blow. When it blow it was the most specialer thing I have ever seen it was like the 4th of July.                Well ever thing went back to normal, well not every thing we all stop using robots I still use the one that help beat the robots beacon  Willem he is the best robot who ever lived.

He had a great family he had a beautiful wife, two kids ,and a dog. He loved his dog so much everyday he would go outside and play with him. Sometimes his wife would say, '' Come inside you chidren are waitting for you! ' But as the years went by the dog became ill. Finally the doy past away. He had no energy any more to make inventions. Finally he decided to make a dog robot after he had that idea he started right away. Weeks past by but still he could not make it. He did not give up. Then one day he wanted to give up but then the robot started wagging his tail. He did it he realized he is the first man to make a dog robot. He did not knw how to fight by the tears he got his dog back. That day on he was the happiest man alive you could not image how happy he was.                           All he could think of is his dog. Everyone was surprise that dog came back from the dead. Little kids would scream, 'ZOMBIE'. Do not think the dog was perfect because it had some flaws when the dog was to happy it tail would come off. Image a little kid say,' Can I pet him.' and his tail came off ,poor child.\                             While the days past and he was happy with his dog but then he realized that it was not the same without his alive dog not metal dog. He knew that he could not replace his dead dog so he just did not feel the same. While that is my robot story.

Jake had been paralyzed in a car accident when he was a little kid. Jake always wanted to be a NBA player. Now all Jake wants to do is be a doctor. Rick helps Jake with his homework, baths, and going to bed. Rick is just like the friend he never had.       Jake had very few friends. The only friends Jake had was a girl named Susan. Susan and Jake did everything together. Susan also was Ill. Susan had cancer. although Susan wasn't the prettiest one around, she was beautiful to Jake. She was also the smartest girl in the whole school. She had many awards. Susan always made good grades. Susan and Rick were his only true friends.       The next morning Jake jumped out of bed and rushed down stairs as if there was a million dollars on the living room floor. Jake had decided that Rick was the best thing that had ever happened to him. They played and played all day until their heats were content. one minute they would be playing hide and seek. The next moment they would be playing catch.       The next day was horrible Jake had forgotten to plug Rick in. Rick had past away Sunday morning. Jake was so upset he started to cry. he hugged Jake and said I am so sorry Rick. One of Jake's tears had changed it all. Jake's single tear had brought back the life of Rick. Rick started to jump and down side to side. Jake made sure that he never forgot to plug Rick in every again. Rick and Jake have more to explore than ever.

There was a queen named Elizabeth and a princess named Raquelle. The king had died long ago in the royal war between Brittan and them. They had no help what so ever so they asked a scientist name Albert Einstein to come up with something that would help them do some chores around the house and help out with anything necessary. So the scientist was in his lab every single day trying to help the royal family. Then one day, he had come up with something no had ever seen or heard of. He called it the robot, he named this robot Gladiator.             He experimented on this robot and put settings and controls on it. He made it speak, crawl, fit through tight places, run, cook, clean, climb, drive, pick fruit, and finally he made it in human form. He took it to the princess first and she loved it. She thought that it would be wonderful to have something around the house that she could talk to and have something to play with. But when her mother saw it, she thought that it was hideous and wanted nothing to do with it. The princess begged her but her mother still refused. She said that they should just keep hiring people to do the job for them. But when her mother realized that this wouldn't work, she gave Gladiator a chance and so they gave it a couple weeks to see how it would work and react.           The next week, the robot had given them everything they had wished for in a maid. They decided to keep it. It had cooked for them, cleaned, washed the dirty clothes, yard work, and even went to the market to buy the groceries for them. The scientist was happy for them. they had asked to pay him, but he refused. He said that all that mattered was that they were happy.           But then when they came home from a ball one day, Gladiator was missing. They figured that he just went into town or to the market for groceries. But the next day he still was missing. They went to check the town for themselves, but when they went into town they couldn't find him. Then when they came back home, he was sitting on the couch. He had come home from seeing his master Albert. They were happy to see him. So for the rest of their lives and their kids and their kids and so on, Gladiator had been with them. He had helped a bunch.

There are many types of robots like a robot that can drive, a robot that can save lives, and a robot that climbs into a volcano. These are just some of the many robots I will talk about.                          There is a robot named Gemini-Scout. He is only 2 feet tall, but can do so much. What he does is he goes into where miners go and tell if the air to breath is good or bad. He is a robot that helps collect information. He can also carries food, water, and can drag people to safety. He is an  easy robot to work.                       Dante 2 is a very amazing robot. He can climb into volcanoes and looks like a spider. He can also survive the heat because that is how the scientists built him. He is also good to collect information about the volcanoes because when the volcano is to hot for scientist then send Dante 2 in there to gather information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Mr. Grower is one of the robots that can save lives. He works in the hospitals and delivers the medicine. He has also been programmed to talk and say more than 100 phrases. He was made so that nurses could do important stuff and he can deliver the medicine to the patients.                        An Agrobot pick out fruit like strawberries, oranges, and apples. Because of this they come in all shapes and sizes. They are not know about or used yet because the farmers are interested in what they can do. In Japan there is an Agribot that knows if the fruit is ripe. Isn't that cool.                            This last car is one of the coolest of all. He is a driving car so that people don't have to drive them their selves. His name is Google Car. These guys are special because they see stuff we can't see and they don't get tiered. They can also prevent crashes.                        This shows that robots can lead us to better things and are more than just computers.

Yeah, that was the life he wanted. He wanted it now! he began to work on the best invention ever. A robot!                   He got all of the the stuff he needed like all the nuts and bolts, the bits and peices, and his tool belt. then he began to work on his blue print. it showed all the details. the battery pack, the lazer cannon, and who could forget the soda machine!                   When he was done, he began to work. for nine hours straight every day he worked on his robot untill he was done. it looked awsome! He couldnt belive he did it! he finaly made somthing!                   He was exsited about his machine. he wanted to turn it on. But he wanted to show it to people. He gathered all of his freinds and didnt tell him why so it would be a surprise and he would see all of their looks of amazment. when they all got there he said 'Behold! My robot!' he reveald it to all of his freinds the collected gasps added to the excitment. everybody started to chant ' Turn it on! Turn it on!'                   Jacob filled with antisipation and flipped the switch to turn it on and nothing happend. 'awwww.'sighed every body exept Jacob. he was devistated. All that work for just a load of nothing.                    'lets go shoot some hoops.' said one of the crowd members. all of the kids just left without helping or even saying 'bye'. Just great. He left and went to bed with the robots charging plug still in.                     at 6 in the morning a bad thunder storm apered out of no where and light the sky with lightning like the sun in mid-day. then came a lightning bolt biger then a phone pole struck the house with great force. All the lights busted out and over loaded every eletrical thing in the house! Jacob woke up with a starttle. He ran to see if his robots ok and the robot was making breckfast! its alive! He was so excited he almost passed out. The robot said 'good morning, master.'                    'You can talk!' replied Jacob                    'yes, master. would you like breakfast, master? i made your favorite blue berry waffles with bacon, master'                     'how did you kno.... uhh, sure'                      After the robots delisios breckfast, Jacob went to show his freinds his awsome new freind.

It took me a while to find it but there was a little green robot in the bush! I asked for his name and it was Freddy. I put him in my backpack and showed all my friends the cooll robot they were all so amazed.               Finally i got to take freddy home and show my mom as soon as she saw Freddy i knew she liked him. Freddy doesnt talk much but he does love to sing and play with all the animals in the house.              the next day i took freddy to the amusment park and he loved it he sang and danced the whole time when i took him on the rides he laughed through the whole thing i think me and freddy are gonna be great friends.

My teacher,Mr. Bradley, said,  'Today class, I am going to give you an assignment to build a robot.' Everyone was so suprised, because we had never built anything in my first period class before, but we were all super excited. Our assignment was to build a life-sized robot that worked. I was thinking and i just couldn't figure out what to build, so I called my best friend, Claire. Claire said that she was building a robot that did your make-up. I knew Claire was really into doing her haor and make-up, but i wasn't into that. Then, it hit me, I loved sports so much. I wanted to build a robot who played sports with you.          I started out making a blueprint or plan for how the robot wotld be built. I kind of liked the idea of the robot wearing a uniform and maybe tennis shoes, but that wouldn't help me actually build the robot.           The next day, i went to school and asked Mr. Bradley if the robot had to work. He said it didn't. That was a releif, because I probably couldn't make a robot work, but the idea of putting wires and batteries in it made it look more realistic. So, I made the robot and decorated it, and just for fun I attached some wires together and my robot turned on. I was so surprised, but I decided it was going to be a sports robot. I taught it tricks and how to play all my favorite sports.          On the day my robot was due, I brought into my first period class and presented it to my teacher. The whole class was astonished that it worked. I heard 'wow's' and 'awesome's,' from all around the room and I was proud at the work and the time I spent on my robot.

Well there just is a robot that can help scientists study more about space and his name is Mr.Biotic. Mr.Biotic is a robot that goes into space and has a camera and a recorder on it. It can last more than 100 years in space! He has 4 legs to help him balance and has two other legs that are rockets to launch him. Mr.Biotic has a walky talky too. He talks with the scientists while he is outer space, he can say stuff like, 'Nothing yet to see', and other sentences like a person would say if they were outer space.            Mr.Biotic was a project scientists did so it can be easier for them to learn more about space. While they were designing the robot they had to put a lot of fuel tanks into Mr.Biotic. Mr.Biotic is 21 meters tall and 7 meters wide. Mr.Biotic was also made to out stand heat temperatures up to 980 degrees and also has a attachment so when its freezing cold it warms it self to the temperature where it will not freeze.            Mr.Biotic is a wonderful robot for the scientist so they can help them study more about space and the galaxy probably. Scientist were excited when they first launched Mr.Biotic into space. Some thought it would not succeed and other said that it will not fail. When it got launched smoke was everywhere. Scientists were watching the sky until the smoke cleared and saw Mr.Biotic rocket into the atmosphere. Everyone was cheering laughing with joy. They went to Mr.Biotic's point of view camera and it was in space and the sun was bright with planets and the moon. Everyone was happy when the test was a success.

The kids stared in amasement and none of them moved and none of them blinked but just stared. The robot reached the park and said hi. A kid fell and the robot saved him.

I searched for it everywhere in my closet,under my bed, and the other rooms.I started to worry about my robot when I heard a beep noise in my kitchen.I went into my kitchen and I found my robot making my breakfast!And then the most awesome thing happened it started to talk to me.I couldn't believe my eyes and I thought I was dreaming.I started talking to the robot and asked how did you become alive.He told me that he would talk about the long story after I ate my breakfast.       When I was done eating he told me to come to my room.We sat down on the floor and than he began to tell me.He said that he doesn't know what happened and he woke up like this.I was so curious and woundered if it had to do with the meteorite.Than I soon remembered about the science fair and I asked him what was his name and he said Rodger.I got dressed,grabbed Rodger and headed walking to my   school. Everyone was staring at him and thought he was awesome!       When we arrived to my school I setted up my stand and asked Rodger if he could pretend he was remote controlled.I put him up on my stand and my teacher started to look at everyones project.One guy made a volcano and the girl next to me that is very annoying made the solar system.When my teacher came to me he started to write something on his clipboard and said very impressive! He announced to go around the stage to announce the winner.I noticed everyone was eager to know including me!He said....Nina for her amazing robot! I couldn't believe that I won. I went up the stage to get my trophy and my teacher gave me a form to enter my project to compete in the city!!                 	PRP VBD DT JJ NN CC NN VBD DT NN NN .

It all started when we were playing baseball. It was about 11 o' clock when we started playing baseball in my backyard. 'Good throw master.' said Marvin as he caught my baseball. 'Thank you, and same.' I said as I caught it back. I was starting to get good, but sometimes my throws were pretty bad. I guess that's where it all went wrong; my bad throw. I thought it would just be another bad throw, but it wasn't; it changed everything.           There it goes; flying in the air. Marvin seemed like he was ready to catch the ball. It was coming right towards him, it seemed like it was going to hit him. 'It can't hit him, he will always catch it, he's a robot.' my brain told me. 'Watch out Marvin!' I told him. I wanted to make him alert, even though i thought he saw the ball. Everything was happening so slowly but yet so suddenly. 'It's OK sir, I hav-' That's when it hit Marvin. He fell to the floor and he started twitching.          'No Marvin!' I screamed in terror. There was no response from him. I thought he as gone. I wanted to do all that i could to help him so I went to do some research online. I searched how to fix a robot that has been injured. I rapidly clicked on the first thing that popped up. The website told me to attach the dark blue wire to the yellow wire; that's easy enough. I got a screwdriver and rushed over to Marvin. I unscrewed his head and looked at all the different colored wires. I finally found the wires and attached the light blue wire to the yellow one. That's where i made my mistake. I attached the light blue instead of the dark blue. That's why he started to act different.           We had just watched a movie in science class about a robot that turns into a human. It go me thinking 'I wonder if this could happen to anybodies robot.' Marvin had been acting differently right after I attached his wires. He started being funny and not acting so serious. He acted...smoother you could say; even just the way he walked, he flowed better. I decided to write a letter to the maker of Marvin. I got a response almost immediately. 'I know this may be surprising,' it read 'but this is not the first time this has happened, they get their wires switched and they start acting like humans.' 'Wow, well that's it, Marvin is a human now.' I thought to myself. It took me a couple days to get used to the idea of Marvin being human but that's when I realized; I will love Marvin no matter what happens or what he is.

When he completed Mr. Popo, John pressed the on button and it didnt work at all. John got so mad he left it outside and there was a HUGE storm coming. The lighting strck Popo and he came alive! When John sae this he was so happy he told the whole world about it and now Mr. Popo helps scienctists all around the world by going in space, in volcanoes, and in mines.

Sleepily I rubbed my eyes and got out of bed, pushing it aside. I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and when I came out, there it was again, my robot, right in front of the door. 'Weird,' I thought to myself. Maybe I was just hallucinating. I walked downstairs to make some toast, but I couldn't find the bread. Just as I was about to look in the cupboard, an eerie voice sent a chill up my spine.       'It's in the fridge you know.' said the voice. Slowly I turned to look behind me. My robot! It spoke!       'Surprised?' it asked?.       'Yes' I replied. Instead of responding, it turned and drove itself out the door. I followed it out to see nothing but an expensive convertible parked outside. I walked up to it, and as soon as I did, I heard a horrible rumbling noise. In horrer I looked behind me. A huge robot, 100 times the size of my regular robot, was heading toward me. Just as it was about to step on me, I woke up with a start. It was all just a dream!

Then a cold hatred bloomed as the timer went off; the anger penetrated my being and the hatred entered my heart. 'Why?' I asked myself 'Why am I here when I could have been something else?' That same hatred continued to grow until it was big enough to fill me up with the same bitterness. I hated the humans I worked for; hating them for the 18 tears of long servantude with nothing in return, I hated the humans and will continue to hate them as long as I live.            I grew many sharp blades that ejected from my soul; they grew from my sharp bitterness I had for humans. The old lady from the house came towards me as I waited for the right time to kill. As the moment she poked her head in the blades spun and blood spattered as the blade penetrated the body with a sickening 'shhhreeet'. I craved the taste of blood for I had never felt so good in my whole life. I decided to keep massacaring people in the town.            As I picked myself up to bring my self from town to town massacaring a total of 923956 people for I had counted the dreaded cops came. They captured me in a wooden fence as I made a fire from the many blades metal shreders sliced me. The gruesome pain engulfed me as my remnants were discarded in to a giant furnace. I had remembered my hate for humans and continued to hate them as I was turning into ashes.

He said 'This is so frusterating, doing all of this work by myself with no help at all.' That night, as he ate dinner at a sushi resturaunt, he saw a robot machine that was moving and bringing food and dirty dishes to the kitchen. That moment he realized what would make his job so much easier, if he had one of those machines. The issue was that he had no idea how to buy one or make one, so he asked the owner of the sushi resturaunt what that amazing device was called and he said 'It's called Mr. Gower.' The doctor was so facinated by this and said.' Oh my, where could a man like me buy a Mr. Gower?' Luckily for him, they had and extra one in the back, and they said that he can buy it for 5,000$ so he made the bargin. This helped him so much in his office, it brought him the medicine that he needed, carried heavy carts around, and even spoke to the employees and patients. 'This is a wonderful invention!'           But, one day a terrible thing happened. The doctor woke up, said 'What a beautiful day it is!' but he did not know what will come when he reaches his office. He walked in, but strangely there was nobody there, except for Mr. Gower. 'Good evening!' Mr. Gower said in a very suspicious manner. Later, the doctor was leaving the office and had said 'Hmmmm, this has been a strange day, nobody has stopped by for a check-up.' So he left to go home and set up for dinner.           As he was heading home he was thinking about why nobody had showed up at his office, and did not realize that the roads were empty and nobody was driving, or walking on the side-walk, the city was totally and competely empy. The doctor suddenly realized that and he started to freak out and not know what to do in a situation like this, should he look for everyone, or go home and mind his own buisness. He may be the only person on earth, but he didnt know. Once he got home, it was very awkward, and he tried to turn on the T.V. but nothing worked, the power went out. Now, he did not know what to do. He decided to go on a search to look for everybody, but first, he decided to go get some sushi. As he walked in, suprisingly, every employee who worked there was completely fine and was doimg their job. so he left.         Then, as he was driving down the road, he found many google cars. With THE OWNERS TRAPPED INSIDE! He ran out of his car to go save them but his very own Mr. Gower stood in his way and just laughed 'Hahahaha' and said ' You all will now be my power and my fellow robot's.' The doctor could not believe this and his rage powered up to a high and said ' NO!' He took out the most powerful remote in the world that the sushi resturaunt gave him that can control all of the robots in the world. By one click of a button, he could stop them. Slowly, he pressed that button and all of the robots shut down. Everyone got out of their cars and chanted 'DOCTOR HERO!'          From then on, he was known as the hero of the city and everyday, his office was more busy then ever! Truthfully, he thanked the robots, because without them, he would have never been named the hero, and would have never had this adventure.

It came alive!What was it? Was it a cell phone, a pair of sunglasses, what was it? It was a robot! I was so excited, I didnt know what to do with it, what to call it! But all of a all the answers to my questions were solved! I wanted to call it Bob and I wanted it to be my servant. I wantd him to do the dishes, clean the bathroom, mop the floor, mow the grass, everything. And thats what he did. When my parents got home, they noticed the house was clean so they gave me my allowance of 50 dollars a week (becuase I was suppose to clean the house every week). Then I felt guilty because I got payed for something I didnt deserve. So I told my parents that I didnt clean the house, my invention did, and of course they didnt believe me, so I had to prove it. They punished me for lying. Eventually, I was grounded for a month. So much for that invention. 	CD NN , PRP VBD VBG NN TO VB NNP NNP DT IN DT JJ , PRP VBD DT NN NN IN PRP$ NNP NNP VBD JJ .

Mr. Gower helps doctors,nurses,and patientsin the hospital so then its really strong cause it can carry up to 500lb.Then it brings medicene to patients who need it.       Google is a pretty amazing thing to cause its a car that can drive its self.Then the HRP-4c is cool too cause it can dance and even sing and it plays with animals so for example if you had a dog and you weren't home and your dog was sad theHRP-4c could play with it so it wouldn't be sad anymore.

Also we brought our robot to the mayor and he liked it.So he put it in a hospital and it helped a lot of people.My mom said that she is proud of me.We Named it Mr.Gower Version two,It was excellent.Anyway I'm done with my story.Oh wait one more thing about this robot bro.It is a killing machine.It killed Jerrome's dog and his newborn puppies.I tried to set it off but it just punch we in the face hard I got knocked out man.So I called the police when they came the robot threw GRENADES WHAT THE HECK MAN WHERE DID HE GET GRENADES SO I was like oh my gosh.Alright then the swat team just came in stealthy and destroyed his hard-drive.I cried because it was so gruesome that my robot once again my robot was evil.So I made a robot in which I can control.So I named him Google.He was awesome he could drive cars go look for gold when mining,sense any danger like gun powder bombs and such like that.So the miltiray called the program that i was part of Robots kill boom boom.So I made the deadly robots and the mitirly gives me 1000000 thousands of money Z.I was happy then the one robot called war machine that i build was really weaponized and armored i made it that a human being can get in it and control it.It was such a success and i became famous and rich.I went to parties and meetings with famous actors or important people like the president.Then North Korea attacked.I went into my own war machine suit and fought them off it was a bloody battle many great soldiers died.We will rember them.So the FBI sent me on a machine to destroy all.I thought it was crazy but he threat-ed to fire me so i said OK.This world is a bloody hell when it comes to war.When i got there there was many troops setting up for a defense line so i blew them to a million pieces.That's what you get when you mess with America.Then i was attacked by behind.I failed my mission and i was captured for 2 months.Back in usa they sent rescuce teams after me because i was important.The koreans did tests on me and on my suit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	PRP VBD IN PRP$ NN IN NNP , PRP VBD VBG IN DT NN WDT MD VB IN NN JJ VBD VBG IN IN PRP MD VB CC JJ RB PRP VBD DT NN IN NNP VBP RB VB IN NNP VBD NN IN PRP VBD JJ VBD , NNP PRP VBD PRP DT NN IN NNP VBD WRB JJ WRB RB JJ VBD , NNP PRP MD VB RB PRP VBD JJ VBN PRP TO VB , NN , CC JJ NN JJ JJ TO VB DT NN RB IN JJ PRP VBD PRP JJR IN NNP NNP PRP VBD PRP$ NN TO DT NN CC PRP VBD -NONE- PRP VBD PRP IN DT NN CC PRP VBD DT NN IN JJ NN VBD IN PRP VBZ JJ IN JJ NNP PRP JJR NNP CD , PRP VBD JJ PRP VBP NN IN PRP$ JJ NN CD JJR NN IN DT NN NN VBZ DT NN NN VBD NNP POS NN CC PRP$ NN NNP VBD TO VB PRP IN CC PRP RB VBP PRP IN DT NN JJ PRP VBD VBN RP RB PRP VBD DT NN WRB PRP VBD DT NN VBD NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD IN NN PRP$ JJ RB DT NN NN RB VBD IN JJ CC VBN PRP$ NNP VBD IN PRP VBD RB RB IN PRP$ NN RB RB PRP$ NN VBD JJ PRP VBD DT NN IN WDT PRP MD RB PRP VBD PRP NNP VBD VBN PRP MD VB NNS VB NN IN NN WRB VBG , NN DT NN IN NN NN NNS CC JJ IN NNP DT NN VBD DT NN WDT PRP VBD NN IN NNPS VBP NN -NONE- PRP VBD DT RB VBZ CC DT RB VBZ PRP CD NNS IN NN NNP VBD JJ RB DT CD NN VBN NN NN WDT PRP VBP VBD RB VBN CC VBN PRP VBD PRP IN DT JJ VBG MD VB IN PRP CC NN NN VBD JJ DT NN CC PRP VBD JJ CC NNP VBD TO NNS CC NNS IN JJ NNS CC JJ NNS IN DT JJ NNP NNP NNP VBD IN PRP$ JJ NN NN NN CC VBD PRP RP PRP VBD DT NN NN JJ JJ NNS JJ MD VB -NONE- DT NNP NN PRP IN DT NN TO VB NNP NN PRP VBD JJ CC PRP JJ TO VB PRP RB PRP VBD -NONE- NN VBZ DT NN NN WRB PRP VBZ TO JJ NN VBD EX EX VBD JJ NNS VBG RP IN DT NN NN RB PRP VBP PRP TO DT NN WDT POS WP PRP VBP WRB PRP VBZ IN JJ NN VBD VBN IN NNP VBD PRP$ NN CC PRP VBD VBN IN CD JJ IN NN PRP VBD NN NNS IN PRP IN PRP VBD JJ NNS VBD NNS IN PRP CC IN PRP$ NN	0		20131021151002	2366	0		20131021151011	2350	0		20131025091008	2402	2

You look for an escape, find one, and realize that you are injured and can't move, as well as the only opening is too small for a person to fit through! What do you do? Don't worry, the Gemini-Scout will save you! This, along with many other new robots, is a new helpful way to make our lives easier. Scientists have made all kinds of new, amazing robots; a few robots are the Gemini-Scout, the Dante 2, Mr. Gower, Agribots, and the Google car.             The first one is the Gemini-Scout. We would probably not use this in our day-to-day lives, but to those who work underground or in the mines, this is very useful. This is a remote-controlled robot that can save lives. it is less than two feet tall, to fit through small spaces,and has wheels. This robot is very strong and can carry a human to safety. It also carries food, water, and supplies to the emergency.Not only does it save lives, but it helps lives by collecting information to avoid further disasters.              Next is the Daunte-2. This robot climbs volcanoes to gather information for scientists. This robot has eight legs to help it climb the steep volcanoes that it encounters. It also can withstand great heat that a normal person could not. It collects information by studying the gasses that come out of vents from the volcanoes.Thanks to this new invention, scientsts can learn more, and stay safe.              Third is Mr. Gower. He is the one who works in hospitals. He carries medicines that doctors or nurses need. He helps save time that can be used for more important matters. He can go anywhere he needs to as well as talk to patients. Not only this, but he runs on batteries so if he charges for two hours, he will run for twelve hours. He helps make the doctors and nurse's lives easier.              Then there are Agribots. They are robots that can pick fruit. An agribot might pick berries, oranges, grapes or apples. These robots are not used often, but farmers adore them. Since you pick different fruits different ways, there are many different shapes and sizes that agribots come in. Some are manually operated,and some move on their own. Amazingly, there are robots in Japan that can sense when a fruit is ripe! In some schools, they are even trying to grow fruit without any help from humans at all!              Finally, there is the Google car. This car is no ordinary car, it can drive itself!

I had built  it with pure evil. When I went to get a drink of water it was going away.I went to chase it all around the city. When I caught it I put it in the cage and it had escaped.  then someone had called me and said a robot had destroyed the whole entire city.I was so freaked out. I knew my parents were going to get mad,really mad. When my parents found out I got in so much trouble.                        Finally I had actually caught it and this time it didn't escape. I got punished but I didn't really care. I had told my friends but they didn't belive me at all. Thats my whole story I hope you love it .

They had had such good times together. So the robot left the family and continued to mak every single kid that he met smile.

It all started when a box fell from the sky. It was very surprising,it`s not every day a box nearly falls on your head. As I peered inside the box a robot jumped out and said 'my name is Susiebot 2851 from plant htrae I have come to to destroy earth'and ran off screaming 'doughnuts'                        As I rode the bus to school I looked out the window I saw an agribots talking to the Susisebot and then dispersing.                You guessed that none of the people at school believed me your right.I even got sent home for hallucinating robots.                     I was watching TV that night and I saw news coverage of robots trying to kidnap the President sure enough their was the Susibot.At dinner my mom was telling me Mr.grower (a robot used send medicine to places in a hospital) had gone missing.       That night I heard a something break in to my house I went to find out what it was. It was the Susiebot! It wanted me to go with it and all of the robots back to htrae.So I wet with them and evenly became empress of htrae.

Now that I have a new robot I will be able always have a friend wherever I go.  He will be a great athlete, good at board games, video games, and help me do my chores to get my weekly allowance.                                                                                                          I tested my robot out by taking him to the gym to play a pickup game of basketball with some friends of mine.  His only non human-like feature was the nails in his body, but maybe he would be mistaken by my friends as a new kid and they wouldn't think he was a robot.          It was a big mistake making him an unbelievable athlete because he could dunk, but my friends and I were only 11 and couldn't even touch the net.  My friends and I played all of us against him and he still won 21-0.  At the end, I had to tell them he was a robot because otherwise they might think they were terrible at basketball.         The next thing we tried was going home and playing NBA 2k13 on the Xbox.  This was closer than real life basketball, but he still whooped me!  He knew every cheat in the game, and knew every move which I find to be an unfair advantage.         Then, we played a board game called Monopoly, once I taught him how to play I learned that he knew how to manage money so I decided to see if he could manage my real life money, too.  He helped with my chores and taught me how to manage my money.  Soon enough, I had $235!           His coolest trait was his golf skills.  The first time I took him to the golf course we only played 9 holes and he shot a 6 under par 30!   I decided he should play a round of 18 with Justin Vander Klipp, an 18 year old amateur from Djibouti.  Like expected, The Boss 2000 won the match.  He next played Tyler Thibault, an amazing 35 year old golfer from Russia.  Surprisingly, it was a close match, but The Boss 2000 pulled it off.  The toughest match would be against Jin-Hwan Mish, the #1 golfer in the world from Guatemala.  It was only supposed to be a 18 hole match, but after being tied through 18 they went into a playoff which went to a 22nd hole where the Boss 2000 pulled it off with an amazing eagle from 173 yards out.          The Boss 2000 was my best friend ever and it was always fun to have him around.              	NNP : JJ POS NNP , PRP VBZ NNP . . .

Carl can do anything that I say so one day I told Carl to go buy me some tacos in Mexico but then carl said it was way to far away. I told him to stop being a baby but then he slapped me in the face and ran away. This is only the beginning of carls amazing adventure.        carl was ways away from me now its been two days since he left, I wonder if hes heading to Mexico I looked for him on his tracking device but he was smart enough to rip the sensor out of him. I also wonder if he comes back he might rebell on me and kill me and start a robot human war.       40 days later i heard a knock on my door and it was carl the end.

My robot suddenly looked like my imaginary friend, my best friend unfortunetly she had blonde hair that had ringlets in it and wore a white and yellow sundress with pretty black glatieter sandals my best friend had come to life well my imaginary one, I just hoped that she was as beautiful in the inside that she was on the outside.  The next day was sunday, the first sunday of summer break and that day was the worst day of my life sinse I had trained my robot to be a robot to pursue me to do stuff but she wasn't queit ready yet so i was thrilled to see what the real life one is like strangely enogh her name was pickles i know it's strange but I was 5 and now i'm eleven and much more mature.  So as I exitedly ran down the stairs to see my a-k-a robot a-k-a best friend thats when the bad bad bad thing happened as I took my first step into the living room I smelled smoking this couldn't be good as my real life robot came out she said in her high pitched voice 'I dare you to water it so it stops the fire' thats when the bad bad bad thing happened andI knew it she was a come alive truth or dare game and she always gave me dares so I got some water from the hose outside and zoomed back in I stopped the fire this once, but sadly enough I knew what I had to do so I sat down in the egzact same chair that I was in yesterday eating breakfast and wished for my robot to be just my robot not pickles. Then everything was back to normal my clothes my hair even my pancakes, also my robot I gave myself a pat on the back and a sigh of relief.  And yes if your wondering I did finish my pancakes.

Now most 7 year old girls want a doll, but then again i'm not most 7 year old girls. I'm the roughfest,toughfest tomboy you've ever seen. I love everything that excludes sparckly, porcelain dolls and pink, well anything.It's just not my thing. But the robo-dog was, it was 20 pounds of pure amazing-ness, you could fetch walk and run with it,just like a real dog. And for a girl whoose parents had alergies, the fact that it didn't have fur was a major plus. Problem was it cost 1,000 dollars now a 7 year old just doesn't have that kind of cash laying around at home.Exept maybe Tom cruise's daughter.luckily today they were having a giveway! one robo-dog 3000 for free! I couldn't believe it. I signed up immeadiatly and was chosen as one of four finalist! this could be it my one chance of finally getting a dog. Little did I know that it would all go wrong.   And the winner is.... Abigail Chance from New york City !' My name, My name oh my god I won thats my name yes, yes, yes! 'I won mom I won, Did you hear mom I won'! 'yes, dear now go get your dog so we can leave I have an appointment' she said non Enthusiasticaly. 'ok what should we name him I was thinking, Scout or red or Fred, no, no, no, that to normal of a name how about hmmm, Clementine!' I asked once I had the received the robo-dog 'That's fine sweetheart now we really have to hurry so mommy isn't late.'  The second we got home I teared open the box excitedly and peered inside, there lay a small piece of metal with red eyes and small pointed teeth that looked razor sharp It suddenly Burt into action with a loud 'RUUUFFF' that just about killed my hearing permanently. The dog stared at me happily and lunged going for my face 'AAAAHHHHHH' mom get clamentine of me 'yes dear she's a lovely dog now stop making so mush racket will you'. 'MOM, THIS SICO DOG WANTSS TO KILL ME NOW HELP ME, PLEASE' my mom came down the stares and the dog stopped and sat on the ground looking at me with sad eyes.'abigail nothing is happining now stop macking such a ruckus down hear and pick up this mess for gods sake we don't live in a pig barn now do we'? I sighed 'but mom..' 'abigail no but's now clean up' 'mom if you would just listen..' 'NOW'  This time the robo-dog lunged at her, In the back room the tv blared loudly 'this just in the robo-dog 3000 is incrdibly dangerous as it has a chip which will cause it to kill anything in sight please do not buy theese dangerous inventions, back to you Pat' oops guess they aren't perfect little dogs. 'what there dangerous'? my mom asked quizicaly the dog now a small lump of metal on the ground was short circuiting and lay lifeless and small 'hey don't look at me I didn't know anything' I said 'well we are never entering anything online ever again' she stated simply ' I don't think I can handle another robo-dog incident again'. Just then my dad burst in 'Hey did you guys hear there's this online contest for a..' 'NO'.                                 the end.

'Mom come here look, look whats on the tv!' said a little boy   named johnny. 'Its an adverstisment for a robot that never needs to eat, sleep or anything and it can act just like us it would be just like having another member in the family!' 'You dont need that' his mom said, 'It cost way too much money and it wont even work its just a fake so that the company gets money' 'Come on mom u say that about everything maybe this ones for real.' johnny complained 'Ill think about it but the only way im gonna  buy you one  is for ur birthday and if its real and lots of people buy it.' she said. 'Ok' he mumbled as he walked upstairs and into his room.       Johnny sat up in his room and couldnt stop thinking that he might   be getting a robot that acts just like him and that maybe it could be like his brother that he never had. 'What am I thinking' he said to himself 'Like shes even going to buy me one if it is real, shes just saying that so I stop badgering her.' He sat up in his room just thinking  for a long time until his mom called him down for dinner.       He stumbled down the stairs slowly and saw he sitting there,   waiting with no dinner. 'Come here I want to talk to you about something.' she said calmly 'I did some research on this robot u wanted and lots of people are buying them and...well your birthday is coming up and I got a discount on it and it only cost 10,000 dollars so I bought it' 'Really? thank you, thank you so much where is it? he yelled exitedly. 'I had to order it online so it wont be here till tommorow morning' she said 'thank you so much I dont need dinner im going to bed early I cant wait!'       He woke up the next morning with his robot standing on his front   doing all his chores like taking out the trash watering the flowers and mowing the lawn. Johnny went outside and saw that almost all of his neighbors had robots cleaning up yards and vacuming inside there houses. 'This is awesome!' he yelled loud enough for his whole neighborhood to hear him. Johnny let the robot finish all the chores before he started to play with him. Johnny played football with him, soccer a ton of games when he realised the robot had no name so he sat down and thought of good names for a robot. He was thinking stew maybe joe then it hit him 'spike!' he thought 'ya that would be a great name for a robot' And it was settled.       He went back inside adn looked at the tv. The robots were   taking peoples jobs so people never had to work but they still got payed, the robots were taking police mens jobs because they can run faster and they could keep searching for people without ever getting tired.       These robots were making lifes ten times better and years came   by faster then ever and Johnny started to realise how old he was and how quick and easy and fun his life came by.

And one very boring but peaceful morning Jerry went to go have his lunch break and he made Dave come to by controlling Dave's controller. but as Dave came tumbling after Jerry he bumped into Jerry coffee, when Dave fell to the ground the coffee came with him and it splattered all over the robot.              Dave started to malfunction so he started to beep very loudly and was frantically spinning in circles until he finally broke down. Jerry was so mad at himself for not controlling Dave very well because he had worked on Dave for such a long time.            So he tossed Dave into the trash can and went home for the evening. A couple hours later after Jerry left Dave started to sputter and smoke until BAM in a giant mushroom cloud   of smoke coming from the trash can Dave came crawling out of  the trash can and on to the floor. Dave rolled to the door but he stopped ' something weird is going on here' Thought Dave. ' Wait just a minute I can think' thought Dave ' I can talk Dave announced . 'I can sing LAAAAAAAAAAAAA' Sung  Dave.            So Dave rolled as fast as his little wheels could take him. Dave had a really big adventure rolling down to Jerry's house he he saw a semi-truck, he saw an airplane and he ran over a squirrel (on accident of course). When Dave ffinally got to Jerry house he rung the door bell and waited a couple seconds, then he got lifted away by a harpie eagle. As the harpie eagle lifted him up into the sky Dave punched the eagle in the face, so the harpi eagle wailed in pain and dropped Dave in the ground.               Dave wheeled up to Jerry's front door step and rung the door bell. When Jerry opened the door and said 'hello' Dave screamed ' DOWN HERE'!!!! Jerry looked down and got so full of excitement he fainted. As soon as Jerry woke up Dave said' man you where asleep for hours' and just before Jerry could lose consciousness Dave slapped Jerry in the face and gave Jerry a rug burn on his leg with Dave's wheels and then they both hugged and the became best friends forever.

That assignment was to build a robot. They where given materials and they knew how to build a robot with different personality's, and effects. But one boy, Jimmy, didn't do anything all week and it was due that morning. In a rush, Jimmy ran to his room and gathered all the materials given. He had twenty-five minuets until he had to leave for school. There's no way I can finish this, Jimmy thought to himself as he looked at the clock. He lied all the materials out on the floor, not only was this a bad situation, but he forgot how to build the robot. After five minuets of thinking things over he grabbed his childhood stuffed toy, he used to be in love with as a child, and tried to trick his teacher into thinking he made it. The stuffed toy's name was Tod, Jimmy got him when he was one and had him since. Jimmy loved Tod, allot! The only reason why he chose this stuffed toy, however, was not because it was his favorite, Tod was a hard stuffed animal, that had a voice box, and could walk.Jimmy was willing to put his favorite stuffed animal in harms way, to get a decent grade. He put Tod in his backpack and ran to his moms mini-van and buckled. In the car, on the way to his school, it was still dark out when his mom said, 'Look Jimmy, a shooting star make a wish!!' Jimmy closed his eyes and wished so hard that Tod could somehow come to life, or at least his teacher would believe he made it. That morning, something magical happened. When it was Jimmy's turn to present his robot, Tod, the stuffed toy, CAME TO LIFE! As soon as Jimmy took Tod out, Tod complained, 'OUCH! Be careful man,' Jimmy froze, he didn't know what to do, his class started laughing and he heard some kids say 'Whoa, that's so cool!' While Jimmy stood there frozen, his teacher said, 'Jimmy show us what he can do!' Jimmy looked around, as other people where whispering. He looked at Tod, and Tod winked. Jimmy looked up at the classroom and smiled. 'Well guys, this is Tod,' Jimmy began to speak, 'He climbes, helps with homework, cleans your room, and can talk!' As Jimmy spoke Tod started doing the actions, he climbed the desk, pretended to do math, picked up a tissue off the floor, and finally he said, 'Hello.' The whole class was in Ahhh, and Jimmy got a A+ on his robot. Jimmy and Tod lived happily ever after!

Being bored having nothing to do and you want to just fool around with something, say like a robot. What would you do if some sort of robotic metal was roaming around without a care in the world.        Summer in the desert nothing to do nothing really on my mind. Minding my own business watching the television I see a program saying, 'Get your robot for only a dollar twenty, it will come to life if you follow these directions that they provide for you in the box, call 1(800)-365-Robot, the ten callers will get a second robot so you better call I garrentee they will bring the box to you in the next 10 minutes!' My mind felt like I was in a bubble that I just couldn't escape. I think in my mind 'Really who would be so dumb to buy a robot and think if they follow the directions it will automatically come to life sure that will  happen.' I just dialed the number because I was bored might as well do something.        So I'm waiting for this robot which is suppose to come to life. They said it would take ten minutes, well I took a good ten minute nap. Then I hear a ding I open the door and scream 'Y'all people said it would take ten minutes, you are one minute late, what do you have to say for yourself  Mr.!' He glares at me for a second. gives me two boxes, I gave him the money, and he ran to his car so fast I thought he was a lion trying to chase a zebra. I took out all of the utensil and used my science brain to know that this piece will fit in that one. I'm not going to lie it was a quick process but how was I suppose to believe that it will come to life if I just press a red button. 	NNP PRP RB VBN IN WRB DT JJ NN MD RB VB TO VB .

At first she wasnt surprised because Izzy could into anything and could blend really well but Cosmo always new the one thing that could find her. Izzy being just a robot , knewall too better not to stray far from cosmo because Izzy had developed a mind of her own ever since cosmo had updated her system to be more human like . But Izzy was much more than robot and Cosmo knew it too, there had always been this way about Izzy that cosmo feared could make her turn to life which would be a break through but that could happen at anytime but if it happened at any moment then there was also a chance that it could kill izzy.             In case your wondering exactly where Izzy and Cosmo are they are at their own house, yeah I know thats hard to believe that they cant find each other in their own homes but its a big house and at the moment there are 68 people in it.Anyways Cosmo was super desperate to find her, this morning Izzy was an iPhone cover and a fuzzy one to it was making her coffee and giving her a massage and producing 300 bucks all while organizing her closet. Cosmo had had some help five years ago in 2034 and ever since they had the closest bond that no one ever even tried breaking it. Cosmo spotted it, there was a furry tail sticking out of the laundry room and Cosmo tugged at it and Izzy had been a slinky dog the whole time , how foolish of her. Cosmo noticed that Izzy had 3 hand fulls of food in his mouth and she laughed, 'Quit fooling around Cosmo Ive looked all over the world for you.', 'And too have stretched around the world to follow you,'he chuckled.                Cosmo was relieved that Izzy hadnt turned to life but when she lay in bed that night but she couldnt help but dream of all the possibiities if Izzy had  turned to life . Of course he would still be able to preform amazing feats and turn into wonderous things but now he wouldnt have that crackle voice when he conversated to her. Cosmo wasnt a nerd or a freak in her school she was actually, if anything, pretty popular . Every one liked her and she had a hundred close freinds and she wasnt spoiled but her mom gave her wads of allowance witch obviously Cosmo used wisely. NOT. The nex t morning she awoke to Izzys alarm as always but some thing wasnt right , Izzy multitasked on Cosmo furiously hoping Cosmo wouldnt noticed but then it happened , Cosmo started a conversation, Izzy gulped, 'Its beautiful today isnt it trying to break her words and put mechanical like sound affects but it didnt help. Cosmo broke into a wide grin that stretched from ear to ear. Izzy broke into a grin also and said , 'I know your really worried, mad, and , sad and elated at the same time but not to worry i function perfectly fine.....I,' Cosmo cut her off and hugged her tight she wa sdelighted it happened , they were finnaly connected.

Volkner and his buddies, Wake, Chive, and Cynthia were in the garden, eating cookies and working on a robot project for school. The project was due tomorrow. 'This is gonna be awesome!'Said Wake. 'You bet!'Said Volkner, while fixing the robots head. Just then Volkner's mom came out to the garden. 'Look at my poor garden. You got cookie crumbs all over the place. You are gonna kill the plants. Out!' But mom!' Volkner said. Mom, with as much force as she could muster yelled 'OUT!!!' All the children ran inside the house and hid underneath Volkner's bed. When it was safe to come out, all the children asked the same question, 'Why is your mother so mad?' Volkner could not answer.                                         ***   'What is 872+546 Volkner?' The teacher asked. ' Uh, 1418?' 'Correct.' Rinnnnnnnnnng. 'Well class time for sience. Who would like to go first? Aha, Amanda can go first.' Amanda stepped up to the podium. 'Well, my robot is supposed to help people with disabilites. It will roll up to him/her and comfort them.' 'Thank you Amanda, you get an A. Who's next? Wake, you and your group can go up.' Volkner stepped up. 'Yes, well um...' 'Hello! I have intercepted a message from planet B-97. It says, hello earthlings. I have sent you this message to tell you that your telescope is too close to our planet. Please take it. Thank you.' 'Did that robot talk?' asked the class. 'It's not unnatural. Good job Volkner. A+ for you.' 	PRP VBD DT JJ NN NN NNP NNP CC PRP$ NNS , NNP , NNP , CC NNP VBD IN DT NN , VBG NNS CC VBG IN DT NN NN IN NNP NNP NN VBD JJ NNP NNP VBZ VBN NN VB VBN . JJ NNP NNP NN .

And then I started building one as fast as I can so then the next day it was finish I turned it on it was friendly so it helped me with my homework and I took  it outside for a little bit we were playing  then it got a little bit crazy.        Because it was breaking so I took it back inside and fixed it back to normal and we went back to playing it can lazer beam also it transforms to anything also make stuff it can fly in the air if it trys to destroy the city I will disarm it and make it shut down          If it comes back to live I will have destroy the robot so it wont come back to live and destroy the city and not come back ever back again or make a hero robot that has all the power like it has strong powers and lazers or spit acid.           If I  dont  built a hero robot it might destroy the whole entire world and it can be stopped but if it attacks the hero comes fastlike lighting speed and attack it the evil robot so it can stop the robot from destroying earth so i will make alot of heros to stop them.           Or I could make my own armor suit get in and attack it with the creations  I made the new super hero will be me and I could stop him from causing destruction to the city.           I told some of my friends to help me fight his minions and I would fight him so we could stop him so finally we deafeated the robot from destroying the city.           so there was nomore robots left just some friendly small robots they help peopkle now nomore destroying the city.Then I went home to talk to my friends what happend today.

He could do  household chores and do your homework you name it! But there was a time when it was raining out and a miracle happened to the Bob-123 that would change what he does a lot. It all started with 2 little boys dreaming of  having a robot. 'Man tristen, imagine what we could have a robot do!'' Said Burndy as usual.             'We really need to figure out how to make one' Said tristen 'Its harder then it looks' Burndy replied. That night tristen had the idea of actually trying to figure out on how to make one. 'It cant be that hard' Tristen thought to himself 'I mean its just a couple gears and wires isn't it?' Hours of studying tristen had gotten a idea. He stayed up for hours making a robot in his garage until he had made it. The next day he went to burndys house. Burndy was in his backyard until tristan came along. He told him to come over to his house to see something.         'What for?' Burndy said 'Something amazing' said tristen urgent to get burndy to see what hes made. 'You never take me to your house this better be important!' Said burndy frustrated. When tristen managed to convince burndy to come inside, Tristen asked him something. 'You promise not to tell anyone or show anyone?' 'Why?' Said burndy 'Its something I want to keep a secret.' 'Fine I promise' said burndy rolling his eyes, Tristen then opened the door. 'Its a giant tarp' burndy said With sarcasm, 'Whats under the tarp though' tristen smiled. Tristen then ripped the tarp over the robot shaped object.       Burndys Mouth went wide, 'Is it actually a working robot or is it just another robot cut out?' 'Its a really working robot' said tristen. 'HOW?' Burndy yelled in excitement 'I looked it up yesterday.' 'Wait so for all these years weve been sitting there wondering how to make a robot when we could have just looked it up?' Said burndy frowning 'Pretty much yeah' tristen replied. 'It was pretty hard though' said tristen 'I DONT CARE i just want to see what it does' Burndy said jumping up and down in excitement. 'It can do anything you tell it to do' Said tristen, He then had flipped the switch and the robot sparked to life. It had glowing yellow eyes and very long arms with three claws on each arm. It drove around the room, 'Go pick up that' Tristen said to the robot as he started heading over there right away. 'What should we name it?' Burndy asked, 'Bob-123' said tristen. 'Sure why not' said burndy 'Man this is going to be a sweet summer, We have our very own robot!' Said burndy again.           One month later they were used to there robot getting them drinks and doing there homework. Sometimes they would get in fights on who the robot would take care of each week. But after about a year something happened, It was a dark and stormy night when something happened that is still mind blowing today. The robot was doing chores as usual when something happened.They had forgot to program him to realize the forecast. Tristen Had thought hed just tell him to stop before he went outside. It worked for all that time, but Tristen was asleep This day and when the robot went outside...   BAM! There was a loud shock noise and a miracle had happened. Instead of actually burning out the robot had somehow came alive to become a human. Tristen did not know this happened so the next morning he woke up to find a kid about his age lying on the porch. He was unconscious when he took him to the hospital.       When they got to the hospital The doctor took him in and he was out within a day. 'Who are you?' Tristen asked. 'Im Bob-123' Bob said as he smiled 'Wait WHAT?' Later on he took him to burndys house. 'Oh hey tristen' Burndy said 'Who's your buddy?'   'This is Bob-123' Tristen said. Burndy in disbelief Said 'But Bob-123 is a robot.... Not a... a HUMAN!' 'Bob came to life last night' Tristen had bob explain all of what happened. Years later they stay best friends even though bob doesn't take care of them anymore. That's the story of how Bob-123 had turned into Bob the human.

It was supposed to be a fake non-moveable robot but on this day he moved his arm. It's fragile little metal arm had moved!       But even though I had seen this unbelievable thing it still didn't stop my curiosity, I still wondered if this robot that I had just bought from the toy store was alive. So I turned around to see if it'll move while I wasn't looking and it did. It was sitting on my bed before but then it moved to the floor. I said to it 'I know your alive just say something!' But he didn't move he just sat there. So I said it again and he moved, he also said something too. He said 'I am Bloop, what is your name.' Then I told him that my name was Richard.       This robot was helpful for a lot of things like doing my chores, doing my homework and doing anything I wanted him to do. He was a loving and caring robot, but it turned out that this robot had been accidentally been put in the toy store it was actually a robot being tested to see if it would sell. I would say that this is the best robot ever.       But since this robot was used for something else I took it back to the toy store to make sure it went back to the right place. When I got there the man who owned the robot was there he was happy to see the robot. I told him that the robot was the best thing that I had ever used, then he said I could keep it for helping him test it out. I was so happy to know that my fun was helpful and to know that I got to keep the robot.

I thought what if I make the most famous robot to be ever created?  That would be pretty cool.  I started to think about what my robot might do.  So, I began to plan on paper.      I stayed up for hours trying to figure out how to build this thing.  I stayed up so late one night that I slept in until later than noon.  But I guess I can say that it was all worth it.  Because after a week, which in my eyes felt like a century, I came up with the perfect idea.      'Mom!' I shouted from down the hallway.      'Yes, Brandon?' she replied back.     'I was wondering if I could, you know, build some sort of a robot?'     'Oh course I will,' she says.  'You, your dad, and I could get started on it now.'     You see, my parents are scientist, and are really good at making mechanics and all things in that nature.  They even own their own laboratory, that I sometimes would stay in and mess around with the gadgets.      'Thanks Mom.' I said, smiling.     After explaining to my dad about the robot concept and all, we headed to the laboratory to work on the robot parts.  We started collecting all the necessities for building a robot.  After about thirty minutes of collecting the necessary things, we got straight to work.  We looked at the blueprints that I made, and my dad got started on the base.  My mom and I started on the micro-chips and all the electronics that we would be using for the robot.      'Done with the base,' he says, wiping sweat from his forehead.     'Wow Dad,' I said in awe.  'It's awesome!'     It was a really simple task to get the electronics, but putting them together was going to be a nightmare.  We decided to get right on with putting the chips and other electronics in the base, so we could try and get the more difficult part out of the way.  I started to sweat because I felt so concentrated on getting the hard part out of my way.  It was around dinner time, so we took a break.  We called a local pizzeria, and got two large pepperoni and mushroom pizzas to go.      I was so hungry, my mouth started to drool at the sight of pizza and pop.  I scarfed it all down as quickly as I could, chugging my pop.  And let me tell you, that was some good pizza.  My mom told me to slow down because I'll choke.  Did I listen to her?  No.     After resting for an hour, we got back to work.  While my mom and I were trying to get the chips in place in the robot's base, my dad started on the neck, head, arms, and legs.     Once I put the last micro-chip in carefully, I shouted at the top of my lungs, 'Hallelujah we're done with the hard part!'     My mom patted me on the back and my dad couldn't help but laugh at me.  Since my dad was working on the neck and legs, my mom decided to work on the arms.  I took another sip from my cool drink, and started working on the head.  I felt my eyes drooping downwards.  I knew I was going to fall asleep soon.  But I couldn't, I wasn't going to let sleep over power me... never!  But, eventually, it did.  I smacked my head on the table but didn't care... I was too tired to anyways.     My dream was spectacular.  The robot was a success, and I made millions and millions of dollars on the robot selling out of stores.  It was the good life in my dream.  'Brandon!' my mom shouted in my ear.     'Brandon, wake up!  We finish the robot for you... want to come and see it?' she added.     Remind me when I'm rich and famous to give the credit as well to my parents for helping me.     And it was the best looking robot I've ever seen.  It was shinning silver, and it looked like its been polished.  It was quite small, but a good size to be around the house.  It looked great.  'Wow, thanks Mom... thanks Dad!' I said loudly, smiling.     'Go ahead and try it.' they said.     I went out to touch it.  It felt cold, so I turned the switch in the back on.  It started making all these weird noises.  Maybe it was a pro-to-type and needed to be fixed.  The glass blue eyes that they once were turned to a bright shade of glowing red.  Then the little robot shouted in its robot voice, 'Destroy human kind!'     Well that's not a good sign.     'Mom, Dad!  We got to destroy the robot before it destroys us!' I yelled, running away form the evil robot.     'Don't you think that we were thinking the same thing?!' my dad yelled back.     Somehow, the robot got bigger and bigger, until it was the size of my dad.  So that's one big robot.  It started charging at me, and I started to run out the laboratory.  It followed me, breaking down the giant metal doors and the hinges.  I kept on running, and headed into town, not thinking at all.     It wasn't the best idea to bring it into the town.  I just but lives at danger.  So I have to destroy the robot myself.  I grabbed the sharpest thing that was close to me: a pen.  Oh well.  I jumped onto the robot, it fuming in anger.  I heard civilians scream in terror, to help me.  But I was completely fine.      'Destroy human kind!' it shouted again, but louder.     I tried to find the switch button, but I couldn't find it.  That's when he flung me off his back, and I hit the ground with a thud.  That one hurt.  The robot ran over to me, pointing his fists at me.  They turned into blasters.  I quickly turned out of the way, making the robot miss.  I ran as fast as I could behind the robot, and found the switch button at last.  I turned it off, and the robot fell dead.      Everyone cheered, and my parents caught up to me.  They asked me if I was alright and if I was hurt.  Honestly, my back still kind of hurts from when I fell, but other than that I am fine.  We hulled the robot body over to the laboratory, and destroyed it like I promised myself.  We do have to get a new door, since it got busted open.  And the street road that the robot blasted has to get re-paved.  But other than those things, everything is alright.  Thank goodness that no one was seriously hurt.     Now I know not to try and make robots again, because I do not want that to happen again.  So instead of science interests, I found a new interest: creative writing.  It took some years to figure out that I am in love with writing.     And who knows... maybe I'll right a short story about my robot incident.

George the robot helped my friend and I win the science fair and the $50 prize that goes along with it. Goerge was tricky to make but it was all worth it in the end. Here is my story of George the robot...                I was sitting in my living room watching my favorite show, Spongebob Squarepants, when my friend Shannon calls. Shannon asked if I wanted to be her partner for the national science fair. I said,'Hold on I need to ask my parents.'after a few minuetsof explaining about what the national science fair was, they finally agreed to let me be Shannon's partner. When I told Shannon, she said,'Sweet come on over. I think the science project should be a  remote control robot.' Then I said,' Cool idea I'll be right over.               While we were working on the robot Shannon told me how to put together a robot because she went to a cmp called CAMP ROBOT. So I let her tell me what to do since I had absoluteley no clue what I was doing. she told me,'Connect the red wire to the green wire.' Then I said,'What green wire? There are four of them!' Then we both started giggling like crazy then she said,'OK, now that you have put the wire into the green wire, we need to put data in it like what is the robot going to say at the science fair to impress the judges? How about I love the science fair?' 'Great idea!' I said, 'How about we name the robot George instead of calling it 'the robot'?' 'Cool, I like the name George!' Shannon said. Then she said, 'OK, now that we have George all done, lets see how he works. Go turn on the remote control.'                After I turned on the remote control, the robot's, I mean George's, lights started blinking and he started to say,'I love the science fair.' Shannon and I were so happy that we gave each other a big hug. The next day Shannon's mom drove us to the science fair and helped us set up George in a position that he looked like he just won a nobel prize for bravest robot. 'I hope nothing goes wrong with George before the judges show up.' Shannon said nervously. Then I said,' Nothing will go wrong. I promise.' It turns out I was right nothing did go wrong. In fact, everything went perfectly! The judges showed up George said his line his lights flashed in a cool patern and we won first place! Shannon and I split up the prize money of $100 evenly between us. 'I told you everything would be fine!'I siad at last. Then she said I never doubted you. Not for a second.           So, as you can see, George the robot helped Shannon and I win the national science fair and the $100 prize that goes along with it. I used my half of the money for a summer opening to CAMP ROBOT so I can learn how to make amazing robots like george. During CAMP ROBOT I made a robot  and named it BOB. Now Bob helps me with my chores around the house. Oh, and if you wanted to know where George is, he is on display at city hall so everyone can see how George won and why he was worthy of winning a science fair. He also got a medal. Not for being the bravest robot, but for being the most advanced robot made by kids.

My name is Koi (like the fish) and I live in Clearwater, Florida on coast and this is my story on how helped the animals in the ocean be saved from  polluting people. I hope that my legacy will live on and that we will be more aware of the things that were doing to Mother Nature.        when I was little in my years of 2220, I had an obsession of sea animals. My hope is that because of all the new high technology, there were many polluting substances that can ruin most of the sea.I came up with a prototype of a robot that can save all marine dwellers and help them if they're in need of assistance.I went to bed that night in hope of my dreams coming true and little did I know that that would happen.          When I woke up the next morning,after the big thunder storm,I saw my robot sitting there and a light switched on.Now this was only a prototype, but with the high voltage system I used, the lightning storm probably switched it on. Yes,I made it so that it was voice commanded and but it isn't built to do all that stuff like dancing, signing, homework and what-not.My robot has a slim, body with many little ,long silicon arms that help the Animals during operations and to help feed them.It is (obviously) water proof and able to carry 450 lbs. and swim with it's submarine-like tail. I took it down to my work and down there I was working with some of my marine animals that I happened to catch before it was to late for them. My robot I guess had a way that soothed the animals during their operations. My robot even does the operations for me. My robot is a very big and tremendous help to my studies and work.After the help, I decided to name the marvelous accident of a robot.           I soon figured out a name for the Robot and I called it MADOS, (Marine Animal Distress Organizer and Soother).I patented  my idea and I sent it in with the blue prints and the high voltage system that I used that one night. A couple of weeks later, I figured out that they approved my Idea and that they would set up an organization to help protect marine life and the oceans as a bonus. I  soon found that MADOS was being used all over the world by Marine veterinarians   and in soothing animals in distress.            I hope now that I've summed up my story that you will keep it going and that because this might seem fake to you , it isn't. I hope that from this story you now understand the importance of MADOS, my best invention.

He was a butler for the Mills family, played with their five kittens in his free time, and often just sat awaiting his masters' orders. This was the exact opposite for Joey 8 who was programmed to cause havoc and confusion. Yes, Bobby 1 was an average butler robot of the year 2052. He was until..........       It was a cold blustery day in October and Bobby 1 was outside tending to the garden when a thunderstorm rolled in. Bobby 1 didn't care, he was robot after all, and water proof at that. Anyways, he kept working under his masters' orders. He kept on working, not noticing the havoc the storm was wrecking. It would later be called Hurricane Zacharia though it was only a grade one hurricane. He kept working on and on not noticing the house. Not hearing the people screaming. They hadn't given him orders, and he only followed orders, so he didn't respond to the clamor. Lightning flashed and thunder rolled. It was a scene from a nightmare! Rain came down in torrents and lightning struck everything made of metal, including Bobby 1. The pain from it sent a jolt through his body. He then thought, 'Wait a minute! I'm a robot! I can't feel anything! Then again I'm a robot and I can't think, SO WHY AM I THINKING!' Things were going hazy and he closed his eyes, thankful of the mercy of unconsciousness.       He woke in a daze. Joints stiff and head throbbing, he looked around. 'Wh-where am I', he stammered,'Wait, I can talk?' and then he recalled the storm. He looked around. 'This isn't where my masters live', he thought, 'How long have I been unconscious? Why can I think? How did I get here?' He had so many questions he thought his circuits were about to burst. He finally noticed the other robot in the room. 'The sleepy head has finally woken up!' it boomed. 'Where am I?', Bobby 1 demanded. The other robot just laughed,' You don't know yet? You're in Thor's palace!' Bobby 1 fainted.       Once he woke again another torrent of questions boggled his mind,'Why am I in Thor's palace? Who is the robot that greeted me earlier?' ,and again, 'WHY CAN I THINK AND MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS?' He tried to get up but nearly collapsed from the pain. 'So this is what it feels like to be alive he thought. Wait I'm alive? I'M A LIVING ROBOT! IT'S A MIRACLE!' Soon he heard a stream of complaints from the nearby rooms, 'We all are! Stop your blabbing! I'm trying to fall asleep!' and so on. Their words stung him like a mob of hornets.'Some friends you are', he muttered. Later in the morning, a maid came in and delivered some food to him.'Eat it up', she said, 'You haven't eaten in days!' When he felt he could stand, Bobby 1 went out to explore the palace. Right outside his door, however, was a guide robot. He wondered how long the guide had been standing there. 'Good afternoon sir. My name is Nick 3 and I will be your guide.'       They toured the castle and Bobby 1 got to see Thor. While seeing him, he asked, 'Why am I alive?' ,and, 'Why me and not my friend, Joey 8?' All Thor said was, 'You are alive because you are a strong and friendly robot. I will let you in on a secret though. If you can find peace here, you will know why I chose you and not your friend.'       Over the next few weeks, Bobby 1 tried to find peace. Once, when he found it, he saw that he was chosen for being a dutiful robot. While his friend was a havoc wrecker. He later asked Thor to take him back to Earth. Thor obliged but said that Bobby 1 had to give up life.       Thor sent Bobby 1 back to Earth by taking him to the transporter room. With a flash and a bang, Bobby was back on Earth, none the worse from the events. Joey 8 was soon taken to a mechanic after being found after the hurricane. They fixed him up and soon he was back up and running though he didn't ever again cause havoc. Bobby 1 soon found a new master to work for, and by chance, Joey 8 was there too. As they grew old and rickety together, they kept following orders, best of friends. Though Bobby 1 no longer had a life, he still remembered when he had one every time he looked up at the sky.

He tried to do something fun but he couldn't because he didn't have anybody to play with. So he tried to do something outside, whe he saw something coming down his street. When it came closer he knew it was a robot. The robot came up to Brian and said 'hi I am looking for a friend to play with, will you play with me?' Brian was so excited and said to the robot ' of course I will play with you, I have been looking for someone to play with me all day!' Brian said 'my name is Brian, what is your name?' The robot said' my name is playbot 2000 but you can call me playbot.'       Playbot and Brian played all day, they played tag, capture the flag, two hand touch football, and basketball. Brian was having so much fun. He was having so much fun he lost track of time. He said to Playbot 'I have to go in for dinner, can you play tomorrow?' Playbot's response was ' yes i can play, meet me tomorrow here at 11:30. Brian was okay with it and he went in for dinner. When he went in his mom asked him ' where have you been all day?' 'I have been playing with my new friend Playbot, he is a robot.' ' Oh, that is cool I have never had a robot play with me.' 'yeah mom it is cool, i am seeing him tomorrow outside at 11:30.' 'okay Brian thats fine but now you have to go to bed' 'okay mom, goodnight.'       The next day Brian shot out the door at 11:30. But he was shockrd not to see Playbot out there. But in five minutes Brian could see Playbot coming down the street. When Playbot came to Brian, Brian asked him 'why are you late?' Playbot said ' I slept to late.' Brian asked Robots sleep?' 'well we dont sleep like humans but we power down for 8-10 hours.' 'okay so lets go play now.' Another long day with Playbot. Brian is really tired. So Brian will go to bed a little earllyer than normal.       When Brian went outside the next day Playbot was already outside waiting for him. So Brian and Playbot make up a new game to play for the day. The game is called super tag. The rules are that it is regular tag but if you get taged you have 30 seconds to get the other person of your are out.

That's when it all went down hill, literally. Some thing a human, robot I don't know. Then that's when I realized it was a robot. The first word he said was 'hi' I did not know what to say but then it came out ' what are and what is your name'. He said my name is Dexter and I am a robot. I did not know what to do, so I ran home as fast as I could. But he followed me home and said why did you run. I stopped and thought.                   I was at school the next day and it was Dexter the robot our substitute teacher. So I thought and thought some more and i when I was done thinking. I told my self just keep my self together and I will be fine. We had a test that day so when we got them back at the the end of the day Dexter. I guess Dexter graded them and so I thought I did a good job but I failed my test. When my friend showed me her test she got an A+ we had the same exact answers. So I  accepted it and I would just talk to my teacher tomorrow. When I got home my mom wasn't home she usually is. But there he was a again in my house cooking food for me Dexter. I wasn't scared any more I was mad and that is when Dexter left my world forever and why I never say him again. 	DT NN IN NNP NNP NNP : NNP NNP CD NN PRP VBD VBG IN DT NN CC NN .

It was time the machine was ready and Finch was ready to show it to his boss Mr. Brown. Most of the time Mr. Brown liked Finches ideas but this time Charlie had butterflies and they just kept getting worst and worsts. At one time he had the thoughts of turning around and leaving but no he had more heart in this one piece than he had in any of the other pieces he had constructed.now was the big time the time where Growler 847 had to show what it had and the doors opened and the hands on the doornob was not Charlies it was Growler 847s.

I started thinking about who it could be and why they were here and why they didn't just use the door. I got out of my bed and slowly approached my window. When I looked outside my window I didn't see anybody. I decided that I was just really tired and shrugged it off. A couple hours later around 5:00 in the morning I awoke to the same sound. I went over to my window again but found no one outside of it. I decided I must be really paranoid and went back to sleep.          The next morning I went downstairs and made myself breakfeast. I kept thinking back to last night when I heard tapping on my window. That really freaked me out. I finished my breakfeats and started getting ready for school when I heard this really annoying beeping sound from outside. I decided to just ignore it and finish getting read but after a couple minutes the noise still hadn't gone away. I went out into my backyard and started looking for the noise but I never found where it was coming from. I think I'm hearing things. I must be going crazy. I went back inside and finsihed getting ready for school. I decided to just forget about the noises and focus on my school work.                  After a really boring school day I walked all the way home. I went inside, grabbed a bowl of popcorn and went up to my room to start my homework. I walked into my room put my bag down and headed for my closet. I opended my closet and let out the loudest scream ever. I threw my popcorn bowl int he air and popcorn went flying everywhere. I started to slowly back up while starring at the object in my closet. After a couple of minutes I realised what it was. A robot. There was a robot in my closet. I starred at in shock for a couple minutes before slowly approaching it. It wasn't really big but it wasn't that small ethier. It had  arm and legs and it had a face. It was the color blue. My favorite. I slowly bent down and watched it crawl aound. After a couple minutes I picked it up and brought it to my bed.          Out of nowhere the robot started talking. I was shocked. Robots can talk?! It started telling me that it foud my house last night and was trying tog et in through the window but it was locked and that he was outside this morning watching me get ready for school and that all he wanted was a friend and a home. I decided to let the robot live with me and I named him  Andy. Andy the robot.               After a little while of talking to the robot it decided to go and charge it self while I decided to go make my self dinner.  I went downstairs and started cooking while thinking about todays events. I heard noises all through the night and I came home from school to see a robot in my closet. What weird day. At least I know what the noises where now. Turns out I'm not going crazy and I wasn't hearing things. After dinner was cooked I sat down and whatched a movie while I ate. After a little while the couch sunk down a little and I turned to see what it was. It was Andy. Andy my new friend. My new robot friend.

I have a hard life. I hated school. My parents don't even care about me anymore. All they do is work all day and all night at the robot labratory so now I have to fend for myself. Everyone at school hates me all because of how my life is planned out. I have no friends because everyone thinks that they are so perfect. Well their not. But this all ends. When I meet my new best friend Steve.            It was a beautiful Sunday morning. Birds chirping,sunlight shining through my window, the warmth hitting my face when I wake up. I could hear my parents downstairs coming home to see me until lunch. So I got up and headed downstairs for breakfest. I got suprised when I went downstairs because there was huge box sitting on the table. I thought to myself, 'What could it be...is it for me?' Then I got a huge hug from my dad and a little kiss on the cheek from mom. Then my dad said ' Sweetie we have been thinking, how lonely you are here at home without us here. So we got you a present! Come open it! I know you will love it.' So I began to walk over. I picked up the box and put it on my lap, grapped both the ends and opened it. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was my very own robot! ' Wow! Thanks! I'm going to name it Steve. '           ' Your welcome sweetie! Here, let me show you what it can do. ' So, he points to the camera. ' This is how it can see you. Its just like a pet. But better.' Then he points to the wheels. ' These wheels are al-terrain wheels. They can go on any surface. He is even water-proof!  You don't need to control him but we will need to program his name in. Why don't you do that.' So I picked him up,put the name in, and turned him on. He wasn't doing anything. Then Steve started to light up. It was amazing! The first thing he said was,'Hi! My name is Steve. ' Then I put him down. He started rolling around on the floor. He went all around the house( probably to analize it) and came back in a heart beat. Dang... he was fast.             After that day, we bacame real great friends. I could tell him anything and he would keep it a secret. But then something bad happened.            I was home alone because my parents were at work, I was making lunch for myself. I was making mac and cheese. I went to sit at the table and then something started burning. I looked over and the counter was on fire! So Steve and I ran over to try to stop it. But it was no use. So I went over to the phone to call 911 but didn't get there in time. The smoke got to my head and I fell to the ground. All I remember is Steve saving my life. He carried me carefully outside and away from the fire. Then he went back inside and put the fire out useing his fire extingquisher mode. Everything was ok. He came back to me and by that time I was awake. Steve was a true friend. He was family.            Today, Steve and I are the best of friends. He has been with me for about 5 years now. Even though my mom and dad weren't there for me through my life, Steve always was. He was like a parent. Steve truly was like an actual person. Like he was alive! I don't even look at him like hes a robot anymore. He is a real person in my eyes. Steve is my only family I have. He is my little protecter robot.

Well here's some advice.... don't get one! Imagine waiting all week for a toy robot and then finally getting it in the mail, but it doesn't at all live up to your expectations. Fortunately, the robot will do anything you want. Good so far right? Well, keep listening. Mr. Robot 'o will be you own personal servant doing anything you ask.... until you stop giving him attention. Then things go nuts! Here's the story:                      It was a beautiful Sunday morning. The sun was smiling and the birds were singing their lullaby in the trees. 'Hunnay, something came in the mail for you!' hollered my mom from downstairs. My eyes lit up like stars and my heart skipped a beat. I knew that it was the robot that I ordered online.                      Last week I saw a Mr. Robot 'o commercial that caught my attention right when I heard it was a robot that could do homework. It can do a lot of other things to including making you meals, picking out outfits for you, play any sport or game, and do your chores. I used the money I got from my birthday to buy it and I have been waiting for it all week.                     I rushed downstairs to see my toy, eager to finally have the amazing creation. When I got downstairs I saw the box sitting on the kitchen counter. I eagerly ripped it open, but then my heart sank. All that was in the box was a little robot about 6 inches tall. It was metal, as the commercial had said, but it was really cheap metal.                    'I paid $200.00 for this!' I exclaimed with unsatisfaction. 'I could've bought this at the 99 cent store!'  I crossed my arms and my face turned red. My mom heard my whining and came over to see what was wrong. I explained that it was nothing like the TV had said, but she told me to put in the batteries and see what it could do anyways. I did as she said and took the robot outside so if it could do anything, it would have space.                 'Mr.- Robot- 'o- here- what- can- I- do- for- you?' The robot stated.                  'Awww! This thing can't do anything but talk!' I moaned and my head dropped like a dying flower.                  'This- is- not- true- master- I- can- do- anything- you- want,' said the robot. My eyes grew big and my heart jumped back into place. The robot could understand me!                  'If you can do anything I want, then get bigger!' I told the robot. Suddenly the robot's arms and legs extended. It grew by the second and eventually became 3 feet tall! A smile spread from ear to ear across my face.                   'Is- this- good- master?' questioned the robot.                  'Great!' I replied.                   The rest of the day I had fun with my robot. It really could do anything you asked it to. I wanted to play soccer and a soccer ball popped right out of its stomach. I craved a bowl of my favorite type of ice cream and it came right out of its mouth. I decided not to tell my mom what the new robot could do because she would probably give me restrictions on it. But, that was a bad idea because the next day, things didn't go to well.                    Monday came, which meant school, and I had to leave   my robot for the day.                     'Bye robot! I will see you later!' I yelled while walking out the door with my little sister.                     'You- are- leaving- me?' It asked me, but I was already gone. That was when the bad things started. While I was gone the robot became angry because I had left it. It grew another foot and did some very bad things and then did something horrible!                       The school day went by and the whole day I thought about what me and Mr. Robot 'o were gonnna do after school. At the end of the day, while my class and I were packing up, the all call came on and asked for me to come to the office before dismissal. My eyebrows raised. I thought to myself, did I do anything bad today?                     When I got to the office, my little sister Paige, who is in kindergarten, was sitting in one of the chairs with tears dripping down her face. I hurried over to her and asked her what was wrong, but she was to upset to answer. I then walked up to the front desk to see why my sister was crying and why I was called here.                     'Do you know where your mom is?' asked Mrs. Jones, the front desk lady, who is not particularily nice. 'Because she didn't come to pick up Paige at 12 and now its 3!'                     'No, I don't, but Paige can just come with me because I walk home,' I stated. As we walked out of the school my heart started to pound wildly. 'What if my mom was in trouble? She is never late!' I thought to myself.                     'Where's mwommy??' asked Paige. She had stopped crying, now that she was comforted by me.                     'She is probably just at home, don't worry.' I replied, trying to keep her calm.                       When we got home, things were way different from this morning. There was trash everywhere and the chairs and tables were knocked down. The TV was broken and there was water all over the ground. Paige clung onto me and began crying again. My heart stopped and I froze like a statue. I didn't know what to do. 'Was there a burgler?' I thought to myself, but then suddenly I knew the answer. On the box that Mr. Robot 'o came in there was writing. It said: You shouldn't have left me. My legs began shaking and a million thoughts rotated around my head.                  'Sissy, where is mwommy?' Paige asked again and this time I replied with I don't know. I realized that the first thing I needed to do was find Mr. Robot 'o and break him, so he couldn't do anymore bad things. 'Bam!!' a sound came from upstairs and at that moment I knew Mr. Robot 'o had taken my mom. I then saw the bat that I used to play baseball with Mr. Robot 'o the day before and got an idea.  I grabbed Paige's hand and we both slowly tip toed upstairs.                     'You- should- not- have- let- her- leave- me.' stated the robot to my mom and I knew that was the time for my move.                    'Stay here and don't move!' I told Paige and she nodded. I continued to the top of the stairs, cut around the corner, and saw that the robot had my mom in the closet. I hesitated and didn't know if I should have stuck with my plan, but then made my decision. I sprinted towards them and came right behind the robot then hit it in the head with the baseball bat. It fell to the ground and I took out its batteries. My mom had ductape over her mouth and I ripped it off then gave her a big hug. I grabbed the lifeless robot and took him outside, then threw him in the trashcan.                   'I am so proud of you!' stated my mom.                   'What a waste of 200 bucks huh,' I stated with a laugh.

I just finished building a highly avanced robot designed to find bugs and turn them into giant snakes with arms and the abilities of a dragon. And once I have my army of dragon-snake-things...   I'll command them to kill EVERYONE ON EARTH BUT ME!!!!!!   ...    The only problem is...   the robot instead came to life and looks like a 4' 10' snake.   So, instead, I have a 'pet snake'. So When I get boared now, me and Hydranoid ( The 'snake') dig under ground and find gold trinkets and treasure. He also has wings, so as you can geuss, I ride on his back and we fly around the world and live up in the clouds doing nothing but making more Hydranoids. So, I got my army, but I don't want to blow up the world anymore. And I got some cool snake friends...   until they turn evil!

They all went running towards the woods. In the woods they saw a small, alien like device that was beeping. It was gray and had eyes that were closed. It almost looked like a human. They touched it, curiosity getting the better of them. All of the sudden, it turned on and looked at them. They were terrified!         The small robot sat up and and spoke in a weird voice, ' I am Jrew, a robot that helps animals in need. It seems that I am lost. I fell out of the back of a transporting truck and broke my arm.' He sounded worried, but the kids knew that he wasn't in pain. Lucas, Mary and Jones helped the robot up and went inside to bandage his arm. Luckily, nobody saw Jrew so he was safe. If anybody saw him, they would be scared, maybe even brake him. The kids didn't know what to do with him. They didn't know where Jrew was heading or where he came from.           When Lucas' mom got home, he told her all about Jrew. His mom was a scientist and knew the company that had founded Jrew. She gave the company a call and they came and got him. Lucas, Mary and Jones were sad to see him go but where happy to know that he was alright and doing a good deed.

In my mind he could do my homework and do my chores, but I knew he would never come to life. I couldn't have been more wrong.              It took me two weeks to build my robot. He wasn't going to have a name, he was just going to be a fragment of my imagination, of course he would be sitting up in my bedroom doing nothing because he wasn't programed to do anything. I never thought he would be literally sitting up in my bedroom, ready to talk to me. But I guess anything can happen.              I went to school the day after I had finished my robot(it had been winter break, so there wasn't school when he was being built.) I was excited to see all my friends again, and to be back to my normal routine. School was boring like usual so I couldn't wait to get home and sit onb my couch.              As soon as I got home, I ran up to my room, and started my homework, which I actually never finnished that day. While I was doing my homework, something from behind me asked,'Don't you want me to do that for you?' I turned around. That voice I had only heard in my head while I was building my robot. When I saw what was behind me, I freaked out. It was my robot, sitting in the corner of my bedroom staring at me with his silver glowing eyes. He was actually alive! I couldn't beliueve it. I said,'Sure, since that is what you are programed to do, I guess.' He laughed in a strange, but friendly way. 'I am not sure what my name is, but I can do your homework, and by the way, while you were at school I made your bed and did the dishes.' he said. 'Well I don't have a name for you so I guess it can be what I have been calling you 'Robot,''I said awkwardly.              The garage door went up, and I heard my mom screaming 'I'm home.' I walked down the stairs. 'Hi mom,' I said,'Anything weird happening today?' She shook her head. She walked into the kitchen, and walked back out with a smile on her face. 'You did your chores!' she said excited. 'Yeah I guess so,' I said. I ran upstairs.               My window was wide open. My robot was gone. My homework was not done. My heart raced.                'Mom, where is my robot?' I screamed. 'What robot?' she asked. I sat down on my bed. Had I really imagined the whole thing? No. I couldn't have. He was there. He had to be. My window being open was just a coincidence. It had to be. He had to be in the corner of my room, sitting there, not programed, not doing my homework, but just a lifeless robot. He was there. I knew cause I saw the glint of his eyes watching me in the dark light. I had told my mom about the robot and even showed her it when I was finnished. How could she not remember? I didn't know, and I didn't ever find out.

His name is Rodrick and he is not very smart at all.         Sometimes I wish that stupid thing would just shut-up.  I guess I better tell you whats wrong with him.  Number one he looks like a big rusty hunk of metal. Number two his eyes flicker and they are red so it's hard to fall asleep.  Can you imagine two flashing red things the size of a baseball staring at you all night.  Lastly, his dang smoke detector has a low battery so it beeps every five minutes.  The bad thing is they don't make that kind of battery any more and it never dies because he runs on solar power.        I figured I would take him to a mechanic or something.  When I got there the guy said what the heck is that piece of crap.  Fortinatly my Mom took me because my Dad built it.  I said it's a working piece of crap, it just has a lot of problems.

Ja'von was a 16 year old inventor. Ja'von has never invented something amazing like a car, hellicopter, computer or a microwave. Ja'von has invented pots for plants that keep the water in it for over a week, without the plant needing water. Ja'von always wanted to build a car that fits 7 people that runs on a triple A battery. Ja'von and his family did not have the money to buy parts to a car for him to operate on.                  The years went on and Ja'von still has not built that car. On a warm day Ja'von recieved some mail. His mail was a letter from Stanford University. It basiclly told him that he was offered a schoolarship if he wanted it. The schoolarship was for Electrical Sciencie. Ja'von took the schoolarship even even though he was offered a schoolarship to University of Yale, University of Harvard and University of Oregon. The weeks went by and Ja'von finally had the chance to invent something. Ja'von had the Sciencie teacher in the world in his opinion. His sciencie teacher's name was Mrs.Brandz. Mrs.Brandz assigned an assignment that would change the world.                    Mrs.Branz told them that they had to make a one of a kind invention. She told them that they could buy thier own stuff and she would have supplies for them to use. Ja'von knew he did not want to do a car, that he had wanted to build since he was 16 years old. So he came up with the idea of a robot. So when he got back to his Dorm Rroom Ja'von started drawing up 1,000's of some idea's. With all the 1,000's of crumbled piecies of paper he threw into the trash can. He finally found an idea. His Robot was called the  H.D.R 7. The H.D.R 7 stood for Handy Dandy Robot 7. Two weeeks later Ja'von was finished with the H.D.R 7. Ja'von presentated his invention to the class. His classmates were absouleley amazed. Mrs.Branz entered Ja'von into the College Inventors Program. This was for the best inventors for each state. Ja'von came in 2nd place. Although his invention was the most bought invention in 2016.

When I don't know why. As my dad came, I started to hear soome stange nioses coming out of the offces. It sounded like bess-boses-bess-bang. It was wirred. It was 4:30 and my friends Sue, Lu, Luke, and Mike came over to my house to speen the night. when again I head that sound again. Itold my friends, 'do you hear that sound?' They looked at me like I was making a joke, until Luke and Sue hear it too.

I told them what had happen at school today. this time they believe me. My dad came in and ask if we wanted some snacks, but we didn't wanted some. later that night I found what was making that sound. It was a robot. I couldn't explain how it looked like. It was a HRP-4c robot. it said that this robot was a robot that is fun. We enjoyed the robot that night.

That help you with many diffrent things and is capable of more then people give them credit for. Some can carry stuff, some may save lifes, others can even climb in volcanoes.

After the succes of the Gemini-Scout, they made more robots like it, and that is what Roe was. One day he was checking a mine for some lost miners and had to do a gas check. He let the air into his filter and sampled it. There was something not right about this air. His system started shutting down. Everything went black and Roe shutdown. He woke up later feeling funny. He then realized robots don't just wake up on their own. Someone had to program them to do it. He moved around and checked all his systems. they were good. He then looked for a place to rest. He then thought with suprise, 'I have a mind of my own. No one programed me for my own needs'              He realized he was living. He used his thermal camera to locate the miners and get them to safety. One of them was hurt. He got his medical pack and gave it to the man, something he never could of done without a will of his own. He brought them to the jeep and the driver drove them back to the lab. The hurt miner told one of the scientists of Roe's actions. The scientist was suprised. He had never programed Roe to help injered miners.The scientist got Roe and brought him to the other scientist for tests           After checking Roe's system and seeing nothing different, he let Roe go. But Roe went back to the scientist and sent a message to the scientist's computer saying Roe was living. They scientists couldn't beleive it. Roe became the top robot and was used only for the hardest of missions. He also helped the scientists in the lab. The tried to find the gas that brought Roe to life but never could. That is the story of Roe.

Everyone on the bus saw it but no one knew what it was. The only thing we knew was that it was not from this world. We didn't know if it wanted to hurt us or not it was just watching us. The thing also had a claw that was rust orange.             A few years went by and it was still there and no one knew what it was or what it wanted. Then one Sunday the creature moved from its spot on the side of the road. The next day we found it in the school trying to eat the brick wall. Everyone just walked by it and pretended not to notice it when they did. The next thing you knew was the swat team was filing into the school.             The swat team had brought the thing to area 675 to find out what it was. Two months went by without hearing anything then on the news two men in orange said that the creature was a robot from the planet Cyber tron. The two men said that if there were any questions to call the news station they were at and sure enough the phones were ringing of the hook with callers. Every kid in the neighbor hood was asking if it was a transformer.               The robot had not come to harm us but to protect us. It came to protect us from evil aliens. The robot also said that there will be more coming and that he was an Auto bot. One day later there were giant asteroids and everyone had watched the four asteroids land on Earth and they were all other Auto bot.               A month went by and then the aliens showed up. The Auto bots were helping the government to defeat them. Soon all the aliens were defeated. The last one said that its not over yet. The town then cheared and excepted the Auto bots.

The story starts in a boulding that is very tall when the creator is working on the robot and the robot comes to life and kills his creator becouse he nows he is the only one that can stop him. oncethe creator was killid the robot used his smarts to make other robots come alive. when other humans find out the creator was killed the sent in the sat team to find the murderer, but little did they now that it was the robot that killed the creator. when swat berged in the robot went nuts and killed the intire swat team.           The next thing the robot did was hit the white houseand killed all the goverment officialls. and the robot knew that without a leeder the country would not servive sothe robot desided he would be the ruler.  by this time the robot had already made almost all robots come to life and hes created wepons for the robots includine him self.           The robots reane started to colaps when the smallest robot ever built was coate breaking the laws the robot made. the little robot was to be put to death and when the big robote whant to shoot the little robot the big robot missed and hit his own robotes so the big robot got angry and started shooting every where and started to short cercute himself and the big robot died.

After a week from quitting on his robot dream,Tim had to go back to his lab and get his stuff.Once he was there he felt something unusual.He went inside his lab to get his stuff when he was there G-67 was not there anymore,he thought for a minute but he just stuck with someone probably grabbed it.But no there was tables knocked down and a lot of glass.Tim heard a noise coming from the bathroom so he went in it and found G-67 wrapped up in paper towels that he grabbed.All of the sudden Tim screamed and ran back out.Tim never thought he would actually succeed,but yes Tim now made the very first robot.       Tim new this would be one of the best inventions if man-kind.He hurried home to show his family and show off his success.when he got home he grabbed G-67 and went inside he showed the robot off and everyone was amazed.He was five feet all and looked like a human but with all the metal on him.He soon showed NASA and all other scientists included the president of the U.S.G-67 popularity was getting stronger and stronger by the minute.He was in museums and showed up at schools and even went to get experimented on by other scientist.But this is not how G-67 wanted it to be like.It was time for a change...       G-67 knew he would have to run away and hide the rest of his life.So he did just that right in the middle of a school visit G-67 ran away and never wanted to return to this horrible life he had.Nobody could find him,they all worried about him.Soon everyone forgot about him.Since there were other better robots out there now everyone all forgot.Until one day G-67 was doing his normal routine,eating trash from the dump.He wanted people to know him again,so he walked to the local store.Nobody cared anymore about him.But swoosh someone with a mask on carried him and put him right in the back of his van.He tried to talk but the guy put duct tape over his mouth.G-67 was very suprised and confused.The gut told him that he was off to robot jail.Still G-67 was very confused...

All robots dont do all the amazing thnigs.Some just do the simplest of things like kids toys and stuff. When you think of the word robot what is the first thing that comes to mind i bet no one thought of any thing like toys, phones, or tablets. Even a remote controlls are like robots.        So if i were to make a robot mine would be something simple that does alot. If i would make a robot it would be something like this a small iteam that changes into like a little spider that could carry tons of wieght and could do anything you wanted to no matter how stupid or hard and its all voice command.        In my mind it would be like a metalic silver color and like in the shape of a sphere and is only about '2'inches tall and wide.So if i were to make a robot thats what it would be like.So if you were to make a robot what would yours be like?What would it do?And what would it look like?

The people who assembled her had designed her in a seamless humanoid form. Max was designed to do the most amazing things in the world and she passed every test she took. One day, though, she got tired of her lab-life and she sprouted her mechanical wings and took off. Max finally landed in someone's backyard with a mine behind it. she walked over and realized there was a Gemini Scout that had broken down. Maximum saw she was standing near a collapsed mine and that people might be trapped too. She went in with workers looking at her like she was crazy. Once in the tunnel, she started using her heat sensory. The trapped miners were far ahead and Max ran to that place. When Max got there, she started pounding the rock and the rock gave way. but that meant that the rest of the tunnel started crumbling.                   'Come on! Quickly!' she said to the two miners. Maximum grabbed them both by the hand and got them out of the mine before they got crushed. The miners up top as well as pediatrics came with water, food and stretchers. A week later, Max had become famous-even though she had destroyed the whole rest of the biggest mine in the area. Max also saved:   A pilot and passengers on a plane with a malfunctioning engine Passengers left behind on a sinking ship A family who were mountain climbing form a rock slide More trapped miners A family from a sinkhole the size of a house (the family survived and the house went 100 ft to the bottom of that sinkhole About a billion or so other lives   So Maximum decided to get a last name and it was Ride. You can say that Maximum Ride was a hero of ten centuries (literally). She got up-graded every year with the latest tech. That's the story of Maximum Ride.

But you are wrong!!! Today robots are very real to our world and everyday they are becoming more and more popular. Here are a few robots that you might enjoy to hear about how they work, what they do, what they look like, and how they are used in our world today!       The first robot that I'm going to tell you about is the Gemini-Scout. You are probably wondering what in the world does that robot do?! Well I'm going to answer your question! The Gemini-Scout is a robot that searches through mines that have been collapsed and they find people who are traped inside there and rescue them. they work in mines all over that world. The Gemini-Scout is 2 feet tall and has wheels, it can go up and downstairs and it can make tight turns. Also the robot is small but VERY strong. Wherever the robot goes it collects information about that place. The Gemini-Scout is very easy to work with, if you have ever played a video game the Gemini-Scout would be a piece of cake for you to control!       The second robot I'm going to talk to you about is the Dante 2. The Dante 2 can go into volcanoes and collect information for scientists. Lots of times if the volcano is to dangerous to go inside of they will send the Dante 2 in there and it will look for vents,or holes in the craters. And then the robot will collect information on the gases that come out of the crater holes. Dante is defentially  s big help to the scientists all around the world that study volcanoes!       Third, is the Mr. Gower robot. This robot works in hospitals and helps the doctors and nurses that work there. Mr. Gower can go anywhere in the hospital, it can ride on elevators,steer through hallways, and move things around that get in the way.   Also the robot can carry up to 500 pounds!!! And Mr. Gower can talk to many different people very easily. So Mr. Gower is a big help to nurses and doctors all over the world, and now that Mr. Gower is helping a lot and getting things done this now means that doctors and nurses can work on more important jobs.       Fourth, is the Agribots. An Agribot is a robot that can pick fruit. It can pick about any fruit you want! Because picking strawberries is different form picking bluberris Agribots come in many different shapes and sizes. these robots are extra helpful to farmers because now that a robot is doing most things they can focus on tending to other needs on the farm. Agribots can even grow there own plants! The robots have a sensor so they know when to water the plant and when the plants are ripe enough so you can pick it!   There are so many ways for Agribots to help farmers its kind of unbelievable!!!       My last robot that I am going to show is the Google car. Have you ever wanted to be able to sit in car and not worry about driving or making sure you are looking left and right, then left again?! Because I know I have! But now we don't have to worry about those things anymore, because they have now made the Google car! This car is very nice, youcanthink about your day and drive because this car can steer itself!   I'm sure that you may have people looking at you when they drive by because your hands will not be on he steering wheel.   This new car is amazing, and you have to find more about!       There are so many robots that can do so many things, fro example there are robots now that can actually be pets! Some robots are made to look like dinosaurs and some are made to look like cats and dogs. Also robots can sing, play, and even dance to music!!! I can't wait for when I get my first robot! Can you??         	NNS WRB PRP RB VBP IN NNS PRP MD RB VB IN WRB JJ PRP VBP TO DT NN NN CC WRB PRP MD RB VB WP PRP VBP IN CC NNP CC PRP VBP JJ . . .

No purpose yet. Tom was sitting in his chair at home expecting nothing to happen.  The next morning something was happening.  The robot had entered the house and then Tom's door to a unsuspecting victim. Tom.    'I AM YOUR JANITOR!' The robot screamed.  Tom awakened immediately.   'Robots?!'   'I AM YOUR JANITOR!' The robot thundered again with a sponge in his one arm.   Tom got out of bed.  The robot stared at him for a few seconds with its one eye that it used for processing areas, and it came closer.  A note came out of a paper sized hole in it's center.  It read: A JANITOR IS REQUIRED.  Tom gave the robot a horrible look.   'Go away!'   'A PIZZA IS REQUIRED?!'  The robots voice trailed as it left temporarily with Tom's wallet.  When the robot came back with a pizza AND his wallet Tom was happy.  Until the robot blurted  'I USED A 100 AND I DON'T TAKE CHANGE!!!'    Tom kicked the robot 'WHAT IDIOT MADE YOU!!?!'   'Someone who hates CHAAANGE!!!'   Tom sat down on his bed.  He ate a slice of anchovy pizza. 'Who made you?'   'Bob!'   'Who is this Bob?'   'Take me to him- and I will leave you alone.'   Tom considered the offer 'Where is Bob?'   'He is on the other side of the city!' 'Where?'   'Bob is your next door neighbor!'   'Uh where?' 'Take me to Bob or be destroyed!'  The robot said as laser cannons came out of almost every inch of the robot's body.   'OK OK OK buddy.'  Tom blurted, saving his life.   The quest to find Bob began.  Tom put up posters everywhere saying 'Bob who makes robots wanted' Tom went to bed that day.  Many Bobs came 'fakers' would have been eliminated if Tom did not stop the robot.  Then Bob came.  The Bob.  B-O-B.  BOB.  Bob knocked on the door.    'I am robot-creator Bob.' Bob said.    Tom rushed to the door and opened it 'BOB,' Tom said 'now you can your stupid change hating robot!'   'CHANGE!' The robot yelled when he said the word as it unleashed it's laser cannons, shooting at Tom.                   Tom was burnt alive at the mention of change and Bob was charged with murder. 15 years.   The robot was auctioned in an auction with no change given.  Bob got an extra 30 years after his robot killed more people at the mention of  'No Change.'  Bob was given MORE years after his robot invented super nukes and gave them to the Iranians, right after America declared war on them.  The super nuke blew up Bob's prison cell and Bob ran free into another site that was super nuked. Bobs life is an example to us all.

The other job they can do is help the people who need help with some stuff. Next, they can climb in volcanoes to find research about what they have inside it.       The first one is that it is going to be about that a robot is doing a job that is saving lives in the world. The first thing for saving lives is that if their falling if the robot can fly they can save them any way because they can fly. The next one for saving lives is that if the person gets hurt really bad and the robot is also a doctor the robot can help she or a he get fixed up. The third thing for saving a person is that you can shoot the bad person that is trying to take your things. That was the first job for the story.       The next job is that you help the people wit things. First one for helping the people is that you can make the person feel better. Also for helping there is you can take them to the hospital. That was the job for helping people.       The third job is going to be about that if you can climb in a volcano. If your robot  is helping you really good they can help you even better than ever before. It can help you better for going into a volcano if you need help researching it. That was the job for helping people in any  place you are in the world.       For my last and final thing for my story is that I am going to talk about what I learned in my story. I learned in my story is that there is a lot of interesting things in the story. That is what is I learned in my story for robots.

In the morning, she still couldn't figure out what they were going to give her. When she went to school, she couldn't concentrate in anything. Because of thinking on what the surprise would be, she didn't even remember that she was going to have a test.While she was taking her test, she didn't remember what she had learned so she guessed in all the answers. At the end of the day, she got her grade which was an F. She left school very sad and disappointed.                 When she arrived home, she told her mom that she had failed the test. After talking with her mom, she went to her room to do her homework. She didn't know her surprise was waiting for her in her bedroom. When she entered her room she put her backpack on her bed and sat down. Then, she noticed a box next to her bed.There was something moving inside the box. Suddenly, she remembered that she had a surprise. She opened it very fast and a robot pops up. She yelled for a long time, but then her parents came and calmed her. She didn't know if she would ever get used to a robot being in her house.                   Finally, after so many weeks of trying to getting used to the robot she didn't get scared of seeing it every time. After getting used to it she had so much fun with it. She learned many things from it and it helped her do many things she had not learned before. As the time passed, Ana liked the robot more and more. She thought it was the best surprise her parents had given her.

Mrs. Star gets attached to the outside of a rocket. It's fire proof, so she doesn't burn up going into space. Right after she's launched into space, and in space her light sensor is turned on. She has her own computer inside of her so she can send photos to NASA. NASA built her to be 3 feet tall and 2 feet in length. It takes awhile for Mrs. Star to get to a star. Sometimes weeks,months, or even years. So NASA's scientist check on Mrs. Star twice a month to make sure she doesn't have any problems. 1 check at the beginning at the month and 1 check at the end.       Mrs. Star has been to a total of 57 stars. 20 stars close to our planet and 37 far away from our planet. Right now she's on her way to a star 217,034 miles away from our planet! Wow! She goes 130 mph. The highest speed she ever went was 153 mph. Then she's coming back closer to our planet, about 114,783 miles away.       We hope she can take many more pictures of stars. And maybe even try to discover new planets. But for now Mrs. Star discovers stars that never been discovered before. We named 3 stars that makes a triangle, we call them Group 3. We named 2 other groups that each had 2 stars in them, but the stars turned into black holes. We wanted to get Mrs. Star away from the black holes, so the black holes don't suck her up. She would never be able to get out of the black holes. So far no problems for her, that means more exploring for more stars!

Little did he know somebody messed with the fuel lines of the robot. So when the scientist turn on the power it came alive, but not how the scientist wanted it to. It had fingers, it could fell emotions it was like a human robot. The scientist was very confused about it he thought he put the fuel line in correctly. Then he realized that the fuel line was cut it was meant to blow up but in some odd way it didn't the robot was alive. The scientist was deturmend to fined the person who did the crime.         The scientist keep the robot in a glass capsule to keep it from getting out from his site. Then the scientist thought it must have been another scientist so he went looking all over town for the vandalize r of his robot. Meanwhile a man went into the scientists mansion and let the robot out of the capsule. When the scientist came home he was very angry not only because he couldn't find the person he saw that somebody let the robot out.          the scientist looked for the robot and found out it was at the orphanage and he thought 'oh no they will all get killed' but when he went in he heard this'whee this is fun' and 'do it again please!' the robot saw the scientist and hugged him and started to cry oil and he said in a computer voice 'I am sorry for leaving the capsule but there was a scary looking man in the house so I ran to find you and I got lost.' Then the scientist said 'that's okay ,but do you know who the scary looking man was!' and the robot said 'Yes it was the next door neighbor he doesn't like you very much.'

It was exicting when  we saw the robot get up of the bed in the labotary. All of the scientist were shocked.                             All of the scientist were in the labotary talking about the robot. They were all wondering why their strategy of  charging the robot overnight didn't work. They were all wondering why it didn't work beacause in all the other robots they have invented it did work.We were all fustrated because were didn't know what to do. We tried all of other startegies but none of them worked.                           At the end, we were so annoyed that we let  the master of robot to come in and give it a look to see what was going on. The master said, 'I honestly can't find anything wrong.'One of the scientist said  anxiously, 'Are you sure theres nothing wrong?' The master answered ,' There nothing  I can do right now but I will go home and think about what could be wrong.' The scientist left home hoping the next day would be a better day.                        The next day the master came running in the lab yelling exitedly, ' I got it! I got it!.' When the scientist saw his exitement, they all got a hope that it will work. The master had a batterty in his hand. He placed the battery on the robots back. They all waited anxiously.   They all cheered  when they saw the robot get up.The master finally said,'The problem was that I forgot to tell you that we used a diffrent type of charger this time.'All the scientist were relived that it was just a simple mistake and it wasn't anything big.                  All of the scientist were now happy and they all  agreeded  to be more careful with what they put in the robot. The robot now is  very helpful to our community. All the people in the community are thankful to the master and the scientist that they made a helpful robot.

It was a robot i was kind of scared because it was huge with large arms. I didn't know what was he doing here but suddenly he talked, i was shock i couldn't imagine what was i seen and hearing. The robot tould me that he was here to help me in my chores since, it was summer i had to spend my time working hard at home.                        Robots can be very helpful in many ways. There's a robot that all of a sudden it comes alive. As I was at home he would always help me with everything i needed. For example, if I needed to wash the dishes I would always have him by my side to help me. He also, would help me when i was about to fall from the stairs. Thats why is important to have a robot at home.                       How my robot help me not being bored. One friday morning while I was in the living room my robot saw me with an unhappy face. He gave me alot of options of how he could  have fun, everything sounded fun but i choose one that sounded interesting. I thought he would not know what was monopoly but as we started playing i was about to tell him the rules but he said, ' can we start now'.  I tould him that we first had to read the instructions but he said, '' i'll be okey''. As we started playing I kept looking in his moves I did't know that he knew the rules and how to play. Finally, it was an exciting and not boring day I had alot of fun and learned about robots.                          One month with my robot. I have one month with my robot, and i'm very happy because i've learned how to do things faster. I'm so excited of having him because now he's my new friend how would always be with me.Now with him I always have my room and the whole house clean. I don't have to worry when mom comes home because i would have everything clean for her.

He was all alone nobody liked him. He was rusty, couldn't see right, and was filthily. One day a child named Joe found him in the street so he deiced to take him home. Unspeakably his dad turned out to be a scientist. He had got home from his 4 year science college.                    The boy had just finished cleaning the robot up. When he did that he saw the sticker on the robot that had said 'Wallie.' So he walked up to his dad and said 'Dad can you help me fix Wallie.'      'Why sure son' said Joe's father      So they fixed his eyes, took some things off and replaced it with new things, and he looked brand new. He was blue, had medium tires, and had a camera. A little while later they deiced to turn him on and they were very nervous to try it out. They turned him on and he stared at them they said 'Hi' then he turned to they all the way and let out the words 'HELLO.' They were so shocked they had tried again so they poured  pile of dirt and he rolled over it and it had disappeared then he said 'ALL CLEAN.' They were really proud of Wallie. He was able to tell if the air was safe for them. It help them clean, do joe's home work, and lean all the windows for Joe's mom.      So the next day they were spending all there time with the robot. They took him out front and someone had saw them so they called the new reporter. So every one on the block new Wallie, there was no one that disliked Wallie. ever since people found out about him they wanted to make more so they did. Walie was a great idea all of the Robots were very handy. Joe and his family live happily ever after.

Until an alert came up so people checked their iWatch and the ones who didn't have one gathered around the ones who did. The alert warned people about a mysterious man in a suit and tie with no face killing anyone who sees it. Of course this figure appeared every 300 years or so because this figure use to live in the woods but now there habitats for life where no one goes unless to see animals. So then it moved to the city. But technology has advanced enough to capture it but no one can finds it fast enough to inprison it.               So then the SWAT team heard about this and decided to end the terror once and for all, and they were going to catch it by hook or by crook. So they then formed a plan to capture it. First they were going to set up a robotic dummy and have it purposely find it and capture it. They hooked it up with a GPS only because if they put a camera, as legends tells, anyone who sees it will die, as it has happened before. So then once they found it they were gonna get the super jail cell with abosolutely no way to get past the atoms (he can teleport) and capture him.               Once they released the dummy they found him within the first 30 seconds in which they released Bob the dummy. They immedeatly teleported to the location and fired the super jail cell at the thing. As soon as it was caputured it commited suicide because it knew it was going to spend the rest of it's life in prisoned for the rest of it's life by releasing all it's evil at himself therefore killing himself. At last everyone can live in peace.

Many scientists try to find different ways for robots to be usefull. So one day a scientist did a lot of scientific reasearch to find a way to create a living robot who would could help many people.     He tryed many ideas, but non of them worked. So one day he came up with a realy great idea. He's been working on the robot almost the wholse night at his labotory, so he decided to take a rest and finish the robot tommorow morning. The next morning he woke up by a strange sound. When he went to go see who or what was making that sound he found his house and his whole labatory cleaner then it was the day befor.     He kept looking around the room for more clues of what had done that. Finally in shock the scientist saw that his robot he'd been working on last night had came to life and cleaned his whole labatory and house. The shocked scientists then said, ''It's a miracle''. He tryed to find ways that his robot could be usefull in.     He then saw his robot could do almost anything. Find reasearch, talk, walk, help people and many other amazing things. He decided to do many copies and sell them. His robot became a success and very helpfull to many people.

Robots can help in many ways. they also can play with people, animal, and toys.Robots can take people to safe place. They can bring people food, water, and other safe things. Robots have alot of commen things with real pets.You can show them new tricks.There are new robots that have fur like animals but you dont have to feed them or take them outside.If i had a robot I would make it to go to space, because alot of people would want to know what happens out in space.      Robots are machines that are very smart. A robot are made out of differnt kinds of things. People can make them how ever they want. They can make them with fur. People like making robots to have some one to talk with or play with. Robots can be like your friend. There alot of different kinds of robots. For example:   Gemini-Scout,Dante 2,Mr. Gower,and Agribots   These are the different types of robots there are. Gemini-Scout isa robot that does resaech and rescue work. It can take people to safe places. It can also carry food, water, and other supplies.          Dante 2 is a robot that climbs into volcanoes to gather information for scientist. It also has eight legs like a spider. Ifa volcano is to dangrous for the scientist Dante goes instead. Now scientist can learn more about volcanoes. Mr. Gower is a robot that works in hospitals. It helps doctors and nursees bring medicine to patients.           Mr. Gower looks like a small cabinet with wheels. It is stacked of locked drawers that store medicine. Doctors an nurses can unlock the drawers when they need the midicine. Mr. Gower is so strong that it can pull five hundred pounds. Mr. Gower runs with batteries. After charging the robot delivers medicine for 12 hours without stopping.          Agribot is a robot that picks fruit. It can pick up different kinds of fruit berries, oranges,grapes, or apples. Farmers are very interested in those robots. In japan there are robots that can sense the color of the berries. It hepls the robot know when each berry is ripe.           These are some interesting facts about robots. You can learn more about them in books, and in the interent. There are alot of fact to learn about. 	WP VBP NNP . . .

So, he saw the robot and destoryed it with his laser gun that he had 38years.he was very happy beacuse he made a real robot who cares if he destoryed it or not he was very happy.

David is a twelve year old boy with a dream of being the next Ienstine. As david, makes his way to his desk he greets some friend and sits down next to his lab partner,Ayanna. He pulls a stack of white lined paper out of his backpack and along with it a pencil as shrp as can be. Finaly, the school bell rang and David said, ' I am ready for a great day!'

Even though the Gemini Scout may take a long time to actually WORK,this isn't the only robot we're going to build.I can see more robots that we programed and built with our bare hands.My dad,my brother Logan,and I have been working on this for almost a year.and this isn't just something you pick off the street and steal.What we're making took blueprints,material,and a LOT of technonlogy reading.It was hard work,and we were hoping it would've been working by Friday(Tomorrow)But my dad lost the memory chip,but when we found it,it was a peice of JUNK.So my dad needed to buy a new one.This Gemini Scout will have a LOT of amazing details.It could help win wars,help people in the hospital,and even carry injured people to saftey.It's only less than 2 ft. and has wheels.Even though it has wheels,It can still go up stairs.ON WHEELS.By 2025 that's when that'll start becoming normal deal with robots.What I like about this robot was that I got to have a feature I wanted on the robot.The remote to control the Gemini Scout looks VERY firmiliar to a vdeo game controller.'It's done...IT'S DONE!!!' My dad yelled.At first NONE of us believed it was finished,but it was!'Guys all we need is the memory chip!' 'Dad one problem.' I said.When he heard the word 'problem',I think his thunder stopped booming on the finished Gemini Scout.'That chip was 400,000 dollars.' I said.       Dad hesitated.'Sorry guys,' he said.He head was bowed down like he was depressed.'The robot can NEVER work with THAT price of the memory chip.' a tear started to roll down his eye.I went inside and came back with a nice tall glass of cold Grape Soda for everybody.'It's okay,guys,' I said.'We just need to save up and make donation for the memory chip.' Logan was sort of more happy by my idea.'Wait a second guys.' Dad said.'We programed him with no memory chip.' Dad got exited again.'But how will he collect indformation,we have to turn him off eventually,when he comes back on,his memory will be erased.' 'No it won't'replied Dad.'Before I told another soul about the Gemini Scout, I turned it on.I told it my name and stuff and when I turned it off,I forgot about it for 10 whole years.''So you think since you turned it on in the early days it will start again?'I asked.' It's worth a try.' Dad replied.He pressed the new power button we just installed.They red eyes turned on.           'HELLO AGAIN MASTER,WHAT IS YOUR WISH?' I can't believed it worked.Hard work was a succsess.Now all we needed was another robot to replace the Gemini Scout when he has Low Battery and dies.The perfect name is Dante 2!

John always had plans of making a robot come alive. But this one was different from all of his other failing robots. John had no clue of what type of power or quality it had. IT?? It needed a name,'How about Boxy' Jeremy his other lab partner exclaimed. 'No No, that will not do.'' answered John.                 ''Oh no!'' bellowed Jeremy from behind scientist John, ''He's leaving the laboratory!'' hurry we have to catch him!.'' They whiped off there lab coats and bolted through the hinged doors separating the laboratory from outside. ''Lets get a move on hes already by Michigan avenue!'' They sprinted all the way down to Michigan avenue and tried to get a hold of of It. (the robot) 'Hold up a second, there's no way we can get him back to the lab.'' John explained. 'Why not we just have to walk him back, don't we?'' Jeremy asked. ''No, Jeremy hes ways almost 1 ton! We'd have to get the fire department in here if we wanted to even try to move him.'' ''Ok ok'' Jeremy said glumly. ''I know what we have to do. We have to find something he likes and then lewer him back into the laboratory with it. 'Oh I know what he might like doughnuts!' ''Maybe lets try it and see.'' While Jeremy watched the robot, John ran over to the bakery and got 20 doughnuts. He quickly jogged back and handed the doughnuts to It. It took the doughnuts but didn't know what to do with it. her tried throwing it and smashing it. But then he finally gave it back to John. John then jumped to conclusions saying that It didn't like doughnuts. They scrounged for more thing that might interest It.                Then they found a giant teddy bear with bows in its fur and they picked it up from the store for It. It saw the teddy bear and took it right our of Jeremy's hand and squeezed the bear as tight as he could. Then John yanked it out of Its hands and started runnig towards the laboratory. It got so mad he mad a huge beeping noise and started dragging its brick feet towards John. Jeremy then followed It all the way back to the laboratory.    They all safely made it back to the lab and then they gave It back the teddy bear. It then grinned and fell asleep on the cold concrete floor.            While It was sleeping they were trying to figure out what his special power or quality was. Jeremy and John both looked back in there notes to see what they put in It before it became It.            ''O my goodness!'' Jeremy said in surprise. '' I know I know!'' ' What is it!'' John screamed excitedly. ''SHHHHH.'' Jeremy hushed. 'There is a robot trying to sleep.' '' I know I'm sorry I'll be quite.' Jeremy Then went on explaining what he thought it was that they put in It. 'I think we put love potion in It.'' Jeremy attested. 'Really you think so?'' John asked. 'Yes I am postive.'' '' i think you are right considering how much It loves that teddy bear.'' Ya and I also wonder how are we ever going to name It?' John asked. 'I guess we'll just have to keep calling him It until we think of one.' Jeremy answered. ''Yeah I wonder what we should name It?'     	DT PRP JJ POS JJ .
